<head>NPNF2-07. Cyril of Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.This volume contains
the work of two impressive theologians--St. Gregory of
Nazianzus and St. Cyril of Jerusalem.The Nicene and Post-
Nicene Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide
keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from
some of the great theologians of the Christian church.These
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over
a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even
today!

<p>THE
CATECHETICAL LECTURES
OF
S. CYRIL,
ARCHBISHOP OF JERUSALEM,
with a revised translation, introduction, notes, and indices,
by
EDWIN HAMILTON GIFFORD, D.D.</p>
<p>FORMERLY ARCHDEACON OF LONDON, AND CANON OF S. PAUL’S.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="3"/>
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>The present translation of the Catechetical Lectures of S. Cyril of Jerusalem is based on
a careful revision of the English translation published in the “Library of the Fathers of the
Holy Catholic Church,” with a most interesting Preface by John Henry Newman, dated
from Oxford, The Feast of St. Matthew, 1838.</p>
<p>In his Preface Mr. Newman stated with respect to the translation “that for almost the
whole of it the Editors were indebted to Mr. Church, Fellow of Oriel College.” Mr. Church
was at that time a very young man, having taken his First Class in Michaelmas Term, 1836;
and this his first published work gave abundant promise of that peculiar felicity of expression,
which made him in maturer life one of the most perfect masters of the English tongue.
Having received full liberty to make such use of his translation as I might deem most desirable
for the purpose of the present Edition, I have been obliged to exercise my own judgment
both in preserving much of Dean Church’s work unaltered, and in revising it wherever the
meaning of the original appeared to be less perfectly expressed.</p>
<p>In this constant study and use of Dean Church’s earliest work I have had always before
my mind a grateful and inspiring remembrance of one whose friendship it was my great
privilege to enjoy during the few last saddened years of his saintly and noble life.</p>
<p>In the notes of the Edition one of my chief objects has been to illustrate S. Cyril’s
teaching by comparing it with the works of earlier Fathers to whom he may have been indebted,
and with the writings of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>In the chapters of the Introduction which touch on S. Cyril’s doctrines of Baptism,
Chrism, and the Holy Eucharist, I have not attempted either to criticise or to defend his
teaching, but simply to give as faithful a representation as I could of his actual meaning.
The Eastern Church had long before S. Cyril’s day, and still has its own peculiar Sacramental
doctrines, which, notwithstanding the efforts of rival theologians, can never be reduced to
exact conformity with the tenets of our own or other Western Churches.</p>
<p>The Indices have been revised, and large additions made to the lists of Greek words,
E.H.G.

<head>Chapter I.—Life of S. Cyril.</head>
<p>The works of S. Cyril of Jerusalem owe much of their peculiar interest and value to the
character of the times in which he wrote. Born a few years before the outbreak of</p>
<p>Arianism in a.d. 318, he lived to see its suppression by the Edict of Theodosius, 380,
and to take part in its condemnation by the Council of Constantinople in the following year.</p>
<p>The story of Cyril’s life is not told in detail by any contemporary author; in his own
writings there is little mention of himself; and the Church historians refer only to the events
of his manhood and old age. We have thus no direct knowledge of his early years, and can
only infer from the later circumstances of his life what may probably have been the nature
of his previous training. The names of his parents are quite unknown; but in the Greek
Menæa, or monthly catalogues of Saints, and in the Roman Martyrology for the 18th day
of March, Cyril is said to have been “born of pious parents, professing the orthodox Faith,
and to have been bred up in the same, in the reign of Constantine.” This account of his
parentage and education derives some probability from the fact that Cyril nowhere speaks
as one who had been converted from paganism or from any heretical sect. His language at
the close of the viith Lecture seems rather to be inspired by gratitude to his own parents for
a Christian education: “The first virtuous observance in a Christian is to honour his parents,
to requite their trouble, and to provide with all his power for their comfort: for however
much we may repay them, yet we can never be to them what they as parents have been to
us. Let them enjoy the comfort we can give, and strengthen us with blessings.”</p>
<p>One member only of Cyril’s family is mentioned by name, his sister’s son Gelasius, who
was appointed by Cyril to be Bishop of Cæsarea on the death of Acacius, a.d. 366 circ.</p>
<p>Cyril himself was probably born, or at least brought up, in or near Jerusalem, for it was
usual to choose a Bishop from among the Clergy over whom he was to preside, a preference
being given to such as were best known to the people generally1.</p>
<p>That Cyril, whether a native of Jerusalem or not, had passed a portion of his childhood
there, is rendered probable by his allusions to the condition of the Holy Places before they
were cleared and adorned by Constantine and Helena. He seems to speak as an eye-witness
of their former state, when he says that a few years before the place of the Nativity at Bethlehem
had been wooded2, that the place where Christ was crucified and buried was a garden,
of which traces were still remaining3, that the wood of the Cross had been distributed to all

nations4, and that before the decoration of the Holy Sepulchre by Constantine, there was a
cleft or cave before the door of the Sepulchre, hewn out of the rock itself, but now no longer
to be seen, because the outer cave had been cut away for the sake of the recent adornments5.</p>
<p>This work was undertaken by Constantine after the year 326 a.d.6; and if Cyril spoke
from remembrance of what he had himself seen, he could hardly have been less than ten or
twelve years old, and so must have been born not later, perhaps a few years earlier, than 315
a.d.</p>
<p>The tradition that Cyril had been a monk and an ascetic was probably founded upon
the passages in which he seems to speak as one who had himself belonged to the order of
Solitaries, and shared the glory of chastity7. We need not, however, suppose that the “Solitaries”
(μονάζοντες)of whom he speaks were either hermits living in remote and desert
places, or monks secluded in a monastery: they commonly lived in cities, only in separate
houses, and frequented the same Churches with ordinary Christians. To such a life of perpetual
chastity, strict asceticism, and works of charity, Cyril may probably, in accordance
with the custom of the age, have been devoted from early youth.</p>
<p>A more important question is that which relates to the time and circumstances of his
ordination as Deacon, and as Priest, matters closely connected with some of the chief troubles
of his later life.</p>
<p>That he was ordained Deacon by Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, who died in 334 or
335, may be safely inferred from the unfriendly notice of S. Jerome, Chron. ann. 349 (350
a.d.): “Cyril having been ordained Priest by Maximus, and after his death permitted by
Acacius, Bishop of Cæsarea, and the other Arian Bishops, to be made Bishop on condition
of repudiating his ordination by Maximus, served in the Church as a Deacon: and after he
had been paid for this impiety by the reward of the Episcopate (Sacerdotii), he by various
plots harassed Heraclius, whom Maximus when dying had substituted in his own place, and
degraded him from Bishop to Priest.”</p>
<p>From this account, incredible as it is in the main, and strongly marked by personal
prejudice, we may conclude that Cyril had been ordained Deacon not by Maximus, but by
his predecessor Macarius; for otherwise he would have been compelled to renounce his
Deacon’s Orders, as well as his Priesthood.</p>

<pb n="6"/>
<p>Macarius died in or before the year 335; for at the Council of Tyre, assembled in that
year to condemn Athanasius, Maximus sat as successor to Macarius in the See of Jerusalem8.
This date is confirmed by the fact that after the accession of Maximus, a great assembly of
Bishops was held at Jerusalem in the year 335, for the dedication of the Church of the Holy
Resurrection9.</p>
<p>It thus appears that Cyril’s ordination as Deacon cannot be put later than 334 or the
beginning of 335.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the latter year the Bishops who had deposed Athanasius at the
Council of Tyre proceeded to Jerusalem “to celebrate the Tricennalia of Constantine’s reign
by consecrating his grand Church on Mount Calvary10.” On that occasion “Jerusalem became
the gathering point for distinguished prelates from every province, and the whole city was
thronged by a vast assemblage of the servants of God……In short, the whole of Syria and
Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the
Thebaid, all contributed to swell the mighty concourse of God’s ministers, followed as they
were by vast numbers from every province. They were attended by an imperial escort, and
officers of trust had also been sent from the palace itself, with instructions to heighten the
splendour of the festival at the Emperor’s expense11.” Eusebius proceeds to describe the
splendid banquets, the lavish distribution of money and clothes to the naked and destitute,
the offerings of imperial magnificence, the “intellectual feast” of the many Bishops’ discourses,
and last, not least, his own “various public orations pronounced in honour of this solemnity.”
Among the Clergy taking part in this gorgeous ceremony, the newly ordained Deacon of
the Church of Jerusalem would naturally have his place. It was a scene which could not fail
to leave a deep impression on his mind, and to influence his attitude towards the contending
parties in the great controversy by which the Church was at this time distracted. He knew
that Athanasius had just been deposed, he had seen Arius triumphantly restored to communion
in that august assembly of Bishops “from every province,” with his own Bishop Maximus,
and Eusebius of Cæsarea, the Metropolitan, at their head. It is much to the praise of
his wisdom and steadfastness that he was not misled by the notable triumph of the Arians
to join their faction or adopt their tenets.</p>
<p>In September, 346, Athanasius returning from his second exile at Trèves passed through
Jerusalem. The aged Bishop Maximus, who had been induced to acquiesce in the condemnation
of Athanasius at Tyre, and in the solemn recognition of Arius at Jerusalem, had afterwards
refused to join the Eusebians at Antioch in 341, for the purpose of confirming the

sentence passed at Tyre, and now gave a cordial welcome to Athanasius, who thus describes
his reception12: “As I passed through Syria, I met with the Bishops of Palestine, who, when
they had called a Council at Jerusalem, received me cordially, and themselves also sent me
on my way in peace, and addressed the following letter to the Church and the Bishops13.”
The letter congratulating the Egyptian Bishops and the Clergy and people of Alexandria on
the restoration of their Bishop is signed first by Maximus, who seems to have acted without
reference to the Metropolitan Acacius, successor of Eusebius as Bishop of Cæsarea, and a
leader of the Arians, a bitter enemy of Athanasius. Though Cyril in his writings never
mentions Athanasius or Arius by name, we can hardly doubt that, as Touttée suggests14,
he must at this time have had an opportunity of learning the true character of the questions
in dispute between the parties of the great heresiarch and his greater adversary.</p>
<p>We have already learned from Jerome that Cyril was admitted to the Priesthood by
Maximus. There is no evidence of the exact date of his ordination: but we may safely assume
that he was a Priest of some years’ standing, when the important duty of preparing the
candidates for Baptism was intrusted to him in or about the year 34815. There appears to
be no authority for the statement (Dict. Chr. Antiq. “Catechumens,” p. 319 a), that the
Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem were delivered by him partly as a Deacon, partly as a Presbyter16.”</p>
<p>At the very time of delivering the lectures, Cyril was also in the habit of preaching to
the general congregation on the Lord’s day17, when the candidates for Baptism were especially
required to be present18. In the Church of Jerusalem it was still the custom for sermons to
be preached by several Presbyters in succession, the Bishop preaching last. From Cyril’s
Homily on the Paralytic (§ 20) we learn that he preached immediately before the Bishop,
and so must have held a distinguished position among the Priests. This is also implied in
the fact, that within three or four years after delivering his Catechetical Lectures to the
candidates for Baptism, he was chosen to succeed Maximus in the See of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The date of his consecration is approximately determined by his own letter to Constantius
concerning the appearance of a luminous cross in the sky at Jerusalem. The letter was
written on the 7th of May, 351, and is described by Cyril as the first-fruit of his Episcopate.
He must therefore have been consecrated in 350, or early in 351.</p>

<p>Socrates and Sozomen agree in the assertion that Acacius, Patrophilus the Arian Bishop
of Scythopolis, and their adherents ejected Maximus and put Cyril in his place19. But according
to the statement of Jerome already quoted20 Maximus, when dying, had not only
nominated Heraclius to be his successor, which, with the consent of the Clergy and people
was not unusual, but had actually established him as Bishop in his stead (in suum locum
substituerat). The two accounts are irreconcileable, and both improbable. Touttée argues
not without reason, that the consecration of Heraclius, which Jerome attributes to Maximus,
would have been opposed to the right of the people and Clergy to nominate their own
Bishop, and to the authority of the Metropolitan and other Bishops of the province, by
whom the choice was to be confirmed and the consecration performed, and that it had
moreover been expressly forbidden seven years before by the 23rd Canon of the Council of
Antioch.</p>
<p>Still more improbable is the charge that Cyril had renounced the priesthood conferred
on him by Maximus, and after serving in the Church as a Deacon, had been rewarded by
the Episcopate, and then himself degraded Heraclius from Bishop to Priest. As a solution
of these difficulties, it is suggested by Reischl21 that Cyril had been designated in the lifetime
of Maximus as his successor, and after his decease had been duly and canonically consecrated,
but had incurred the calumnious charges of the party opposed to Acacius and the Eusebians,
because he was supposed to have bound himself to them by accepting consecration at their
hands. This view is in some measure confirmed by the fact that “in the great controversy
of the day Cyril belonged to the Asiatic party, Jerome to that of Rome. In the Meletian
schism also they took opposite sides, Cyril supporting Meletius, Jerome being a warm adherent
of Paulinus22,” by whom he had been recently ordained Priest. It is also worthy of
notice that Jerome’s continuation of the Chronicle of Eusebius was written at Constantinople
in 380–381, the very time when the many injurious charges fabricated by Cyril’s bitter enemies
were most industriously circulated in popular rumour on the eve of a judicial inquiry
by the second general Council which met there in 381, under the presidency of Meletius,
Cyril, and Gregory of Nazianzum23. Had Jerome written of Cyril a year or two later, he
must have known that these calumnies had been emphatically rejected by the Synod of
Constantinople (382) consisting of nearly the same Bishops who had been present at the
Council of the preceding year. In their Synodical letter24 to Pope Damasus they wrote:
<note type="footnote">19 Socr. H. E. ii. 38; Soz. iv. 20. The Bishops of Palestine, except two or three, had received Athanasius most

“And of the Church in Jerusalem, which is the Mother of all the Churches, we notify that
the most reverend and godly Cyril is Bishop: who was long ago canonically appointed by
the Bishops of the Province, and had many conflicts in various places against the Arians.”
The beginning of Cyril’s Episcopate was marked by the appearance of a bright Cross in
the sky, about nine o’clock in the morning of Whitsunday, the 7th of May, 351 a.d. Brighter
than the sun, it hung over the hill of Golgotha, and extended to Mount Olivet, being visible
for many hours. The whole population of Jerusalem, citizens and foreigners, Christians
and Pagans, young and old, flocked to the Church, singing the praises of Christ, and hailing
the phænomenon as a sign from heaven confirming the truth of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Cyril regarded the occasion as favourable for announcing to the Emperor Constantius
the commencement of his Episcopate; and in his extant letter described the sign as a proof
of God’s favour towards the Empire and its Christian ruler. The piety of his father Constantine
had been rewarded by the discovery of the true Cross and the Holy places: and
now the greater devotion of the Son had won a more signal manifestation of Divine approval.
The letter ends with a prayer that God may grant to the Emperor long to reign as the protector
of the Church and of the Empire, “ever glorifying the Holy and Consubstantial
Trinity, our true God.” The word ὁμοούσιον, it is alleged, had not at this time been accepted
by Cyril, and its use has therefore been thought to cast doubt upon the genuineness of this
final prayer, which is nevertheless maintained by the Benedictine Editor25. The letter as a
whole is certainly genuine, and the phenomenon is too strongly attested by the historians
of the period to be called in question. While, therefore, we must reject Cyril’s explanation,
we have no reason to suspect him of intentional misrepresentation. A parhelion, or other
remarkable phenomenon, of which the natural cause was at that time unknown, might well
appear “to minds excited by the struggle between the Christian Faith and a fast-declining
heathenism to be a miraculous manifestation of the symbol of Redemption, intended to
establish the Faith and to confute its gainsayers26.”</p>
<p>The first few years of Cyril’s episcopate fell within that so-called “Golden Decade,”
346–355, which is otherwise described as “an uneasy interval of suspense rather than of
peace27.” Though soon to be engaged in a dispute with Acacius concerning the privileges
of their respective Sees, Cyril seems to have been in the interval zealous and successful in
promoting the peace and prosperity of his own Diocese.</p>
<p>We learn from a letter of Basil the Great that he had visited Jerusalem about the year
357, when he had been recently baptized, and was preparing to adopt a life of strict asceticism.
He speaks of the many saints whom he had there embraced, and of the many who

<pb n="10"/>
had fallen on their knees before him, and touched his hands as holy28,—signs, as Touttée
suggests, of a flourishing state of religion and piety. Cyril’s care for the poor, and his personal
poverty, were manifested by an incident, of which the substantial truth is proved by
the malicious use to which it was afterwards perverted. “Jerusalem and the neighbouring
region being visited with a famine, the poor in great multitudes, being destitute of necessary
food, turned their eyes upon Cyril as their Bishop. As he had no money to succour them
in their need, he sold the treasures and sacred veils of the Church. It is said, therefore, that
some one recognised an offering of his own as worn by an actress on the stage, and made
it his business to inquire whence she had it, and found that it had been sold to her by a
merchant, and to the merchant by the Bishop29.”</p>
<p>This was one of the charges brought against Cyril in the course of the disputes between
himself and Acacius, which had commenced soon after he had been installed in the Bishopric
of Jerusalem. As Bishop of Cæsarea, Acacius exercised Metropolitan jurisdiction over the
Bishops of Palestine. But Cyril, as presiding over an Apostolic See, “the Mother of all the
Churches,” claimed exemption from the jurisdiction of Cæsarea, and higher rank than its
Bishop. It is not alleged, nor is it in any way probable, that Cyril claimed also the jurisdiction
over other Bishops. The rights and privileges of his See had been clearly defined many years
before by the 7th Canon of the Council of Nicæa: “As custom and ancient tradition shew
that the Bishop of Ælia ought to be honoured, let him have precedence in honour, without
prejudice to the proper dignity of the Metropolitical See.” Eusebius30, in reference to a
Synod concerning the time of Easter, says: “There is still extant a writing of those who were
then assembled in Palestine (about 200 a.d.), over whom Theophilus, Bishop of Cæsarea,
and Narcissus, Bishop of Jerusalem, presided.” If one Synod only is here meant, it would
appear that the Bishop of Cæsarea took precedence of the Bishop of Jerusalem, which would
be the natural order in a Synod held at Cæsarea. Bishop Hefele, however, takes a different
view31: “According to the Synodicon, two Synods were held in Palestine on the subject of
the Easter controversy: the one at Jerusalem presided over by Narcissus, and composed of
fourteen Bishops; and the other at Cæsarea, comprising twelve Bishops, and presided over
by Theophilus.” In confirmation of this view we may observe that when next Eusebius
mentions Narcissus and Theophilus, he reverses the previous order, and names the Bishop
of Jerusalem first.</p>
<p>However this may have been, Acacius, who as an Arian was likely to have little respect
for the Council of Nicæa, seems to have claimed both precedence and jurisdiction over

Cyril. From32 Socrates we learn that Cyril was frequently summoned to submit to the
judgment of Acacius, but for two whole years refused to appear. He was therefore deposed
by Acacius and the other Arian Bishops of Palestine on the charge of having sold the property
of the Church, as before mentioned. Socrates, who confesses that he does not know for
what Cyril was accused, yet suggests that he was afraid to meet the accusations33. But
Theodoret, a more impartial witness, says34 that Acacius took advantage of some slight occasion
(ἀφορμάς) and deposed him. Sozomen35 also describes the accusation as a pretext
(ἐπὶ προφάσει τοιᾷδε), and the deposition as hastily decreed, to forestall any countercharge
of heresy by Cyril (φθάνει καθελών). The deposition was quickly followed by Cyril’s expulsion
from Jerusalem, and a certain Eutychius was appointed to succeed him36. Passing by
Antioch, which at this time, 357–358, was left without a Bishop by the recent decease of the
aged Arian Leontius Castratus37, Cyril took refuge in Tarsus with its Bishop the “admirable
Silvanus,” “one of the Semi-Arians,” who, as Athanasius testifies, agreed almost entirely
with the Nicene doctrine, only taking offence at the expression ὁμοούσιος, because in their
opinion it contained latent Sabellianism38.” Cyril now sent to the Bishops who had deposed
him a formal notice that he appealed to a higher Court (μεῖζον ἐπεκαλέσατο δικαστήριον
), and his appeal was approved by the Emperor Constantius39. Acasius, on learning the
place of Cyril’s retreat, wrote to Silvanus announcing his deposition. But Silvanus out of
respect both to Cyril, and to the people, who were delighted with his teaching, still permitted
him to exercise his ministry in the Church. Socrates finds fault with Cyril for his appeal:
“In this,” he says, “he was the first and only one who acted contrary to the custom of the
Ecclesiastical Canon, by having recourse to appeals as in a civil court.” The reproach implied
in this statement is altogether undeserved. The question, as Touttée argues, is not whether
others had done the like before or after, but whether Cyril’s appeal was in accordance with
natural justice, and the custom of the Church. On the latter point he refers to the case of
the notorious heretic Photinus, who after being condemned in many Councils appealed to

<note type="footnote">36 There is much uncertainty and confusion in the names of the Bishops who succeeded Cyril on the three
occasions of his being deposed. His successor in 357 is said by Jerome to have been a certain Eutychius, probably
the same who was afterwards excommunicated at Seleucia (Dict. Chr. Biogr. Eutychius 13). The subject is discussed
at length by Touttée (Diss. I. vii.).</note>

the Emperor, and was allowed to dispute in his presence with Basil the Great as his opponent.
Athanasius himself, in circumstances very similar to Cyril’s, declined to appear before Eusebius
and a Synod of Arian Bishops at Cæsarea, by whom he was condemned a.d. 334, and
appealed in person to Constantine, requesting either that a lawful Council of Bishops might
be assembled, or that the Emperor would himself receive his defence.40”</p>
<p>In justification of Cyril’s appeal it is enough to say that it was impossible for him to
submit to the judgment of Acacius and his Arian colleagues. They could not be impartial
in a matter where the jurisdiction of Acacius their president, and his unsoundness in the
Faith, were as much in question as any of the charges brought against Cyril. He took the
only course open to him in requesting the Emperor to remit his case to the higher jurisdiction
of a greater Council, and in giving formal notice of this appeal to the Bishops who had expelled
him.</p>
<p>While the appeal was pending, Cyril became acquainted with “ the learned Bishop, Basil
of Ancyra “ (Hefele), with Eustathius of Sebaste in Armenia, and George of Laodicea, the
chief leaders of the party “usually (since Epiphanius), but with some injustice, designated
Semi-Arian41.” One of the charges brought against Cyril in the Council of Constantinople
(360, a.d.) was, as we shall see, that he held communion with these Bishops.</p>
<p>Cyril had not long to wait for the hearing of his appeal. In the year 359 the Eastern
Bishops met at Seleucia in Isauria, and the Western at Ariminum. Constantius had at first
wished to convene a general Council of all the Bishops of the Empire, but this intention he
was induced to abandon by representations of the long journeys and expense, and he
therefore directed the two Synods then assembled at Ariminum and at Seleucia “the Rugged”
to investigate first the disputes concerning the Faith, and then to turn their attention to the
complaints of Cyril, and other Bishops against unjust decrees of deposition and banishment42.
This order of proceeding was discussed, and after much controversy adopted on
the first day of meeting, the 27th of September43. On the second day Acacius and his friends
refused to remain unless the Bishops already deposed, or under accusation, were excluded.
Theodoret relates that “ several friends of peace tried to persuade Cyril of Jerusalem to
withdraw, but that, as he would not comply, Acacius left the assembly44.” Three days afterwards,
according to Sozomen, a third meeting was held at which the demand of Acacius
was complied with; “for the Bishops of the opposite party were determined that he should
have no pretext for dissolving the Council, which was evidently his object in order to prevent

<pb n="13"/>
the impending examination of the heresy of Aëtius and of the accusations which had been
brought against him and his partisans45.” A creed put forward by Acacius having been rejected,
he refused to attend any further meetings, though repeatedly summoned to be present
at an investigation of his own charges against Cyril.</p>
<p>In the end Acacius and many of his friends were deposed or excommunicated. Some
of these, however, in defiance of the sentence of the Council, returned to their dioceses, as
did also the majority who had deposed them.</p>
<p>It is not expressly stated whether any formal decision on the case of Cyril was adopted
by the Council: but as his name does not appear in the lists of those who were deposed or
excommunicated, it is certain that he was not condemned. It is most probable that the
charges against him were disregarded after his accuser Acacius had refused to appear, and
that he returned, like the others, to his diocese. But he was not to be left long in peace.
Acacius and some of his party had hastened to Constantinople, where they gained over to
their cause the chief men attached to the palace, and through their influence secured the
favour of Constantius, and roused his anger against the majority of the Council. But what
especially stirred the Emperor’s wrath were the charges which Acacius concocted against
Cyril: “For,” he said that “the holy robe which the Emperor Constantine of blessed memory,
in his desire to honour the Church of Jerusalem, had presented to Macarius, the Bishop of
that city, to be worn when he administered the rite of Holy Baptism, all fashioned as it was
with golden threads, had been sold by Cyril, and bought by one of the dancers at the theatre,
who had put it on, and while dancing had fallen, and injured himself, and died. With such
an ally as this Cyril,” he said, “they undertake to judge and pass sentence upon the rest of
the world46.”</p>
<p>Ten deputies who at the close of the Council of Seleucia had been appointed to report
its proceedings to the Emperor, “met, on their arrival at the Court, the deputies of the
Council of Ariminum, and likewise the partisans of Acacius47. After much controversy and
many intrigues, a mutilated and ambiguous Creed adopted at Ariminum in which the
ὁμοούσιος of Nicæa was replaced by “like to the Father that begat Him according to the
Scriptures,” and the mention of either “essence” (οὐσία) or “subsistence” (ὑπόστασις) condemned48,
was brought forward and approved by the Emperor. “After having, on the last
day of the year 359, discussed the matter with the Bishops till far into the night49, he at
length extorted their signatures….It is in this connexion that Jerome says: Ingemuit totus

orbis, et Arianum se esse miratus est50.” Early in the following year, 360 a.d., through the
influence of Acacius a new Synod was held at Constantinople, in which, among other Semi-
Arian Bishops, Cyril also was deposed on the charge of having held communion with Eustathius
of Sebaste, Basil of Ancyra, and George of Laodicea. Cyril, as we have seen, had
become acquainted with these Bishops during his residence at Tarsus in 358, at which time
they were all zealous opponents of Acacius and his party, but differed widely in other respects.</p>
<p>George of Laodicea was a profligate in morals, and an Arian at heart, whose opposition
to Acacius and Eudoxius was prompted by self-interest rather than by sincere conviction.
He had been deposed from the priesthood by Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, both on that
ground of false doctrine, and of the open and habitual irregularities of his life. Athanasius
styles him “the most wicked of all the Arians,” reprobated even by his own party for his
grossly dissolute conduct51.</p>
<p>Basil of Ancyra was a man of high moral character, great learning, and powerful intellect,
a consistent opponent both of the Sabellianism of Marcellus, and of every form of Arian
and Anomoean heresy, a chief among those of whom Athanasius wrote52, “We discuss the
matter with them as brothers with brothers, who mean what we mean, and dispute only
about the word (ὁμοούσιος)….Now such is Basil who wrote from Ancyra concerning the
Faith” (358 a.d., the same year in which Cyril met him at Tarsus).</p>
<p>Eustathius is described as a man unstable in doctrine, vacillating from party to party,
subscribing readily to Creeds of various tendency, yet commanding the respect even of his
enemies by a life of extraordinary holiness, in which active benevolence was combined with
extreme austerity. “He was a man,” says Mr. Gwatkin53, “too active to be ignored, too unstable
to be trusted, too famous for ascetic piety to be lightly made an open enemy.”</p>
<p>S. Basil the Great, when travelling from place to place, to observe the highest forms of
ascetic life, had met with Eustathius at Tarsus, and formed a lasting friendship with a man
whom he describes as “exhibiting something above human excellence,” and of whom, after
the painful dissensions which embittered Basil’s later life, that great saint could say, that
from childhood to extreme old age he (Eustathius) had watched over himself with the greatest
care, the result of his self-discipline being seen in his life and character54.</p>
<p>Of any intimate friendship between Cyril, and these Semi-Arian leaders, we have no
evidence in the vague charges of Acacius: their common fault was that they condemned
him in the Synod of Seleucia. The true reason of Cyril’s deposition, barely concealed by the

<pb n="15"/>
frivolous charges laid against him, was the hatred of Acacius, incurred by the refusal to acknowledge
the Metropolitan jurisdiction of the See of Cæsarea. The deposition was confirmed
by Constantius, and followed by a sentence of banishment. The place of Cyril’s exile
is not mentioned; nor is it known whether he joined in the protest of the other deposed
Bishops, described by S. Basil, Epist. 75. His banishment was not of longer continuance
than two years. Constantius died on the 3rd of November, 361, and the accession of Julian
xvii
was soon followed by the recall of all the exiled Bishops, orthodox and heretical, and the
restoration of their confiscated estates55. Julian’s object, according to Socrates, was “ to
brand the memory of Constantius by making him appear to have been cruel towards his
subjects.” An equally amiable motive imputed to him is mentioned by Sozomen: “It is said
that he issued this order in their behalf not out of mercy, but that through contention among
themselves the Church might be involved in fraternal strife56.” Cyril, returning with the
other Bishops, seems to have passed through Antioch on his way home, and to have been
well received by the excellent Bishop Meletius.</p>
<p>It happened that the son of a heathen priest attached to the Emperor’s Court, having
been instructed in his youth by a Deaconess whom he visited with his mother, had secretly
become a Christian. On discovering this, his father had cruelly scourged and burnt him
with hot spits on his hands, and feet, and back. He contrived to escape, and took refuge
with his friend the Deaconess. “‘She dressed me in women’s garments, and took me in her
covered carriage to the divine Meletius. He handed me over to the Bishop of Jerusalem, at
that time Cyril, and we started by night for Palestine.’ After the death of Julian, this young
man led his father also into the way of truth. This act he told me with the rest57.”</p>
<p>The next incident recorded in the life of S. Cyril is his alleged prediction of the failure
of Julian’s attempt to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem. “The vain and ambitious mind of
Julian,” says Gibbon, “might aspire to restore the ancient glory of the Temple of Jerusalem.
As the Christians were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been
pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law, the Imperial sophist would have
converted the success of his undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of
prophecy and the truth of revelation.” Again he writes: “The Christians entertained a natural
and pious expectation, that in this memorable contest, the honour of religion would
be vindicated by some signal miracle58.” That such an expectation may have been shared
by Cyril is not impossible: but there is no satisfactory evidence that he ventured to foretell

<pb n="16"/>
any miraculous interposition. According to the account of Rufinus59, “lime and cement
had been brought, and all was ready for destroying the old foundations and laying new on
the next day. But Cyril remained undismayed, and after careful consideration either of what
he had read in Daniel’s prophecy concerning the ‘times,’ or of our Lord’s predictions in the
Gospels, persisted that it was impossible that one stone should ever there be laid upon another
by the Jews.” This account of Cyril’s expectation, though probable enough in itself,
seems to be little more than a conjecture founded on his statement (Cat. xv. 15), that “Antichrist
will come at the time when there shall not be left one stone upon another in the Temple
of the Jews.” That doom was not completed in Cyril’s time, nor did he expect it to be fulfilled
until the coming of the Jewish Antichrist, who was to restore the Temple shortly before the
end of the world. It was impossible for Cyril to see in Julian such an Antichrist as he has
described; and therefore, without any gift or pretence of prophecy, he might very well express
a firm conviction that the attempted restoration at that time must fail. Though Gibbon is
even more cynical and contemptuous than usual in his examination of the alleged miracles,
he does not attempt to deny the main facts of the story60: with their miraculous character
we are not here concerned, but only with Cyril’s conduct on so remarkable an occasion.
In the same year, a.d. 363, Julian was killed in his Persian campaign on the 26th of June,
and was succeeded by Jovian, whose universal tolerance, and personal profession of the
Nicene faith, though discredited by the looseness of his morals, gave an interval of comparative
rest to the Church. In his reign Athanasius was recalled, and Acacius and his friends
subscribed the Nicene Creed, with an explanation of the sense in which they accepted the
word ὁμοούσιον61. As Cyril’s name is not mentioned in any of the records of Jovian’s short
reign of seven months, we may infer that he dwelt in peace at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Jovian died on the 17th of February, 364, and was succeeded by Valentinian, who in the
following March gave over the Eastern provinces of the Empire to his brother Valens.
During the first two years of the new reign we hear nothing of Cyril: but at the beginning
of the year 366, on the death of his old enemy Acacius, Cyril assumed the right to nominate
his successor in the See of Cæsarea, and appointed a certain Philumenus62. Whether this
assumption of authority was in accordance with the 7th Canon of Nicæa may be doubted:
Cyril’s choice of his nephew was, however, in after times abundantly justified by the conduct
and character of Gelasius, who is described by Theodoret as a man “distinguished by the

<pb n="17"/>
purity of his doctrine, and the sanctity of his life,” and is quoted by the same historian as
“the admirable,” and “the blessed Gelasius63.”</p>
<p>Epiphanius relates64 that “after these three had been set up, and could do nothing on
account of mutual contentions,” Euzoius was appointed by the Arians, and held the See
until the accession of Theodosius in a.d. 379, when he was deposed, and Gelasius restored.
In the meantime Cyril had been a third time deposed and driven from Jerusalem, probably
in the year 367. For at that time Valens, who had fallen under the influence of Eudoxius,
the Arian Bishop of Constantinople, by whom he was baptized, “wrote to the Governors of
the provinces, commanding that all Bishops who had been banished by Constantius, and
had again assumed their sacerdotal offices under the Emperor Julian, should be ejected from
their Churches65.” Of this third and longest banishment we have no particulars, but we
may safely apply to it the words of the Synod at Constantinople, 382, that Cyril “ had passed
through very many contests with the Arians in various places.”</p>
<p>The terrible defeat and miserable death of Valens in the great battle against the Goths
at Adrianople (a.d. 378) brought a respite to the defenders of the Nicene doctrine. For
Gratian “disapproved of the late persecution that had been carried on for the purpose of
checking the diversities in religious Creeds, and recalled all those who had been banished
on account of their religion66.” Gratian associated Theodosius with himself in the Empire
on the 19th of January, 379; and “at this period,” says Sozomen67, “all the Churches of the
East, with the exception of that of Jerusalem, were in the hands of the Arians.” Cyril,
therefore, had been one of the first to return to his own See. During his long absence the
Church of Jerusalem had been the prey both of Arianism and of the new heresy of Apollinarius,
which had spread among the monks who were settled on Mount Olivet. Egyptian
Bishops, banished for their orthodoxy, having taken refuge in Palestine, there found themselves
excluded from communion. Jerusalem was given over to heresy and schism, to the
violent strife of rival factions, and to extreme licentiousness of morals.</p>
<p>Gregory of Nyssa, who had been commissioned by a Council held at Antioch in 378 to
visit the Churches in Arabia and Palestine, “because matters with them were in confusion,
and needed an arbiter,” gives a mournful account both of the distracted state of the Church,
and of the prevailing corruption. “If the Divine grace were more abundant about Jerusalem
than elsewhere, sin would not be so much the fashion among those who live there , but as

it is, there is no form of uncleanness that is not perpetrated among them; rascality, adultery,
theft, idolatry, poisoning, quarrelling, murder, are rife.” In a letter68 written after his return
to Cæsarea in Cappadocia he asks, “What means this opposing array of new Altars? Do we
announce another Jesus? Do we produce other Scriptures? Have any of ourselves dared to
say “Mother of Man” of the Holy Virgin, the Mother of God?</p>
<p>In the year a.d. 381 Theodosius summoned the Bishops of his division of the Empire
to meet in Council at Constantinople, in order to settle the disputes by which the Eastern
Church had been so long distracted, and to secure the triumph of the Nicene Faith over the
various forms of heresy which had arisen in the half-century which had elapsed since the
first General Council. Among the Bishops present were Cyril of Jerusalem, and his nephew
Gelasius, who on the death of Valens had regained possession of the See of Cæsarea from
the Arian intruder Euzoius. Cyril is described by Sozomen69 as one of three recognised
leaders of the orthodox party, and, according to Bishop Hefele70, as sharing the presidency
with the Bishops of Alexandria and Antioch. This latter point, however, is not clearly expressed
in the statement of Sozomen. Socrates writes that Cyril at this time recognised the
doctrine of ὁμοούσιον, having retracted his former opinion: and Sozomen says that he had
at this period renounced the tenets of the Macedonians which he previously held71. Touttée
rightly rejects these reproaches as unfounded: they are certainly opposed to all his teaching
in the Catechetical Lectures, where the doctrine of Christ’s unity of essence with the Father
is fully and frequently asserted, though the term ὁμοούσιος is not used, and the co-equal
Deity of the Holy Ghost is everywhere maintained.</p>
<p>We find no further mention of Cyril in the proceedings of the Council itself. As consisting
of Eastern Bishops only, its authority was not at first acknowledged, nor its acts approved
in the Western Church. The two Synods held later in the same year at Aquileia and at Milan,
sent formal protests to Theodosius, and urged him to summon a General Council at Alexandria
or at Rome. But instead of complying with this request, the Emperor summoned
the Bishops of his Empire to a fresh Synod at Constantinople, and there in the summer of
382 very nearly the same Bishops were assembled who had been present at the Council of
the preceding year. Their Synodical letter addressed to the Bishops assembled at Rome is
preserved by Theodoret72 and in it we read as follows: “Of the Church in Jerusalem, the
Mother of all the Churches, we make known that Cyril the most reverend and most beloved
of God is Bishop; and that he was canonically ordained long ago by the Bishops of the

province, and that he has very often fought a good fight in various places against the Arians.”
Thus justice was done at last to one whose prudence, moderation, and love of peace, had
exposed him in those days of bitter controversy to undeserved suspicion and relentless
persecution. His justification by the Council is the last recorded incident in Cyril’s life. We
are told by Jerome that he held undisturbed possession of his See for eight years under
Theodosius. The eighth year of Theodosius was a.d. 386, and in the Roman Martyrology,
the 18th of March in that year is marked as “The birthday (‘Natalis,’ i.e. of his heavenly life)
of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, who after suffering many wrongs from the Arians for the sake
of the Faith, and having been several times driven from his See, became at length renowned
for the glory of sanctity, and rested in peace: an Ecumenical Council in a letter to Damasus
gave a noble testimony to his untarnished faith.”</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Catechetical Instruction.</head>
<p>§ 1. Catechesis. The term “Catechesis” in its widest sense includes instruction by word
of mouth on any subject sacred or profane73, but is especially applied to Christian teaching,
whether of an elementary kind appropriate to new converts, or, as in the famous Catechetical
School of Alexandria, extending to the higher interpretation of Holy Scripture, and the
exposition of Christian philosophy.</p>
<p>The earliest known example of a Catechetical work is the “Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles,” which Athanasius names among the “books not included in the Canon, but appointed
by the Fathers to be read by those who are just recently coming to us, and wish to
be instructed in the word of godliness (κατηχεῖσθαι τὸν τῆς εὐσεβείας λόγον)74.” The use
of the Didache for the instruction of recent converts from Paganism agrees with its original
purpose as stated in the longer title, “Teaching of the Lord through the Twelve Apostles for
the Gentiles.” The first six chapters are evidently adapted for those who need elementary
instruction, more particularly for Catechumens of Gentile descent, as distinct from Jewish
candidates for Baptism75. The remaining chapters of the Didache relate chiefly to the administration
of Baptism, to Prayer, Fasting, and the services of the Lord’s Day, and to the
celebration of the Agape and Eucharist76. This same division of subjects is observed in the
two classes of S. Cyril’s Catechetical Lectures: the first class, including the Procatechesis,
consists of XIX Lectures addressed to candidates for Baptism, and these are followed by five
“Mystagogic” Lectures, so called as being explanations of the Sacramental Mysteries to the
newly-baptized.</p>
<p>The Didaché was taken as the basis of other manuals of instruction, as is evident from
the fact that the greater part of the first six chapters is imbedded in “ The Apostolical Church
Order,” supposed to date from Egypt in the third century. The Greek text, with an English
translation, of the part corresponding with the Didaché, is given in “ The oldest Church
Manual “ as Document V.</p>
<p>A further development of the Didaché, “adapted to the state of the Eastern Church in
the first half of the fourth century,” is contained in the Seventh Book of the Apostolical
Constitutions of Pseudo-Clement of Rome, chs. i.–xxxii. “Here the Didaché is embodied
almost word for word, but with significant omissions, alterations, and additions, which betray

a later age.…The Didaché was thus superseded by a more complete and timely Church
Manual, and disappeared.” Dr. Schaff has appended this document also to his edition of
the Didaché, noting the borrowed passages on the margin, and distinguishing them by
spaced type in the Greek text, and by italics in the English translation.</p>
<p>In this work the directions concerning the instruction of Catechumens and their Baptism
are addressed to the Catechist and the Minister of Baptism. They contain only a short outline
(c. xxxix.) of the subjects in which the Catechumens are to be instructed, most if not all of
which are explained at large in Cyril’s Lectures: and in the directions concerning Baptism,
Chrism, and the Eucharist, the similarity is so close, that in many passages of the Constitutions
the author seems to be referring especially to the use of the Church of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>From this close affinity with earlier works we may be assured that in the Catecheses of
Cyril we have trustworthy evidence of the great care which the Church had from the beginning
bestowed on the instruction and training of converts, before admitting them to the
privilege of Baptism; but beyond this, Cyril’s own work has a peculiar value as the earliest
extant example of a full, systematic, and continuous course of such instruction.</p>
<p>§ 2. Catechist. The duty of catechizing was not limited to a class of persons permanently
set apart for that purpose, but all orders of the Clergy were accustomed to take part in the
work. Even laymen were encouraged to teach children or new converts the first elements
of religion, as we learn from Cyril’s exhortation: “If thou hast a child according to the flesh,
admonish him of this now; and if thou hast begotten one through catechizing, put him also
on his guard77.” That this remark was addressed not to the Catechumens, but to such of
the Faithful as happened to be present among his audience, appears from what he says
elsewhere, “So thou likewise, though not daring before thy Baptism to wrestle with the adversaries,
yet after thou hast received the grace, and art henceforth confident in the armour
of righteousness, must then do battle, and preach the Gospel, if thou wilt78.”</p>
<p>The more systematic instruction of those who had been already admitted to the order
of Catechumens was entrusted to persons appointed to this special duty. Thus Origen “was
in his eighteenth year when he took charge of the Catechetical School at Alexandria,” which
“was entrusted to him alone by Demetrius, who presided over the Church79:” and S. Augustine’s
Treatise, De Catechizandis Rudibus, was addressed to Deogratias, who being a
Deacon at Carthage, and highly esteemed for his skill and success as a Catechist, felt so
strongly the importance of the work and his own insufficiency, that he wrote to Augustine
for advice as to the best method of instructing those who were brought to him to be taught
the first elements of the Christian Faith.</p>

<pb n="22"/>
<p>The final training of the φωτιζόμενοι, or candidates for Baptism, was undertaken in
part by the Bishop himself, but chiefly by a Priest specially appointed by him. Of the part
taken by the Bishop mention is made by S. Ambrose in a letter to his sister Marcellina (Ep.
xx.): “On the following day, which was the Lord’s day, after the Lessons and Sermon, the
Catechumens had been dismissed, and I was delivering the Creed to some candidates
(Competentes) in the Baptistery of the Basilica.”</p>
<p>Of this “delivery of the Creed,” which was usually done by a Presbyter, we have examples
in S. Augustine’s Sermons In traditione Symboli, ccxii.–ccxiv., each of which contains a brief
recapitulation and explanation of the several articles of belief. In Serm. ccxiv., after a short
introduction, we find the following note inserted by the preacher himself. <del>“After this preface
the whole Creed is to be recited, without interposing any discussion. ‘I believe in God the
Father Almighty,’ and the rest that follows. Which Creed, thou knowest, is not wont to be
written: after it has been said, the following discussion (disputatio) is to be added.”</del></p>
<p>From the opening words of Sermon ccxiv., and of ccxvi., “ad Competentes,” it is evident
that these were delivered by S. Augustine as the first-fruits of his ministry very soon after
he had been reluctantly ordained Priest (a.d. 391). Two other examples of addresses to
Candidates for Baptism are the Catecheses I., II., πρὸς τοὺς μέλλοντας φωτίζεσθαι, delivered
at Antioch by S. Chrysostom while a Presbyter.</p>
<p>Another duty often undertaken by the Bishop was to hear each Candidate separately
recite the Creed, and then to expound to them all the Lord’s Prayer80.</p>
<p>§ 3. Catechumens. The term Catechumen denoted a person who was receiving instruction
in the Christian religion with a view to being in due time baptized. Such persons were
either converts from Paganism and Judaism, or children of Christian parents whose Baptism
had been deferred. For though the practice of Infant-Baptism was certainly common in the
Early Church81, it was not compulsory nor invariable. “In many cases Christian parents
may have shared and acted on the opinion expressed by Tertullian in the second century,
and by Gregory Nazianzen in the fourth, and thought it well to defer the Baptism of children,
cases of grave sickness excepted, till they were able to make answer in their own name to
the interrogations of the baptismal rite82.”</p>

case of little children.” Cf. Gregor. Naz. Orat. 40 De Baptismo, quoted by Bingham, xi. c. 4, § 13.</note>

<pb n="23"/>
<p>It is stated by Bingham83, but without any reference to ancient authors, that “the child
of believing parents, as they were baptized in infancy, were admitted Catechumens as soon
as they were capable of learning.” Though the title “Catechumen” was not usually applied
to those who had been already baptized, it is probable that such children were admitted to
the Lectures addressed to Catechumens both in the earlier and later stage of their preparation:
for it seems to be implied in the passage quoted above from Cat. xv. 18, that admission was
not limited to the candidates for Baptism.</p>
<p>To believe and to be baptized are the two essential conditions of membership in Christ’s
Church84: but for the admission of new converts to the class of Catechumens nothing more
could be required than evidence of a sincere desire to understand, to believe, and ultimately
to be baptized.</p>
<p>We know that unbelievers, Jews, and Heathens were allowed in the Apostolic age to be
present at times in the Christian assemblies85; and in Cyril’s days they stood in the lower
part of the Church (νάρθηξ) to hear the Psalms, Lessons, and Sermon86.</p>
<p>Any persons who by thus hearing the word, or by other means, were brought to believe
the truth of Christianity, and to wish for further instruction, were strictly examined as to
their character, belief, and sincerity of purpose. The care with which such examinations
were conducted is thus described by Origen: “The Christians, however, having previously,
so far as possible, tested the souls of those who wish to become their hearers, and having
previously admonished them in private, when they seem, before entering the community,
to have made sufficient progress in the desire to lead a virtuous life, they then introduce
them, having privately formed one class of those who are just beginners, and are being introduced,
and have not yet received the mark of complete purification; and another of those
who have manifested to the best of their ability the purpose of desiring no other things than
are approved by Christians87.” Such as were thus found worthy of admission were brought

to the Bishop Presbyter, and received by the sign of the Cross88, with prayer and imposition
of hands, to the status of Catechumens.</p>
<p>We have a description by Eusebius89 of some of these ceremonies in the case of Constantine:
When the Emperor felt his life to be drawing to a close, “he poured forth his supplications
and confessions to God, kneeling on the pavement in the Church itself, in which
he also now for the first time received the imposition of hands with prayer.” Soon after this
the Bishops whom he had summoned to Nicomedia to give him Baptism, “performed the
sacred ceremonies in the usual manner, and having given him the necessary instructions
made him a partaker of the mystic ordinances.”</p>
<p>Another ceremony used in the admission of Catechumens, at least in some Churches,
mentioned by S. Augustine90: “Sanctification is not of one kind only: for I suppose that
Catechumens also are sanctified in a certain way of their own by the sign of Christ’s Cross,
and the Prayer of the Imposition of Hands; and that which they receive, though it be not
the Body of Christ, is yet an holy thing, and more holy than the common food which sustains
us, because it is a sacrament.” From this passage it has been inferred that consecrated bread
(εὐλογίαι, panis benedictus), taken out of the oblations provided for the Eucharist, was
given to the Catechumens,—an opinion which seemed to have some support in the comparison
between “that which the Catechumens receive,” and “the food which sustains us.” But
Bingham maintains91 that S. Augustine here refers only to the symbolical use of salt, of
which he says in his Confessions, I. xi., that while yet a boy he “used to be marked with the
sign of His Cross, and seasoned with His salt.” The meaning of this so-called “Sacrament
of the Catechumens” was that by the symbol of salt “they might learn to purge and cleanse
their souls from sin.”</p>
<p>In the African Church in the time of S. Augustine it was customary to anoint the new
convert with exorcised oil at the time of his admission, but in the Eastern Church there
seems to have been no such anointing until immediately before Baptism.</p>
<p>Persons who had been thus admitted to the class of Catechumens were usually regarded
as Christians, but only in a lower degree, being still clearly distinguished from the Faithful.
“Ask a man, Art thou a Christian? If he is a Pagan or a Jew, he answers, I am not. But if he
say, I am, you ask him further, Catechumen or Faithful? If he answer, Catechumen, he has
been anointed, but not yet baptized92.” Augustine, like Tertullian, complains that among

heretics there was no sure distinction between the Catechumen and the Faithful93: and according
to the second General Council, Canon 7, converts from certain heresies to the orthodox
Faith were to be received only as heathen: “On the first day we make them Christians,
on the second Catechumens, on the third we exorcise them by three times breathing on
them on the face and on the ears; and so we instruct them (κατηχοῦμεν), and make them
frequent the Church for a long time, and listen to the Holy Scriptures, and then we baptize
them.”</p>
<p>Whether Cyril calls his hearers Christians before they had been baptized is not very
clear: in Cat. x. § 16, he seems to include them among those who are called by the “new
name;” but in § 20 of the same Lecture he assumes that there may be present some one who
“was before a believer (πιστός),” and to him he says “Thou wert called a Christian; be tender
of the name,” and in Lect. xxi. i, speaking to those who had now been baptized, he says,
“Having therefore become partakers of Christ, ye are properly called Christs. Now ye have
been made Christs by receiving the antitype of the Holy Ghost,” that is, Chrism.</p>
<p>§ 4. Candidates for Baptism. Bingham, who himself makes four classes or degrees of
Catechumens, acknowledges that “the Greek expositors of the ancient Canons,” and other
writers, “usually make but two sorts94.” These were (1) the imperfect (ἀτελέστεροι), called
also hearers (ἀκροώμενοι , audientes), because in Church they were only allowed to remain
till the Holy Scriptures had been read, the Sermon preached, the special prayers of the Catechumens
said, and the blessing given to each by the Bishop in the words of the “prayer of
the imposition of hands95.” After this the Deacon says, “Go out, ye catechumens, in peace.”
(2) After the Energumens also have been dismissed, the more perfect (τελειότεροι,
φωτιζόμενοι) remain on their knees in prayer (γονυκλίνοντες, εὐχόμενοι). Then the
Deacon is to cry aloud, “Ye that are to be illuminated, pray. Let us the faithful all pray for
them. And being sealed to God through His Christ, let them bow down their heads, and
receive the blessing from the Bishop.” The “Prayer of the Imposition of hands” is then
pronounced over them by the Bishop.</p>
<p>The period of probation and instruction varied at different times and places: according
to Canon 42 of the Synod of Elvira, 305, it was to be two years: “He who has a good name,
and wishes to become a Christian, must be a Catechumen two years: then he maybe baptized96.”
After this probation had been satisfactorily passed, the Catechumens invited to

<pb n="26"/>
give in their names as Candidates for Baptism. This invitation, described by Cyril as a call
to military service (κλῆσις στρατείας)97, appears to have been often repeated on the approach
of Lent. Thus S. Ambrose, in his Commentary on S. Luke, v. 5; We have toiled all night and
have taken nothing, complains, “I too, Lord, know that for me it is night, when I have not
Thy command. No one yet has given his name: with my voice I have cast the net throughout
Epiphany, and as yet I have taken nothing.”</p>
<p>This preliminary “call to service” must be distinguished from the actual enlistment in
the Christian army at Baptism, in anticipation of which Cyril prays for his hearers that God
“may enlist them in His service, and put on them the armour of righteousness98.” The same
metaphorical language in reference to the Christian warfare recurs in many passages99.</p>
<p>The next step for those who responded to the call was the registration of names
(ὀνοματογραφία )100. It appears from passages of Dionysius Pseudo-Areopagites, quoted
by Bingham101, that the Bishop, after laying his hand on each Catechumen’s head, commanded
his Presbyters and Deacons to register his name, together with that of his sponsor
(ἀνάδοχος) in the Diptychs of the living. This ceremony took place at Jerusalem at the beginning
of Lent, as we learn from Procat. § 1: “Thou hast entered, been approved; thy name
inscribed.…A long notice is allowed thee; thou hast forty days for repentance.” Those who
had been admitted as candidates for Baptism were in most Churches still reckoned among
the Catechumens, being distinguished as συναιτοῦντες , “competentes.” But from Cyril’s
language in several passages it appears that in the Church of Jerusalem they ceased to be
regarded as Catechumens, and were reckoned among the Faithful. “Thou wert called a
Catechumen, while the word echoed round thee from without. Think not that thou receivest
a small thing: though a miserable man, thou receivest one of God’s titles. Hear S. Paul
saying, God is faithful. But beware, lest thou have the title of ‘faithful,’ but the will of the
faithless102.” “Thou receivest a new name which thou hadst not before. Heretofore thou
wast a Catechumen, but now thou wilt be called a Believer (Πιστός)103.”</p>
<p>Again, “How great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you from the order
of Catechumens to that of the Faithful, the Apostle Paul shews, when he affirms, God is
faithful104.”</p>

<p>Two passages in S. Cyril have been thought to imply that the newly-admitted Candidates
for Baptism carried lighted torches in procession, perhaps on the first Sunday after the registration.
He speaks of their having received “torches of the bridal procession105;” and on
this expression the Benedictine Editor observes that “Wax tapers” were perhaps given to
the Illuminandi to carry, a custom which may also be indicated in the words, “Ye who have
lately lighted the torches of faith, guard them carefully in your hands unquenched106.”</p>
<p>Others are of opinion that the custom of carrying torches or tapers was observed only
in the procession of the newly-baptized from the Baptistery to the Church107, and that here
Cyril means by the “bridal lamps,” those motions of the Holy Ghost, and spiritual instructions,
which had lighted their way to Christ, and to the entrance to His Kingdom108. This
latter interpretation is rather vague and far-fetched, and it is evident that the words, “Ye
who have lately lighted the torches of faith,” gain much in clearness and force, if suggested
by the visible symbolism of a ceremony in which the Illuminandi had just borne their part.
The lighted torches would be a significant symbol both of the marriage of the soul with
Christ, and of its enlightenment by faith.</p>
<p>§ 5. φωτιζόμενοι. In the first words of his Introductory Lecture Cyril addresses his
hearers as οἱ φωτιζόμενοι, “Ye who are being enlightened,” and from the Titles of the Catechetical
Lectures i.–xviii., we see that this name was constantly used to distinguish the
candidates preparing for immediate Baptism.</p>
<p>The Verb φωτίζω is frequently used by the LXX., both in a physical and in a spiritual
sense. In the New Testament it is found but rarely in the physical sense109, being generally
applied to the light of spiritual truth, and to Christ as its source110.</p>
<p>In two passages of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Aorist (φωτισθέντας ) marks “the
decisive moment when the light was apprehended in its glory111,” from which the thought
easily passes on to the public profession of the truth thus received, that is, to Baptism.</p>
<p>That the word began very early to be used in this new sense, is evident from Justin
Martyr’s explanation of it in his First Apology, c. 61; where, after speaking of instruction in
Christian doctrine, of the profession of faith, and the promise of repentance and holy living,
as the necessary preparations for Baptism, he thus proceeds: “And this washing is called
Illumination (σωτισμός), because they who learn these things are illuminated in their un-

derstanding.112” The same transition of the meaning from instruction to Baptism is clearly
implied by Clement of Alexandria: “Among the barbarian philosophers also to instruct and
to enlighten is called to regenerate113,” and again: “For this reason the teaching, which
made manifest the hidden things, has been called illumination (φωτισμός)114.”</p>
<p>That this is the sense in which Cyril uses the word is placed beyond doubt by a passage
of the Lecture delivered immediately before the administration of Baptism: “that your soul
being previously illuminated (προφωτιζομένης ) by the word of doctrine, ye may in each
particular discover the greatness of the gifts bestowed on you by God115.”</p>
<p>We thus see that the Present Participle (φωτιζόμενοι) describes a process of gradual illumination
during the course of instruction, to be completed in Baptism, a sense which is
well expressed in the Latin Gerundive “Illuminandi.” And as we have seen that the candidates
are addressed as οἱ φωτιζόμενοι even before the course of instruction has commenced, the
quasi-Future sense “follows necessarily from the context116.”</p>
<p>The spiritual “Illumination,” of which Baptism was to be the completion and the seal,
thus became by a natural development one of the recognised names of Baptism itself. On
the contrary, the inverse process assumed by the Benedictine Editor is entirely unnatural.
Starting from the later ecclesiastical use of φωτίζω and φωτισμός as connoting Baptism, he
supposes that this was the first application of those terms, and that they were transferred to
the previous illumination acquired by instruction in Christian truth, only because this was
a necessary preparation for Baptism. He therefore maintains that φωτιζόμενοι throughout
the Catechetical Lectures is another term for βαπτιζόμενοι: and as a decisive proof of this
he refers to Cat. xvi. 26: μέλλει δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ σὲ τὸν βαπτιζόμενον φθάνειν ἡ χάρις, not observing
that the grace is to come upon “the person being baptized” at a time still future.
This meaning of the passage is made absolutely certain by the words which immediately
follow,—“But in what manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper season.” We
may conclude, therefore, that in Cyril’s Lectures the term οἱ φωτιζόμενοι refers to the preparatory
course of enlightenment rather than to Baptism. At the same time we must remember
that in Cyril’s day, and long before, φωτίζω, φωτισμός, and φώτισμα were constantly
used to denote Baptism itself, as being the time of special illumination by the grace of the
Holy Spirit then given. Thus Clement of Alexandria writes: “In Baptism we are illuminated.<gap reason="omitted"/>
This work is variously called grace, and illumination (φώτισμα), and perfection, and
washing:<gap reason="omitted"/>illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is beheld, that is, by which we

<head>Chapter III.—Special Preparation for Baptism.</head>
<p>§ 1. Penitence. The candidate for Baptism, having been duly admitted and registered,
was required not only to be diligent in attending the course of Catechetical instruction119,
but also to enter at once upon a course of strict devotion and penitential discipline. “Those
who are coming to Baptism,” says Tertullian, “must be constantly engaged in prayers, fastings,
kneelings, and watchings, together with confession of all past faults120.”</p>
<p>On these subjects Cyril’s teaching is earnest, wise, and sympathetic: he seeks to lead to
repentance by gentle persuasion, and pleads for self-discipline as needful for the good of
the soul121. One whole Lecture is devoted to the necessity of thorough repentance for all
past sins, and forgiveness of all offences122: another to the sure efficacy of repentance for
the remission of sins123.</p>
<p>§ 2. Confession. ᾽Εξομολόγησις. Great stress is laid by Cyril on the necessity not only
of sincere inward repentance, but also of open confession. The words ἐξομολογεῖσθαι,
ἐξομολόγησις have a twofold meaning and a wide application.</p>
<p>(1.) In the Septuagint they occur very frequently, especially in the Psalms, in the sense
of “giving thanks or praise” (Heb. 􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀)124, a meaning which is also found in the New Testament125.
Perhaps the earliest instance in an Ecclesiastical writer is in Hermas, Mandat. X.
iii. 2: ἐξομολογούμενος τῷ θεῷ. I have not found any instance of this meaning in Cyril.</p>
<p>S. Chrysostom, commenting on the words, “I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord126,”
says, “There are two kinds of exomologesis; for it is either a condemnation of our own sins
or a giving of thanks to God.” The link between these two ideas is seen in Joshua’s exhortation
to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession127
unto Him. R.V. Margin. Or, give praise.</p>

<pb n="30"/>
<p>(2.) In the sense of “confessing” sins, the Verb is not uncommon in the N.T.128, and in
the early Fathers129. Tertullian adopts the Greek word, and calls exomologesis “the handmaid
of repentance130,” adding that it will extinguish the fire of Gehenna in the heart, being a
second remedy for sin, after Baptism.</p>
<p>Again, speaking of the outward act of repentance, he says: “This act, which is more
usually expressed and commonly spoken of under a Greek name, is ἐξομολόγησις, whereby
we confess our sins to the Lord, not indeed as if He were ignorant of them, but inasmuch
as by confession satisfaction is appointed, and of confession repentance is born, and God
appeared by repentance. Accordingly exomologesis is a discipline for man’s prostration and
humiliation, enjoining a demeanour calculated to move mercy. With regard also to the very
dress and food, it commands (the penitent) to lie in sackcloth and ashes…to know no food
and drink but such as is plain,—to feed prayers on fastings, to groan, to weep and roar
(mugire) unto the Lord God; to roll before the feet of the presbyters, and kneel to God’s dear
ones, to enjoin on all the brethren embassies of intercession on his behalf. All this exomologesis
does, that it may enhance repentance131, U+0026c.” </p>
<p>In this highly rhetorical description of the ecclesiastical discipline so dear to Tertullian
there are many features of extreme severity to which Cyril makes no allusion; yet he frequently
and very earnestly insists on the necessity and the efficacy of confession. “The present is
the season of confession: confess what thou hast done in word or in deed, by night or by
day; confess in an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation receive the heavenly treasure132”
“Tell the Physician thine ailment: say thou also, like David, I said, I will confess me
my sin unto the Lord ; and the same shall be done in thy case, which he says forthwith, and
Thou forgavest the wickedness of my heart133.” “ Seest thou the humility of the king? Seest
thou his confession?.…The deed was quickly done, and straightway the Prophet appeared
as accuser, and the offender confessed his fault; and because he candidly confessed, he received
a most speedy cure134.”</p>
<p>“Ezekias prevailed to the cancelling of God’s decree, and cannot Jesus grant remission
of sins? Turn and bewail thyself, shut thy door, and pray to be forgiven, pray that He may

remove from thee the burning flames. For confession has power to quench even fire, power
to tame even lions135.”</p>
<p>The confession to which Cyril attaches so high a value, whether made in the privacy of
solitude, or openly before the Ministers of the Church and the Congregation, is a confession
to God, and not to man. “Having therefore, brethren, many examples of those who have
sinned and repented and been saved, do ye also heartily make confession unto the Lord136.”
Elsewhere he expressly disclaims the necessity of private confession to man: “Not that thou
shouldest shew thy conscience to me, for thou art not to be judged of man’s judgment; but
that thou shew the sincerity of thy faith to God, who trieth the reins and hearts, and knoweth
the thoughts of men137.” He also limits the season of confession and repentance to this
present life: “Therefore the just shall then offer praise; but they who have died in sins have
no further season for confession138.”</p>
<p>§ 3. Exorcism. One of the earliest ceremonies, after the registration of names, was Exorcism,
which seems to have been often repeated during the Candidate’s course of preparation.
“Receive with earnestness the exorcisms: whether thou be breathed upon or exorcised,
the act is to thee salvation139.”</p>
<p>The power of casting out devils, promised by our Lord140, and exercised by Apostles141,
and by Philip the Deacon and Evangelist142, was long regarded in the early Church as a
direct gift still bestowed by the Holy Ghost, apart from any human ordinance. Justin Martyr143,
Tertullian144, Origen145, all speak of exorcism as being practised by laymen, even
by soldiers, and women, by means of prayer and invocation of the name of Jesus. Accordingly
“an Exorcist is not ordained, for it is a gift of the spontaneous benevolence and grace of God
through Christ by visitation of the Holy Ghost. For he who has received the gift of healing
is declared by revelation from God, the grace which is in him being manifest to all146.”
When the extraordinary gift was found to have been withdrawn, exorcists are mentioned

among the inferior officers of the Church, after readers and subdeacons147. From an early
period certain set formulæ, such as the Divine names, “The God of Abraham, and God of
Isaac, and God of Jacob,” “The God of Israel,” “The God who drowned the king of Egypt
and the Egyptians in the Red Sea,” were frequently invoked against demons and certain
wicked persons148.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when an exorcist was ordained the Bishop was directed to give him the
book in which the exorcisms were written, with the words, “Receive thou these, and commit
them to memory, and have thou power to lay hands upon the Energumens, whether they
be baptized or only Catechumens149.” Though this Canon speaks only of exorcising Energumens,
or such persons as were supposed to be possessed by evil spirits, we must remember
that the power of such spirits was believed to extend to the whole world outside the Christian
Church. Thus all converts from Paganism and Judaism, and even the children of Christian
parents were exorcised before being baptized. The practice was closely connected with the
doctrine of original sin, as we see in many passages of S. Augustine, and is declared by him
to be very ancient and universal150. In expounding the Creed to candidates for Baptism,
he says: “Therefore, as you have seen this day, and as you know, even little children are
breathed on and exorcised, that the hostile power of the devil may be driven out of them,
which deceived one man in order that he might get possession of all men151.”</p>
<p>We find accordingly that Cyril enforces the duty of attending the Exorcisms on all the
candidates alike, and from his use of the Plural (Exorcisms) we see that the ceremony was
often repeated for each person. Thus in the Clementine Homilies Peter is represented as
saying, “Whoever of you wish to be baptized, begin from to-morrow to fast, and each day
have hands laid upon you152,” the imposition of hands being one of the ceremonies used
in exorcism153. From expressions in the Introductory Lecture, “When ye have come in
before the hour of the exorcisms154,” and again, “when your exorcism has been done, until
the others who are to be exorcised have come155,” it seems that before each Catechizing the

candidates were all exorcised, one by one156, and that the earlier, after returning from their
own exorcism, had to wait for those who came later. The catechizing was thus frequently
delayed till late in the day, and Cyril often complains of the shortness of the time left at his
disposal157.</p>
<p>At Antioch, the Catechizing preceded the Exorcism, as we learn from S. Chrysostom:
“After you have heard our instruction, they take off your sandals, and unclothe you, and
send you on naked and barefoot, with your tunic only, to the utterances of the Exorcists158.”
Cyril says nothing of this unclothing, but mentions another ceremony as practised at Jerusalem:
“Thy face has been veiled, that thy mind may henceforward be free, lest the eye by
roving make the heart rove also. But when thine eyes are veiled, thine ears are not hindered
from receiving the means of salvation159.” The veil may also have been a symbol of the
slavery and darkness of sin, as S. Augustine regards the removal of the veil on the octave of
Easter as symbolising the spiritual liberty of the baptized160. Of this meaning Cyril makes
no express mention.</p>
<p>In the Greek Euchologion, as quoted by Kleopas, the act of the Exorcist is thus described:
“And the Priest breathes upon his mouth, his forehead, and his breast, saying, Drive forth
from him every evil and unclean spirit, hidden and lurking in his heart, the spirit of error,
the spirit of wickedness161, U+0026c.”</p>
<p>Besides such invocations of the names of God, as we have mentioned above, the Exorcist
used set forms of prayer “collected out of the Holy Scriptures.” Their effect, as described
by Cyril, is to “set the soul, as it were, on fire,” and scare the evil spirit away; and his meaning
may be illustrated by a passage of Tertullian, who says162: “All the authority and power we
have over them is from naming the name of Christ, and recalling to their memory the woes
with which God threatens them at the hands of Christ as Judge.…So at our touch and
breathing, overwhelmed by the thought of those judgment-fires, they leave the bodies they
have entered, at our command, unwilling and distressed, and before your very eyes put to
an open shame.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Ceremonies of Baptism and Chrism.</head>
<p>§ 1. Renunciation. We have seen that Cyril’s last Catechetical Lecture was delivered in
the early dawn of the Great Sabbath, Easter Eve. The additional instructions then promised165
concerning the behaviour of the Candidates were given on the same day, probably in the
evening, when they were all assembled immediately before the administration of Baptism.
The most important parts of the Baptismal ceremony are described by Cyril in the first
Mystagogic Lecture, delivered on the Monday of Easter week. Thus in § 1 he says, Let us
now teach you these things exactly, that ye may know the significance of the things done to
you on that evening of your Baptism.”</p>
<p>The first act was the renunciation of the Devil and all his works. This, as described by
Tertullian, was done first in the Church “under the hand of the Bishop,” and again immediately
before entering the water166. Cyril speaks of the latter occasion only. “First ye entered
into the outer chamber of the Baptistery, and there facing towards the West (as the region
of darkness) ye heard the command to stretch forth your hand, and as in the presence of
Satan to renounce him167.” For the formula of renunciation in the Apostolical Constitutions,
see note 2 on Mystag. i. § 8; it corresponds closely with Cyril’s, except that this is addressed
to Satan as if personally present: “ I renounce thee, Satan 168, and all thy works169, and all
thy pomp170, and all thy worship171.”</p>
<p>§ 2. Profession of Faith. After the renunciation of Satan the Candidate immediately
turned to the East and said, “And I associate myself (συντάσσομαι ) with Christ.” Cyril does
not give the words, but seems to allude to the custom, when he speaks of the Candidates
“turning from the West to the East, the place of light172.”</p>
<p>Then, still facing the East, the Candidate was bidden to say, “I believe in the Father, and
in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism of repentance173.” We have seen
that in Cat. xviii. 22, 32, Cyril intimated to his Candidates that they would be required to
profess publicly the Creed which he had delivered to them and which they had repeated
after him. This public profession of faith (῾Ομολογία, “Redditio Symboli”) was in some

Churches made on Holy Thursday, according to Canon 46 of the Synod of Laodicea: “Those
to be baptized must learn the Creed by heart, and recite it to the Bishop or Presbyters on
the fifth day of the week.” But in the Apostolic Constitutions, c. xli., Candidate is required
to recite the whole Creed immediately after the Renunciation: “And after his renunciation
let him in his consociation (συντασσόμενος) say: ‘And I associate myself to Christ, and
believe and am baptized into One Unbegotten Being, the Only True God Almighty, the
Father of Christ,.…and into the Lord Jesus Christ.…and I am baptized into the Holy
Ghost,.…into the resurrection of the flesh, and into the remission of sins, and into the
kingdom of heaven, and into the life of the world to come.’ And after this vow he comes in
order to the anointing with oil.”</p>
<p>Such appears to have been the custom of the Eastern Churches in general and of Jerusalem
in Cyril’s time, although he mentions only those articles of the Creed which were
commonly held to be indispensable to a valid profession of Christian belief.</p>
<p>Dr. Swainson174 represents the matter somewhat differently: “When we come to the
profession of his own personal faith which was made at Jerusalem by the Candidate for
Baptism, we find that this was far briefer not only than the collection of ‘necessary things’
(Cat. iv.), but also than the Creed of the Church of Jerusalem.” Then after quoting the short
form in Cyril, Myst. i. § 9, “I believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost,
and in one Baptism of repentance,” Dr. Swainson adds: “The words are clear and definite.
In these words each answered the question of which we read elsewhere, ‘Did he believe in
the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit?’ In this his reply the Candidate
‘confessed’ what Cyril called ‘the saving confession.’”</p>
<p>It is evident that two separate parts of the Baptismal Service are here confused: the
question to which Dr. Swainson alludes, and “the saving confession” of which Cyril speaks
in Mystag. ii. § 4, belong, as we shall presently see, to a later stage of the ceremony.</p>
<p>§ 3. First Unction. On passing from the outer to the inner chamber of the Baptistery,
the Candidate who had made his renunciation and profession barefoot and wearing his tunic
(Χιτών)175 only, now put off this inner garment also, as an emblem of putting off the man
with his deeds176. A further significance is ascribed by Cyril to this unclothing of Candidate,
as being an imitation both of Christ, who hung naked177 on the Cross, and by His nakedness

<note type="footnote">177 This passage has recently (1891) acquired a special interest from the controversy concerning Mr. Calderon’s
picture, representing St. Elisabeth of Hungary as kneeling naked before the altar. The word “naked” (γυμνός,
nudus) is not in itself decisive, but here in St. Cyril’s account of Baptism absolute nakedness seems to be implied;
for though women sometimes wore an under-tunic (χιτώνιον), men had nothing beneath the tunic proper</note>

<pb n="38"/>
put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, and “of the first-formed Adam, who
was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.”</p>
<p>“Then, when ye were stripped, ye were anointed with exorcised oil, from the very hairs
your head to your feet178.” The consecration of the “exorcised oil” is thus described179:
“Now this is blessed by the chief-priest for the remission of sins, and the first preparation
for Baptism. For he calls thus upon the Unbegotten God, the Father of Christ, the King of
all sensible and intelligent natures, that He would sanctify the oil in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and impart to it spiritual grace and efficacious strength, the remission of sins, and the
first preparation for the confession of Baptism, that so the Candidate for Baptism, when he
is anointed may be freed from all ungodliness, and may become worthy of initiation, according
to the command of the Only-begotten.”</p>
<p>Bingham’s observation, that Cyril describes this first unction as used “between the renunciation
and the confession180” is not quite accurate: in fact it came between two confesxxxi
sions, the one made, as we have seen, immediately after the renunciation in the outer
chamber, the other at the very time of immersion. Chrysostom181 clearly distinguishes two
Confessions, but places one before Baptism, and the other after: “What can be more beautiful
than the words by which we renounce the devil? Or those by which we associate
ourselves with Christ? Than that confession which comes before the washing? Or that
which comes after the washing?”</p>
<p>This first unction is not mentioned by Tertullian, nor in any genuine work of Justin
Martyr, but in the Responsiones ad Orthodoxos, a work which though still early is regarded
as certainly spurious, we find the question put, “Why are we first anointed with oil, and
then, having performed the before-mentioned symbolic acts in the Laver, are afterwards
sealed with the ointment, and do not regard this as done in opposition to what took place
in our Lord’s case, who was first anointed with ointment and then suffered182?” And in the
answer it is stated that “We are anointed with the simple oil that we may be made Christs
(Χριστοί), but with the ointment in remembrance of our Saviour Christ, who regarded the
anointing with ointment as His burial, and called us to the fellowship of His own sufferings
and glory, typically in the present life but truly in the life to come.”</p>

<p>Cyril attributes to this “exorcised oil” the same power as to Exorcism itself, “not only
to burn and cleanse away the traces of sin, but also to chase away all the invisible powers of
the evil one183.”</p>
<p>According to the directions concerning this first unction in the Apostolical Constitutions184,
the Bishop was first to anoint the head only, the anointing of the whole body being
then completed by the Deacon or Deaconess.</p>
<p>§ 4. Baptism. After this anointing the Candidates were “led by the hand to the sacred
pool of Holy Baptism185.” This pool (κολυμβήθρα) was supplied with water raised from
the reservoirs, of which, as we shall see, the Bordeaux Pilgrim speaks in his description of
the Basilica.</p>
<p>As great multitudes both of men and women were baptized at the special seasons, the
Baptisteries were large buildings outside the Church, such as the Baptistery of the Lateran,
said to have been originally built by Constantine. The font itself also was large enough for
several persons to be baptized at the same time. In some places the men were baptized first,
and then the women: in others different parts of the Baptistery were assigned to them, and
curtains were hung across the Font itself186.</p>
<p>The consecration of the water is not mentioned in the Didache or Justin Martyr; but
Tertullian thus describes its effect: “The waters after invocation of God acquire the sacramental
power of sanctification; for immediately the Spirit comes down from heaven upon
the waters, and rests upon them, sanctifying them from Himself, and they being thus sanctified
imbibe a power of sanctifying187.”</p>
<p>In the prayer of consecration given in the Apostolic Constitutions the Bishop is directed
first to offer adoration and thanksgiving to the Father and Son, and then to call upon the
Father and say: “Look down from heaven, and sanctify this water, and give it grace and
power, that so he that is to be baptized, according to the command of Thy Christ, may be
crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and may be buried with Him, and may rise with
Him to the adoption which is in Him, that he may be dead to sin, and live to righteousness188.”</p>
<p>Cyril ascribes the like effect to the consecration of the water, as imparting to it a new
power of holiness by “the invocation of the Holy Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father189.”</p>

<pb n="40"/>
<p>While standing in the water the Candidate made what Cyril calls “the saving confession190.”
The whole Creed having been already recited (Redditio Symboli) in the outer
chamber immediately after the Renunciation, a short form was now employed containing
only the necessary declaration of faith in the Holy Trinity, and in the Baptism of Repentance
for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>§ 5. Trine Immersion. This short confession appears to have been ‘made by way of
question and answer thrice repeated. “Thou wast asked, Dost thou believe in God the
Father Almighty? Thou saidst, I believe, and dippedst thyself, that is, wast buried. Again
thou wast asked, Dost thou believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and in His Cross? Thou saidst,
I believe, and dippedst thyself; therefore thou wast buried with Christ also: for he who is
buried with Christ, rises again with Christ. A third time thou wast asked, Dost thou believe
also in the Holy Ghost? Thou saidst, I believe, a third time thou dippedst thyself; that the
threefold confession might absolve the manifold fault of thy former life191.” But Cyril of
Alexandria, as quoted by Bingham192, “makes these answers not only to be a confession of
the three Persons of the Trinity, but a triple confession of Christ; which implies a repetition
of the Creed (the shortened form?) three times over.”</p>
<p>In which of these ways the threefold interrogation (“usitata et legitima verba interrogationis”)
was made at Jerusalem, is not quite certain from Cyril’s words: “Each was asked,
Dost thou believe in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and ye
made that saving confession, and went down thrice into the water193.” The Didaché194
enjoins baptism simply into the names of the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity. Justin
Martyr195 adds a few words only to the names “of God the Father and Lord of the universe,
and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit;” and Tertullian196 observes that
“Wherever there are three, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, there is the
Church, which is a body of three.” The trine immersion had reference not only to the
Trinity, but was also a symbol of the three days of our Saviour’s burial197. The use of the
three Holy Names was made more strictly indispensable as heresies were multiplied: thus
the 49th Apostolic Canon, which, Hefele says, “must be reckoned among the most ancient
Canons of the Church,” orders that “If any Bishop or Presbyter does not baptize, according

to the Lord’s command, into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but into three Beings
without beginning, or into three Sons, or three Comforters, he shall be deprived.”</p>
<p>We see here that the power of administering Baptism was not restricted to the Bishop:
and Cyril speaks of it as possessed by “Bishops, or Presbyters, or Deacons,” assigning as the
reason the great increase of believers, “for the grace is everywhere, in villages and in cities,
on them of low as on them of high degree, on bondsmen and on freemen198.”</p>
<p>Thus the rule of Ignatius199, that “it is not lawful either to baptize or to hold a love-feast
apart from the Bishop (χωρὶς τοῦ ἐπισκόπου),” must be understood to mean “without the
authority and permission of the Bishop.”</p>
<p>Of certain minor ceremonies connected with Baptism, such as the “Kiss of peace,” and
the taste of milk and honey administered to the neophyte200, no mention is made by Cyril.</p>
<p>§ 6. Chrism. The custom of anointing the baptized with consecrated ointment is regarded
by Cyril as a sacramental act representing the anointing of Jesus by the Spirit at His
Baptism. “As the Holy Ghost in substance lighted on Him, like resting upon like, so, after
you had come up from the pool of the sacred waters, there was given to you an unction the
counterpart (τὸ ἀντίτυπον) of that wherewith He was anointed, and this is the Holy
Ghost201.” As “He was anointed with a spiritual oil of gladness, that is with the Holy Ghost,
called oil of gladness, because He is the author of spiritual gladness, so ye were anointed
with ointment, and made partakers and fellows of the Christ202.” The ceremony was very
ancient: there is probably a reference to it in the words of Theophilus of Antioch203 (c. a.d.
170): “We are called Christians, because we are anointed with the oil of God.” Tertullian,
a little later, after speaking of Baptism, says: “Immediately on coming out of the Laver we
are thoroughly anointed with a consecrated unction204;” and again, “After that, the hand
is laid upon us in benediction, invoking and inviting the Holy Ghost205.” In another passage206
he mentions also the sign of the Cross: “The flesh is washed, that the soul may be
cleansed; the flesh is anointed that the soul may be consecrated, the flesh is signed [with the
Cross] that the soul also may be guarded; the flesh is overshadowed by imposition of the
hand, that the soul also may be illuminated by the Spirit.”</p>

<pb n="42"/>
<p>The consecration of the ointment is compared by Cyril to the consecration of the
Eucharist; after the invocation of the Holy Ghost it is no longer simple or common ointment,
but a gift (Χάρισμα) of Christ, and by the presence of the Holy Ghost is able to impart of
His Divine Nature. And this ointment is symbolically applied to thy forehead, and thy
other organs of sense207.”</p>
<p>The ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed, and Cyril explains the symbolical
meaning in each case by appropriate passages of Scripture208.
The consecration of the chrism could be performed by none but the Bishop, and he
alone could anoint the forehead209, Presbyters being allowed to anoint the breast, but only
with chrism received from the Bishop210. The several ceremonies are thus explained in the
Apostolical Constitutions211: “This baptism is given into the death of Jesus: the water is
instead of the burial, and the oil instead of the Holy Ghost; the seal instead of the Cross; the
ointment is the confirmation of the Confession212.”</p>
<p>In like manner the chrism is explained again, “The ointment is the seal of the covenants213,”
that is, both of God’s promises, and of the Baptismal vows.</p>
<p>The members to be anointed were not the same in all Churches, but everywhere the
chief ceremony was the anointing of the forehead with the sign of the Cross. This is what
Cyril calls “the Royal Sign214,” and “the Royal Seal to be borne upon the forehead of Christ’s
soldiers215,” and again, “The Seal of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost216.”</p>
<p>These last were probably the very words pronounced by the Bishop in making the sign
of the Cross on the forehead, for by Canon 7 of the Second General Council at Antioch
(381), converts from heretical sects were to be “sealed or anointed with the holy ointment
on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears. And in sealing them we say, ‘The seal of
the gift of the Holy Ghost.’”</p>
<p>An additional prayer to be said by the Bishop is given in the Apostolical Constitutions217:
“O Lord God, the Unbegotten, who hast no Lord, who art Lord of all, who madest the odour

of the knowledge of the Gospel to go forth among all nations, grant also now that this
ointment may be efficacious upon him that is baptized (βαπτιζομένῳ), that the sweet odour
of thy Christ may remain firm and stable in him, and that having died with Him, he may
arise and live with Him.”</p>
<p>The whole ceremony was called by the Greeks “Chrism,” the “Unction” being regarded
by them as the chief part. In the Latin Church the name Confirmation is of later date, and
indicates that greater importance was then attached to the “Laying on of Hands” with
prayer.</p>
<p>Another ceremony, not alluded to by Cyril, was the saying of the Lord’s Prayer by the
neophyte, standing up, and facing towards the East218, after which he was also to pray, “O
God Almighty, the Father of Thy Christ, Thine Only-begotten Son, give me a body undefiled,
a clean heart, a watchful mind, an unerring knowledge, the influence (ἐπιφοίτησιν) of the
Holy Ghost for attainment and full assurance of the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom
be glory to Thee in the Holy Ghost for ever. Amen.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Eucharistic Rites. Liturgy.</head>
<p>§ 1. First Communion. When the rites of Baptism and Chrism were completed, the
new-made Christians, clothed in white robes (Myst. iv. 8), and bearing each a lighted taper
in his hand, passed in procession from the Baptistery into the great “Church of the Resurrection.”
The time was still night, as we gather from the allusion in Procat., § 15: “May God
at length shew you that night, that darkness which shines like the day, concerning which it
is said, darkness shall not be hidden from thee, and the night shall be light as the day.” As
the newly-baptized entered the church, they were welcomed in the words of the 32nd Psalm.
“Even now,” says Cyril (Procat., § 15), “let your ears ring, as it were, with that glorious sound,
when over your salvation the Angels shall chant, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered; when like stars of the Church you shall enter in, bright in the
body and radiant in the soul.” During the chanting of the Psalm the neophytes seem to
have stood in front of the raised ‘bema’ or sanctuary, as we learn from Cyril’s eloquent
contemporary, Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. XL. § 46: “The station in which presently after
Baptism thou wilt stand before the great sanctuary prefigures the glory from yonder heaven;
the psalmody, with which thou wilt be welcomed, is a prelude of those heavenly hymns; the
lamps, which thou wilt light, are a mystic sign of the procession of lights, with which bright
and virgin souls shall go forth to meet the Bridegroom, with the lamps of faith burning
brightly.”</p>
<p>From the Syriac “Treatise of Severus, formerly Patriarch of Alexandria (Antioch), concerning
the rites of Baptism and of Holy Communion (Synaxis) as received among the
Syrian Christians” (Resch, Agrapha, § 12, p. 361); we learn that it was the custom “to lift up
the newly-baptized to the altar, and after giving them the mysteries the Bishop (Sacerdos)
crowned them with garlands.”</p>
<p>The white garments (Procat., § 2: Mystag., iv. 88) were worn until the Octave of Easter,
Low Sunday, Dominica in Albis (Bingham, XII. c. iv. § 3).</p>
<p>§ 2. The Liturgy. In Cyril’s last Lecture, Mystagogic V., he reminds his hearers of what
they had witnessed at their first Communion on Easter-day, and thus gives a most valuable
testimony to the prescribed form of administering the Holy Eucharist in the Eastern Church
in the middle of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Passing over all the preparatory portion of the Liturgy, he tells us first that the Deacon
brings water to the Bishop or Priest (τῷ ἱερεῖ) and to the Presbyters who stand round the
altar, that they may wash their hands in token of the need of purification from sin; a ceremony
which evidently had reference to the words of the Psalmist, “I will wash mine hands in in-

nocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O Lord219.” In some Churches, perhaps also at Jerusalem,
the words were actually chanted during the ablution220.</p>
<p>“Then the Deacon cries aloud, Receive ye one another: and let us salute (ἀσπαζώμεθα
) one another.” In the Clementine Liturgy221 the “Kiss of Peace” precedes the “Ablution.”</p>
<p>Sometimes these two sentences are combined: “Salute ye one another with the holy
kiss222.” In the Liturgy of S. James there are two separate rubrics, one immediately after
the dismissal of the Catechumens, “Take knowledge one of another,” and a second after the
Creed, “Let us embrace (ἀγαπήσωμεν) one another with a holy kiss.”</p>
<p>“After this the Priest (ἱερεύς) cries aloud, Lift up your hearts. Then ye answer, We lift
them up unto the Lord223.”</p>
<p>The meaning of this Preface, as explained by Cyril, is an exhortation by the Priest, or
Bishop when present, and a promise by the people, to raise all their thoughts to God on
high, in preparation for the great Thanksgiving to which they were further invited: “Let us
give thanks unto the Lord,”—“It is meet and right224.”</p>
<p>Then follows a very brief summary of the Eucharistic Preface, and after that the
Trisagion225, corresponding in part to the long Thanksgiving in the Apostolic Constitutions
for all God’s mercies in creation, providence, and redemption226.</p>
<p>It is important to observe how S. Cyril in this and the following sections associates the
people with the Priest, using throughout the Plural “We.” That this is intentional and significant,
we may learn from a passage of S. Chrysostom227 which is so interesting that we may
be allowed to translate it at length: “Sometimes moreover no difference is made between
the Priest and those over whom he presides, as for example when we are to partake of the
awful mysteries; for we are all alike deemed worthy of the same privileges: not as in the Old
Covenant some parts were eaten by the Priest, and others by the governed (ὁ ἀρχόμενος),
and it was not lawful for the people to share in what the Priest partook of. It is not so now:
but one Body is set before all, and one Cup. And in the prayers also one may see the laity
contributing much. For the prayers on behalf of the Energumens, and on behalf of those
in Penitence are offered in common both by the Priest and by themselves; and all say one

prayer, a prayer that is full of compassion. Again, after we have excluded from the sacred
precincts those who are unable to partake of the Holy Table, there is another prayer to be
made, and we all alike lie prostrate on the floor, and all alike rise up. When again we are to
receive and give a kiss of peace, we all alike embrace each other. Again even amid the most
tremendous Mysteries the Priest prays over the people, and the people over the Priest: for
the formula, “With Thy Spirit,” is nothing else than this. The words of the Thanksgiving
again are common: for he does not give thanks alone, but also the whole people. For having
first got their answer, and they agreeing that ‘It is meet and right so to do,’ he then begins
the thanksgiving. And why wonder that the people sometimes speak with the Priest, when
even with the very Cherubim and the Powers on high they send up those sacred hymns in
common. Now all this I have said in order that each of the common people (τῶν ἀρχομένων)
also may be vigilant, that we may learn that we are all one Body, having only as much difference
between one and another, as between members and members, and may not cast the
whole work upon the Priests, but ourselves also care for the whole Church even as for a
common Body.”</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in Cyril’s account of the Eucharistic rites in this Lecture there is
not the slightest reference to the words of Institution, though these hold so prominent a
place before the Invocation both in the Clementine Liturgy and in the Liturgy of S. James.
But we cannot justly assume, from a mere omission in so brief a summary, that the Commemoration
of the Institution had no place in the Liturgy then in use at Jerusalem. It seems
more probable that Cyril did not think it necessary, after his repeated references to the Institution
in the preceding Lecture, to make further mention of a custom so well known as
the recitation of Christ’s own words in the course of the Prayer preceding the Invocation.
On the previous day he had quoted S. Paul’s account of the Institution, with the remark,
“Since then He Himself has declared and said of the Bread, This is My Body, who shall dare
doubt any longer? And since He has Himself affirmed and said, This is My Blood, who shall
ever hesitate, saying that it is not His Blood228?” The like efficacy he again ascribes to “the
Lord’s declaration” concerning both the Bread and the Wine, that they are “the Body and
Blood of Christ229.”</p>
<p>In the Didaché, which gives the oldest elements of an Eucharistic Service, there is neither
the Commemoration nor the Invocation, but only two short and simple forms of Thanksgiving
“for the Holy Vine of David,” and “for the broken Bread230.”</p>
<p>Justin Martyr seems to imply that the consecration is effected by the Commemoration
of Christ’s own words in the Institution: “We have been taught,” he says, “that the food

<pb n="47"/>
which is blessed by the prayer of the word which comes from Him (τὴν δι᾽ εὐχῆς λόγου τοῦ
παρ αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστηθεῖσαν τροφήν), and by which our blood and flesh are by transmutation
nourished, is the Flesh and Blood of that Jesus who was made Flesh.” He gives no separate
Invocation of the Holy Ghost, but this may have been supplied in the “praise and glory” or
in the “prayer and thanksgivings” sent up “to the Father of all through the name of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost231.”</p>
<p>Irenæus is apparently the earliest writer who represents the Invocation of the Holy
Ghost as the immediate act of consecration: “We make an oblation to God of the bread and
the cup of blessing, giving Him thanks for that He has commanded the earth to bring forth
these fruits for our nourishment. And then, having completed the oblation, we call forth
(ἐκκαλοῦμεν ) the Holy Spirit, that He may exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread the Body
of Christ, and the cup the Blood of Christ, in order that the partakers of these antitypes may
obtain the remission of sins and life eternal232.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond writes that, “By the Oriental Churches an Invocation of the Holy Spirit
is considered necessary to complete the consecration. In the three Oriental Families of
Liturgies such an Invocation is invariably found shortly after the Words of Institution233.”
It is in accordance with this statement that, we find Cyril so frequently declaring that
the elements which before the Invocation are simple bread and wine, become after the Invocation
the Body and Blood of Christ234. In the first of the passages referred to below he
speaks of “the Holy Invocation of the Adorable Trinity,” in the others of the Holy Spirit
only.</p>
<p>Cyril next describes the Invocation as “completing the Spiritual Sacrifice, the bloodless
Service,” and then gives a summary of the “Great Intercession” as made “over that Sacrifice
of the Propitiation.” The Intercession, as represented by Cyril, is not simply a prayer, but
an offering of the Sacrifice235, and this is in accordance with the usual language of the
Liturgies.” We offer to Thee, O Lord, on behalf also of Thy holy places, which Thou hast
glorified by the Theophany of Thy Christ, and by the visitation of Thine All-Holy Spirit:
especially on behalf of glorious Sion, the Mother of all the Churches, and on behalf of Thy
Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church throughout the whole world236.” In the Liturgy of S.
Chrysostom, as now commonly used in the Orthodox Eastern Church, we find the fuller

<pb n="48"/>
phrase, “We offer unto Thee this reasonable Service on behalf of the world, on behalf of the
Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church237.”</p>
<p>In some particulars Cyril’s summary agrees most nearly with the Clementine Liturgy,
as, for example, in the prayer “for the King and those in authority, and for the whole army,
that they may be at peace with us238.” In others he follows the Liturgy of S. James, as in the
intercession for “every Christian soul afflicted and distressed, that stands in need of Thy
pity and succour239.”</p>
<p>Cyril next describes the commemoration of departed Saints, and “of all who in past
years have fallen asleep among us,” that is, in the bosom of the Church, and states his belief
“that it will be a very great benefit to the souls, for whom the supplication is put up while
that holy and most awful Sacrifice is presented240.” He refers to objections against this belief,
and brings forward in defence of it a reason applicable only to sinners: “When we offer,”
he says, “our supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners, we offer
up Christ sacrificed for our sins, propitiating our merciful God for them as well as for
ourselves241.” His language on this subject seems in fact to shew an advance in doctrine
beyond the earliest Liturgies. In those of S. James and S. Basil we find prayers that the offering
may be acceptable as a propitiation “for the rest of the souls that have fallen asleep aforetime,”
and again, “that we may find mercy and grace with all the Saints who have ever been pleasing
in Thy sight from generation to generation, forefathers, fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Teachers, holy men, and every righteous spirit made perfect
in the faith of Thy Christ.”</p>
<p>There is nothing here, nor in the Clementine Liturgy, nor in that of S. Mark, corresponding
to the purpose which Cyril ascribes to the commemoration, “that at their prayers and
intercessions God would receive our petition.” In the Anaphora of S. Chrysostom contained
in the later form of the Liturgy of Constantinople we find, apparently for the first time, this
prayer added to the commemoration of all Saints, “at whose supplications look upon us, O
God.”</p>
<p>There was much controversy on the subject of prayers for the dead in Cyril’s time, and
the objections which he notices were brought into prominence by Ærius, and rebuked by
Epiphanius242.</p>

<p>From the commemoration of the departed Cyril passes at once to the Lord’s Prayer243,
omitting the Preface which is found in the Liturgies of S. James and S. Mark. In the Clementine
Liturgy, contrary to general use, the Lord’s Prayer is not said at all. Cyril adds an
exposition of each petition, and gives an unusual explanation of ἐπιούσιος, for which see
the footnote: he also explains τοῦ πονηροῦ as referring to “the wicked one,” following in
this the Embolismus of S. James, “deliver us from the wicked one and from his works.”</p>
<p>“After this the Bishop says, Holy things for holy men244.” Chrysostom explains this as
being both an invitation to the Faithful in general to communicate, and a warning to the
unholy to withdraw. “The Bishop, with loud voice and awe-inspiring cry, raising high his
arm like a herald, and standing on high in sight of all, above that awful silence cries aloud,
inviting some and repelling others, and doing this not with his hand, but with his tongue
more clearly than with the hand..…For when he says, Holy things for the holy, he means
this: Whosoever is not holy, let him not draw near245.”</p>
<p>In regard to the doctrinal significance of the formula, Dr. Waterland’s remarks should
be consulted246.</p>
<p>The response of the people to the “Sancta Sanctis” is given by Cyril247 in accordance
with the Liturgy of S. James and the Clementine: “One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus
Christ:” but he does not mention the “Gloria in excelsis” nor the “Hosanna,” both of which
follow here in the Clementine.</p>
<p>“After this,” says Cyril, “ye hear the chanter inviting you with a sacred melody to the
Communion of the Holy Mysteries, and saying, O taste and see that the Lord is good248.
This agrees with the Clementine rubric: “Let the 33rd Psalm be sung while all the rest are
partaking.” In the Liturgy of S. James, while the Bishop is breaking the Bread and dipping
in the Wine, the “Agnus Dei” and several Psalms were sung: but of these there is no mention
in the Clementine Liturgy or in Cyril.</p>
<p>On Cyril’s directions for receiving the Bread and the Cup with due reverence, see the
footnotes on the passages249.</p>
<p>His final injunction to remain for the prayer and thanksgiving is taken from that in the
Clementine Liturgy: “Having partaken of the precious Body and the precious Blood of
Christ, let us give thanks to Him who hath counted us worthy to partake of His holy Mys-

<head>Chapter VI.—Effects of Baptism and of Chrism.</head>
<p>§ 1. Baptism. When we try to ascertain the exact relation between Baptism and the
Unction or Chrism which immediately followed, we find that Cyril’s teaching on the subject
has been understood in very different senses. By some he is thought to regard the Unction
as being merely an accessory rite of the one great Sacrament of Baptism; to others he seems
to draw a clear distinction between them, assigning to each its proper grace and efficacy.</p>
<p>The former view is stated by the Oxford editor, Milles, in his note on the words: “And
in like manner to you also, after you had come up from the pool of the sacred waters, there
was given an unction, a figure (ἀντίτυπον ) of that with which Christ was anointed; and
that is the Holy Ghost250.” “It is evident,” says Milles, “from his words here, that the Chrism
of which Cyril treats in this Lecture is not to be referred to the Unction which is administered
by the Romanists in Confirmation. For every one sees that by Unction in this passage a
ceremony of Baptism is indicated. The ancients employed two Unctions in Baptism, the
first before the immersion in the water, of which he spoke in the preceding Lecture; the
second immediately upon ascending from the water, of which he speaks in this Lecture.”</p>
<p>This opinion is elaborately discussed by the Benedictine editor, Touttée, Dissertatio iii.
c. 7, who argues that the Unction described by Cyril is a Sacrament distinct from Baptism,
that it has for its proper grace the gift of the Holy Spirit, and further that this gift is not
conferred in Baptism. Of these assertions the first and second appear to represent Cyril’s
view correctly: the last is an exaggeration and a mistake, the tendency of which is to
identify the Chrism of the Eastern Church with that which is used in Confirmation by the
Roman Church, and to exalt the rite of Confirmation as a proper Sacrament distinct from
Baptism, and even superior to it. A view differing in some respects from both of these has
been recently put forward by a learned and devout writer of our own Church, who has fully
discussed the teaching of Cyril and other Eastern Fathers, and gives the result of his investigation
in the following “Summary251:” “For very many centuries the Christians of the East
have never been forced to define to themselves at all clearly the position of a person baptized
but unconfirmed. Their mode of administering Confirmation (Chrism?) by the hands of
the baptizing Presbyter—though among the Greeks and some others with chrism prepared
by the Bishop—relieves them from the necessity which weighs upon us Westerns, of teaching
Christian children what their status is between the two rites. Confirmation (Chrism?) is for

<note type="footnote">251 A. J. Mason, D.D., The Relation of Confirmation to Baptism, p. 389. Though I find myself compelled to
differ widely from my friend Canon Mason in the interpretation of Cyril’s teaching on this subject, I cannot
refrain from expressing my sincere admiration of the tone and purpose of his treatise, and of the learning and
research which it exhibits.</note>

<pb n="52"/>
them, far more than it has been for a long while in the West, a factor in Baptism. Only a
more or less conscious desire not to fall behind Western teachers in honouring the perfecting
Unction can have led their later authorities to treat that Unction as a sacrament numerically
distinct from Baptism. To all the early doctors of the East the two things are one, and Baptism
culminates in the Unction. The tendency among Oriental Christians was, not to attribute
to Baptism in our modern sense the gift of the Holy Ghost, but rather to consider Baptism
by itself as a bare rite, benefiting the body alone, and dependent for its spiritual efficacy
upon other actions, after and before. Not that this tendency has its full way. The Greek
Fathers may be said certainly on the whole to trace the forgiveness of sins, the preparatory
cleansing, to the baptismal Laver; the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the ordinary purposes of
Christian living, they trace, like S. Chrysostom, to that act which comes “ immediately after
Baptism, and before the Mysteries.”</p>
<p>When we come to inquire how far these several theories agree with the teaching of Cyril
himself, we must in the outset put aside altogether the name Confirmation: for as applied
to the Unction used in the Eastern Church it is only confusing and misleading. In the early
ages of the Church Confirmation was not known even by name. In the Latin Church “neither
Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, nor any of the Latin Fathers, makes
mention of Confirmation in this sense. Nor have the Greeks any word to answer to this
Latin term252.” So far, therefore, Milles appears to be perfectly right in refusing to connect
the Chrism of which Cyril treats with the Unction used in Confirmation by the Roman
Church.</p>
<p>We may add that in Cyril’s account of Chrism it is wholly unconnected with Confirmation,
both in its symbolic reference and in its outward form. Chrism, he says, is the antitype
of the Unction of Christ by the Holy Ghost at His Baptism: Confirmation is universally
admitted to have been a following of the Apostles in their laying on of hands. But in that
Apostolic rite there was no unction, and in Chrism there was no such laying on of hands.</p>
<p>In several passages Cyril clearly distinguishes the outward form of Baptism from the
spiritual grace.</p>
<p>“If thy body be here, but not thy mind, it profiteth thee nothing. Even Simon Magus
once came to the Laver: he was baptized, but was not enlightened; and though he dipped
his body in water, he enlightened not his heart with the Spirit: his body went down and
came up, but his soul was not buried with Christ, nor raised with Him253.”</p>
<p>It is impossible here to regard “the Spirit” as referring to the grace of Unction: for (1)
Baptism was not accompanied by Unction in the time of the Apostles, and (2) we should
thus make a false antithesis between the outward part of the one rite (“he dipped his body
<note type="footnote">252 Suicer, Thesaurus, Χρίσμα.</note>
<note type="footnote">253 Procat. § 2.</note>

<pb n="53"/>
in water”), and the inward part of the other. Here, therefore, Cyril attributes enlightenment
of the heart by the Spirit to Baptism apart from Unction, and at the same time lays stress
upon the difference between the worthy and unworthy recipient of the outward form.</p>
<p>The importance of this difference is further enforced throughout the next two sections,
and at the close of § 4 the distinction between the outward sign and inward grace of Baptism,
strictly so called, is again asserted, “though the water will receive thee, the Spirit will not
accept thee.”</p>
<p>“Some might suppose,” it is said, “from these words that Cyril thought of water and the
Spirit as the sign and the thing signified in Baptism respectively, and a passage in a later
Lecture upon the subject of the Sacrament (of Baptism) at first confirms that impression254.”</p>
<p>To suppose that Cyril had any other thought in the former passage, seems to me impossible
for any ordinary reader, and the later passage, not only at first, but more fully the
longer it is considered, confirms that impression beyond all doubt. The whole quotation,
including Cat. iii. §§ 3, 4, is too long to repeat here, but may be read in its proper place. It
will be sufficient to give the passages which are of chief importance in the question before
us, according to Canon Mason’s translation.</p>
<p>Cat. iii. § 3. “Do not attend to the laver as mere water, but to the spiritual grace given
along with the water”…“the mere water, receiving the invocation of the Holy Ghost, and
of Christ, and of the Father, acquires a power of sanctity. For since man is a two-fold being
composed of soul and body, the cleansing element also is two-fold, the incorporeal for the
incorporeal, the bodily for the body. And the water cleanses the body, but the Spirit seals
the soul, in order that having our hearts sprinkled by the Spirit, and our bodies washed with
pure water, we may draw nigh to God. When, therefore, you are about to go down into the
water do not pay attention to the mere nature of the water, but expect salvation by the operation
of the Holy Ghost. For without both it is impossible for thee to be perfected.”</p>
<p>No words could state more clearly the distinction between the outward sign and the
inward grace of Baptism, and the absolute necessity for both. There is no possible reference
to Unction, but “the operation of the Holy Ghost” in cleansing and sealing the soul is unmistakably
connected with Baptism as “the grace given with the water” (μετὰ τοῦ ὕδατος),
and below, as “the seal by water” (τὴν δι᾽ ὕδατος σφραγῖδα), the latter phrase shewing that
Baptism by water is the signum efficax of the grace in question.</p>
<p>Cyril then quotes our Lord’s words, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God, and explains them thus: “On the one hand he who
is being baptized (βαπτιζόμενος) with the water, but has not had the Spirit vouchsafed to
him (καταξιωθείς), has not the grace in perfection: on the other hand, even if a man be
distinguished for virtue in his deeds, but does not receive the seal bestowed by means of
<note type="footnote">254 Mason, ubi supr., p. 337.</note>

<pb n="54"/>
water (τὴν δι᾽ ὕδατος σφραγῖδα), he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” Canon
Mason, whose translation I have followed, finds here a reference both to Baptism and to
Unction as “the first baptismal act and the second,” and in support of this interpretation
gives a second and more emphatic version: “He who is in course of being baptized with the
water, but has not yet had the Spirit vouchsafed to him, has not the grace in perfection.”
This introduction of the word “yet,” in order to represent a distinction between two separate
acts, is not justified either by the reading of the older editions (οὐδὲ τῷ ὕδατι βαπτιζόμενος
μὴ καταξιωθεὶς δὲ τοῦ Πνεύματος), nor by that of Codices Monac. Roe, Casaub. adopted
by Reischl (οὔτε ὁ βεβαπτισμένος κ.τ.λ.), nor by the Benedictine text (οὔτε ὁ βαπτιζόμενος
κ.τ.λ.). The obvious meaning of the passage, with either reading, is that “the man who in
Baptism did not receive the Holy Spirit, has not the grace (of Baptism) complete.” The Benedictine
Editor in his elaborate argument for regarding Chrism as a distinct sacrament255”,
does not even refer to this passage.</p>
<p>A statement which is important in this connexion is found in Mystag. ii. § 6: “Let no
one then suppose that Baptism is the grace of remission of sins only, or further of adoption,
as the Baptism of John conferred only remission of sins; but as we know full well that it
cleanses from sins and procures a gift of the Holy Spirit, so also it is a counterpart (ἀντίτυπον)
of the sufferings of Christ.”</p>
<p>Here besides “the remission of sins, which no man receiveth without the Holy Spirit256,”
we find “a gift of the Holy Ghost,” and the fellowship of Christ’s Passion distinctly attributed
to Baptism.</p>
<p>If the “adoption” mentioned at the beginning of this passage were identical (as Touttée
thinks) with the “gift of the Holy Ghost,” it would by no means follow that Cyril here means
to include Unction in Baptism. For the grace which beyond all others is exclusively attached
to Baptism, and not to Unction, is the new birth, and this is “the new birth into freedom
and adoption257.” In fact Cyril’s teaching on this point is in strict accordance with that of
St. Paul in Gal. iv. 4–6, that we first receive the adoption of sons (υἱοθεσίαν), and then “because
ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” So
again in Rom. viii. 15, 16, he says, “Ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
Father. The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.”
In both passages St. Paul clearly distinguishes two things, “the adoption” itself, and the
witness of it by “the Spirit of adoption.” Cf. Bengel on v. 4: “Prius adoptionem, deinde
Spiritum adoptionis accepimus;” and on v. 6: “Filiorum statum sequitur inhabitatio Spiritus
Sancti, non hanc ille.” The adoption itself belongs to Baptism strictly so called, in which
<note type="footnote">255 Dissert. iii. c. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">256 Hooker, E.P.V. lxvi. § 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">257 Cat. i. 2.</note>

<pb n="55"/>
we are made children of God and joint heirs with Christ (cf. Cat. iii. 15): the witness of the
indwelling Spirit of adoption is the special grace ascribed to Chrism in the Eastern Church,
and to Confirmation in the Western. There are many other passages in which Cyril ascribes
to Baptism itself, as distinct from Chrism, a gift of the Spirit, such as the following: “But
He trieth the soul: He casteth not His pearls before the swine: if thou dissemble, men will
baptize thee now, but the Spirit will not baptize thee258.”</p>
<p>“The Lord, preventing us according to His loving-kindness, has granted repentance at
Baptism, in order that we may cast off the chief—nay, rather the whole burden of our sins,
and having received the seal by the Holy Ghost, may be made heirs of eternal life259.”</p>
<p>Again, after speaking of “the invocation of grace having sealed the soul,” he adds:
“Having gone down dead in sins, thou comest up quickened in righteousness. For if thou
hast been united with the likeness of the Saviour’s death, thou shalt also be deemed worthy
of His Resurrection260.” The benefits ascribed to Baptism in these several passages without
any allusion to Chrism, are brought together with rhetorical effect in the Introductory Lecture,
§ 16: “Great is the Baptism that lies before you; a ransom to captives, a remission of
offences, a death of sin, a new birth of the soul, a garment of light, a holy indissoluble seal,
a chariot to heaven, the delight of Paradise, a welcome into the kingdom, the gift of adoption.”</p>
<p>From such language it is clear beyond question that in Cyril of Jerusalem, not to speak
of other Oriental Fathers, the tendency is not “to consider Baptism by itself as a bare rite,
benefiting the body alone, and dependent for its spiritual efficacy upon other actions after
and before,” but as depending on the power of the Holy Ghost, and the sincerity of repentance
and faith in man.</p>
<p>If further proof were needed, a glance at the Index under the word “Baptism” will shew
the extraordinary richness, variety, and precision of Cyril’s teaching, as to the gifts of the
Holy Ghost conferred therein.</p>
<p>§ 2. Chrism. When spiritual blessings so many and so great have been ascribed to
Baptism, in what light, it may be asked, does Cyril regard the Unction which follows? Does
he treat it as being merely an additional ceremony subordinate to Baptism, or as having for
its own proper grace some special gift of the Holy Ghost? We find no answer to this question
in the earlier course of Lectures261. But that Chrism was not regarded by Cyril as a mere
accessory to Baptism, as Milles thought262, may be safely inferred from the fact that in announcing
the subjects of his Mystagogic Lectures, he mentions first Baptism, then “the seal

<pb n="56"/>
of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,” and then “the Mysteries at the altar of the New Covenant263:”
and this inference is fully confirmed by his language elsewhere: “Ye have heard
enough of Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ264.” A
mere additional ceremony of Baptism could not have been so independently placed between
the two sacraments, and, as it were, in the same rank with them.</p>
<p>The importance thus attached to Chrism is further shewn in the fact that Cyril uses the
very same language in reference to the consecration of the ointment of Chrism and of the
water of Baptism, and of the Eucharistic elements. “The bread and wine of the Eucharist
before the Invocation of the Holy and Adorable Trinity are simple (λιτός) bread and wine,
but after the Invocation the Bread becomes the Body and the Wine the Blood of Christ265.”
Regard not the Laver as simple (λιτῷ) water, but rather regard the spiritual grace that is
given with the water266.” “The simple water having received the Invocation of the Holy
Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father, acquires a new power of holiness267.”</p>
<p>“But see thou suppose not this to be plain (ψιλόν) ointment. For as the Bread of the
Eucharist, after the Invocation of the Holy Ghost is no longer simple (λιτός) bread, but the
Body of Christ; so also this holy ointment is no longer plain (ψιλόν) ointment, nor, as one
might say, common, after Invocation, but Christ’s gift of grace (χάρισμα), and is made effectual
to impart the Holy Ghost by the presence of His own Godhead268.”</p>
<p>The spiritual benefits which Cyril ascribes to the Unction are set forth in the same Lecture.
“This holy thing is a spiritual safeguard of the body, and salvation of the soul” (§ 7):
it sanctifies all the organs of sense: “the body is anointed with the visible ointment, and the
soul is sanctified by the Holy and Life-giving Spirit” (§ 3). After being anointed the Christian
is now entitled to that name in its fullest sense269; he is clothed with the whole armour
of the Holy Ghost, that he may stand against the power of the adversary: he may say, “I can
do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me” (§ 4).</p>
<p>In regard to the supposed identity of Chrism and Confirmation, it is important to notice
carefully how Cyril speaks of the laying on of hands in the only passage where he mentions
it270.</p>

<pb n="57"/>
<p>He first illustrates the freedom of the Spirit, and His independence of human agency,
by the gift of prophecy to the seventy elders, including Eldad and Medad: he then refers to
the gift of the spirit of wisdom to Joshua by the laying on of Moses’ hands271, and adds,
“Thou seest everywhere the figure (τύπον) in the Old Testament, and in the New the same.
In Moses’ time the Spirit was given by laying on of hands (χειροθεσίᾳ ), and Peter gives the
Spirit by laying on of hands272: and upon thee also, who art to be baptized, the grace is
about to come; but the manner (τὸ πῶς) I tell thee not, for I do not forestall the time.”</p>
<p>From this passage it has been inferred (i) that Cyril alludes to a gift of the Spirit by laying
on of hands in immediate connexion with Baptism and Unction273, and (2) that he refers
this gift of the Spirit not to Baptism itself, but to the laying on of hands, or to the Unction
as a figure that answers to it274.</p>
<p>(1) The first of these inferences is opposed to the fact that Cyril neither mentions the
laying on of hands as part of the actual ceremonial in Baptism or Unction, nor as the analogous
rite in the old Testament, but on the contrary expressly says275 that the symbol (τὸ
σύμβολον) of this holy Chrism in the Old Testament lies in the consecration of Aaron to
be High Priest, when Moses, “after the washing in water anointed him, and he was called
‘anointed,’ evidently from this figurative unction (τοῦ χρίσματος δηλαδὴ τοῦ τυπικοῦ).”</p>
<p>(2) In support of the second inference the argument offered is as follows: “That the
Spirit was to come upon them in the course of their Baptism is here again clearly stated; but
that Cyril did not intend them to suppose that Baptism itself would convey the gift is equally
clear. Again and again in earlier Lectures, as well as in the words actually before us, Cyril
has taught them to expect the gift in Baptism; if therefore the immersion itself were to be
the means of receiving it, he has already told them his secret. Yet now he says that he will
not tell them ‘how’ they are to receive it. That remains for a future occasion276.” The mistake,
as I venture to consider it, lies in the words which I have marked with italics. For of the
mysteries which were to be concealed from the unbaptized (ἀμύητοι) the first was the
manner of administering Baptism itself, and the second, the unction of Chrism; and in the
preceding Lectures Cyril has no more told the secret of the one than of the other. “Baptism,
the Eucharist, and the oil of Chrism, were things that the uninitiated (ἀμύητοι) were not
allowed to look upon277.”</p>

<p>“We bless,” says S. Basil278, “both the water of Baptism and the oil of the Chrism, and
moreover the baptized (βαπτιζόμενον) himself. From what written commands? Is it not
from a secret (σιωπωμένης) and mystical tradition? Again, the very anointing with the oil,
what word of Scripture taught that? And the dipping the man thrice, whence came it? And
all the other accompaniments of Baptism, the renunciation of Satan and his angels, from
what Scripture came they? Come they not from this unpublished and secret teaching, which
our fathers guarded in a silence with which no prying curiosity might meddle, having been
well taught to preserve the sanctity of the mysteries by silence? For how could it have been
right to publish in writing the doctrine of these mysteries, which the unbaptized are not
even allowed to look upon?”</p>
<p>As these secret ceremonies of Baptism and Unction are revealed by Cyril only in the
Mystagogic Lectures, the supposed reason for saying, that in Cat. xvi. 26, the promised gift
of the Spirit refers not to Baptism but only to Unction, at once falls to the ground.</p>
<p>The true state of the case is well expressed by Bingham279, “Though the ancients acquainted
the Catechumens with the doctrine of Baptism so far as to make them understand the
spiritual nature and design of it, yet they never admitted them to the sight of the actual ceremony,
nor so much as to hear any plain discourse about the manner of its administration,
till they were fitted and prepared for the actual reception of it,”—or rather, till they actually
received it.</p>
<p>There is in fact no reason to exalt the benefits of Unction, or Confirmation, by robbing
Baptism of its proper grace. “It was this Unction, as the completion of Baptism, to which
they ascribed the power of making every Christian in some sense partaker of a royal priesthood.
To it they also ascribed the noble effects of confirming the soul with the strength of
all spiritual graces on God’s part, as well as the confirmation of the profession and covenant
made on man’s part280.” We may well be satisfied that the doctrine of the early Church has
been so fully retained in essential points in our own Office of Confirmation, recalling as it
does by the ratification of the baptismal vows the immediate connexion of the ancient
Unction with Baptism, and in its Prayers invoking the same gifts of the Holy Spirit,—“
Strengthen them, we beseech Thee, O Lord, with the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and
daily increase in them Thy manifold gifts of grace; the spirit of wisdom and understanding;

<head>Chapter VII.—Eucharistic Doctrine.</head>
<p>We have seen that Cyril makes the consecration of sacramental elements in every case
consist in the Invocation of the Holy Ghost, after which the water of Baptism is no longer
mere simple water281, the ointment no longer plain ointment282, the bread and the wine
no longer plain bread and wine, but the Body and Blood of Christ283.</p>
<p>Upon these statements an argument against Transubstantiation has been founded by
Bishop Cosin284, and adopted both by Dr. Pusey285 and Dean Goode286. It being universally
admitted that the substance of the water and of the ointment remains unchanged, it is argued
from the identity of the language employed in each case that, according to Cyril, no substantial
change takes place in the Bread and Wine. Bishop Cosin quotes the following passage,
of which the original is given below: “Take heed thou dost not think that this is a mere
ointment only. For as the bread of the Eucharist after the invocation of the Holy Ghost is
no longer ordinary bread, but is the body of Christ; so this holy ointment is no longer a bare
common ointment after it is consecrated, but is the gift or grace of Christ, which, by His
Divine Nature, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, is made efficacious; so that the body is
anointed with the ointment, but the soul is sanctified by the holy and vivifying Spirit287.”</p>
<p>Bishop Cosin proceeds to argue thus: “Can anything more clear be said? Either the
ointment is transubstantiated by consecration into the spirit and grace of Christ, or the
bread and wine are not transubstantiated by consecration into the Body and Blood of Christ.
Therefore as the ointment retains still its substance, and yet is not called a mere or common
ointment, but the Chrism or grace of Christ: so the bread and wine remaining so, as to their
substance, yet are not said to be only bread and wine common and ordinary, but also the
Body and Blood of Christ.”</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the great authority of Bishop Cosin, and the assent of Theologians of
such opposite schools as Dr. Pusey and Dean Goode, it must be admitted that the argument,

<pb n="61"/>
even as against Transubstantiation, is pressed beyond its just limits. The identity of language
extends only to two points, (1) the mode of consecration by Invocation, (2) the effect negatively
stated, that the material element in each case is no longer simply a material element.
A change, therefore, of some kind has taken place, and we have still to inquire how the
change in each case is described by Cyril. “The water acquires a power of sanctity,” otherwise
described as “the spiritual grace given with the water288.”</p>
<p>“The ointment is Christ’s gift of grace (Χάρισμα), and becomes effectual to impart by
the presence of the Holy Ghost His Divine Nature289.” “The Bread becomes the Body and
the Wine the Blood of Christ290.”</p>
<p>There is here no such identity of language as would justify the assertion that the change
described is of the same nature in each case, that because it leaves the substance of the water
and the ointment untouched, therefore the substance of the Bread also must, according to
Cyril, remain unchanged: this must be proved by other arguments. We must also remember
that if this argument based upon the identity of the language used on the two sides of a
comparison is trustworthy, there is another passage in Cyril to which it may be applied:
“He once, in Cana of Galilee, changed the water into wine akin to blood (οἰκεῖον αἵματι)291,
and is it incredible that He changed wine into blood?” The change of the water into wine
was a change of substance: are we then prepared to agree with the Roman Church that the
change of the bread also is a change of substance? Nay further, would the Roman Church
itself accept the principle of the argument? For observe that in fact Bishop Cosin himself,
when he comes to deal with this passage, gives up his former argument, and distinctly rejects
it. “Protestants,” he says, “do freely grant and firmly believe that the wine, in the sense
already often mentioned, is changed into the Blood of Christ; but every change is not a
transubstantiation; neither doth Cyril say that this change (i.e. of the wine) is like that of
the water, for then it would appear to our senses; but that He who changed the water sensibly
can also change the wine sacramentally, will not be doubted by any292.” Again, in describing
the act of consecration, Cyril says: “We beseech the merciful God to send forth His Holy
Spirit upon the gifts lying before Him, that He may make the bread the Body of Christ, and
the wine the Blood of Christ, for certainly whatsoever the Holy Ghost has touched, is sanctified
and changed (ἡγίασται καὶ μεταβέβληται )293.” Here again, as in the passage quoted

<pb n="62"/>
from Myst. iii. § 3, a sacramental change of some sort is asserted, but its specific character
is not defined.</p>
<p>There is, however, a passage which throws some light on Cyril’s conception of the change
in Myst. iv. § 3: “In the figure of Bread is given to thee His Body, and in the figure of Wine
His Blood, that thou by partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ mightest be made of the
same body and the same blood with Him. For thus we come to bear Christ in us, His Body
and His Blood being distributed to our members (εἰς τὰ ἡμέτερα ἀναδιδομένου μέλη).”
Several good MSS read ἀναδεδεγμένοι, which would give the meaning, “having received of
His Body and of His blood into our members.” This does not alter the general sense of the
passage; but the reading ἀναδιδομένου is supported by another passage, Myst. v. § 15: “Our
common bread is not substantial (ἐπιούσιος): but this Holy Bread is substantial, that is,
appointed for the substance of the soul. This Bread goeth not into the belly and is not cast
out into the draught, but is distributed (ἀναδίδοται) into thy whole system for the benefit
of body and soul.”</p>
<p>In order to accommodate these passages to the Roman doctrine of Transubstantiation
the Benedictine Editor here introduces the idea of species, the outward forms or accidents
of the bread. “We must not suppose,” he says, “that Cyril thought the Body of Christ to be
divided and digested (digeri) into our body; but by a customary way of speaking he attributes
to the Holy Body what is suitable only to the species which conceal it. And he does not deny
that the species pass into the draught, but only that the Body of Christ does so.”</p>
<p>But Cyril draws no such distinction between the species and the Body of Christ: to him
the Bread and Wine after consecration are the Body and the Blood of Christ. For how could
it be said that the species, which in Transubstantiation are the mere outward accidents of
bread and wine, are distributed into the whole system for the benefit of body and soul?</p>
<p>In whatever sense the bread and wine become by consecration the Body and Blood of
Christ, in that same sense the Body and Blood of Christ are, according to Cyril, distributed
to our whole system.</p>
<p>This was no new doctrine: Ignatius, Ephes. xxi., speaks of Christians as “breaking one
Bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote that we should not die, but
live for ever in Jesus Christ.” This is perhaps the earliest expression of the belief that the
resurrection of the body is secured by the communion of the Body of Christ in the Eucharist.
The manner in which this communion is effected is described by Justin Martyr (Apolog. I.
§ 66) in language which shews clearly what Cyril meant: “We do not receive these things
as common bread and common drink: but in the same way as Jesus Christ our Saviour was
made flesh by the Word of God, and took both flesh and blood for our salvation, so we have
been taught that the food over which thanksgiving has been made by prayer in the word
received from Him (τὴν δι᾽ εὐχῆς λόγου τοῦ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστηθεῖσαν τροφήν), from

<pb n="63"/>
which (food) our blood and flesh are by transmutation (κατὰ μεταβολήν) nourished, is
both the Flesh and Blood of Him the Incarnate Jesus.”</p>
<p>Here it is plainly taught that by consecration the Bread and Wine have become the Flesh
and Blood of Christ, and that as such they nourish our “blood and flesh” (observe the inverted
order) by undergoing a change: in other words, the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ
are changed into nourishment of our blood and flesh, by being distributed (as Cyril says)
to all our members, that is by being subjected to the natural processes of digestion and assimilation.
The unusual order of the words “our blood and flesh” is not accidental, but answers
to the process of assimilation, in which the digested food first nourishes the blood
and then the blood nourishes the flesh.</p>
<p>The meaning is, as Otto says in his note, “that the divine food passes away into our
bodies entire, so that nothing remains:” and Dr. Pusey seems to take the same view, in his
note on the words, “from which (food) through transmutation our blood and flesh are
nourished: “i.e. the material parts are changed into the substance of the human body294.”</p>
<p>Thus then, according to Cyril, the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ are distributed
to all our members; His Flesh and Blood pass by a change into our blood and flesh, and we
thereby become “of the same body and the same blood with Him295:” and “this Bread does
not pass into the belly, and is not cast out into the draught296,” but wastes away as the body
itself wastes297.</p>
<p>However much this view of the Sacramental mystery may differ from later theories, it
was certainly held by many of the Greek Fathers. Irenæus, for example, in addition to those
already mentioned, thus writes: “When therefore both the mingled cup and the created
bread receive the Word of God, and the Eucharist becomes the Body of Christ, and from
these the substance of our flesh increaseth and consisteth, how say they that the flesh is incapable
of the gift of God which is eternal life, that flesh which is nourished from the Body
and Blood of the Lord, and is already (ὑπάρχουσα) a member of Him?—even as the blessed
Paul saith, that we are members of His Body, of His Flesh, and of His Bones298.”</p>
<p>That this was also the teaching of Cyril’s contemporaries is clear from the famous passage
of Gregory of Nyssa, in which this doctrine is fully developed. It will be sufficient to quote
<note type="footnote">294 Real Presence, p. 144. See note 8, below.</note>
<note type="footnote">295 Mystag. iv. §§ 1, 3.</note>

me,—῾συναναλίσκεσθαι. It appears to me that this word can only be explained by a periphrasis. The writer
appears to me to mean that the elements are not thrown off like ordinary food, but that they become blended
or assimilated to the body, and waste away as the body wastes away.’ Mr. Field gives the same meaning.</note>
<note type="footnote">298 V. ii. § 3.</note>

<pb n="64"/>
here the latter part of the passage, in which Gregory is speaking of the Wine. “Since then
that God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this particular nourishment
also, and since the God who was manifested infused Himself into perishable humanity
for this purpose, viz. that by this communion with Deity mankind might at the same time
be deified, for this end it is that, by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates Himself in
every believer through that flesh whose substance comes from bread and wine, blending
Himself with the bodies of believers, to secure that, by this union with the immortal, man
too may be a sharer in incorruption. He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through
which He transelements the natural quality of these visible things to that immortal thing299.”</p>
<p>In another remarkable passage300 Cyril gives a further explanation of the effect of consecration:
“In the New Testament there is heavenly Bread and a Cup of salvation, sanctifying
soul and body: for as the Bread corresponds to the body, so also the Word (ὁ λόγος) is appropriate
to the soul.” With this language of Cyril we may compare further what is said by
Gregory of Nyssa in the context of the passage already quoted: “Just then, as in the case of
ourselves, as has been repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also in a kind of way
looks on a human body, for by being within this it becomes this, so in that other case the
Body into which God entered (τὸ θεοδόχον σῶμα), by partaking of the nourishment of
bread was in a certain sense the same with it, since that nourishment, as we have said, is
changed into the nature of the body: for that which is proper to all men is acknowledged
also in the case of That Flesh, namely, that That Body too was maintained by bread; which
Body also by the indwelling of God the Word was changed into the dignity of Godhead.
Rightly then do we believe that now also the bread which is sanctified by the Word of God
is changed into the Body of God the Word. For even that Body was once virtually (τῇ
δυνάμει) bread, but has been sanctified by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled
in the flesh.”</p>
<p>In this passage we have the full explanation of what Irenæus meant when he said that
the elements “by receiving the Word of God become the Eucharist,” and what Cyril meant
by saying that “as the Bread corresponds to the body, so also the Word is appropriate to the
soul.” Their common doctrine is, that besides the Body and Blood of Christ, that is, His
Humanity offered upon the Cross for our redemption, His Divine Nature, the Word is also
present, and that it is by receiving the Divine Word that the Bread is made the Body of
Christ. “The fathers,” says Touttée, “often play upon the ambiguity of the term, saying at
one time that the Divine Word, at another that the word and oracles of God nourish our
soul. Both are true. For the whole life-giving power of the Eucharist is derived from the
<note type="footnote">299 Oratio Catechetica, c. xxxvii. The whole chapter should be read with the Rev. W. Moore’s notes in this
Series, Vol. V. pp. 504–506.</note>
<note type="footnote">300 Mystag. iv. § 5.</note>

<pb n="65"/>
Divine Word united with the flesh which He assumed: and the whole benefit (fructus) of
Eucharistic eating consists in the union of our soul with the Word, by meditation on His
mysteries and words, and conformation thereto301.” O si sic omnia!</p>
<p>In this view the Bread and Wine are signs or figures of the natural Body of Christ crucified,
but they are also much more, they are endued by the Divine Word, and through the
operation of the Holy Ghost, with the life-giving power of the same Body and Blood of
Christ,—a power which being imparted to the faithful recipient makes him to be “of the
same body and the same blood with Christ,” thereby assuring him of the resurrection of the
body to eternal life, and at the same time strengthening and refreshing the soul by its being
united through faith with the Word, and being thus made “partaker of the Divine nature.”</p>
<p>This is not the language of the Western Church, whether Roman, Lutheran, or Anglican,
but it is the language of the earliest Greek Fathers, and of Cyril, as is partly and reluctantly
admitted by so cautious a writer as Dr. Waterland. After referring to the passage quoted
above from Justin Martyr (Apol. i. 66) he proceeds: “There is another the like obscure hint
in Irenæus, which may probably be best interpreted after the same way. He supposes the
elements to become Christ’s body by receiving the word (Word). He throws two considerations
into one, and does not distinguish so accurately as Origen afterwards did between the
symbolical food and the true food.” The elements, Waterland adds, “are made the representative
body of Christ; but they are at the same time, to worthy receivers, made the means of
their spiritual union with Christ Himself; which Irenæus points at in what he says of the
bread’s receiving the Logos, but should rather have said it of the communicants themselves,
as receiving the spiritual presence of Christ, in the worthy use of the sacred symbols302.”</p>
<p>Again, in c. vii., he says more explicitly of Irenæus, what is equally true of Cyril; “Least
of all does he favour the figurists or memorialists; for his doctrine runs directly counter to
them almost in every line: he asserts over and over, that Christ’s body and blood are eaten
and drunk in the Eucharist, and our bodies thereby fed; and not only so, but insured thereby
for a happy resurrection: and the reason he gives is, that our bodies are thereby made or
continued members of Christ’s body, flesh, and bones.”</p>
<p>From this view of Cyril’s doctrine concerning the Sacramental elements we can easily
understand in what sense he applies the terms “ type” and “antitype” to the Eucharistic elements.
“The Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist having two parts, an outward and an inward,
and the outward part having been instituted by our Blessed Lord with a certain relation to
the inward, and gifted with a certain significance of it, nothing is more natural than that the
<note type="footnote">301 Mystag. iv. note 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">302 Review of the Doctrine of the Eucharist, c. V.</note>

<pb n="66"/>
titles, type, antitype, symbol, figure, image, should be given to the outward part303.” Add
to this that, according to Cyril’s doctrine as already explained, the bread after the Invocation,
without ceasing to be bread, not only signifies but also is the Body, and we see how natural
it was for him to say in one passage that “His Body bore the figure of bread304,” in another
that “in the figure of bread the Body is given305.” The Body which “is given” cannot be an
absent Body of our Lord, but must be that Sacramental Body, of which Cyril goes on to say
in the same sentence that it is “distributed to our members.” Thus the Bread broken is a
type or figure of Christ’s Body as crucified for us; and by virtue of its union with the Divine
Word it becomes the life-giving Body, which makes the faithful recipient to be, in Cyril’s
words, “of the same body and same blood with Christ.”</p>
<p>Another term applied by Cyril and other Greek Fathers to the sacramental elements is
“antitype.”</p>
<p>In Mystag. ii. § 6, where Baptism is called “the counterpart (ἀντίτυπον) of Christ’s sufferings,”
the meaning is clearly explained by the context: for in § 5 the reality of Christ’s
sufferings is emphatically and repeatedly contrasted with the figurative representation of
the same; and this figurative representation no less emphatically contrasted with the real
and actual bestowal of the grace of salvation: ἐν εἰκόνι ἡ μίμησις, ἐν ἀληθείᾳ δὲ ἡ
σωτηρία,.…ἵνα τῇ μιμήσει τῶν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ κοινωνήσαντες, ἀληθείᾳ τὴν σωτηρίαν
κερδήσωμεν.</p>
<p>We have thus a clear distinction of (1) the ‘res sacramenti,’ Christ’s Death and Resurrection,
(2) the ‘sacramentum’ or ‘sign,’ the outward form of Baptism, and (3) the ‘virtus sacramenti,’
our real participation in the benefits of Christ’s Passion, “a death unto sin, and a
new birth unto righteousness.” Thus, as Cyril adds at the end of the section, Baptism “has
the fellowship by representation of Christ’s true sufferings,” it is the spiritual counterpart
in us of that which was actual in Him.</p>
<p>In Mystag. iii. § i, speaking of the Chrism, Cyril says, “Now ye have been made Christs
(Χρισοί) by receiving the antitype of the Holy Ghost, and all things have been wrought in
you by imitation, because ye are images of Christ:” and again, “there was given to you an
Unction, the antitype of that wherewith Christ was anointed, and this is the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>Here again we have (1) the ‘res sacramenti,’ the anointing of Christ with the Holy Ghost
at His Baptism, (2) the sacramental sign or figure, the anointing of the baptized, and (3) the
spiritual benefit received in the gift of the Holy Ghost, for, as Cyril adds at the end of § 3,
“while Thy body is anointed with the visible ointment, thy soul is sanctified by the Holy
and Life-giving Spirit.” In these passages we see a distinction between τύπος and ἀντίτυπος.

<pb n="67"/>
The former is simply the outward sign or figure; the latter includes with the sign the spiritual
counterpart in us of the thing signified, the benefits of Christ’s Passion in the one case, the
gift of the Holy Ghost in the other.</p>
<p>It only remains to inquire whether there is the same distinction in the meaning of the
words as applied to the Holy Eucharist.</p>
<p>In Mystag. v. § 20, Cyril informs us that during the Administration the words, “O taste
and see that the Lord is good,” were sung: and in reference to that passage he adds, “In
tasting we are bidden to taste not bread and wine, but the antitypical Body and Blood of
Christ.” To taste “the antitypical Body” is therefore to taste “that the Lord is good,” whence
it clearly follows that “the antitypical Body” is not the mere sign or figure of Christ’s own
natural Body, but the sacramental and spiritual counterpart of it, by which those who
faithfully receive it are so united to Him, that their spirit, and soul, and body, are to be preserved
entire without blame at His coming306.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Place of S. Cyril’s Lectures.</head>
<p>We have seen in a passage already quoted307 that at Milan S. Ambrose expounded the
Creed to Catechumens in the Baptistery. But whatever may have been the custom in other
places, it is certain from numerous passages in Cyril’s Lectures that they were delivered in
the great Basilica, or Church of the Resurrection, built by Constantine on the site of the
Holy Sepulchre, and consecrated, as we have seen, with great splendour in the year 335308.
In a passage309 where Cyril is speaking of the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of
Pentecost, he says, “as we discourse on Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha, so it were
most fitting that we should also speak concerning the Holy Ghost in the Upper Church; yet
since He who descended there jointly partakes of the glory of Him who was crucified here,
we here speak concerning Him also who descended there.” It appears from a passage in the
Introductory Lecture310 that it was delivered in the Church itself before the whole congregation,
after that portion of the daily Service to which Catechumens were usually admitted:
“Dost thou behold this venerable constitution of the Church? Dost thou view her order
and discipline, the reading of Scripture, the presence of the Ordained, the course of instruction?”
The same custom was retained in Jerusalem in the time of John, Cyril’s successor in
the Bishopric, who in writing to Jerome says, “The custom with us is that we deliver the
doctrine of the Holy Trinity publicly during forty days to those who are to be baptized311.”</p>
<p>The Mystagogic Lectures were delivered not in the Church, but after the conclusion of
the public Service “in the Holy Place of the Resurrection itself312,” that is, in the small Chapel
which contained the Holy Sepulchre, and to which the name “Anastasis” more properly
belonged. Happily we are not required by the purpose of this work to enter into the disputed
questions concerning the Holy Places. Whether the cave re-fashioned and adorned by
Constantine was the actual sepulchre in which our Lord’s body was laid, and whether the
present Churches occupy the same site as the Basilica and Anastasis of Constantine, are
matters still under discussion, and awaiting the result of further researches. What more
properly concerns us is to collect the chief passages in which Cyril refers to these localities,
and to try to give a fair representation of his testimony, comparing it with that of earlier or
contemporary writers.</p>
<p>Next to Eusebius, and the Bordeaux Pilgrim who visited Jerusalem in 333, Cyril is the
earliest and most important witness as to the site of Constantine’s Churches.</p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p>In Cat. xiv. § 5, he says, “It was a garden where He was crucified. For though it has now
been most highly adorned with royal gifts, yet formerly it was a garden, and the signs and
the remnants of this remain.” From this it is evident that the traces of a garden close to the
Church were still visible both to Cyril and his hearers. Twice again in § 11 he mentions the
garden, which he had most probably himself seen in its former state, before the ground was
cleared at the time of the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre in 326.</p>
<p>On this point it may be well to quote the words of Mr. Walter Besant, Honorary Secretary
of the Palestine Exploration Fund, who, in an article on “The Holy Sepulchre” in the Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities, writes as follows: “While the temple of Venus with its
foundations was being cleared away, there might have been, and most probably was present,
a Christian lad, native of Jerusalem, eleven years of age, watching the discovery, which did
as much as the great luminous cross which appeared in the sky four (? twenty-four) years
later to confirm the doubtful and strengthen the faithful, that of the rock containing the
sacred tomb. It was Cyril, afterwards Bishop of Jerusalem. One must not forget that he is
the third eye-witness who speaks of these things; that though he was a boy at the time of
the discovery, he lived in Jerusalem, and must have watched, step by step, the progress of
the great Basilica; that he was ordained before the completion and dedication of the buildings,
and that many, if not all, of his lectures were delivered in the Church of the Anastasis itself.”</p>
<p>That Cyril’s testimony concerning the Holy Places was in full accordance with the
general belief of his contemporaries is clear from the fact that he so frequently points to the
traditional sites as bearing witness to the truth of the Crucifixion and Resurrection. He
speaks of Golgotha in eight separate passages, sometimes as near to the Church in which
he and his hearers are assembled313, and sometimes as standing up above in their sight314.
In one place he asks, “Seest thou this spot of Golgotha?” and the hearers answer with a shout
of approval315. In other passages he speaks as if the Church itself was in or rather on Golgotha316,
the same Preposition (ἐν) being repeated when he mentions “Him who was crucified
thereon.”</p>
<p>In explanation of these different modes of speaking, the Benedictine Editor comments
thus317: “The Church of the Resurrection was built on part of the hill Golgotha (intra
montem G.): but the actual rock on which our Lord was crucified was not within the limits
of the Church, yet not far off, namely about “a stone’s throw,” as the author of the Jerusalem

Itinerary says. For the Church had been built on the site of the Sepulchre. Some think that
the place of Crucifixion was included in the vast area which was enclosed with colonnades
between the Sepulchre and the Basilica,…that Golgotha was midway between the Basilica
of the Crucifixion, and the Anastasis or Sepulchre. But the area in question Constantine
paved with stones, and it must therefore have been flat, as we learn from Eusebius318; Golgotha,
on the contrary, stood up high319, and moreover shewed a cleft made there at Christ’s
death320, which would either have been a hindrance to the paving or covered up by it. In
addition to this, from the doors of the Basilica there seems to have been a view of the Sacred
Tomb321. This would have been obstructed if Golgotha had been between them.”</p>
<p>The cleft in the rock of Golgotha is mentioned in a fragment of the defence made before
Maximinus in 311 or 312 by Lucian the Martyr of Antioch322: If yet you believe not, I will
also offer you the testimony of the very spot on which the thing was done. The place itself
in Jerusalem vouches for these facts, and the rock of Golgotha broken asunder under the
weight of the Cross: that cave also, which when the gates of hell were burst, gave back the
Body in newness of life.” On this passage Dr. Routh remarks that Maundrell, Journey from
Aleppo to Jerusalem, at Easter, 1697, “shews that the rock had been rent not by any instrument,
but by the force of an earthquake. Also it is related by Eusebius in his Theophania,
a book now recovered, that there was one cave only in this cleft of the rock.”</p>
<p>According to Eusebius in the passages of the Life of Constantine already referred to, the
Emperor first beautified the monument or sepulchre with rare columns, then paved with
finely polished stone a large area open to the sky, and enclosed on three sides with long
colonnades, and lastly erected the Church itself “at the side opposite to the cave, which was
the Eastern side.”</p>
<p>The following is the statement of the Bordeaux Pilgrim: “From thence (the Palace of
David) as you go out of the wall of Sion walking towards the gate of Neapolis, on the right
side below in the valley are walls where the house or Prætorium of Pontius Pilate was: here
our Lord was tried before His Passion. On the left hand is the little hill (monticulus) of
Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. About a stone’s throw from thence is a vault (crypta)
wherein His body was laid, and rose again on the third day. There by command of the
Emperor Constantine has now been built a Basilica, that is to say, a Church of wondrous
beauty, having at the side reservoirs (exceptoria) from which water is raised, and a bath behind

in which infants are washed (baptized).” Neapolis was the name given by Vespasian to the
ancient city of Shechem, now Nâbulus: the “porta Neapolitana” therefore was in the North
wall of Sion.</p>
<p>In reference to the passage quoted above, Mr. Aubrey Stewart says: “The narrative is
clear and connected, and it is hardly possible, for any one who knows the ground, to read
it without feeling that the Pilgrim from Bordeaux actually saw Constantine’s buildings
standing on the site now occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre323.”</p>
<p>From these earlier testimonies, compared with the several passages already quoted from
Cyril, we may safely draw the following inferences, (1) The Anastasis properly so called, or
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in which the five Mystagogic Lectures were delivered, was
built by Constantine over the cave which, according to the evidence then existing, was fully
believed to be the Burial-place of our Lord. (2) The Great Basilica, called also the Church
of the Holy Cross, in which the Catechetical Lectures were delivered, was erected on the
East of the Anastasis, and separated from it by a large open area. (3) The hill of Golgotha
(on which at a later period there was built a third Church, called the Church of Golgotha,
of Holy Calvary, or of Cranium) stood about a stone’s throw on the North side of Constantine’s
two Churches, and about equidistant from them.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Time and Arrangement of S. Cyril’s Lectures.</head>
<p>§ 1. The Year. The incidental notes of time in the Catechetical Lectures are sufficient
to determine with considerable probability the exact year in which they were delivered.</p>
<p>In Cat. xiv. 14, Cyril speaks in the Plural of the Emperors then reigning (οἱ νῦν βασιλεῖς)
as having completed the building (ἐξειργάσαντο) and embellishment of the great Church
of the Resurrection. This can only apply to the sons of Constantine, Constans and Constantius,
and as Constans died early in 350, the Lectures must have been delivered before that
year.</p>
<p>In Cat. xv. § 6, Cyril asks, “Is there at this time war between Persians and Romans, or
no?” The time thus indicated was apparently that of the campaign which ended in the disastrous
defeat of Constantius at Singara, 348, the battle being soon followed by a suspension
of hostilities324.</p>
<p>The Benedictine Editor tries to find another proof of the date of the Lectures in Cyril’s
description of the state of the Church in Cat. xv. §7: “If thou hear that Bishops advance
against Bishops, and clergy against clergy, and laity against laity, even unto blood, be not
troubled.” Touttée refers this account to the fierce dissensions which followed the Synod
of Sardica, where Athanasius and Marcellus were declared innocent and received into
communion, while the Encyclical of the dissentient Bishops, who had withdrawn to Philippopolis,
condemned them both. But it is now ascertained that the Synod of Sardica was
held not in 347, as Touttée supposed, but in 344325: and Cyril’s description may unhappily
be applied to the state of the Church at almost any time from the Council of Tyre, by which
Athanasius had been deposed in 335, until long after any date which can possibly be assigned
to Cyril’s Lectures.</p>
<p>There is a much more definite note of time in Cat. vi. § 20, where speaking of Manes
Cyril says: “The delusion began full seventy years ago.” If we may assume that the outbreak
of this heresy is to be dated from the famous disputation between Archelaus and Manes in
277326, it follows that Cyril must have made this statement in 347 or 348. And further, if
Dr. Routh327 is correct in fixing the date of the Disputation between July and December
277, the Lent in which the Lectures were delivered must have been, as Touttée decides, that
of 348, not of 347, as Tillemont had supposed.</p>

<p>§ 2. The days. It is expressly stated by Sozomen328 that “the interval called Quadragesima”
was made to consist of six weeks in Palestine, “whereas it comprised seven weeks in
Constantinople and the neighbouring provinces.”</p>
<p>It is certain the Catechetical Lectures i.–xviii. were all delivered in these six weeks, being
preceded by the Procatechesis, which was addressed to the candidates before the whole
congregation at the public Service on Sunday (§ 4). In the same context Cyril says, “Thou
hast forty days for repentance,” and again in Cat i. § 5, “Hast thou not forty days to be free
for thine own soul’s sake?” It thus appears probable that the first of the eighteen (Catechetical
Lectures was delivered on the Monday of the first week of the Fast, the forty days being
completed on the night preceding the Great Sabbath, that is to say, the night of Good Friday,
when the fast was brought to an end at a late hour.</p>
<p>With regard to the date of Cat. iv., which contains a brief preliminary statement of all
the articles of the Creed, we may obtain some evidence from an incident recorded in a letter
of Jerome329 to Pammachius. John, who had then succeeded Cyril as Bishop of Jerusalem,
had on a certain occasion discoursed on the Creed and all the doctrines of the Church in
the presence of Epiphanius and the whole congregation. Jerome, being ignorant of the peculiar
custom of the Church of Jerusalem, rebukes the supposed presumption of the Bishop,
“that a man deficient in eloquence should in one discourse in Church discuss all the doctrines
concerning the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Crucifixion, the descent into hell, the nature
of angels, the state of departed souls, the Resurrection of Christ, and of ourselves, and other
subjects.” The rebuke calls out a statement from John: “The custom among us is that for
forty days we publicly deliver the doctrine of the Holy and Adorable Trinity to those who
are to be baptized.” This being the custom at Jerusalem in Cyril’s time, we may conjecture
that Cat. iv., which corresponds closely to the description of John’s discourse, was delivered,
like that, on a Sunday before the whole congregation: and this is in fact suggested by Cyril’s
own words in § 3: “Let those here present, whose habit of mind is mature, and who have
their senses already exercised to discern good and evil, endure patiently to listen to things
fitted rather for children.” That this could not have been later than the Sunday following
that on which the Procatechesis was delivered, is shewn by the mention in the same section
of “the long interval of the days of all this holy Quadragesima,” an expression which could
not well have been used later than the second Sunday in Lent.</p>
<p>In Cat. iv. § 32, Cyril speaks of having discoursed on Baptism “the day before yesterday,”
that is, on the Friday.</p>
<p>In Cat. v. we have first a discourse on the nature of faith, and then towards the end,
between § 12 and § 13, the actual words of the Creed are for the first time recited by Cyril
<note type="footnote">328 Hist. Eccles. vii. c. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">329 Ep. 61 (al. 38). Cf. Ben. Ed. Praeloq. ad Cat. iv. pp. 49, 50.</note>

<pb n="74"/>
to the candidates alone. In the next four Lectures there are no marks of time, except that
vi., vii., viii., were delivered on successive days, as is proved by the word “yesterday”(τῇ χθὲς
ἡμέρᾳ) in vii. § 1, and viii. § 1. It thus appears probable that the five Lectures, v.–ix., belong
to the five days, Monday to Friday inclusive, of the second or third week.</p>
<p>In Cat. x. § 14 Cyril reminds his hearers that he had preached on the words after the
order of Melchizedek at the public Service on the Lord’s day. As he does not here employ
his usual phrase “yesterday,” we may infer that Cat. x. was delivered not earlier than the
Tuesday following the 4th Sunday in Lent, the Epistle for that Sunday in the Eastern Church
being Heb. vi. 13–20, which ends with the words on which Cyril had preached. The next
two Lectures followed Cat. x. immediately on successive days, Wednesday and Thursday,
the word “yesterday” recurring in xi. § 1, and xii. § 4.</p>
<p>Cat. xiii., which is occupied with the Crucifixion and Burial, seems to have followed
them immediately on the Friday: it certainly came a few days only before Cat. xiv. § 1. For
speaking there of the preceding Lecture, Cyril says, “I know the sorrow of Christ’s friends
in these past days; because, as our discourse stopped short at the Death and the Burial, and
did not tell the good tidings of the Resurrection, your mind was in suspense to hear what
you were longing for.” Now we know that Cat. xiv. was delivered on the Monday after
Passion Sunday: for the Epistle for that 5th Sunday in Lent was Heb. vi. 11–14, referring to
the Ascension330: and in § 24 Cyril says, “The grace of God so ordered it, that thou heardest
most fully concerning it, so far as our weakness allowed, yesterday on the Lord’s day, since
by the providence of divine grace the course of the Readings (ἀναγνωσμάτων) in Church
included the account of our Saviour’s going up into the heavens.”</p>
<p>In Cat. xv. there is no note of time to determine on what day it was spoken; but in § 33
Cyril speaks as if his course of teaching was to be interrupted for a little while: “If the grace
of God should permit us, the remaining Articles also of the Faith shall be in good time (κατὰ
καιρόν) declared to you.” We may therefore assign Cat. xv. to the early part of Passion
week, and the three remaining Catechetical Lectures to the week before Easter. This arrangement
seems to be confirmed by Cat. xvii. 34, where Cyril speaks of the two Lectures on the
Holy Spirit, xvi. and xvii., as “these present Lectures,” distinguishing them from “our previous
discourses.” In the same section he refers to “the fewness of the days,” and in § 20 speaks
of “the holy festival of the Passover” as being close at hand. We may therefore probably
assign xvi. and xvii. to two consecutive days in the earlier part of the week before Easter.</p>
<p>Cat. xviii. contains many indications from which we may conclude with certainty that
it was delivered either on the night of Good Friday, or in the early hours of the morning of
the “Great Sabbath.” Thus in § 17 he speaks of “the weariness caused by the prolongation
(ὑπερθέσεως) of the fast of the Preparation (Friday), and the watching.” In § 21 he calls
<note type="footnote">330 Dict. Chr. Antiq. “Lectionary,” p. 958 b.</note>

<pb n="75"/>
upon the Candidates to recite the Creed, which he had dictated to them, and which they
would be required to repeat more publicly immediately before their Baptism, as we learn
from § 32: “Concerning the holy Apostolic Faith which has been delivered to you to profess
(εἰς ἐπαγγελίαν), we have spoken through the grace of the Lord as many Lectures as was
possible in these past days of Lent.…But now the holy day of the Passover is at hand, and
ye, beloved in Christ, are to be enlightened by the washing of regeneration. Ye shall therefore
again be taught what is requisite if God so will; with how great devotion and order you must
enter in when summoned, for what purpose each of the holy mysteries of Baptism is performed,
and with what reverence and order you must go from Baptism to the holy altar of
God, and enjoy its spiritual and heavenly mysteries.” The additional instructions here
promised were to be given on the same day as the last Lecture, Cat. xviii, that is on Easter
Eve immediately before Baptism. For it was forbidden to reveal the mysteries of Baptism,
Chrism, and the Holy Eucharist to the uninitiated, and yet it was necessary that the Candidates
should not come wholly unprepared to perform what would be required of them. The
full explanation of the various ceremonies and of the doctrines implied in them was reserved
for the Mystagogic Lectures, which were to be delivered on Easter Monday and the four
following days, after the public Service, not in the great Basilica, but in the Holy Sepulchre
itself.</p>
<p>§ 3. Arrangement. The Lectures of S. Cyril have a peculiar value as being the first and
only complete example of the course of instruction given in the early centuries to Candidates
seeking admission to the full privileges of the Christian Church. “The Great Catechetical
Oration” of Gregory of Nyssa is addressed not to the learner but to the teacher, in accordance
with the opening statement of the Prologue, that “The presiding ministers of the mystery of
godliness have need of a system in their instructions, in order that the Church may be replenished
by the accession of such as should be saved, through the teaching of the word of Faith
being brought home to the hearing of unbelievers.” As an instruction to the Catechist how
he should refute the opponents of Christianity, it is an apologetic work rather than a Catechism.
S. Augustine’s treatise De catechizandis rudibus is also addressed to the teacher, being
an answer to Deogratias, a Deacon of Carthage, who on being appointed Catechist had
written to Augustine for advice as to the best method of discharging the office. S. Augustine’s
Sermons De traditione Symboli, and De redditione Symboli, are not a connected series, but
single addresses to Catechumens consisting of brief comments on a few chief articles of the
Creed. Cyril’s Lectures thus remain unique in character.</p>
<p>After the Procatechesis, which is simply an introductory exhortation to the newly admitted
Candidates, he devotes three Lectures to the need of a sincere purpose of mind, the
efficacy of repentance, and the general nature and importance of Baptism. The fourth Lecture
gives “a short summary of necessary doctrines,” stating with admirable clearness and brevity
ten chief points of the Faith, and the arguments on each point, which are to be developed

<pb n="76"/>
in the remaining Catechetical Lectures v.–xviii. He thus traverses the whole ground of
Theology as expressed in the Creed of Jerusalem, of which the exact language is given in
the titles of the successive Lectures. These instructions to the ‘Illuminandi’ (φωτιζομένων)
were followed on Easter-day by the administration of Baptism, Chrism, and Holy Communion:
and on the following days of Easter-week the ceremonies and doctrines proper to
each of these Sacraments were explained in the five Lectures on the Mysteries (Μυσταγωγίαι)
to the newly-baptized (πρὸς τοὺς Νεοφωτίστους). These Mystagogic Lectures thus form a
most important record of the Sacramental Rites and Doctrines of the Eastern Church in the
fourth Century, the most critical period of Ecclesiastical History.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The Creed of Jerusalem: Doctrine of the Holy Trinity.</head>
<p>§ 1. The Creed. The ancient Creed which was used by the Church of Jerusalem in the
middle of the fourth Century, and which Cyril expounded in his Catechetical Lectures, was
recited by him to the Catechumens at the end of the fifth Lecture, to be committed to
memory, but not to be written out on paper (§ 12). Accordingly it is not found in any of
the MSS., but instead of it the Nicene Creed with the Anathema is there inserted in Codd.
Roe, Casaub. This could only have been added after Cyril’s time, when the motives for
secrecy had ceased.</p>
<p>The Creed which Cyril really taught and expounded may be gathered from various
passages in the Lectures themselves, and especially from the Titles prefixed to them.</p>
<p>With the Creed of Jerusalem thus ascertained, it will be instructive to compare the
Nicene formula, and for this purpose we print them in parallel columns.</p>

<p>§ 2. Doctrine of the Holy Trinity. “The doctrinal position of S. Cyril is admirably described,
and his orthodoxy vindicated by Cardinal Newman in the following passage of his
Preface to the Lectures in the Library of the Fathers. “There is something very remarkable
and even startling to the reader of S. Cyril, to find in a divine of his school such a perfect
agreement, for instance as regards the doctrine of the Trinity, with those Fathers who in his
age were more famous as champions of it. Here is a writer, separated by whatsoever cause
from what, speaking historically, may be called the Athanasian School, suspicious of its adherents,
and suspected by them; yet he, when he comes to explain himself, expresses precisely
the same doctrine as that of Athanasius or Gregory, while he merely abstains from the particular
theological term in which the latter Fathers agreeably to the Nicene Council conveyed
it. Can we have a clearer proof that the difference of opinion between them was not one of
ecclesiastical and traditionary doctrine, but of practical judgment? that the Fathers at Nicæa
wisely considered that, under the circumstances, the word in question was the only symbol
which would secure the Church against the insidious heresy which was assailing it, while S.

Cyril, with Eusebius of Cæsarea, Meletius and others shrank from it, at least for a while, as
if an addition to the Creed, or a word already taken into the service of an opposite heresy,
and likely to introduce into the Church heretical notions? Their judgment, which was erroneous,
was their own; their faith was not theirs only, but shared with them by the whole
Christian world345.”</p>
<p>In regard to the doctrine of the Trinity in general the two great heresies which distracted
the Church in S. Cyril’s day were Sabellianism and Arianism, the one “confounding the
Persons,” the other “dividing the substance” of the indivisible Unity of the Godhead. Both
these opposite errors Cyril condemns with equal energy: “Do thou neither separate the Son
from the Father, nor by making a confusion believe in a Son-Fatherhood346.” Again he
says: “Our hope is in Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. We preach not three Gods: let the
Marcionites be silenced; but with the Holy Ghost through One Son we preach One God.
The Faith is indivisible; the worship inseparable. We neither separate the Holy Trinity, like
some (that is the Arians); nor do we, as Sabellius, work confusion347.” “He says not, I am
the Father, but the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father. And again He said not, I and the
Father am one, but, I and the Father are One, that we should neither separate them, nor
make a confusion of Son-Father348.”</p>
<p>In the sequel of this last passage Cyril proceeds to argue that this unity of the Father
and the Son lies in their Nature, “since God begat God,” in their Kingdom349, in their Will350,
and in their joint Creation351, thus at each step rejecting some prominent heretical tenet.</p>
<p>The question, however, of Cyril’s orthodoxy depends especially upon his supposed opposition
to the Creed of Nicæa, of which no evidence is alleged except his attendance at the
Council of Seleucia, and the absence from his Lectures of the word ὁμοούσιον.</p>
<p>The purpose of Cyril’s attendance at Seleucia was to appeal against his deposition by
Acacius, and there is apparently no evidence of his having taken part in the doctrinal discussions,
or signed the Creed of Antioch352. What is certain is that Cyril’s bitterest enemies
who refused to sit with him in the Council were Acacius and his Arian allies, who expressly

rejected both ὁμοούσιος and ὁμοιούσιος and “altogether denied the Nicene formula and
censured the Council, while the others, who were the majority, accepted the whole proceedings
of the Council, except that they complained of the word ‘Co-essential,’ as obscure, and
so open to suspicion353.” It thus appears that Cyril’s friends at Seleucia were partly those
who approved the word “ Co-essential,” and partly those of whom Athanasius speaks as
“brothers, who mean what we mean, and dispute only about the word354.” It needed in fact
the profound insight of an Athanasius to foresee that in the end that word must triumph
over all opposition, and be accepted by the Universal Church as the one true safeguard of
the Christian Faith. Meanwhile it was the standard round which debate, and strife, and
hatred, and persecution, were to rage for fifty years with unexampled fury.</p>
<p>Was Cyril to be blamed, ought he not rather to be commended, for not introducing
such a war-cry into the exposition of an ancient Creed, in which it had no place, the Creed
of his own Church, the Mother of all the Churches, whose Faith he as a youthful Presbyter
was commissioned to teach to the young Candidates for Baptism?</p>
<p>But if we compare his doctrine with that of the Nicene formula, we shall find that, as
Dr. Newman says, “His own writings are most exactly orthodox, though he does not in the
Catechetical Lectures use the word ὁμοούσιον355.”</p>
<p>The first point to be noticed in the comparison is the use of the title “Son of God.” For
this Eusebius in his Creed had substituted “Word of God.” Athanasius explains the significance
of the change: “Uniting the two titles, Scripture speaks of ‘Son’ in order to herald the
natural and true offspring of His essence (οὐσίας); and on the other hand that none may
think of the offspring as human, in again indicating His essence it calls Him Word, and
Wisdom, and Radiance, for from this we infer that the generation was impassible (ἀπαθές),
and eternal, and becoming to God356.”</p>
<p>Cyril is here in full accord with Athanasius: in his Creed he found “Son of God,” and
in his exposition he states that the Father is “by nature and in truth Father of One only, the
Only-begotten Son357:” “One they are because of the dignity pertaining to the Godhead,
since God begat God358:” “The Son then is Very God, having the Father in Himself, not
changed into the Father359.” When he says that the Son is in all things like (ὅμοιος ἐν πᾶσιν)
to Him who begat Him; begotten Life of Life, and Light of Light, Power of Power, God of

God, and the characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable (ἀπαράλλακτοι ) in the
Son360,” he is using in all good faith the very words of the orthodox Bishops at Nicæa,
“ὅμοιόν τε καὶ ἀπαράλλακτον αὐτὸν κατὰ πὰντα τῷ Πατρί361.”</p>
<p>The further significance which Athanasius ascribes to the title “Logos,” is also expressed
fully and repeatedly by Cyril: “Whenever thou hearest of God begetting, sink not down in
thought to bodily things, nor think of a corruptible generation, lest thou be guilty of impiety362.”</p>
<p>The “passionless generation,” to which so much importance was attached at Nicæa and
by Athanasius, is also asserted by Cyril when he says that God “became a Father not by
passion (οὐ πάθει Πατὴρ γενόμενος)363.” The eternal generation is most emphatically declared
again and again: the Son, he says, “began not His existence in time, but was before
all ages eternally and incomprehensibly begotten of the Father; the Wisdom, and the Power
of God, and His Righteousness personally subsisting364:” “Throughout His being (ἐξ οὗπερ
ἦν), a being by eternal generation, He holds His royal dignity, and shares His Father’s
seat365.” Believe that of One God there is One Only-begotten Son, who is before all ages
God the Word; not the uttered word diffused into the air, nor to be likened to impersonal
words; but the Word, the Son, Maker of all who partake of reason, the Word who heareth
the father, and Himself speaketh366.”</p>
<p>The importance of such language is better understood when we remember that Marcellus,
“another head of the dragon lately sprung up in Galatia367,” entirely rejected the word
“Begotten,” as implying a beginning, and “contradicting the eternity of the Logos, so distinctly
proclaimed by S. John.” An eternal generation, as stated by Athanasius and others, was to
him unimaginable. The Logos in His pre-existence was unbegotten, and could not be called
Son, but only the Logos invested with human nature was Son of God and begotten368.”
These heretical opinions of Marcellus had been condemned in several Councils within a
few years preceding Cyril’s Lectures.</p>

<pb n="82"/>
<p>The next supposed proof of Cyril’s opposition to the Nicene doctrine is that he has not
adopted in his Lectures the phrases “of the essence (οὐσίας) of the Father,” and “of one essence
(ὁμοούσιον) with the Father.” This omission is the chief ground of the reproaches
cast upon the memory of Cyril by the writers of Ecclesiastical History; for this he was described
by Jerome as an Arian, and by Rufinus as a waverer, while his formal acceptance of
the terms used at Nicæa is called by Socrates and Sozomen an act of repentance. By others
he was denounced as ᾽Αρειανόφρων because he had addressed his letter to Constantius as
“the most religious king,” and never used the word ὁμοούσιον in his Lectures.</p>
<p>We shall be better able to estimate the justice of these reproaches, if we consider first
the history of these words οὐσία and ὁμοούσιος, and the reasons which Cyril may have had
for not employing them in the instruction of youthful Candidates for Baptism.</p>
<p>It is strange to find that seven hundred years before the great controversy at Nicæa on
the introduction of the word Οὐσία into the Creed, it had been the war-cry of almost as
fierce a conflict between rival schools of philosophy.</p>
<p>“There appears,” says Plato in the person of the Eleatic stranger, “to be a sort of war of
the giants going on between them because of the dispute concerning οὐσία. Some of them
are dragging all things down from heaven and from the invisible to earth, grasping rocks
and oaks in their hands; for of all such things they lay hold, in obstinately maintaining that
what can be touched and handled alone has being (εἶναι), because they define ‘being’ and
‘body’ as one; and if any one else says that what is not a body has being, they altogether
despise him, and will hear of nothing but body….Therefore their opponents cautiously defend
themselves from above out of some invisible world, mightily contending that certain intelligible
and incorporeal ideas are the true essence (οὐσίαν)369.”</p>
<p>It is apparently to this passage of Plato that Aristotle refers in describing the ambiguity
of the word οὐσία370: “Now Οὐσία seems to belong most manifestly to bodies: wherefore
animals and plants and their parts we say are οὐσίαι, also natural bodies as fire and water
and earth and all such things, and all either parts of these, or products either of parts or the
whole, as the heaven and its parts, stars, moon, and sun. But whether these are the only
οὐσίαι or there are others also, or none of these but others of a different kind, is a matter
for inquiry. Some think that the boundaries of bodies, as a surface, and a line and a point
and a unit (μονάς), are οὐσίαι, even more so than body and solid. Further, one class of
persons thinks that besides things sensible there is no οὐσία, and another that there are
many things, and these more enduring (ἀΐδια), as Plato thinks that the ideas (εἴδη) and the
<note type="footnote">369 Plato, Sophist. § 246. “The passage is quoted by Theodoret, Græcarum affectionem Curatio, ii. p. 732.”
(Heindorf.)</note>
<note type="footnote">370 Metaph. vi. § 2.</note>

<pb n="83"/>
mathematical elements are two kinds of οὐσία, and that the οὐσία of sensible bodies is a
third.”</p>
<p>In proceeding to define the term, Aristotle says that οὐσία is used in four senses if not
more: the essential nature (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι), the universal (τὸ καθόλον) the genus, and a
fourth the subject (τὸ ὑποκείμενον). Under, this fourth sense he proceeds to discuss the
application of the term οὐσια to the matter, the form, and the resulting whole. Without
going further we may see that the use of the word in philosophy was full of difficulty and
ambiguity.</p>
<p>The ambiguity is thus expressed by Mr. Robertson371: “We may look at a concrete term
as denoting either this or that individual simply (τόδε τι), or as expressing its nature, and
so as common to more individuals than one. Now properly (πρώτως) οὐσία is only appropriate
to the former purpose. But it may be employed in a secondary sense to designate the
latter, in this sense species and genera are δεύτεραι οὐσίαι, the wider class being less truly
οὐσίαι than the former.” Perhaps the earliest use of οὐσία in Christian writings is in Justin
M.372, where he describes the Logos as “having been begotten from the Father, by His power
and will, but not by abscission (ἀποτομήν), as if the οὐσία of the Father were divided, as all
other things when divided and cut are no longer the same as before.” His example was fire,
from which other fires are kindled, while it remains undiminished and unchanged. According
to Dr. Newman373, οὐσία here means “substance, or being.”</p>
<p>In Clement of Alexandria374, οὐσία means a “nature” common to many, for he speaks
of the Gnostic Demiurge as creating an irrational soul ὁμοούσιον with the soul of the beasts;”
and again as implanting in man “something co-essential (ὁμοούσιον) with himself, inasmuch
as he is invisible and incorporeal; his essence (οὐσίαν) he called “the breath of life,” but the
thing formed (μορφωθέν) became “a living soul,” which in the prophetic Scriptures he
confesses himself to be. Again in §42 of the same Fragment, according to the Valentinians,
“the body of Jesus is co-essential (ὁμοούσιον) with the Church.”</p>
<p>So Hippolytus375 speaks of the Son Incarnate as being “at one and the same time Infinite
God and finite Man, having the nature (οὐσίαν) of each in perfection:” and again, “There
has been effected a certain inexpressible and irrefragable union of the two (the Godhead
and the Manhood) into one subsistence (ὑπόστασιν).”</p>
<p>In Origen we find the two words οὐσία (essence, or substance) and ὑπόστασις (individual
subsistence) accurately distinguished. Quoting the description of Wisdom, as being the

<pb n="84"/>
breath (ἀτμίς) of the power of God, and pure effluence (ἀπόρροια) from the glory of the
Almighty, and radiance (ἀπαύγασμα) of the Eternal Light376,” he says that “Wisdom proceeding
from Him is generated of the very substance of God,” and adds that “these comparisons
most manifestly shew that there is community of substance between Father and Son.
For an effluence appears to be ὁμοούσιος, that is, of one substance with that body from
which it is an effluence or vapour.”</p>
<p>On the other hand he writes, “We worship the Father of the Truth, and the Son who is
the Truth, being in subsistence (τῇ ὑποστάσει) two377.” On this passage Bishop Bull remarks:
“The words ὑπόστασις and οὐσία in ancient times were variously used, at least by the
Christians. That is to say, sometimes ὑπόστασις was taken by them for what we call οὐσία,
and vice versa, οὐσία for what we call ὑπόστασις: sometimes the ancients even before the
Council of Nicæa used ὑπόστασις for what we now call ‘person’ or ‘subsistence378’.” This
Bishop Bull presently explains again as “an individual thing subsisting by itself, which in
rational beings is the same as person.”</p>
<p>For examples of these interchanges of meaning, we may notice that the Synod of Antioch
(a.d. 269), in the Epistle addressed to Paul of Samosata before his deposition, speaking of
the unity of Christ’s Person, says that “He is one and the same in His οὐσίᾳ379.” On this
passage Routh remarks that “The words οὐσία and φύσις are sometimes employed by the
ancients for a personal subsistence (persona subsistente), as is plainly testified by Photius.”</p>
<p>In the earlier part380 of the same Epistle the Son is described as “being before all ages,
not in foreknowledge, but in essence and subsistence (ἐν οὐσίᾳ καὶ ὑποστάσει).”</p>
<p>The confusion arising from the uncertainty in the use of these two words is well illustrated
in the account which Athanasius381 himself gives of this same Synod of Antioch:
“They who deposed the Samosatene, took Co-essential (ὁμοούσιος) in a bodily sense, because
Paul had attempted sophistry and said, ‘Unless Christ has of man become God, it follows
that He is Co-essential with the Father; and if so, of necessity there are three essences (οὐσίαι),
one the previous essence, and the other two from it;’ and therefore guarding against this
they said with good reason, that Christ was not Co-essential (ὁμοούσιον).” Athanasius then
explains on what grounds the Bishops at Nicæa “reasonably asserted on their part, that the
Son was Co-essential.” Athanasius himself states that, in giving this explanation of the rejection
of οὐσιον by the Bishops who condemned the Samosatene, he had not their Epistle

before him382; and his statement, that Paul used the term not to express his own view, but
to refute that of the Bishops, is thought to be opposed to what Hilary says383, “Male
ὁμοούσιον Samosatenus confessus est: sed numquid melius Ariani negaverunt?”</p>
<p>That the statement of Athanasius himself is not free from difficulty is clear from the
way in which so great a Theologian as Bishop Hefele endeavours to explain it: “Athanasius
says that Paul argued in this way: If Christ is ῾Ομοούσιος with the Father, then three subsistences
(οὐσίαι) must be admitted—one first substance (the Father), and two more recent
(the Son and the Spirit); that is to say, that the Divine Substance is separated into three
parts384.” The logical subtlety of Paul was better understood by Basil the Great385: “For in
truth they who met together about Paul of Samosata found fault with the phrase, as not being
distinct; for they said that the word ὁμοούσιος gave the idea of an οὐσία and of those derived
from it, so that the title ὁμοούσιον assigned the οὐσία separately to the subjects to which it
was distributed: and this notion has some reason in the case of copper and the coins made
from it; but in the case of God the Father, and God the Son, there is no substance conceived
to be antecedent and superior to both: for to say and to think this surpasses all bounds of
impiety.”</p>
<p>The confusion arising from the uncertainty in the use of these words had been the cause
of strife throughout the Christian Church for more than twenty years before the date of
Cyril’s Lectures; and though it was declared at the Council of Alexandria (362) to be but a
controversy about words386, it had long been and long afterwards continued to be a fruitful
cause of dissension between men who, when forced to explain their meaning, were found
to be in substantial agreement. That Cyril abstained from introducing into his elementary
teaching terms so provocative of dangerous controversy, is a reason for commendation, not
for censure. But if it is alleged that he denied or doubted or failed to assert the essential
Godhead of the Son, the suspicion is unfounded and easily refuted. To the many passages
already quoted concerning the eternal generation of the Son, it will be enough to add one
single sentence which ought to dispel all doubt of his orthodoxy. “The Only-begotten Son,
together with the Holy Ghost, is partaker of the Godhead of the Father (τῆς θεότητος τῆς
Πατρικῆς κοινωνός).” The word chosen by Cyril to express the Divine Essence (θεότης)
common to the three Persons of the Godhead is at least as appropriate as οὐσία.</p>
<p>If we now look at the particular errors mentioned in the Anathema of the Nicene
Council, we shall find that every one of them is earnestly condemned by Cyril.</p>

<p>“Once He was not (῏Ην ποτε ὅτε οὐκ ἦν). This famous Arian formula is expressly rejected
in Cat. xi. § 17: “Neither let us say, There was a time when the Son was not.” The eternity
of the Son is asserted again and again, in reference, for instance, to His generation387, His
Priesthood388, and His throne389.</p>
<p>“Before His generation He was not” (πρὶν γεννηθῆναι οὐκ ἦν). Compare with this Cyril’s
repeated assertions that “the Son is eternally begotten, by an inscrutable and incomprehensible
generation390,” “the Son of God before all ages, without beginning391,” that “time intervenes
not in the generation of the Son from the Father392.”</p>
<p>“He came to be from nothing” (ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων ἐγένετο). Cyril’s language is emphatic:
“As I have often said, He did not bring forth the Son from non-existence (ἐκ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος)
into being, nor take the non-existent into Sonship393.”</p>
<p>“That He is of other subsistence or essence” (ἐξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας). It is certain
that Cyril has given no countenance to the error or errors condemned in this clause, but is
in entire agreement with the Council.</p>
<p>On the question whether ὺπόστασις and οὐσία have in this passage the same or different
meanings, see Bull, Def. Fid. Nic. II. 9, 11, p. 314 (Oxf. Ed.). Athanasius expressly states that
they are perfectly equivalent: “Subsistence (ὑπόστασις) is essence (οὐσία), and means
nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence (ὕπαρξις).” Basil distinguishes
them, and is followed by Bishop Bull, whose opinion is controverted by Mr. Robertson in
an Excursus on the meaning of the phrase, on p. 77 of his edition of Athanasius in this
Series. The student who desires to pursue the subject may consult in addition to the works
just named, and the authorities therein mentioned, Dr. Newman’s Arians of the Fourth
Century, especially chap. v. sect. i. 3, and Appendix, note iv., on “the terms οὐσία and
ὑπόστασις as used in the early Church;” Mr. Robertson’s Prolegomena, ch. ii. § 3 (2) (b);

<head>Chapter XI.—S. Cyril’s Writings.</head>
<p>§ 1. List of Works. Besides the Catechetical and Mystagogic Lectures translated in this
volume, the extant works of S. Cyril include (1) the “Letter to the Emperor Constantius
concerning the appearance at Jerusalem of a luminous Cross in the sky:” (2) “The Homily
on the Paralytic at the Pool of Bethesda:” and (3) Fragments of Sermons on the Miracle of
the water changed into wine, and on John xvi. 28, “I go to My Father.”</p>
<p>Another work attributed by some authorities to Cyril of Jerusalem and by others to
Cyril of Alexandria is a Homily De Occursu Domini, that is, On the Presentation of Christ
in the Temple, and the meeting with Symeon, called in the Greek Church ἡ ῾Υπαπαντή.</p>
<p>The other Fragments and Letters mentioned in the Benedictine Edition have no claim
to be considered genuine.</p>
<p>§ 2. Authenticity of the Lectures. The internal evidence of the time and place at which
the Lectures were delivered has been already discussed in chapters viii. and ix., and proves
beyond doubt that they must have been composed at Jerusalem in the middle of the fourth
century. At that date Cyril was the only person living in Jerusalem who is mentioned by
the Ecclesiastical Historians as an author of Catechetical Lectures: and S. Jerome, a younger
contemporary of Cyril, expressly mentions the Lectures which Cyril had written in his
youth. In fact their authenticity seems never to have been doubted before the seventeenth
century, when it was attacked with more zeal than success by two French Protestant Theologians
of strongly Calvinistic opinions, Andrew Rivet (Critic. Sacr. Lib. iii. cap. 8, Genev.
1640), and Edmund Aubertin (De Sacramento Eucharistiæ, Lib. ii. p. 422, Ed. Davent., 1654).
Their objections, which were reprinted at full length by Milles at the end of his Edition, were
directed chiefly against the Mystagogic Lectures, and rested on dogmatic rather than on
critical grounds. The argument most worthy of notice was that in a MS. of the Library of
Augsburg the Mystagogic Lectures were attributed to John, Bishop of Jerusalem. This is
admitted by Milles, who gives the title thus: Μυσταγωγικαὶ κατηχήσεις πέντε ᾽Ιωάννου
᾽Επισκόπου ῾Ιεροσολύμων, περὶ βαπτίσματος, χρίσματος, σώματος, καὶ αἵματος Χριστοῦ.</p>
<p>I do not find this Codex Augustinus mentioned elsewhere by any of the Editors under
that name: but the Augsburg MSS. were removed to Munich in 1806, and in the older
Munich MS. (Cod. Monac. i), the title of the first Mystagogic Lecture is Μυσταγωγία πρώτη
᾽Ιωάννου ἐπισκόπου ῾Ιεροσολύμων. Also in Codd. Monac. 2, Ottobon. there is added at
the end of the Title, τοῦ αὐτοῦ Κυρίλλου καὶ ᾽Ιωάννου ἐπισκόπου. That John, Cyril’s successor,
did deliver Catechetical Lectures, we know from his own correspondence with
Jerome: and this very circumstance may account for his name having been associated with,
or substituted for that of Cyril.</p>
<p>To Rivet’s objection Milles makes answer that if the mistakes of a transcriber or the
stumbling of an ignorant Librarian (imperiti Librarii cæspitationes) have in one or two MSS.

<pb n="88"/>
ascribed the Lectures to John or any one else, this cannot be set against the testimony of
those who lived nearest to the time when the Lectures were composed, as Jerome and
Theodoret. Also the internal evidence proves that the Lectures could not have been delivered
later than the middle of the fourth century, whereas John succeeded Cyril about 386.</p>
<p>Moreover it is quite impossible to assign the two sets of Lectures to different authors.
In Cat. xviii. § 33 the author promises, as we have seen, that he will fully explain the Sacramental
Mysteries in other Lectures to be given in Easter week, in the Holy Sepulchre itself,
and describes the subject of each Lecture; to which description the Mystagogic Lectures
correspond in all particulars. Other promises of future explanations are given in Cat. xiii.
§ 19, and xvi. § 26, and fulfilled in Myst. iv. § 3, and ii. § 6, and iii. § i. On the other hand
the author of Myst. i. § 9, after quoting the words, “I believe in the Father, and in the Son,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism of repentance,” adds, “Of which things I spoke
to thee at length in the former Lectures.”</p>
<p>By these and many other arguments drawn from internal evidence Touttée has shewn
convincingly that all the Lectures must have had the same author, and that he could be no
other than Cyril.</p>
<p>§ 3. Early Testimony. Under the title “Veterum Testimonia de S. Cyrillo Hierosolymitano
ejusque Scriptis,” Milles collected a large number of passages bearing on the life and writings
of S. Cyril, of which it will be sufficient to quote a few which refer expressly to his Lectures.</p>
<p>S. Jerome, in his Book of Illustrious Men, or Catalogue of Ecclesiastical Writers, composed
at Bethlehem about six years after Cyril’s death, writes in Chapter 112: “Cyril, Bishop of
Jerusalem, having been often driven out from the Church, afterwards in the reign of
Theodosius held his Bishopric undisturbed for eight years: by whom there are Catechetical
Lectures, which he composed in his youth.”</p>
<p>Theodoret, born six or seven years after the death of Cyril, in his Dialogues (p. 211 in
this Series) gives the “Testimony of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, from his fourth Catechetical
Oration concerning the ten dogmas. Of the birth from a virgin, “Believe thou this, U+0026c.”</p>
<p>Theophanes (575 circ.) Chronographia, p. 34, Ed. Paris, 1655, defends the orthodoxy of
Cyril, as follows: “It was right to avoid the word ὁμοούσιος, which at that time offended
most persons, and through the objections of the adversaries deterred those who were to be
baptized, and to explain clearly the co-essential doctrine by words of equivalent meaning:
which also the blessed Cyril has done, by expounding the Creed of Nicæa word for word,
and proclaiming Him Very God of Very God.”</p>
<p>Gelasius, Pope 492, De duabus in Christo naturis, quotes as from Gregory Nazianzen
the words of Cyril, Cat. iv. § 9: Διπλοῦς ἦν ὁ Χριστός, κ.τ.λ.</p>
<p>Leontius Byzantinus (610 circ.) Contra Nestor. et Eutychem, Lib. 1. quotes the same
passage expressly as taken “From the 4th Catechetical Oration of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem.”</p>

<pb n="89"/>
<p>Many other references to the Catecheses as the work of Cyril are given by Touttée, pp.
306–315.</p>
<p>§ 4. Editions. 1. Our earliest information concerning the Greek text and translations
of S. Cyril’s Lectures is derived from John Grodecq, Dean of Glogau in Bohemia.</p>
<p>From his statement it appears that Jacob Uchanski, Archbishop of Gnessen and Primate
of Poland, had obtained from Macedonia a version of the Catecheses in the Slavonic dialect,
and had translated it into the Polish language some years before 1560.</p>
<p>2. In that year Grodecq himself published at Vienna an edition of the Mystagogic Lectures,
thus described in the catalogue of the Imperial Library:—</p>
<p>“S. Cyril’s Mystagogic Lectures to the newly baptized, which now for the first time are
edited in Greek and Latin together, that he who doubts the Latin may have recourse to the
Greek, and he who does not understand Greek well may read the Latin, translated by John
Grodecq.”</p>
<p>Nothing more is known of this edition: Fabricius, Milles, Touttée, and Reischl, all say
that they have been unable to find any trace of it. Uchanski about this time sent to Grodecq
his Slavonic and Polish versions, in order that they might be compared with the Greek original.
The result according to Grodecq was that the fidelity of both versions was clearly
shewn, and “there could not possibly remain any doubt that these Lectures of Cyril are
perfectly genuine.”</p>
<p>Whether Uchanski’s book was written or printed is unknown, as no trace of it has
hitherto been found.</p>
<p>3. S. Cyrilli Hier. Catecheses ad Illuminandos et Mystagogicæ. Interpretatus est Joannes
Grodecius. Romæ 1564. 8°.</p>
<p>Grodecq had come to Rome in the suite of Stanislaus Hosius, Cardinal Legate at the
Council of Trent, who in the year 1562 had published in the Confession of Petricow the 4th
and part of the 3rd Mystagogic Lectures from a Greek MS. belonging to Cardinal Sirlet.
From this MS. Grodecq made his Latin translation, using also the work of Uchanski before
mentioned. The preface is dated from Trent, on the 9th of July, 1563. The translation was
published in the following year at Rome, Cologne, Antwerp, and Paris, and often elsewhere
until superseded by the new Latin Version of Touttée in the Benedictine Edition.</p>
<p>4. In the same year, 1564, the Mystagogic Lectures and Catecheses iv., vi., viii.–x., xv.,
xviii. were published at Paris by William Morel, the King’s Printer, under the following
title:</p>
<p>“S. Cyrilli Hier. Catecheses, id est institutiones ad res sacras, Græce editæ, ex bibliotheca
Henrici Memmii, cum versione Latina. Cura Guil. Morellii. Paris. G. Morel., 1564. 4°
min.”</p>
<p>The Greek text depending on de Mesme’s one MS., and that mutilated and faulty, is
said by Touttée to have many faults and omissions, but to have been nevertheless very useful

<pb n="90"/>
to him in correcting the text. The MS. itself had entirely disappeared. The Latin version,
appended to the copy in the Royal (National) Library at Paris, but not always attached to
the Greek, is said by Touttée to be a careful and elegant version, independent of Grodecq’s.</p>
<p>A copy of Morel’s Edition which formerly belonged to Du Fresne, containing various
readings in the margin from two other MSS., was lent to Touttée from the Library of S.
Geneviève (Genovef.).</p>
<p>Reischl describes the MS. as “Cod. Mesmianus (Montf. I. 185). Sec. xi.”</p>
<p>5. “S. Cyrilli H. Catecheses Græce et Latine ex interpretatione Joan. Grodecii nunc
primum editæ, ex variis bibliothecis, præcipue Vaticana, studio et opera Joan. Prevotii.
Paris. (Claude Morellus), 1608.” This was the first complete edition of the Greek text.
Prevot, a native of Bordeaux, states in the Dedication to Pope Paul V., that by the help of
MSS. “melioris notæ” found in the Vatican, he had both corrected the text of the Lectures
previously published by Morel, and carefully transcribed the rest. He made, according to
Touttée, many useful emendations, but did not mention the number, age, nor various
readings of the MSS. employed.</p>
<p>6. “S. Cyrilli Hier. Arch. opera quæ supersunt omnia; quorum quædam nunc primum
ex Codd. MSS. edidit, reliqua cum Codd. MSS. contulit, plurimis in locis emendavit, Notisque
illustravit Tho. Milles S.T.B. ex Æde Christi Oxoniæ, e Theatro Sheldoniano, Impensis
Richardi Sare Bibliopol. Lond. MDCCIII.”
The author of this fine Edition gives us in his Preface the following description of his
work:</p>
<p>“In the first place I wished to amend more thoroughly the text of J. Prevot, which, as I
said, he himself largely corrected and supplied from MSS. in the Vatican, and which I have
printed in this Edition: I have therefore compared it with all the other Editions that I could
collect, and in this manner have easily removed many errors both of the printers and of
Prevot himself. Afterwards I carefully compared all the Catecheses and the Epistle to Constantinus
with two MSS. and some with three, namely iv., vi., viii.–x., xv., xvi., xviii. The
first Codex, written on parchment apparently six hundred years ago, I found among those
MSS. which Sir Tho. Roe, our first Ambassador from King James I. to the Great Mogul,
brought from the East, and presented to the Bodleian Library. The second we owe to the
diligence of Isaac Casaubon, who collated the Catecheses and Epistle to Constantius with
a MS. which he chanced to find, I think, in some Library in France, and carefully noted all
the various readings in the margin. This copy of Casaubon’s the Right Reverend Father in
Christ, John Bishop of Norwich, very kindly lent to me out of his well-furnished Library,
and of his great love for learning did not disdain to shew the highest favour to my slight
endeavours.”</p>

<pb n="91"/>
<p>Touttée thinks that the MS. from which Casaubon drew his various readings was C.
Roe itself, or that one of the two MSS. had been copied from the other, or both from the
same.</p>
<p>7. “S. Cyrilli Arch. Hier, opera quæ exstant omnia et ejus nomine circumferuntur, ad
MSS. codices necnon ad superiores Editiones castigata, Dissertationibus et Notis illustrata,
cum nova interpretatione et copiosis indicibus. Cura et studio Domni Antonii-Augustini
Touttéi, Presbyteri et Monachi Benedictini e Congregatione S. Mauri. Paris. Typis Jac.
Vincent. 1720, fol. (Recusa Venet. 1763).”</p>
<p>Of the Greek text the Editor says, “I have collated it as carefully as I could with Grodecq’s
translation, Morel’s and Prevot’s Editions, and with MSS. to be found in this City. The
various readings of the Roman MSS. I have obtained by the help of friends: those which
Milles had collected from the English Codices I have adopted for my own use.”</p>
<p>8. “S. Cyrilli Hier. Arch. opp. quæ supersunt omnia ad libros MSS. et impressos recensuit
Notis criticis commentariis indicibusque locupletissimis illustravit Gulielm. Car. Reischl S.
Th. D. et Reg. Lycei Ambergensis Professor. Vol. I Monac. M DCCC XLVIII.”</p>
<p>The Editor says in his Preface that he has altered the Benedictine text only when the
evidence was very weighty, and has then given all the various readings in the critical notes.
The exegetical commentary was to be reserved for the 2nd Volume, but this Dr. Reischl did
not live to complete.</p>
<p>The Prolegomena contain (1) Touttée’s inordinately long “Life of Cyril,” (2) a Dissertation
on the general character and authenticity of the Catecheses, and (3) an “Apparatus
Litterarius,” to which I have been indebted.</p>
<p>Vol. ii., containing Catecheses xii.–xviii., Myst. i.–v., and the other works, genuine and
spurious, attributed to Cyril, was published by J. Rupp at Munich, 1860.</p>
<p>The MSS. used in revising the text of this, the best critical edition, will be noticed below.</p>
<p>9. An Edition of the Catecheses only was published at Jerusalem in 1867, having been
commenced in 1849 at the request of the Archbishop, Cyril II., by Dionysius Kleopas,
Principal of the Theological School of Jerusalem, and, after his death in 1861, continued by
his successor Photius Alexandrides, “Archdeacon of the Apostolic and Patriarchal See of
Jerusalem, and Principal of the Theological School.”</p>
<p>The Editor gives in the Preface an interesting account of the life of Kleopas, and of the
work which he left unfinished.</p>
<p>§ 5. Manuscripts. From the preceding account of the various Editions of S. Cyril we
may obtain the following list of authorities which have been hitherto used in revising the
Text.</p>
<p>1. Codex Sirletianus, known only by Grodecq’s Latin version, Rome, 1564. Cf. § 1. 3.</p>
<p>2. C. Mesmianus, known only in Morel’s edition, Paris, 1564. Cf. § i. 4.</p>
<p>3. Vatican MSS. used by Prevot. 1608, but not identified. Cf. § i. 5.</p>

<pb n="92"/>
<p>4. C. Roe, Bibl. Bodleian. Oxon. “Codex membranaceus in folio, ff. 223, sec. xi„ binis
columnis bene exaratus;” [ol. 271].</p>
<p>5. C. Casaubon. On this and the preceding MS. see Milles as quoted above, § i. 6.</p>
<p>6. C. Ottobonianus (1) ol. Rom. iv. membran. sec. xi. “Continet Catecheses omnes et
Epist. ad Constantium. Multas habet insignes ab editis varietates.”
C. Ottob. (2), “Chartaceus et recens est, nihil fere ab editis discrepans.”
These are the Roman MSS. mentioned by Touttée: see above, § i. 7.</p>
<p>7. C. Coislin. 227 (ol. 101). Membran. Sæc. xi. circ. “From this came many important
emendations” (Touttée, Notitia Codicum MSS.).</p>
<p>In the descriptions of the following MSS. of the National Library at Paris there is so
much discrepancy between Touttée and Reischl, that it is better to quote both.</p>
<p>8. “Catecheses xii., xiii., xiv., xv., comparavi cum Codice Reg. bibliothecæ num. 2503.
Scriptus est in bombycina charta an. 1231, quam anni notam apposuit calligraphus”
(Touttée, Not. Codd. MSS.).</p>
<p>Reischl has no notice of a MS. at all answering to this description.</p>
<p>9. Cod. Reg. alter, “ol. 1260, nunc 1824, qui S. Basilii opera complectitur, sub ejus
nomine Procatechesin continet “ (Touttée, Not. Codd. MSS.): aliter, “Cod. Reg. ol. 260,
nunc 1284, pag. 254, qui duodecimi circiter est sæculi, in quo habetur Procatechesis hæc
sub nomine S. Basilii” (Id. Monit. in Procatechesin).</p>
<p>“Cod. Reg. 467 (apud Touttéum, 1824) Fonteblandensis, chartac. fol. sec. x. Continet
sub S. Basilii nomine Orationem de Baptismo, quæ est S. Cyrilli Hier. Procatechesis. C. Reg.
Touttéi” (Reischl).</p>
<p>10. “Cod. Reg. 969 (ol. Mazarin.) Epistolarum S. Basilii. 4°. Sec. xiv. Exhibet sub n. 7
Basilii homiliam quo (sic) ostenditur Deum esse incomprehensibilem, quæ non S. Basilii, sed
Cyrilli est Procatechesis” (Reischl).
This description agrees in substance with Touttée’s.
11. C. Colbert. “Catecheses iv., vi., viii., ix., x., xv., xviii., contuli cum cod. Colbert.
Biblioth. chartaceo et recenti 4863 notato…In omnibus pene cum Morelliana editione
consentit” (Touttée, Notitia Codd. MSS.).</p>
<p>Reischl makes no mention of this MS.</p>
<p>12. C. Colbert. alter. “membran. sign. 1717, Sec. xiii. diversas Patrum homilias continet,
et Cat. xiii. exhibet sub nomine Cyrillianæ in Crucem et Porasceven homiliæ” (Touttée,
Notitia).</p>
<p>This is described by Reischl as “Cod. Reg. 771 (ol. 1717) Colbertinus. Membran. fol.
seculi xiii.–xiv.”</p>
<p>The following MSS. have been used in Editions later than the Benedictine.</p>
<p>13. “C. Monacensis I. 394 membran. fol., titulis et initialibus miniatis, f. 261 nitidissime
uncialibus minutis circiter seculo decimo in Oriente scriptus.”</p>

<pb n="93"/>
<p>This was regarded both by Reischl and by Rupp as the most important authority for the
text: it is much older than Codd. Roe, Casaub., and seems to be related to Codd. Ottobon.
Coislin.</p>
<p>C. Mon. 2 of the 16th Century is of little value.</p>
<p>14. “C. Vindobonensis, 55, membran. fol antiquissimus, sed incerto sæculo.”</p>
<p>A full account is given by Rupp in the Preface to Vol. ii. It was collated by Joseph Müller,
1848, and contains all Cyril’s Lectures, except the Procatechesis.</p>
<p>15. Codex A, found by Kleopas in the Library of the Archbishop of Cyprus, and used
as the basis of his text, sometimes stands alone in preserving the true reading.</p>
<p>§ 6. Versions. Besides the Latin Translations published with the Greek text, as mentioned
above, Reischl mentions the first three of the following:</p>
<p>(a) Les catéchèses de Sainct Cyrille. Traduit par Louis Ganey. Paris, 1564.</p>
<p>(b) Cyrill’s Schriften übersetzt und mit Anmerkungen versehen von J. Mich. Feder.

<p>(f) On Faith and the Creed. C. A. Heurtley, D.D., Margaret Professor of Divinity, and
Canon of Christ Church, Oxford. Parker, 3rd Ed., 1889. Contains, with other Treatises,
the Fourth Catechetical Lecture of S. Cyril.</p>
<p>In the present volume the translation given in the Oxford “Library of Fathers” has been
carefully revised throughout. Where it has been found necessary to depart from the Benedictine
text, the Editor has consulted the readings and critical notes of Milles, Reischl, and
Rupp, and the Jerusalem edition of Kleopas and Anaxandrides.</p>
<p>A few additions have been made to the index of Subjects: the Indices of Greek Words
and of Scripture Texts have been much enlarged, and carefully revised. For any errors which
may have escaped observation the indulgence of the critical reader will not, it is hoped, be
asked in vain.</p>

good. God is lavish in beneficence, yet He waits for each man’s genuine will: therefore the
Apostle added and said, to them that are called according to a purpose400. The honesty of
purpose makes thee called: for if thy body be here but not thy mind, it profiteth thee nothing.</p>
<p>2. Even Simon Magus once came to the Laver401: he was baptized, but was not enlightened;
and though he dipped his body in water, he enlightened not his heart with the
Spirit: his body went down and came up, but his soul was not buried with Christ, nor raised
with Him402. Now I mention the statements403 of (men’s) falls, that thou mayest not fall:
for these things happened to them by way of example, and they are written for the admonition404
of those who to this day draw near. Let none of you be found tempting His grace,
lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you405. Let none of you enter saying, Let us
see what the faithful406 are doing: let me go in and see, that I may learn what is being done.
Dost thou expect to see, and not expect to be seen? And thinkest thou, that whilst thou art
searching out what is going on, God is not searching thy heart?</p>
<p>3. A certain man in the Gospels once pried into the marriage feast407, and took an unbecoming
garment, and came in, sat down, and ate: for the bridegroom permitted it. But
when he saw them all clad in white408, he ought to have assumed a garment of the same
kind himself: whereas he partook of the like food, but was unlike them in fashion and in
purpose. The bridegroom, however, though bountiful, was not undiscerning: and in going

for their seemly behaviour), he saw a stranger not having on a wedding garment, and said
to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither? In what a colour409! With what a conscience!
What though the door-keeper forbade thee not, because of the bountifulness of the entertainer?
what though thou wert ignorant in what fashion thou shouldest come in to the
banquet?—thou didst come in, and didst see the glittering fashions of the guests: shouldest
thou not have been taught even by what was before thine eyes? Shouldest thou not have
retired in good season, that thou mightest enter in good season again? But now thou hast
come in unseasonably, to be unseasonably cast out. So he commands the servants, Bind his

around him: and cast him into the outer darkness; for he is unworthy of the wedding
torches410. Thou seest what happened to that man: make thine own condition safe.</p>

on the brightest robe of chastity. This charge I give thee, before Jesus the Bridegroom of
souls come in and see their fashions. A long notice416 is allowed thee; thou hast forty417
days for repentance: thou hast full opportunity both to put off, and wash, and to put on
and enter. But if thou persist in an evil purpose, the speaker is blameless, but thou must
not look for the grace: for the water will receive, but the Spirit will not accept thee418. If
any one is conscious of his wound, let him take the salve; if any has fallen, let him arise. Let
there be no Simon among you, no hypocrisy, no idle curiosity about the matter.</p>
<p>5. Possibly too thou art come on another pretext. It is possible that a man is wishing
to pay court to a woman, and came hither on that account419. The remark applies in like
manner to women also in their turn. A slave also perhaps wishes to please his master, and
a friend his friend. I accept this bait for the hook, and welcome thee, though thou camest
with an evil purpose, yet as one to be saved by a good hope. Perhaps thou knewest not
whither thou wert coming, nor in what kind of net thou art taken. Thou art come within
the Church’s nets420: be taken alive, flee not: for Jesus is angling for thee, not in order to
kill, but by killing to make alive: for thou must die and rise again. For thou hast heard the
Apostle say, Dead indeed unto sin, but living unto righteousness421. Die to thy sins, and live
to righteousness, live from this very day.</p>
<p>6. See, I pray thee, how great a dignity Jesus bestows on thee. Thou wert called a Catechumen,

their depth. The echo is no longer around thee, but within thee; for the indwelling Spirit423
henceforth makes thy mind a house of God. When thou shalt have heard what is written
concerning the mysteries, then wilt thou understand things which thou knewest not. And
think not that thou receivest a small thing: though a miserable man, thou receivest one of
God’s titles. Hear St. Paul saying, God is faithful424. Hear another Scripture saying, God is
faithful and just425. Foreseeing this, the Psalmist, because men are to receive a title of God,

But beware lest thou have the title of “faithful,” but the will of the faithless. Thou hast entered
into a contest, toil on through the race: another such opportunity thou canst not have427.
Were it thy wedding-day before thee, wouldest thou not have disregarded all else, and set
about the preparation for the feast? And on the eve of consecrating thy soul to the heavenly
Bridegroom, wilt thou not cease from carnal things, that thou mayest win spiritual?</p>
<p>7. We may not receive Baptism twice or thrice; else it might be said, Though I have
failed once, I shall set it right a second time: whereas if thou fail once, the thing cannot be
set right; for there is one Lord, and one faith, and one baptism428: for only the heretics are
re-baptized429, because the former was no baptism.</p>
<p>8. For God seeks nothing else from us, save a good purpose. Say not, How are my sins
blotted out? I tell thee, By willing, by believing430. What can be shorter than this? But if,
while thy lips declare thee willing, thy heart be silent, He knoweth the heart, who judgeth
thee. Cease from this day from every evil deed. Let not thy tongue speak unseemly words,
let thine eye abstain from sin, and from roving431 after things unprofitable.</p>
<p>9. Let thy feet hasten to the catechisings; receive with earnestness the exorcisms432:
whether thou be breathed upon or exorcised, the act is to thee salvation. Suppose thou hast
gold unwrought and alloyed, mixed with various substances, copper, and tin, and iron, and
lead: we seek to have the gold alone; can gold be purified from the foreign substances without
fire? Even so without exorcisms the soul cannot be purified; and these exorcisms are divine,
having been collected out of the divine Scriptures. Thy face has been veiled433, that thy
mind may henceforward be free, lest the eye by roving make the heart rove also. But when
thine eyes are veiled, thine ears are not hindered from receiving the means of salvation. For

in like manner as those who are skilled in the goldsmith’s craft throw in their breath upon
the fire through certain delicate instruments, and blowing up the gold which is hidden in
the crucible stir the flame which surrounds it, and so find what they are seeking; even so
when the exorcists inspire terror by the Spirit of God, and set the soul, as it were, on fire in
the crucible of the body, the hostile demon flees away, and there abide salvation and the
hope of eternal life, and the soul henceforth is cleansed from its sins and hath salvation.
Let us then, brethren, abide in hope, and surrender ourselves, and hope, in order that the
God of all may see our purpose, and cleanse us from our sins, and impart to us good hopes
of our estate, and grant us repentance that bringeth salvation. God hath called, and His call
is to thee.</p>
<p>10. Attend closely to the catechisings, and though we should prolong our discourse, let
not thy mind be wearied out. For thou art receiving armour against the adverse power, armour
against heresies, against Jews, and Samaritans434, and Gentiles. Thou hast many enemies;
take to thee many darts, for thou hast many to hurl them at: and thou hast need to
learn how to strike down the Greek, how to contend against heretic, against Jew and
Samaritan. And the armour is ready, and most ready the sword of the Spirit435: but thou
also must stretch forth thy right hand with good resolution, that thou mayest war the Lord’s
warfare, and overcome adverse powers, and become invincible against every heretical attempt.</p>
<p>11. Let me give thee this charge also. Study our teachings and keep them for ever.
Think not that they are the ordinary homilies436; for though they also are good and trustworthy,
yet if we should neglect them to-day we may study them to-morrow. But if the
teaching concerning the laver of regeneration delivered in a consecutive course be neglected
to-day, when shall it be made right? Suppose it is the season for planting trees: if we do not
dig, and dig deep, when else can that be planted rightly which has once been planted ill?
Suppose, pray, that the Catechising is a kind of building: if we do not bind the house together
by regular bonds in the building, lest some gap be found, and the building become unsound,
even our former labour is of no use. But stone must follow stone by course, and corner
match with corner, and by our smoothing off inequalities the building must thus rise evenly.
In like manner we are bringing to thee stones, as it were, of knowledge. Thou must hear
concerning the living God, thou must hear of Judgment, must hear of Christ, and of the
Resurrection. And many things there are to be discussed in succession, which though now
dropped one by one are afterwards to be presented in harmonious connexion. But unless

thou fit them together in the one whole, and remember what is first, and what is second,
the builder may build, but thou wilt find the building unsound.</p>
<p>12. When, therefore, the Lecture is delivered, if a Catechumen ask thee what the
teachers have said, tell nothing to him that is without437. For we deliver to thee a mystery,
and a hope of the life to come. Guard the mystery for Him who gives the reward. Let none
ever say to thee, What harm to thee, if I also know it? So too the sick ask for wine; but if it
be given at a wrong time it causes delirium, and two evils arise; the sick man dies, and the
physician is blamed. Thus is it also with the Catechumen, if he hear anything from the believer:
both the Catechumen becomes delirious (for he understands not what he has heard,
and finds fault with the thing, and scoffs at what is said), and the believer is condemned as
a traitor. But thou art now standing on the border: take heed, pray, to tell nothing out; not
that the things spoken are not worthy to be told, but because his ear is unworthy to receive.
Thou wast once thyself a Catechumen, and I described not what lay before thee. When by
experience thou hast learned how high are the matters of our teaching, then thou wilt know
that the Catechumens are not worthy to hear them.</p>
<p>13. Ye who have been enrolled are become sons and daughters of one Mother. When
ye have come in before the hour of the exorcisms, let each one of you speak things tending
to godliness: and if any of your number be not present, seek for him. If thou wert called to
a banquet, wouldest thou not wait for thy fellow guest? If thou hadst a brother, wouldest
thou not seek thy brother’s good?</p>
<p>Afterwards busy not thyself about unprofitable matters: neither, what the city has done,
nor the village, nor the King438, nor the Bishop, nor the Presbyter. Look upward; that is
what thy present hour needeth. Be still439, and know that I am God. If thou seest the believers
ministering, and shewing no care, they enjoy security, they know what they have received,
they are in possession of grace. But thou standest just now in the turn of the scale, to be
received or not: copy not those who have freedom from anxiety, but cherish fear.</p>
<p>14. And when the Exorcism has been done, until the others who are being exorcised
have come440, let men be with men, and women with women. For now I need the example

though the ark was one, and the door was shut, yet had things been suitably arranged. If
the Church is shut, and you are all inside, yet let there be a separation, men with men, and
women with women441: lest the pretext of salvation become an occasion of destruction.
Even if there be a fair pretext for sitting near each other, let passions be put away. Further,
let the men when sitting have a useful book; and let one read, and another listen: and if
there be no book, let one pray, and another speak something useful. And again let the party
of young women sit together in like manner, either singing or reading quietly, so that their
lips speak, but others’ ears catch not the sound: for I suffer not a woman to speak in the
Church442. And let the married woman also follow the same example, and pray; and let her
lips move, but her voice be unheard, that a Samuel443 may come, and thy barren soul give
birth to the salvation of “God who hath heard thy prayer;” for this is the interpretation of

remain; let the rust of the iron be rubbed off, and the true metal remain. May God sometime
shew you that night, the darkness which shines like the day, concerning which it is said, The
darkness shall not be hidden from thee, and the night shall shine as the day444. Then may
the gate of Paradise be opened to every man and every woman among you. Then may you
enjoy the Christ-bearing waters in their fragrance445. Then may you receive the name of

but since ye will not, our fathers have thought it necessary to separate you at least by these boards; for I have
heard from my elders that there were not these walls in old times.” These barriers had not yet been introduced

and Thrones and Dominions doing service, and every man of you and every woman receiving
salvation. Even now let your ears ring, as it were, with that glorious sound, when over your
salvation the angels shall chant, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins

offences; a death of sin; a new-birth of the soul; a garment of light; a holy indissoluble seal;
a chariot to heaven; the delight of Paradise; a welcome into the kingdom; the gift of adoption!
But there is a serpent by the wayside watching those who pass by: beware lest he bite thee
with unbelief. He sees so many receiving salvation, and is seeking whom he may devour449.
Thou art coming in unto the Father of Spirits, but thou art going past that serpent. How
then mayest thou pass him? Have thy feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace450;
that even if he bite, he may not hurt thee. Have faith in-dwelling, stedfast hope, a strong
sandal, that thou mayest pass the enemy, and enter the presence of thy Lord. Prepare thine
own heart for reception of doctrine, for fellowship in holy mysteries. Pray more frequently,
that God may make thee worthy of the heavenly and immortal mysteries. Cease not day
nor night: but when sleep is banished from thine eyes, then let thy mind be free for prayer.
And if thou find any shameful thought rise up in thy mind, turn to meditation upon Judgment
to remind thee of Salvation. Give thy mind wholly to study, that it may forget base
things. If thou find any one saying to thee, Art thou then going in, to descend into the water?
Has the city just now no baths? take notice that it is the dragon of the sea451 who is laying
these plots against thee. Attend not to the lips of the talker, but to God who worketh in

mayest become an heir of everlasting salvation.</p>

<head>FIRST CATECHETICAL LECTURE
of
Our Holy Father Cyril,</head>
<p>Archbishop of Jerusalem,
To those who are to be Enlightened, delivered extempore at Jerusalem, as an Introductory
Lecture to those who had come forward for Baptism458:</p>
<p>With a reading from Isaiah</p>
<p>Wash you, make you clean; put away your iniquities from your souls, from before mine eyes,
and the rest459.</p>
<p>1. Disciples of the New Testament and partakers of the mysteries of Christ, as yet by
calling only, but ere long by grace also, make you a new heart and a new spirit460, that there
may be gladness among the inhabitants of heaven: for if over one sinner that repenteth there
is joy, according to the Gospel461, how much more shall the salvation of so many souls move
the inhabitants of heaven to gladness. As ye have entered upon a good and most glorious
path, run with reverence the race of godliness. For the Only-begotten Son of God is present
here most ready to redeem you, saying, Come unto Me all that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest462. Ye that are clothed with the rough garment463 of your offences,
who are holden with the cords of your own sins, hear the voice of the Prophet saying, Wash
you, make you clean, put away your iniquities from before Mine eyes464: that the choir of
Angels may chant over you, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered465. Ye who have just lighted the torches of faith466, guard them carefully in

your hands unquenched; that He, who erewhile on this all-holy Golgotha opened Paradise
to the robber on account of his faith, may grant to you to sing the bridal song.</p>
<p>2. If any here is a slave of sin, let him promptly prepare himself through faith for the
new birth into freedom and adoption; and having put off the miserable bondage of his sins,
and taken on him the most blessed bondage of the Lord, so may he be counted worthy to
inherit the kingdom of heaven. Put off, by confession467, the old man, which waxeth corrupt
after the lusts of deceit, that ye may put on the new man, which is renewed according to
knowledge of Him that created him468. Get you the earnest of the Holy Spirit469 through
faith, that ye may be able to be received into the everlasting habitations470. Come for the
mystical Seal, that ye may be easily recognised by the Master; be ye numbered among the
holy and spiritual flock of Christ, to be set apart on His right hand, and inherit the life prepared
for you. For they to whom the rough garment471 of their sins still clings are found
on the left hand, because they came not to the grace of God which is given through Christ
at the new birth of Baptism: new birth I mean not of bodies, but the spiritual new birth of
the soul. For our bodies are begotten by parents who are seen, but our souls are begotten
anew through faith: for the Spirit bloweth where it listeth472: and then, if thou be found
worthy, thou mayest hear, Well done, good and faithful servant473, when thou art found to
have no defilement of hypocrisy in thy conscience.</p>
<p>3. For if any of those who are present should think to tempt God’s grace, he deceives
himself, and knows not its power. Keep thy soul free from hypocrisy, O man, because of
Him who searcheth hearts and reins474. For as those who are going to make a levy for war
examine the ages and the bodies of those who are taking service, so also the Lord in enlisting
souls examines their purpose: and if any has a secret hypocrisy, He rejects the man as unfit
for His true service; but if He finds one worthy, to him He readily gives His grace. He gives
not holy things to the dogs475; but where He discerns the good conscience, there He gives
the Seal of salvation, that wondrous Seal, which devils tremble at, and Angels recognise;
that the one may be driven to flight, and the others may watch around it as kindred to
themselves. Those therefore who receive this spiritual and saving Seal, have need also of

the disposition akin to it. For as a writing-reed or a dart has need of one to use it, so grace
also has need of believing minds.</p>
<p>4. Thou art receiving not a perishable but a spiritual shield. Henceforth thou art planted
in the invisible476 Paradise. Thou receivest a new name, which thou hadst not before.
Heretofore thou wast a Catechumen, but now thou wilt be called a Believer. Thou art
transplanted henceforth among the spiritual477 olive-trees, being grafted from the wild into
the good olive-tree478, from sins into righteousness, from pollutions into purity. Thou art
made partaker of the Holy Vine479. Well then, if thou abide in the Vine, thou growest as a
fruitful branch; but if thou abide not, thou wilt be consumed by the fire. Let us therefore
bear fruit worthily. God forbid that in us should be done what befell that barren fig-tree480,
that Jesus come not even now and curse us for our barrenness. But may all be able to use
that other saying, But I am like a fruitful olive-tree in the house of God: I have trusted in the
mercy of God for ever481,—an olive-tree not to be perceived by sense, but by the mind482,
and full of light. As then it is His part to plant and to water483, so it is thine to bear fruit:
it is God’s to grant grace, but thine to receive and guard it. Despise not the grace because
it is freely given, but receive and treasure it devoutly.</p>
<p>5. The present is the season of confession: confess what thou hast done in word or in
deed, by night or by day; confess in an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation484 receive
the heavenly treasure. Devote thy time to the Exorcisms: be assiduous at the Catechisings,
and remember the things that shall be spoken, for they are spoken not for thine ears only,
but that by faith thou mayest seal them up in the memory. Blot out from thy mind all
earthly485 care: for thou art running for thy soul. Thou art utterly forsaking the things of
the world: little are the things which thou art forsaking, great what the Lord is giving.
Forsake things present, and put thy trust in things to come. Hast thou run so many circles
of the years busied in vain about the world, and hast thou not forty days to be free (for
prayer486), for thine own soul’s sake? Be still487, and know that I am God, saith the Scripture.

Excuse thyself from talking many idle words: neither backbite, nor lend a willing ear to
backbiters; but rather be prompt to prayer. Shew in ascetic exercise that thy heart is
nerved488. Cleanse thy vessel, that thou mayest receive grace more abundantly. For though
remission of sins is given equally to all, the communion of the Holy Ghost is bestowed in
proportion to each man’s faith. If thou hast laboured little, thou receivest little; but if thou
hast wrought much, the reward is great. Thou art running for thyself, see to thine own interest.</p>
<p>6. If thou hast aught against any man, forgive it: thou comest here to receive forgiveness
of sins, and thou also must forgive him that hath sinned against thee. Else with what face
wilt thou say to the Lord, Forgive me my many sins, if thou hast not thyself forgiven thy
fellow-servant even his little sins. Attend diligently the Church assemblies489; not only now
when diligent attendance is required of thee by the Clergy, but also after thou hast received
the grace. For if, before thou hast received it, the practice is good, is it not also good after
the bestowal? If before thou be grafted in, it is a safe course to be watered and tended, is it
not far better after the planting? Wrestle for thine own soul, especially in such days as these.
Nourish thy soul with sacred readings; for the Lord hath prepared for thee a spiritual table;
therefore say thou also after the Psalmist, The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall lack nothing:
in a place of grass, there hath He made me rest; He hath fed me beside the waters of comfort,
He hath converted my soul490:—that Angels also may share your joy, and Christ Himself
the great High Priest, having accepted your resolve, may present you all to the Father, saying,
Behold, I and the children whom God hath given Me491. May He keep you all well-pleasing
in His sight! To whom be the glory, and the power unto the endless ages of eternity. Amen.</p>

<head>On Repentance and Remission of Sins, and Concerning the Adversary.</head>
<p>Ezekiel xviii. 20–23</p>
<p>The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall
be upon him. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. A fearful thing is sin, and the sorest disease of the soul is transgression, secretly cutting
its sinews, and becoming also the cause of eternal fire; an evil of a man’s own choosing, an
offspring of the will.492 For that we sin of our own free will the Prophet says plainly in a
certain place: Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine, wholly true: how art thou turned to bitterness,
(and become) the strange vine493? The planting was good, the fruit coming from the will is
evil; and therefore the planter is blameless, but the vine shall be burnt with fire since it was
planted for good, and bore fruit unto evil of its own will. For God, according to the
Preacher, made man upright, and they have themselves sought out many inventions494. For
we are His workmanship, says the Apostle, created unto good works, which God afore prepared,
that we should walk in them495. So then the Creator, being good, created for good works;
but the creature turned of its own free will to wickedness. Sin then is, as we have said, a
fearful evil, but not incurable; fearful for him who clings to it, but easy of cure for him who
by repentance puts it from him. For suppose that a man is holding fire in his hand; as long
as he holds fast the live coal he is sure to be burned, but should he put away the coal, he
would have cast away the flame also with it. If however any one thinks that he is not being
burned when sinning, to him the Scripture saith, Shall a man wrap up fire in his bosom, and
not burn his clothes496? For sin burns the sinews of the soul, <del>and breaks the spiritual bones
of the mind, and darkens the light of the heart497</del>.</p>
<p>2. But some one will say, What can sin be? Is it a living thing? Is it an angel? Is it a
demon? What is this which works within us? It is not an enemy, O man, that assails thee
from without, but an evil shoot growing up out of thyself. Look right on with thine eyes498,

and there is no lust. [Keep thine own, and499] seize not the things of others, and robbery
has ceased500. Remember the Judgment, and neither fornication, nor adultery, nor murder,
nor any transgression of the law shall prevail with thee. But whenever thou forgettest God,
forthwith thou beginnest to devise wickedness and to commit iniquity.</p>
<p>3. Yet thou art not the sole author of the evil, but there is also another most wicked
prompter, the devil. He indeed suggests, but does not get the mastery by force over those
who do not consent. Therefore saith the Preacher, If the spirit of him that hath power rise
up against thee, quit not thy place501. Shut thy door, and put him far from thee, and he shall
not hurt thee. But if thou indifferently admit the thought of lust, it strikes root in thee by
its suggestions, and enthrals thy mind, and drags thee down into a pit of evils.</p>
<p>But perhaps thou sayest, I am a believer, and lust does not gain the ascendant over me,
even if I think upon it frequently. Knowest thou not that a root breaks even a rock by long
persistence? Admit not the seed, since it will rend thy faith asunder: tear out the evil by
the root before it blossom, lest from being careless at the beginning thou have afterwards
to seek for axes and fire. When thine eyes begin to be diseased, get them cured in good
time, lest thou become blind, and then have to seek the physician.</p>
<p>4. The devil then is the first author of sin, and the father of the wicked: and this is the
Lord’s saying, not mine, that the devil sinneth from the beginning502: none sinned before
him. But he sinned, not as having received necessarily from nature the propensity to sin,
since then the cause of sin is traced back again to Him that made him so; but having been
created good, he has of his own free will become a devil, and received that name from his
action. For being an Archangel503 he was afterwards called a devil from his slandering:
from being a good servant of God he has become rightly named Satan; for “Satan” is interpreted
the adversary504. And this is not my teaching, but that of the inspired prophet Ezekiel:
for he takes up a lamentation over him and says, Thou wast a seal of likeness, and a crown
of beauty; in the Paradise of God wast thou born505: and soon after, Thou wast born blameless
in thy days, from the day in which thou wast created, until thine iniquities were found in thee.

perfect pattern” of earthly glory, set in a condition like that of Adam in Paradise, and, seemingly, blameless as
Adam before his fall. Cyril seems to regard the Prince of Tyre as an embodiment of Satan, because he was deified
as the object of national worship: v. 1, “Thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God.”</note>

Very rightly hath he said, were found in thee; for they were not brought in from without,
but thou didst thyself beget the evil. The cause also he mentions forthwith: Thine heart
was lifted up because of thy beauty: for the multitude of thy sins wast thou wounded, and I
did cast thee to the ground. In agreement with this the Lord says again in the Gospels: I
beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven506. Thou seest the harmony of the Old Testament
with the New. He when cast out drew many away with him. It is he that puts lusts into
them that listen to him: from him come adultery, fornication, and every kind of evil.
Through him our forefather Adam was cast out for disobedience, and exchanged a Paradise
bringing forth wondrous fruits of its own accord for the ground which bringeth forth thorns.</p>
<p>5. What then? some one will say. We have been beguiled and are lost. Is there then no
salvation left? We have fallen: Is it not possible to rise again? We have been blinded: May
we not recover our sight? We have become crippled: Can we never walk upright? In a
word, we are dead: May we not rise again? He that woke Lazarus who was four days dead
and already stank, shall He not, O man, much more easily raise thee who art alive? He who
shed His precious blood for us, shall Himself deliver us from sin. Let us not despair of
ourselves, brethren; let us not abandon ourselves to a hopeless condition. For it is a fearful
thing not to believe in a hope of repentance. For he that looks not for salvation spares not
to add evil to evil: but to him that hopes for cure, it is henceforth easy to be careful over
himself. The robber who looks not for pardon grows desperate; but, if he hopes for forgiveness,
often comes to repentance. What then, does the serpent cast its slough507, and shall
not we cast off our sin? Thorny ground also, if cultivated well, is turned into fruitful; and
is salvation to us irrecoverable? Nay rather, our nature admits of salvation, but the will also
is required.</p>
<p>6. God is loving to man, and loving in no small measure. For say not, I have committed
fornication and adultery: I have done dreadful things, and not once only, but often: will
He forgive? Will He grant pardon? Hear what the Psalmist says: How great is the multitude
of Thy goodness, O Lord508! Thine accumulated offences surpass not the multitude of God’s
mercies: thy wounds surpass not the great Physician’s skill. Only give thyself up in faith:
tell the Physician thine ailment: say thou also, like David: I said, I will confess me my sin
unto the Lord: and the same shall be done in thy case, which he says forthwith: And thou
forgavest the wickedness of my heart509.</p>
<p>7. Wouldest thou see the loving-kindness of God, O thou that art lately come to the
catechising? Wouldest thou see the loving-kindness of God, and the abundance of His long-

suffering? Hear about Adam. Adam, God’s first-formed man, transgressed: could He not
at once have brought death upon him? But see what the Lord does, in His great love towards
man. He casts him out from Paradise, for because of sin he was unworthy to live there; but
He puts him to dwell over against Paradise510: that seeing whence he had fallen, and from
what and into what a state he was brought down, he might afterwards be saved by repentance.
Cain the first-born man became his brother’s murderer, the inventor of evils, the first author
of murders, and the first envious man. Yet after slaying his brother to what is he condemned?
Groaning and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth511. How great the offence, the sentence
how light!</p>
<p>8. Even this then was truly loving-kindness in God, but little as yet in comparison with
what follows. For consider what happened in the days of Noe. The giants sinned, and much
wickedness was then spread over the earth, and because of this the flood was to come upon
them: and in the five hundredth year God utters His threatening; but in the six hundredth
He brought the flood upon the earth. Seest thou the breadth of God’s loving-kindness extending
to a hundred years? Could He not have done immediately what He did then after
the hundred years? But He extended (the time) on purpose, granting a respite for repentance.
Seest thou God’s goodness? And if the men of that time had repented, they would not have
missed the loving-kindness of God.</p>
<p>9. Come with me now to the other class, those who were saved by repentance. But
perhaps even among women some one will say, I have committed fornication, and adultery,
I have defiled my body by excesses of all kinds: is there salvation for me? Turn thine eyes,
O woman, upon Rahab, and look thou also for salvation; for if she who had been openly
and publicly a harlot was saved by repentance, is not she who on some one occasion before
receiving grace committed fornication to be saved by repentance and fasting? For inquire
how she was saved: this only she said: For your God is God in heaven and upon earth512.
Your God; for her own she did not dare to say, because of her wanton life. And if you wish
to receive Scriptural testimony of her having been saved, you have it written in the Psalms:
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me513. O the greatness
of God’s loving-kindness, making mention even of harlots in the Scriptures: nay, not simply
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon, but with the addition, among them that know

the Gentile Church.</note>

<pb n="112"/>
me. There is then in the case both of men and of women alike the salvation which is ushered
in by repentance.</p>
<p>10. Nay more, if a whole people sin, this surpasses not the loving-kindness of God.
The people made a calf, yet God ceased not from His loving-kindness. Men denied God,
but God denied not Himself514. These be thy gods, O Israel515, they said: yet again, as He
was wont, the God of Israel became their Saviour. And not only the people sinned, but also
Aaron the High Priest. For it is Moses that says: And the anger of the Lord came upon
Aaron: and I prayed for him, saith he, and God forgave him516. What then, did Moses
praying for a High Priest that sinned prevail with God, and shall not Jesus, His Only-begotten,
prevail with God when He prays for us? And if He did not hinder Aaron, because of his
offence, from entering upon the High Priesthood, will He hinder thee, who art come out
from the Gentiles, from entering into salvation? Only, O man, repent thou also in like
manner, and grace is not forbidden thee. Render thy way of life henceforth unblameable;
for God is truly loving unto man, nor can all time517 worthily tell out His loving kindness;
nay, not if all the tongues of men unite together will they be able even so to declare any
considerable part of His loving-kindness. For we tell some part of what is written concerning
His loving-kindness to men, but how much He forgave the Angels we know not: for them
also He forgives, since One alone is without sin, even Jesus who purgeth our sins. And of
them we have said enough.</p>
<p>11. But if concerning us men thou wilt have other examples also set before thee518,
come on to the blessed David, and take him for an example of repentance. Great as he was,
he fell: after his sleep, walking in the eventide on the housetop, he cast a careless look, and
felt a human passion. His sin was completed, but there died not with it his candour concerning
the confession of his fault. Nathan the Prophet came, a swift accuser, and a healer of
the wound. The Lord is wroth, he says, and thou hast sinned519. So spake the subject to the
reigning king. But David the king520 was not indignant, for he regarded not the speaker,
but God who had sent him. He was not puffed up521 by the array of soldiers standing round:
for he had seen in thought the angel-host of the Lord, and he trembled as seeing Him who

is invisible522; and to the messenger, or rather by him in answer to God who sent him, he
said, I have sinned against the Lord523. Seest thou the humility of the king? Seest thou his
confession? For had he been convicted by any one? Were many privy to the matter? The
deed was quickly done, and straightway the Prophet appeared as accuser, and the offender
confesses the fault. And because he candidly confessed, he received a most speedy cure.
For Nathan the Prophet who had uttered the threat, said immediately, The Lord also hath
put away thy sin. Thou seest the swift relenting of a merciful God. He says, however, Thou
hast greatly provoked the enemies of the Lord. Though thou hadst many enemies because
of thy righteousness, thy self-control protected thee; but now that thou hast surrendered
thy strongest armour, thine enemies are risen up, and stand ready against thee.</p>
<p>12. Thus then did the Prophet comfort him, but the blessed David, for all he heard it
said, The Lord hath put away thy sin, did not cease from repentance, king though he was,
but put on sackcloth instead of purple, and instead of a golden throne, he sat, a king, in
ashes on the ground; nay, not only sat in ashes, but also had ashes for his food, even as he
saith himself, I have eaten ashes as it were bread524. His lustful eye he wasted away with
tears saying, Every night will I wash my couch, and water my bed with my tears525. When
his officers besought him to eat bread he would not listen. He prolonged his fast unto seven
whole days. If a king thus made confession oughtest not thou, a private person, to confess?
Again, after Absalom’s insurrection, though there were many roads for him to escape, he
chose to flee by the Mount of Olives, in thought, as it were, invoking the Redeemer who was
to go up thence into the heavens526. And when Shimei cursed him bitterly, he said, Let him
alone, for he knew that “to him that forgiveth it shall be forgiven527.”</p>
<p>13. Thou seest that it is good to make confession. Thou seest that there is salvation for
them that repent. Solomon also fell but what saith he? Afterwards I repented528. Ahab,
too, the King of Samaria, became a most wicked idolater, an outrageous man, the murderer

Yet when by Jezebel’s means he had slain Naboth, and the Prophet Elias came and merely
threatened him, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth. And what saith the merciful
God to Elias? Hast than seen how Ahab is pricked in the heart before Me530? as if almost He
would persuade the fiery zeal of the Prophet to condescend to the penitent. For He saith, I
will not bring the evil in his days. And though after this forgiveness he was sure not to depart
from his wickedness, nevertheless the forgiving God forgave him, not as being ignorant of
the future, but as granting a forgiveness corresponding to his present season of repentance.
For it is the part of a righteous judge to give sentence according to each case that has occurred.</p>
<p>14. Again, Jeroboam was standing at the altar sacrificing to the idols: his hand became
withered, because he commanded the Prophet who reproved him to be seized: but having
by experience learned the power of the man before him, he says, Entreat the face of the Lord
thy God531; and because of this saying his hand was restored again. If the Prophet healed
Jeroboam, is Christ not able to heal and deliver thee from thy sins? Manasses also was utterly
wicked, who sawed Isaiah asunder532, and was defiled with all kinds of idolatries, and filled
Jerusalem with innocent blood533; but having been led captive to Babylon he used his experience
of misfortune for a healing course of repentance: for the Scripture saith that Manasses
humbled himself before the Lord, and prayed, and the Lord heard him, and brought him back
to his kingdom. If He who sawed the Prophet asunder was saved by repentance, shall not
thou then, having done no such great wickedness, be saved?</p>
<p>15. Take heed lest without reason thou mistrust the power of repentance. Wouldst
thou know what power repentance has? Wouldst thou know the strong weapon of salvation,
and learn what the force of confession is? Hezekiah by means of confession routed a hundred
and fourscore and five thousand of his enemies. A great thing verily was this, but still small
in comparison with what remains to be told: the same king by repentance obtained the recall
of a divine sentence which had already gone forth. For when he had fallen sick, Esaias said
to him, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live534. What expectation remained,
what hope of recovery, when the Prophet said, for thou shalt die? Yet Hezekiah

to him from being prolonged.” Jerome on Is. i. 10, says that he was slain because of his calling the Jews “princes

did not desist from repentance; but remembering what is written, When thou shalt turn and
lament, then shalt thou be saved535, he turned to the wall, and from his bed lifting his mind
to heaven (for thickness of walls is no hindrance to prayers sent up with devotion), he said,
“Remember me, O Lord, for it is sufficient for my healing that Thou remember me. Thou
art not subject to times, but art Thyself the giver of the law of life. For our life depends not
on a nativity, nor on a conjunction of stars, as some idly talk; but both of life and its duration.
Then art Thyself the Lawgiver according to Thy Will.” And he, who could not hope to live
because of the prophetic sentence, had fifteen years added to his life, and for the sign the
sun ran backward in his course. Well then, for Ezekias’ sake the sun turned back but for
Christ the sun was eclipsed, not retracing his steps, but suffering eclipse536, and therefore
shewing the difference between them, I mean between Ezekias and Jesus. The former prevailed
to the cancelling of God’s decree, and cannot Jesus grant remission of sins? Turn
and bewail thyself, shut thy door, and pray to be forgiven, pray that He may remove from
thee the burning flames. For confession has power to quench even fire, power to tame even

faith was there poured out as a river, and there spake they the spell against all ills542:
Righteous art Thou, O Lord, in all the things that Thou hast done to us: for we have sinned,
and transgressed Thy law543. And their repentance quelled the flames544. If thou believest

wings overshadowing the Ark (1 Kings vi. 23–26; viii. 6, 7). All these were either carried off or destroyed,
when Nebuchadnezzar took away “all the treasures of the house of the Lord” and “cut in pieces all the vessels
of gold which Solomon, King of Israel, had made in the Temple of the Lord” (2 Kings xxiv. 13; 1 Esdras i. 54; 2

vessels in the house of idols? Did he not deserve ten thousand deaths?</p>
<p>18. Thou hast seen the greatness of his evil deeds: come now to God’s loving-kindness.
He was turned into a wild beast558, he abode in the wilderness, he was scourged, that he
might be saved. He had claws as a lion559; for he was a ravager of the Sanctuary. He had a
lion’s mane: for he was a ravening and a roaring lion. He ate grass like an ox: for a brute
beast he was, not knowing Him who had given him the kingdom. His body was wet from
the dew; because after seeing the fire quenched by the dew he believed not560. And what
happened561? After this, saith he, I, Nabuchodonosor, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and
I blessed the Most High, and to Him that liveth for ever I gave praise and glory562. When,
therefore, he recognised the Most High563, and sent up these words of thankfulness to God,
and repented himself for what he had done, and recognised his own weakness, then God
gave back to him the honour of the kingdom.</p>

confession, did God give him pardon and the kingdom, and when thou repentest shall He

let him die like him for the sake of the Lord Jesus. For He who to his tears begrudged not the Apostleship, will

not give thee the remission of sins, and the kingdom of heaven, if thou live a worthy life?
The Lord is loving unto man, and swift to pardon, but slow to punish. Let no man therefore
despair of his own salvation. Peter, the chiefest and foremost of the Apostles, denied the
Lord thrice before a little maid: but he repented himself, and wept bitterly. Now weeping
shews the repentance of the heart: and therefore he not only received forgiveness for his
denial, but also held his Apostolic dignity unforfeited.</p>

and been saved, do ye also heartily make confession unto the Lord, that ye may both receive
the forgiveness of your former sins, and be counted worthy of the heavenly gift, and inherit
the heavenly kingdom with all the saints in Christ Jesus; to Whom is the glory for ever and

<p>Romans vi. 3, 4</p>
<p>Or know ye not that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
were buried therefore with Him by our baptism into death, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Rejoice, ye heavens, and let the earth be glad566, for those who are to be sprinkled
with hyssop, and cleansed with the spiritual567 hyssop, the power of Him to whom at His
Passion drink was offered on hyssop and a reed568. And while the Heavenly Powers rejoice,
let the souls that are to be united to the spiritual Bridegroom make themselves ready. For
the voice is heard of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord569. For this
is no light matter, no ordinary and indiscriminate union according to the flesh570, but the
All-searching Spirit’s election according to faith. For the inter-marriages and contracts of
the world are not made altogether with judgment: but wherever there is wealth or beauty,
there the bridegroom speedily approves: but here it is not beauty of person, but the soul’s
clear conscience; not the condemned Mammon, but the wealth of the soul in godliness.</p>
<p>2. Listen then, O ye children of righteousness, to John’s exhortation when he says, Make
straight the way of the Lord. Take away all obstacles and stumbling-blocks, that ye may walk
straight onward to eternal life. Make ready the vessels571 of the soul, cleansed by unfeigned
faith, for reception of the Holy Ghost. Begin at once to wash your robes in repentance, that
when called to the bride-chamber ye may be found clean. For the Bridegroom invites all
without distinction, because His grace is bounteous; and the cry of loud-voiced heralds assembles
them all: but the same Bridegroom afterwards separates those who have come in
to the figurative marriage. O may none of those whose names have now been enrolled hear
the words, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment572? But may

you all hear, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will
set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord573.</p>
<p>For now meanwhile thou standest outside the door: but God grant that you all may
say, The King hath brought me into His chamber574. Let my soul rejoice in the Lord: for He
hath clothed me with a garment of salvation, and a robe of gladness: He hath crowned me
with a garland as a bridegroom575, and decked me with ornaments as a bride: that the soul
of every one of you may be found not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing576; I do not
mean before you have received the grace, for how could that be? since it is for remission of
sins that ye have been called; but that, when the grace is to be given, your conscience being
found uncondemned may concur with the grace.</p>
<p>3. This is in truth a serious matter, brethren, and you must approach it with good heed.
Each one of you is about to be presented to God before tens of thousands of the Angelic
Hosts: the Holy Ghost is about to seal577 your souls: ye are to be enrolled in the army of
the Great King. Therefore make you ready, and equip yourselves, by putting on I mean,
not bright apparel578, but piety of soul with a good conscience. Regard not the Laver as
simple water, but rather regard the spiritual grace that is given with the water. For just as
the offerings brought to the heathen altars579, though simple in their nature, become defiled
by the invocation of the idols580, so contrariwise the simple water having received the invocation
of the Holy Ghost, and of Christ, and of the Father, acquires a new power of holiness.</p>
<p>4. For since man is of twofold nature, soul and body, the purification also is twofold,
the one incorporeal for the incorporeal part, and the other bodily for the body: the water
cleanses the body, and the Spirit seals the soul; that we may draw near unto God, having
our heart sprinkled by the Spirit, and our body washed with pure water581. When going

of the water of Baptism is found in the Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 43: “Look down from heaven, and sanctify
this water, and give it grace and power, that so he that is to be baptized according to the command of Thy Christ,
may be crucified with Him, and may die with Him, and be buried with Him, and may rise with him to the adoption
which is in him, that he may be dead to sin and live to righteousness.”</note>

down, therefore, into the water, think not of the bare element, but look for salvation by the
power of the Holy Ghost: for without both thou canst not possibly be made perfect582. It
is not I that say this, but the Lord Jesus Christ, who has the power in this matter: for He
saith, Except a man be born anew (and He adds the words) of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God583. Neither doth he that is baptized with water, but
not found worthy of the Spirit, receive the grace in perfection; nor if a man be virtuous in
his deeds, but receive not the seal by water, shall he enter into the kingdom of heaven. A
bold saying, but not mine, for it is Jesus who hath declared it: and here is the proof of the
statement from Holy Scripture. Cornelius was a just man, who was honoured with a vision
of Angels, and had set up his prayers and alms-deeds as a good memorial584 before God in
heaven. Peter came, and the Spirit was poured out upon them that believed, and they spake
with other tongues, and prophesied: and after the grace of the Spirit the Scripture saith that
Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ585; in order that, the soul
having been born again by faith586, the body also might by the water partake of the grace.</p>
<p>5. But if any one wishes to know why the grace is given by water and not by a different
element, let him take up the Divine Scriptures and he shall learn. For water is a grand thing,
and the noblest of the four visible elements of the world. Heaven is the dwelling-place of
Angels, but the heavens are from the waters587: the earth is the place of men, but the earth
is from the waters: and before the whole six days’ formation of the things that were made,
the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water588. The water was the beginning of the
world, and Jordan the beginning of the Gospel tidings: for Israel deliverance from Pharaoh
was through the sea, and for the world deliverance from sins by the washing of water with
the word589 of God. Where a covenant is made with any, there is water also. After the flood,
a covenant was made with Noah: a covenant for Israel from Mount Sinai, but with water,
and scarlet wool, and hyssop590. Elias is taken up, but not apart from water: for first he
crosses the Jordan, then in a chariot mounts the heaven. The high-priest is first washed,

who had not yet been purified by water pray for the rest? Also as a symbol of Baptism there
was a laver set apart within the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>6. Baptism is the end of the Old Testament, and beginning of the New. For its author
was John, than whom was none greater among them that are born of women. The end he
was of the Prophets: for all the Prophets and the law were until John591: but of the Gospel
history he was the first-fruit. For it saith, The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, U+0026c.:
John came baptising in the wilderness592. You may mention Elias the Tishbite who was
taken up into heaven, yet he is not greater than John: Enoch was translated, but he is not
greater than John: Moses was a very great lawgiver, and all the Prophets were admirable,
but not greater than John. It is not I that dare to compare Prophets with Prophets: but their
Master and ours, the Lord Jesus, declared it: Among them that are born of women there hath
not risen a greater than John593: He saith not “among them that are born of virgins,” but
of women594. The comparison is between the great servant and his fellow-servants: but the
pre-eminence and the grace of the Son is beyond comparison with servants. Seest thou how
great a man God chose as the first minister of this grace?—a man possessing nothing, and
a lover of the desert, yet no hater of mankind: who ate locusts, and winged his soul for
heaven595: feeding upon honey, and speaking things both sweeter and more salutary than
honey: clothed with a garment of camel’s hair, and shewing in himself the pattern of the
ascetic life; who also was sanctified by the Holy Ghost while yet he was carried in his
mother’s womb. Jeremiah was sanctified, but did not prophesy, in the womb596: John alone
while carried in the womb leaped for joy597, and though he saw not with the eyes of flesh,
knew his Master by the Spirit: for since the grace of Baptism was great, it required greatness
in its founder also.</p>

learn, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, how they that came out were baptized by him: confessing
their sins, it is said599. First they shewed their wounds, then he applied the remedies, and
to them that believed gave redemption from eternal fire. And if thou wilt be convinced of
this very point, that the baptism of John is a redemption from the threat of the fire, hear
how he says, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come600?
Be not then henceforth a viper, but as thou hast been formerly a viper’s brood, put off, saith
he, the slough601 of thy former sinful life. For every serpent creeps into a hole and casts its old
slough, and having rubbed off the old skin, grows young again in body. In like manner enter
thou also through the strait and narrow gate602: rub off thy former self by fasting, and drive
out that which is destroying thee. Put off the old man with his doings603, and quote that
saying in the Canticles, I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on604?</p>
<p>But there is perhaps among you some hypocrite, a man-pleaser, and one who makes a
pretence of piety, but believes not from the heart; having the hypocrisy of Simon Magus;
one who has come hither not in order to receive of the grace, but to spy out what is given:
let him also learn from John: And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees, Every
tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire605. The
Judge is inexorable; put away thine hypocrisy.</p>
<p>8. What then must you do? And what are the fruits of repentance? Let him that hath
two coats give to him that hath none606: the teacher was worthy of credit, since he was also
the first to practise what he taught: he was not ashamed to speak, for conscience hindered
not his tongue: and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. Wouldst thou enjoy the grace
of the Holy Spirit, yet judgest the poor not worthy of bodily food? Seekest thou the great
gifts, and impartest not of the small? Though thou be a publican, or a fornicator, have hope
of salvation: the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you607. Paul
also is witness, saying, Neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor the rest, shall inherit the

kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified608.
He said not, such are some of you, but such were some of you. Sin committed in the state of
ignorance is pardoned, but persistent wickedness is condemned.</p>
<p>9. Thou hast as the glory of Baptism the Son Himself, the Only-begotten of God. For
why should I speak any more of man? John was great, but what is he to the Lord? His was
a loud-sounding voice, but what in comparison with the Word? Very noble was the herald,
but what in comparison with the King? Noble was he that baptized with water, but what to
Him that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and with fire609? The Saviour baptized the Apostles
with the Holy Ghost and with fire, when suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of the
rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared
unto them cloven tongues like as of fire: and it sat upon each one of them, and they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost610.</p>
<p>10. If any man receive not Baptism, he hath not salvation; except only Martyrs, who
even without the water receive the kingdom. For when the Saviour, in redeeming the world
by His Cross, was pierced in the side, He shed forth blood and water; that men, living in
times of peace, might be baptized in water, and, in times of persecution, in their own blood.
For martyrdom also the Saviour is wont to call a baptism, saying, Can ye drink the cup which
I drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with611? And the Martyrs
confess, by being made a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men612; and thou
wilt soon confess:—but it is not yet the time for thee to hear of this.</p>
<p>11. Jesus sanctified Baptism by being Himself baptized. If the Son of God was baptized,
what godly man is he that despiseth Baptism? But He was baptized not that He might receive
remission of sins, for He was sinless; but being sinless, He was baptized, that He might give
to them that are baptized a divine and excellent grace. For since the children are partakers
of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same613, that having been made
partakers of His presence in the flesh we might be made partakers also of His Divine grace:
thus Jesus was baptized, that thereby we again by our participation might receive both salvation
and honour. According to Job, there was in the waters the dragon that draweth up
Jordan into his mouth614. Since, therefore, it was necessary to break the heads of the dragon
in pieces615, He went down and bound the strong one in the waters, that we might receive

power to tread upon serpents and scorpions616. The beast was great and terrible. No fishingvessel
was able to carry one scale of his tail617: destruction ran before him618, ravaging all
that met him. The Life encountered him, that the mouth of Death might henceforth be
stopped, and all we that are saved might say, O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is
thy victory619? The sting of death is drawn by Baptism.</p>
<p>12. For thou goest down into the water, bearing thy sins, but the invocation of grace620,
having sealed thy soul, suffereth thee not afterwards to be swallowed up by the terrible
dragon. Having gone down dead in sins, thou comest up quickened in righteousness. For
if thou hast been united with the likeness of the Saviour’s death621, thou shalt also be deemed
worthy of His Resurrection. For as Jesus took upon Him the sins of the world, and died,
that by putting sin to death He might rise again in righteousness; so thou by going down
into the water, and being in a manner buried in the waters, as He was in the rock, art raised
again walking in newness of life622.</p>
<p>13. Moreover, when thou hast been deemed worthy of the grace, He then giveth thee
strength to wrestle against the adverse powers. For as after His Baptism He was tempted
forty days (not that He was unable to gain the victory before, but because He wished to do
all things in due order and succession), so thou likewise, though not daring before thy baptism
to wrestle with the adversaries, yet after thou hast received the grace and art henceforth
confident in the armour of righteousness623, must then do battle, and preach the Gospel, if
thou wilt.</p>
<p>14. Jesus Christ was the Son of God, yet He preached not the Gospel before His Baptism.
If the Master Himself followed the right time in due order, ought we, His servants, to venture
out of order? From that time Jesus began to preach624, when the Holy Spirit had descended
upon Him in a bodily shape, like a dove625; not that Jesus might see Him first, for He knew
Him even before He came in a bodily shape, but that John, who was baptizing Him, might

behold Him. For I, saith he, knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, He
said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him,
that is He626. If thou too hast unfeigned piety, the Holy Ghost cometh down on thee also,
and a Father’s voice sounds over thee from on high—not, “This is My Son,” but, “This has
now been made My son;” for the “is” belongs to Him alone, because In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God627. To Him belongs the “is,”
since He is always the Son of God: but to thee “has now been made:” since thou hast not
the sonship by nature, but receivest it by adoption. He eternally “is;” but thou receivest the
grace by advancement.</p>
<p>15. Make ready then the vessel of thy soul, that thou mayest become a son of God, and
an heir of God, and joint-heir with Christ628; if, indeed, thou art preparing thyself that thou
mayest receive; if thou art drawing nigh in faith that thou mayest be made faithful; if of set
purpose thou art putting off the old man. For all things whatsoever thou hast done shall be
forgiven thee, whether it be fornication, or adultery, or any other such form of licentiousness.
What can be a greater sin than to crucify Christ? Yet even of this Baptism can purify. For
so spake Peter to the three thousand who came to him, to those who had crucified the Lord,
when they asked him, saying, Men and brethren, what shall we do629? For the wound is
great. Thou hast made us think of our fall, O Peter, by saying, Ye killed the Prince of Life630.
What salve is there for so great a wound? What cleansing for such foulness? What is the
salvation for such perdition? Repent, saith he, and be baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ our Lord, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost631. O unspeakable loving-kindness of God! They have no hope of being saved, and
yet they are thought worthy of the Holy Ghost. Thou seest the power of Baptism! If any of
you has crucified the Christ by blasphemous words; if any of you in ignorance has denied
Him before men; if any by wicked works has caused the doctrine to be blasphemed; let him
repent and be of good hope, for the same grace is present even now.</p>
<p>16. Be of good courage, O Jerusalem; the Lord will take away all thine iniquities632. The
Lord will wash away the filth of His sons and of His daughters by the Spirit of judgment, and
by the Spirit of burning633. He will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed

new shorn, (because of the confession of a good conscience: and further) which have all of

that came the gift of the Spirit, which notwithstanding was but begun in Baptism and completed in Confirmation.
Vid. Tertullian. de Bapt. 7, 8, supr. i. 5 fin. Hence, as in the text, Baptism may be said to be made up of two gifts,
Water, which is Christ’s blood, and the Spirit. There is no real difference between this and the ordinary way of
speaking on the subject;—Water, which conveys both gifts, is considered as a type of one especially,—conveys
both remission of sins through Christ’s blood and the grace of the Spirit, but is the type of one, viz. the blood of
Christ, as the Oil in Confirmation is of the other. And again, remission of sins is a complete gift given at once,
sanctification an increasing one. (R.W.C.) See Index, “Baptism.”</note>

<head>On the Ten638 Points of Doctrine.</head>
<p>Colossians ii. 8.</p>
<p>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
after the rudiments of the world, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive to be thought wheat, growing like the wheat
in appearance, but being detected by good judges from the taste. The devil also transfigures
himself into an angel of light639; not that he may reascend to where he was, for having made
his heart hard as an anvil640, he has henceforth a will that cannot repent; but in order that
he may envelope those who are living an Angelic life in a mist of blindness, and a pestilent
condition of unbelief. Many wolves are going about in sheeps’ clothing641, their clothing
being that of sheep, not so their claws and teeth: but clad in their soft skin, and deceiving
the innocent by their appearance, they shed upon them from their fangs the destructive
poison of ungodliness. We have need therefore of divine grace, and of a sober mind, and
of eyes that see, lest from eating tares as wheat we suffer harm from ignorance, and lest from
taking the wolf to be a sheep we become his prey, and from supposing the destroying Devil
to be a beneficent Angel we be devoured: for, as the Scripture saith, he goeth about as a
roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour642. This is the cause of the Church’s admonitions,
the cause of the present instructions, and of the lessons which are read.</p>
<p>2. For the method of godliness consists of these two things, pious doctrines, and virtuous
practice: and neither are the doctrines acceptable to God apart from good works, nor does
God accept the works which are not perfected with pious doctrines. For what profit is it,
to know well the doctrines concerning God, and yet to be a vile fornicator? And again, what

profit is it, to be nobly temperate, and an impious blasphemer? A most precious possession
therefore is the knowledge of doctrines: also there is need of a wakeful soul, since there are
many that make spoil through philosophy and vain deceit643. The Greeks on the one hand
draw men away by their smooth tongue, for honey droppeth from a harlot’s lips644: whereas
they of the Circumcision deceive those who come to them by means of the Divine Scriptures,
which they miserably misinterpret though studying them from childhood to old age645, and
growing old in ignorance. But the children of heretics, by their good words and smooth
tongue, deceive the hearts of the innocent646, disguising with the name of Christ as it were
with honey the poisoned arrows647 of their impious doctrines: concerning all of whom together
the Lord saith, Take heed lest any man mislead you648. This is the reason for the
teaching of the Creed and for expositions upon it.</p>
<p>3. But before delivering you over to the Creed649, I think it is well to make use at present
of a short summary of necessary doctrines; that the multitude of things to be spoken, and
the long interval of the days of all this holy Lent, may not cause forgetfulness in the mind
of the more simple among you; but that, having strewn some seeds now in a summary way,
we may not forget the same when afterwards more widely tilled. But let those here present
whose habit of mind is mature, and who have their senses already exercised to discern good
and evil650, endure patiently to listen to things fitted rather for children, and to an introductory
course, as it were, of milk: that at the same time both those who have need of the instruction
may be benefited, and those who have the knowledge may rekindle the remembrance
of things which they already know.</p>

say, that there is one God who is just, and another who is good652, thou mayest immediately
remember, and discern the poisoned arrow of heresy. For some have impiously dared to
divide the One God in their teaching: and some have said that one is the Creator and Lord
of the soul, and another of the body653; a doctrine at once absurd and impious. For how
can a man become the one servant of two masters, when our Lord says in the Gospels, No
man can serve two masters654? There is then One Only God, the Maker both of souls and
bodies: One the Creator of heaven and earth, the Maker of Angels and Archangels: of many

His patient endurance, being crowned as it were by God after His Passion; but throughout
His being,—a being by eternal generation673,—He holds His royal dignity, and shares the
Father’s seat, being God and Wisdom and Power, as hath been said; reigning together with
the Father, and creating all things for the Father, yet lacking nothing in the dignity of Godhead,
and knowing Him that hath begotten Him, even as He is known of Him that hath
begotten; and to speak briefly, remember thou what is written in the Gospels, that none
knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any the Father save the Son674.</p>
<p>8. Further, do thou neither separate675 the Son from the Father, nor by making a confusion
believe in a Son-Fatherhood676; but believe that of One God there is One Only-begotten
Son, who is before all ages God the Word; not the uttered677 word diffused into the

<p>Concerning His Birth of the Virgin.</p>
<p>9. Believe then that this Only-begotten Son of God for our sins came down from
heaven upon earth, and took upon Him this human nature of like passions679 with us, and
was begotten of the Holy Virgin and of the Holy Ghost, and was made Man, not in seeming
and mere show680, but in truth; nor yet by passing through the Virgin as through a channel681;
but was of her made truly flesh, [and truly nourished with milk682], and did truly
eat as we do, and truly drink as we do. For if the Incarnation was a phantom, salvation is a
phantom also. The Christ was of two natures, Man in what was seen, but God in what was
not seen; as Man truly eating like us, for He had the like feeling of the flesh with us; but as
God feeding the five thousand from five loaves; as Man truly dying, but as God raising him
that had been dead four days; truly sleeping in the ship as Man, and walking upon the waters
as God.</p>
<p>Of the Cross.</p>
<p>10. He was truly crucified for our sins. For if thou wouldest deny it, the place refutes
thee visibly, this blessed Golgotha683, in which we are now assembled for the sake of Him
who was here crucified; and the whole world has since been filled with pieces of the wood
of the Cross684. But He was crucified not for sins of His own, but that we might be delivered

yet He was acknowledged by the Creation as God: for when the sun saw his Lord dishonoured,
he grew dim and trembled, not enduring the sight.</p>
<p>Of His Burial.</p>
<p>11. He was truly laid as Man in a tomb of rock; but rocks were rent asunder by terror
because of Him. He went down into the regions beneath the earth, that thence also He
might redeem the righteous685. For, tell me, couldst thou wish the living only to enjoy His
grace, and that, though most of them are unholy; and not wish those who from Adam had
for a long while been imprisoned to have now gained their liberty? Esaias the Prophet
proclaimed with loud voice so many things concerning Him; wouldst thou not wish that
the King should go down and redeem His herald? David was there, and Samuel, and all the
Prophets686, John himself also, who by his messengers said, Art thou He that should come,
or look we for another687? Wouldst thou not wish that He should descend and redeem such
as these?</p>

<p>12. But He who descended into the regions beneath the earth came up again; and Jesus,

not Christ then risen from the earth on the third day? Is a dead man raised to life on
touching the bones of Elisha, and is it not much easier for the Maker of mankind to be raised
by the power of the Father? Well then, He truly rose, and after He had risen was seen again
of the disciples: and twelve disciples were witnesses of His Resurrection, who bare witness
not in pleasing words, but contended even unto torture and death for the truth of the Resurrection.
What then, shall every word be established at the mouth of two of three witnesses688,
according to the Scripture, and, though twelve bear witness to the Resurrection of Christ,

<p>13. But when Jesus had finished His course of patient endurance, and had redeemed
mankind from their sins, He ascended again into the heavens, a cloud receiving Him up:
and as He went up Angels were beside Him, and Apostles were beholding. But if any man
disbelieves the words which I speak, let him believe the actual power of the things now seen.
All kings when they die have their power extinguished with their life: but Christ crucified
is worshipped by the whole world. We proclaim The Crucified, and the devils tremble now.
Many have been crucified at various times; but of what other who was crucified did the invocation
ever drive the devils away?</p>
<p>14. Let us, therefore, not be ashamed of the Cross of Christ; but though another hide
it, do thou openly seal it upon thy forehead, that the devils may behold the royal sign and
flee trembling far away689. Make then this sign at eating and drinking, at sitting, at lying
down, at rising up, at speaking, at walking: in a word, at every act690. For He who was here
crucified is in heaven above. If after being crucified and buried He had remained in the
tomb, we should have had cause to be ashamed; but, in fact, He who was crucified on Golgotha
here, has ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives on the East. For after having
gone down hence into Hades, and come up again to us, He ascended again from us into
heaven, His Father addressing Him, and saying, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool691.</p>

together698” is honoured with the glory of the Godhead: of Whom also thrones, and

<p>Of the Soul.</p>
<p>18. Next to the knowledge of this venerable and glorious and all-holy Faith, learn further
what thou thyself art: that as man thou art of a two-fold nature, consisting of soul and body;
and that, as was said a short time ago, the same God is the Creator both of soul and body703.
Know also that thou hast a soul self-governed, the noblest work of God, made after the image
of its Creator704: immortal because of God that gives it immortality; a living being, rational,
imperishable, because of Him that bestowed these gifts: having free power to do what it
willeth705. For it is not according to thy nativity that thou sinnest, nor is it by the power of
chance that thou committest fornication, nor, as some idly talk, do the conjunctions of the
stars compel thee to give thyself to wantonness706. Why dost thou shrink from confessing
thine own evil deeds, and ascribe the blame to the innocent stars? Give no more heed, pray,
to astrologers; for of these the divine Scripture saith, Let the stargazers of the heaven stand
up and save thee, and what follows: Behold, they all shall be consumed as stubble on the fire,
and shall not deliver their soul from the flame707.</p>
<p>19. And learn this also, that the soul, before it came into this world, had committed no
sin708, but having come in sinless, we now sin of our free-will. Listen not, I pray thee, to

land: but if ye be not willing, neither hearken unto Me, the sword shall devour you, U+0026c.710:
and again, As ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto
iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification711.
Remember also the Scripture, which saith, Even as they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge712: and, That which may be known of God is manifestin them713; and again, their
eyes they have closed714. Also remember how God again accuseth them, and saith, Yet I

<p>Of the Body.</p>
<p>22. Thou hast learned, beloved, the nature of the soul, as far as there is time at present:
now do thy best to receive the doctrine of the body also. Suffer none of those who say that
this body is no work of God718: for they who believe that the body is independent of God,
and that the soul dwells in it as in a strange vessel, readily abuse it to fornication719. And
yet what fault have they found in this wonderful body? For what is lacking in comeliness?
And what in its structure is not full of skill? Ought they not to have observed the luminous
construction of the eyes? And how the ears being set obliquely receive the sound unhindered?
And how the smell is able to distinguish scents, and to perceive exhalations?
And how the tongue ministers to two purposes, the sense of taste, and the power of speech?
How the lungs placed out of sight are unceasing in their respiration of the air? Who imparted
the incessant pulsation of the heart? Who made the distribution into so many veins and
arteries? Who skilfully knitted together the bones with the sinews? Who assigned a part
of the food to our substance, and separated a part for decent secretion, and hid away the
unseemly members in more seemly places? Who when the human race must have died out,
rendered it by a simple intercourse perpetual?</p>
<p>23. Tell me not that the body is a cause of sin720. For if the body is a cause of sin, why
does not a dead body sin? Put a sword in the right hand of one just dead, and no murder
takes place. Let beauties of every kind pass before a youth just dead, and no impure desire
arises. Why? Because the body sins not of itself, but the soul through the body. The body
is an instrument, and, as it were, a garment and robe of the soul: and if by this latter it be
given over to fornication, it becomes defiled: but if it dwell with a holy soul, it becomes a
temple of the Holy Ghost. It is not I that say this, but the Apostle Paul hath said, Know ye
not, that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you721? Be tender, therefore,
of thy body as being a temple of the Holy Ghost. Pollute not thy flesh in fornication: defile
not this thy fairest robe: and if ever thou hast defiled it, now cleanse it by repentance: get
thyself washed, while time permits.</p>

henceforth in the Angelic books for thy profession of chastity, see that thou be not blotted
out again for thy practice of fornication.</p>
<p>25. Nor again, on the other hand, in maintaining thy chastity be thou puffed up against
those who walk in the humbler path of matrimony. For as the Apostle saith, Let marriage
be had in honour among all, and let the bed be undefiled724. Thou too who retainest thy
chastity, wast thou not begotten of those who had married? Because thou hast a possession
of gold, do not on that account reprobate the silver. But let those also be of good cheer, who
being married use marriage lawfully; who make a marriage according to God’s ordinance,
and not of wantonness for the sake of unbounded license; who recognise seasons of abstinence,
that they may give themselves unto prayer725; who in our assemblies bring clean bodies

marriages is in striking contrast with the passionate vehemence of Tertullian in the treatise de Monogamia, and
elsewhere. Aug. de Hæresibus, cc. 26, 38, reckons the condemnation of second marriage among the heretical
doctrines of the Montanists and Cathari. In the treatise de Bono Viduitatis, c. 6, he argues that a second marriage</note>

permissible to enter upon a second marriage, that the weak may not fall into fornication.
For it is good for them, saith the Apostle, if they abide even as I. But if they have not continency,
let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn727. But let all the other practices
be banished afar, fornication, adultery, and every kind of licentiousness: and let the body
be kept pure for the Lord, that the Lord also may have respect unto the body. And let the
body be nourished with food, that it may live, and serve without hindrance; not, however,
that it may be given up to luxuries.</p>
<p>Concerning Meats.</p>
<p>27. And concerning food let these be your ordinances, since in regard to meats also
many stumble. For some deal indifferently with things offered to idols728, while others
discipline themselves, but condemn those that eat: and in different ways men’s souls are
defiled in the matter of meats, from ignorance of the useful reasons for eating and not eating.
For we fast by abstaining from wine and flesh, not because we abhor them as abominations,
but because we look for our reward; that having scorned things sensible, we may enjoy a
spiritual and intellectual feast; and that having now sown in tears we may reap in joy729 in
the world to come. Despise not therefore them that eat, and because of the weakness of
their bodies partake of food: nor yet blame these who use a little wine for their stomach’s
sake and their often infirmities730: and neither condemn the men as sinners, nor abhor the
flesh as strange food; for the Apostle knows some of this sort, when he says: forbidding to
marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with
thanksgiving by them that believe731. In abstaining then from these things, abstain not as
from things abominable732, else thou hast no reward: but as being good things disregard
them for the sake of the better spiritual things set before thee.</p>

epistle to all the Gentiles, that they should abstain first from things offered to idols, and then
from blood also and from things strangled733. For many men being of savage nature, and

For tell me; a hundred years ago or more, think where wast thou thyself: and from what a
most minute and mean substance thou art come to so great a stature, and so much dignity
of beauty735. What then? Cannot He who brought the non-existent into being, raise up
again that which already exists and has decayed736? He who raises the corn, which is sown
for our sakes, as year by year it dies,—will He have difficulty in raising us up, for whose
sakes that corn also has been raised737? Seest thou how the trees stand now for many months
without either fruit or leaves: but when the winter is past they spring up whole into life

again as if from the dead738: shall not we much rather and more easily return to life? The
rod of Moses was transformed by the will of God into the unfamiliar nature of a serpent:
and cannot a man, who has fallen into death, be restored to himself again?</p>
<p>31. Heed not those who say that this body is not raised; for it is raised: and Esaias is
witness, when he says: The dead shall arise, and they that are in the tombs shall awake739:
and according to Daniel, Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to
everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame740. But though to rise again is common to
all men, yet the resurrection is not alike to all: for the bodies received by us all are eternal,
but not like bodies by all: for the just receive them, that through eternity they may join the
Choirs of Angels; but the sinners, that they may endure for ever the torment of their sins.</p>

<p>32. For this cause the Lord, preventing us according to His loving-kindness, has granted

eternal life. But as we have spoken sufficiently concerning the Laver the day before yesterday,

<p>Of the Divine Scriptures.</p>

teach us. For the God of the two Testaments is One, Who in the Old Testament foretold
the Christ Who appeared in the New; Who by the Law and the Prophets led us to Christ’s
school. For before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, and, the law hath been
our tutor to bring us unto Christ742. And if ever thou hear any of the heretics speaking evil
of the Law or the Prophets, answer in the sound of the Saviour’s voice, saying, Jesus came
not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it743. Learn also diligently, and from the Church, what
are the books of the Old Testament, and what those of the New. And, pray, read none of

the apocryphal writings744: for why dost thou, who knowest not those which are acknowledged
among all, trouble thyself in vain about those which are disputed? Read the Divine
Scriptures, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, these that have been translated by
the Seventy-two Interpreters745.</p>
<p>34. For after the death of Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, and the division of
his kingdom into four principalities, into Babylonia, and Macedonia, and Asia, and Egypt,
one of those who reigned over Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus, being a king very fond of
learning, while collecting the books that were in every place, heard from Demetrius Phalereus,
the curator of his library, of the Divine Scriptures of the Law and the Prophets, and judged
it much nobler, not to get the books from the possessors by force against their will, but
rather to propitiate them by gifts and friendship; and knowing that what is extorted is often
adulterated, being given unwillingly, while that which is willingly supplied is freely given
with all sincerity, he sent to Eleazar, who was then High Priest, a great many gifts for the
Temple here at Jerusalem, and caused him to send him six interpreters from each of the
twelve tribes of Israel for the translation746. Then, further, to make experiment whether
<note type="footnote">744 τῶν ἀποκρύφων. The sense in which Cyril uses this term may be learned from Rufinus (Expositio Symboli,
§ 38), who distinguishes three classes of books: (1) The Canonical Books of the Old and New Testaments, which
alone are to be used in proof of doctrine; (2) Ecclesiastical, which may be read in Churches, including Wisdom,
Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the Books of the Maccabees, in the Old Testament, and The Shepherd of Hermas,
and The Two Ways in the New Testament; (3) The other writings they called “Apocryphal,” which they would
not have read in Churches. The distinction is useful, though the second class is not complete.</note>
<note type="footnote">745 The original source of this account of the Septuagint version is a letter purporting to have been written
by Aristeas, or Aristæus, a confidential minister of Ptolemy Philadelphus, to his brother Philocrates. Though
the letter is not regarded as genuine its statements are in part admitted to be true, being confirmed by a fragment,
preserved by Eusebius (Præparatio Evangelica, ix. 6.), of a work of Aristobulus, a Jewish philosopher who wrote
in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor, 181–146, b.c. Upon these testimonies it is generally admitted that “the
whole Law,” i.e. the Pentateuch was translated into Greek at Alexandria in the reign either of Ptolemy Soter
(323–285, b.c.), or of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus (285–247, b.c.), under the direction of Demetrius Phalereus,
curator of the King’s library.</note>
<note type="footnote">746 Up to this point Cyril’s account is based upon the statements of the Pseudo-Aristeas. The fabulous incidents
which follow, concerning the separate cells, the completion of the whole version by each translator, the miraculous
agreement in the very words, proving a Divine inspiration, are found in Philo Judæus, Life of Moses, II. 7.
Josephus, Antiquities, XII. c. ii. 3–14, following the letter of Aristeas, gives long descriptions of the magnificent
presents sent by Philadelphus to Jerusalem, and of his splendid hospitality to the translators, but makes no allusion
to the separate cells or miraculous agreement. On the contrary he represents the 72 interpreters as meeting together
for consultation, agreeing on the text to be adopted, and completing their joint labours in 72 days. The
slightest comparison of the Version with the original Hebrew must convince any reasonable person that the
idea of divine inspiration or supernatural assistance, borrowed by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, and other Fathers,</note>

<pb n="145"/>
the books were Divine or not, he took precaution that those who had been sent should not
combine among themselves, by assigning to each of the interpreters who had come his
separate chamber in the island called Pharos, which lies over against Alexandria, and committed
to each the whole Scriptures to translate. And when they had fulfilled the task in
seventy-two days, he brought together all their translations, which they had made in different
chambers without sending them one to another, and found that they agreed not only in the
sense but even in words. For the process was no word-craft, nor contrivance of human
devices: but the translation of the Divine Scriptures, spoken by the Holy Ghost, was of the
Holy Ghost accomplished.</p>
<p>35. Of these read the two and twenty books, but have nothing to do with the apocryphal
writings. Study earnestly these only which we read openly in the Church. Far wiser and
more pious than thyself were the Apostles, and the bishops of old time, the presidents of
the Church who handed down these books. Being therefore a child of the Church, trench747
thou not upon its statutes. And of the Old Testament, as we have said, study the two and
twenty books, which, if thou art desirous of learning, strive to remember by name, as I recite
them. For of the Law the books of Moses are the first five, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy. And next, Joshua the son of Nave748, and the book of Judges, including
Ruth, counted as seventh. And of the other historical books, the first and second
books of the Kings749 are among the Hebrews one book; also the third and fourth one book.
And in like manner, the first and second of Chronicles are with them one book; and the
first and second of Esdras are counted one. Esther is the twelfth book; and these are the
Historical writings. But those which are written in verses are five, Job, and the book of
Psalms, and Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs, which is the seventeenth
book. And after these come the five Prophetic books: of the Twelve Prophets one book, of
Isaiah one, of Jeremiah one, including Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle750; then
Ezekiel, and the Book of Daniel, the twenty-second of the Old Testament.</p>

simple sort. Receive also the Acts of the Twelve Apostles; and in addition to these the seven
Catholic Epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude; and as a seal upon them all, and the last
work of the disciples, the fourteen Epistles of Paul752. But let all the rest be put aside in a
secondary rank. And whatever books are not read in Churches, these read not even by

and the wicked practices of necromancy, admit not even to a hearing. From
every kind of intemperance stand aloof, giving thyself neither to gluttony nor licentiousness,
rising superior to all covetousness and usury. Neither venture thyself at heathen assemblies
for public spectacles, nor ever use amulets in sicknesses; shun also all the vulgarity of tavernhaunting.
Fall not away either into the sect of the Samaritans, or into Judaism: for Jesus

of the 2nd Century. His list is as follows:—“Of Moses five (books); Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy,

<head>Lecture V.</head>
    
<head>Of Faith.</head>
<p>Hebrews xi. 1, 2</p>
<p>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the
elders obtained a good report.</p>
<p>1. How great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you from the order of
Catechumens to that of the Faithful, the Apostle Paul shews, when he affirms, God is faithful,
by Whom ye were called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ755. For since God is called
Faithful, thou also in receiving this title receivest a great dignity. For as God is called Good,
and Just, and Almighty, and Maker of the Universe, so is He also called Faithful. Consider
therefore to what a dignity thou art rising, seeing thou art to become partaker of a title of
God756.</p>
<p>2. Here then it is further required, that each of you be found faithful in his conscience:
for a faithful man it is hard to find757: not that thou shouldest shew thy conscience to me,
for thou art not to be judged of man’s judgment758; but that thou shew the sincerity of thy
faith to God, who trieth the reins and hearts759, and knoweth the thoughts of men760. A great
thing is a faithful man, being richest of all rich men. For to the faithful man belongs the
whole world of wealth761, in that he disdains and tramples on it. For they who in appearance
are rich, and have many possessions, are poor in soul: since the more they gather, the more
they pine with longing for what is still lacking. But the faithful man, most strange paradox,
in poverty is rich: for knowing that we need only to have food and raiment, and being
therewith content762, he has trodden riches under foot.</p>

<note type="footnote">761 This sentence is a spurious addition to the text of the Septuagint, variously placed after Prov. xvii. 4, and
xvii. 6. The thought is there completed by the antithesis, but to the faithless not even an obol. The origin of the
interpolation is unknown.</note>
<note type="footnote">762 1 Tim. vi. 8.</note>

<pb n="149"/>
<p>3. Nor is it only among us, who bear the name of Christ, that the dignity of faith is
great763: but likewise all things that are accomplished in the world, even by those who are
aliens764 from the Church, are accomplished by faith.</p>
<p>By faith the laws of marriage yoke together those who have lived as strangers: and because
of the faith in marriage contracts a stranger is made partner of a stranger’s person
and possessions. By faith husbandry also is sustained, for he who believes not that he shall
receive a harvest endures not the toils. By faith sea-faring men, trusting to the thinnest
plank, exchange that most solid element, the land, for the restless motion of the waves,
committing themselves to uncertain hopes, and carrying with them a faith more sure than
any anchor. By faith therefore most of men’s affairs are held together: and not among us
only has there been this belief, but also, as I have said, among those who are without765.
For if they receive not the Scriptures, but bring forward certain doctrines of their own, even
these they accept by faith.</p>
<p>4. The lesson also which was read to-day invites you to the true faith, by setting before
you the way in which you also must please God: for it affirms that without faith it is impossible
to please Him766. For when will a man resolve to serve God, unless he believes that
He is a giver of reward? When will a young woman choose a virgin life, or a young man live
soberly, if they believe not that for chastity there is a crown that fadeth not away767? Faith
<note type="footnote">763 It was a common objection of Pagan philosophers that the Christian religion was not founded upon
reason but only on faith. Cyril’s answer that faith is necessary in the ordinary affairs of life is the same which
Origen had employed against Celsus (I. 11): “Why should it not be more reasonable, since all human affairs
are dependent upon faith, to believe God rather than men? For who takes a voyage, or marries, or begets children,
or casts seeds into the ground, without believing that better things will result, although the contrary might and
sometimes does happen?” See also Arnobius, adversus Gentes, II. 8; and Hooker’s allusion to the scornful reproach
of Julian the Apostate, “The highest point of your wisdom is believe” (Eccles. Pol. V. lxiii. 1.).</note>

description of heretics: see Tertullian, de Baptismo, c. xv.</note>

is an eye that enlightens every conscience, and imparts understanding; for the Prophet saith,
And if ye believe not, ye shall not understand768.</p>
<p>Faith stoppeth the mouths of lions769, as in Daniel’s case: for the Scripture saith concerning
him, that Daniel was brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon
him, because he believed in his God770. Is there anything more fearful than the devil? Yet
even against him we have no other shield than faith771, an impalpable buckler against an
unseen foe. For he sends forth divers arrows, and shoots down in the dark night772 those
that watch not; but, since the enemy is unseen, we have faith as our strong armour, according
to the saying of the Apostle, In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able
to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one773. A fiery dart of desire of base indulgence
is often cast forth from the devil: but faith, suggesting a picture of the judgment, cools down
the mind, and quenches the dart.</p>
<p>5. There is much to tell of faith, and the whole day would not be time sufficient for us
to describe it fully. At present let us be content with Abraham only, as one of the examples
from the Old Testament, seeing that we have been made his sons through faith. He was
justified not only by works, but also by faith774: for though he did many things well, yet he
was never called the friend of God775, except when he believed. Moreover, his every work
was performed in faith. Through faith he left his parents; left country, and place, and home
through faith776. In like manner, therefore, as he was justified be thou justified also. In his
body he was already dead in regard to offspring, and Sarah his wife was now old, and there
was no hope left of having children. God promises the old man a child, and Abraham
without being weakened in faith, though he considered his own body now as good as dead777,

heeded not the weakness of his body, but the power of Him who promised, because he
counted Him faithful who had promised778, and so beyond all expectation gained the child
from bodies as it were already dead. And when, after he had gained his son, he was commanded
to offer him up, although he had heard the word, In Isaac shall thy seed be called779,
he proceeded to offer up his son, his only son, to God, believing that God is able to raise up
even from the dead780. And having bound his son, and laid him on the wood, he did in
purpose offer him, but by the goodness of God in delivering to him a lamb instead of his
child, he received his son alive. Being faithful in these things, he was sealed for righteousness,
and received circumcision as a seal of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision781,
having received a promise that he should be the father of many nations782.</p>
<p>6. Let us see, then, how Abraham is the father of many nations783. Of Jews he is confessedly
the father, through succession according to the flesh. But if we hold to the succession
according to the flesh, we shall be compelled to say that the oracle was false. For according
to the flesh he is no longer father of us all: but the example of his faith makes us all sons of
Abraham. How? and in what manner? With men it is incredible that one should rise from
the dead; as in like manner it is incredible also that there should be offspring from aged
persons as good as dead. But when Christ is preached as having been crucified on the tree,
and as having died and risen again, we believe it. By the likeness therefore of our faith we
are adopted into the sonship of Abraham. And then, following upon our faith, we receive
like him the spiritual seal, being circumcised by the Holy Spirit through Baptism, not in the
foreskin of the body, but in the heart, according to Jeremiah, saying, And ye shall be circumcised
unto God in the foreskin of your heart784: and according to the Apostle, in the circumcision
of Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, and the rest785.</p>
<p>7. This faith if we keep we shall be free from condemnation, and shall be adorned with
all kinds of virtues. For so great is the strength of faith, as even to buoy men up in walking
on the sea. Peter was a man like ourselves, made up of flesh and blood, and living upon like
food. But when Jesus said, Come786, he believed, and walked upon the waters, and found

his faith safer upon the waters than any ground; and his heavy body was upheld by the
buoyancy of his faith. But though he had safe footing over the water as long as he believed,
yet when he doubted, at once he began to sink: for as his faith gradually relaxed, his body
also was drawn down with it. And when He saw his distress, Jesus who remedies the distresses
of our souls, said, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt787? And being
nerved again by Him who grasped his right hand, he had no sooner recovered his faith,
than, led by the hand of the Master, he resumed the same walking upon the waters: for this
the Gospel indirectly mentioned, saying, when they were gone up into the ship788. For it
says not that Peter swam across and went up, but gives us to understand that, after returning
the same distance that he went to meet Jesus, he went up again into the ship.</p>
<p>8. Yea, so much power hath faith, that not the believer only is saved, but some have
been saved by others believing. The paralytic in Capernaum was not a believer, but they
believed who brought him, and let him down through the tiles789: for the sick man’s soul
shared the sickness of his body. And think not that I accuse him without cause: the Gospel
itself says, when Jesus saw, not his faith, but their faith, He saith to the sick of the palsy,
Arise790! The bearers believed, and the sick of the palsy enjoyed the blessing of the cure.</p>
<p>9. Wouldest thou see yet more surely that some are saved by others’ faith? Lazarus
died791: one day had passed, and a second, and a third: his sinews792 were decayed, and
corruption was preying already upon his body. How could one four days dead believe, and
entreat the Redeemer on his own behalf? But what the dead man lacked was supplied by
his true sisters. For when the Lord was come, the sister fell down before Him, and when
He said, Where have ye laid him? and she had made answer, Lord, by this time he stinketh;
for he hath been four days dead, the Lord said, If thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God;
as much as saying, Supply thou the dead man’s lack of faith: and the sisters’ faith had so
much power, that it recalled the dead from the gates of hell. Have then men by believing,
the one on behalf of the other, been able to raise793 the dead, and shalt not thou, if thou
believe sincerely on thine own behalf, be much rather profited? Nay, even if thou be faithless,
or of little faith, the Lord is loving unto man; He condescends to thee on thy repentance:

only on thy part say with honest mind, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief794. But if
thou thinkest that thou really art faithful, but hast not yet the fulness of faith, thou too hast
need to say like the Apostles, Lord, increase our faith795: for some part thou hast of thyself,
but the greater part thou receivest from Him.</p>
<p>10. For the name of Faith is in the form of speech796 one, but has two distinct senses.
For there is one kind of faith, the dogmatic, involving an assent of the soul on some particular
point: and it is profitable to the soul, as the Lord saith: He that heareth My words, and
believeth Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into judgment797: and
again, He that believeth in the Son is not judged, but hath passed from death unto life798. Oh
the great loving-kindness of God! For the righteous were many years in pleasing Him: but
what they succeeded in gaining by many years of well-pleasing799, this Jesus now bestows
on thee in a single hour. For if thou shalt believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that God
raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved, and shalt be transported into Paradise by
Him who brought in thither the robber. And doubt not whether it is possible; for He who
on this sacred Golgotha saved the robber after one single hour of belief, the same shall save
thee also on thy believing800.</p>
<p>11. But there is a second kind of faith, which is bestowed by Christ as a gift of grace.
For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge
according to the same Spirit: to another faith, by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of
healing801. This faith then which is given of grace from the Spirit is not merely doctrinal,
but also worketh things above man’s power. For whosoever hath this faith, shall say to this
mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove802. For whenever any one
shall say this in faith, believing that it cometh to pass, and shall not doubt in his heart, then
receiveth he the grace.</p>

<p>And of this faith it is said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed803. For just as the
grain of mustard seed is small in size, but fiery in its operation, and though sown in a small
space has a circle of great branches, and when grown up is able even to shelter the fowls804;
so, likewise, faith in the swiftest moment works the greatest effects in the soul. For, when
enlightened by faith, the soul hath visions of God, and as far as is possible beholds God, and
ranges round the bounds of the universe, and before the end of this world already beholds
the Judgment, and the payment of the promised rewards. Have thou therefore that faith in
Him which cometh from thine own self, that thou mayest also receive from Him that faith
which worketh things above man805.</p>

transformed into an angel of light811 should wish to lead you astray. For though we or an
angel from heaven preach to you any other gospel than that ye have received, let him be to
you anathema812. So for the present listen while I simply say the Creed813, and commit it
to memory; but at the proper season expect the confirmation out of Holy Scripture of each
part of the contents. For the articles of the Faith were not composed as seemed good to
men; but the most important points collected out of all the Scripture make up one complete
teaching of the Faith. And just as the mustard seed in one small grain contains many
branches, so also this Faith has embraced in few words all the knowledge of godliness in the
Old and New Testaments. Take heed then, brethren, and hold fast the traditions814 which
ye now receive, and write them an the table of your heart815.</p>
<p>13. Guard them with reverence, lest per chance the enemy despoil any who have grown
slack; or lest some heretic pervert any of the truths delivered to you. For faith is like putting
money into the bank816, even as we have now done; but from you God requires the accounts
of the deposit. I charge you, as the Apostle saith, before God, who quickeneth all things, and
Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession, that ye keep this faith
which is committed to you, without spot, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ817. A
treasure of life has now been committed to thee, and the Master demandeth the deposit at
His appearing, which in His own times He shall shew, Who is the blessed and only Potentate,
the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light which no
man can approach unto; Whom no man hath seen nor can see. To Whom be glory, honour,
and power818 for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

εἶδος μοναρχίας βασιλικῆς), Philo Judæus (de Circumcisione, § 2; de Monarchia, Titul.), means “sole government.”
Compare Tertullian (adv. Praxean. c. iii.): “If I have gained any knowledge of either language, I am sure that
Μοναρχία has no other meaning than ‘single and individual rule.’” Athanasius (de Decretis Nicænæ Synodi, §
26) has preserved part of an Epistle of Dionysius, Bishop of Rome (259–269, a.d.), against the Sabellians: “It
will be natural for me now to speak against those who divide, and cut into pieces, and destroy that most sacred
doctrine of the Church of God, the Monarchia, making it, as it were, three powers and divided hypostases, and
three Godheads;” (ibid.): “It is the doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion to sever and divide the Monarchia
into three origins (ἀρχάς).” We see here the sense which Μοναρχία had acquired in Christian Theology: it
meant the “Unity of God,” as the one principle and origin of all things. “By the Monarchy is meant the doctrine
that the Second and Third Persons in the Ever-blessed Trinity are ever to be referred in our thoughts to the
First, as the Fountain of Godhead” (Newman, Athanas. de Decretis Nic. Syn. § 26, note h). Justin Martyr (Euseb.
H.E. IV. 18), and Irenæus (ibid. V. 20), had each written a treatise περὶ Μοναρχίας. On the history of Monarchianism

the Doxology silently, so that those who were near could hear only “world without end.” The form which was
regarded as the most orthodox, and adopted in the Liturgies ran thus: “Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and

with Him, because the glory of the Son flows from His Father’s honour: and again, when
the Son is glorified, the Father of so great a blessing is highly honoured.</p>
<p>2. Now though the mind is most rapid in its thoughts, yet the tongue needs words, and
a long recital of intermediary speech. For the eye embraces at once a multitude of the ‘starry
quire;’ but when any one wishes to describe them one by one, which is the Morning-star,
and which, the Evening-star, and which each one of them, he has need of many words. In
like manner again the mind in the briefest moment compasses earth and sea and all the
bounds of the universe; but what it conceives in an instant, it uses many words to describe822.
Yet forcible as is the example I have mentioned, still it is after all weak and inadequate. For
of God we speak not all we ought (for that is known to Him only), but so much as the capacity
of human nature has received, and so much as our weakness can bear. For we explain not
what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him. For
in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is the best knowledge823. Therefore magnify
the Lord with me, and let us exalt His Name together824,—all of us in common, for one
alone is powerless; nay rather, even if we be all united together, we shall yet not do it as we
ought. I mean not you only who are here present, but even if all the nurslings of the whole
Church throughout the world, both that which now is and that which shall be, should meet
together, they would not be able worthily to sing the praises of their Shepherd.</p>

and when he came before God, then speaking the truth candidly he saith, I am earth and
ashes825. He did not say ‘earth,’ and then cease, lest he should call himself by the name of
that great element; but he added ‘and ashes,’ that he might represent his perishable and frail
nature. Is there anything, he saith, smaller or lighter than ashes? For take, saith he, the
comparison of ashes to a house, of a house to a city, a city to a province, a province to the

earth to the heaven in which it is embosomed;—the earth, which bears the same proportion
to the heaven as the centre to the whole circumference of a wheel, for the earth is no more
than this in comparison with the heaven826: consider then that this first heaven which is
seen is less than the second, and the second than the third, for so far Scripture has named
them, not that they are only so many, but because it was expedient for us to know so many
only. And when in thought thou hast surveyed all the heavens, not yet will even the heavens
be able to praise God as He is, nay, not if they should resound with a voice louder than
thunder. But if these great vaults of the heavens cannot worthily sing God’s praise, when
shall ‘earth and ashes,’ the smallest and least of things existing, be able to send up a worthy
hymn of praise to God, or worthily to speak of God, that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
and holdeth the inhabitants thereof as grasshoppers827.</p>
<p>4. If any man attempt to speak of God, let him first describe the bounds of the earth.
Thou dwellest on the earth, and the limit of this earth which is thy dwelling thou knowest
not: how then shalt thou be able to form a worthy thought of its Creator? Thou beholdest
the stars, but their Maker thou beholdest not: count these which are visible, and then describe
Him who is invisible, Who telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their
names828. Violent rains lately came pouring down upon us, and nearly destroyed us:
number the drops in this city alone: nay, I say not in the city, but number the drops on
thine own house for one single hour, if thou canst: but thou canst not. Learn then thine
own weakness; learn from this instance the mightiness of God: for He hath numbered the
drops of rain829, which have been poured down on all the earth, not only now but in all
time. The sun is a work of God, which, great though it be, is but a spot in comparison with
the whole heaven; first gaze stedfastly upon the sun, and then curiously scan the Lord of the
sun. Seek not the things that are too deep for thee, neither search out the things that are above
thy strength: what is commanded thee, think thereupon830.</p>

made us; for it is a divine command which saith, Let every breath praise the Lord831. I am
attempting now to glorify the Lord, but not to describe Him, knowing nevertheless that I
shall fall short of glorifying Him worthily, yet deeming it a work of piety even to attempt it

hath seen the Father, save He which is of God, He hath seen the Father834. The Angels
therefore behold as much as they can bear, and Archangels as much as they are able; and
Thrones and Dominions more than the former, but yet less than His worthiness: for with
the Son the Holy Ghost alone can rightly behold Him: for He searcheth all things, and
knoweth even the deep things of God835: as indeed the Only-begotten Son also, with the
Holy Ghost, knoweth the Father fully: For neither, saith He, knoweth any man the Father,
save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him836. For He fully beholdeth, and, according
as each can bear, revealeth God through the Spirit: since the Only-begotten Son
together with the Holy Ghost is a partaker of the Father’s Godhead. He, who837 was begotten
knoweth Him who begat; and He Who begat knoweth Him who is begotten. Since Angels
then are ignorant (for to each according to his own capacity doth the Only-begotten reveal
Him through the Holy Ghost, as we have said), let no man be ashamed to confess his ignorance.
I am speaking now, as all do on occasion: but how we speak, we cannot tell: how
then can I declare Him who hath given us speech? I who have a soul, and cannot tell its
distinctive properties, how shall I be able to describe its Giver?</p>

<p>7. For devotion it suffices us simply to know that we have a God; a God who is One, a
living838, an ever-living God; always like unto Himself839; who has no Father, none mightier
than Himself, no successor to thrust Him out from His kingdom: Who in name is manifold,
in power infinite, in substance uniform840. For though He is called Good, and Just, and
Almighty and Sabaoth841, He is not on that account diverse and various; but being one and
the same, He sends forth countless operations of His Godhead, not exceeding here and deficient
there, but being in all things like unto Himself. Not great in loving-kindness only,
and little in wisdom, but with wisdom and loving-kindness in equal power: not seeing in
part, and in part devoid of sight; but being all eye, and all ear, and all mind842: not like us
perceiving in part and in part not knowing; for such a statement were blasphemous, and
unworthy of the Divine substance. He foreknoweth the things that be; He is Holy, and
Almighty, and excelleth all in goodness, and majesty, and wisdom: of Whom we can declare
neither beginning, nor form, nor shape. For ye have neither heard His voice at any time,
nor seen His shape843, saith Holy Scripture. Wherefore Moses saith also to the Israelites:

again dared to say that He has seven eyes, because it is written, seven eyes of the Lord looking
upon the whole earth847. For if He has but seven eyes surrounding Him in part, His seeing
is therefore partial and not perfect: but to say this of God is blasphemous; for we must believe
that God is in all things perfect, according to our Saviour’s word, which saith, Your Father
in heaven is perfect848: perfect in sight, perfect in power, perfect in greatness, perfect in
foreknowledge, perfect in goodness, perfect in justice, perfect in loving-kindness: not circumscribed

God hath prepared for them that love Him854. If the things which God hath prepared are
incomprehensible to our thoughts, how can we comprehend with our mind Himself who
hath prepared them? O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God! How

O monstrous blindness, that from majesty so great came down so low! The tree which was
planted by God, and nourished by the rain, and afterwards burnt and turned into ashes by
the fire,—this is addressed as God, and the true God is despised. But the wickedness of idolatry
grew yet more prodigal, and cat, and dog, and wolf857 were worshipped instead of
God: the man-eating lion858 also was worshipped instead of God, the most loving friend
of man. The snake and the serpent859, counterfeit of him who thrust us out of Paradise,
were worshipped, and He who planted Paradise was despised. And I am ashamed to say,
and yet do say it, even onions860 were worshipped among some. Wine was given to make
glad the heart of man861: and Dionysus (Bacchus) was worshipped instead of God. God
made corn by saying, Let the earth bring forth grass, yielding seed after his kind and after his

then the adulteries alleged among those who are by them called gods? I say nothing of the
transformations of Zeus into a swan: I am ashamed to speak of his transformations into a
bull: for bellowings are unworthy of a god. The god of the Greeks has been found an
adulterer, yet are they not ashamed: for if he is an adulterer let him not be called a god.
They tell also of deaths865, and falls866, and thunder-strokes867 of their gods. Seest thou
from how great a height and how low they have fallen? Was it without reason then that the
Son of God came down from heaven? or was it that He might heal so great a wound? Was
it without reason that the Son came? or was it in order that the Father might be acknowledged?
Thou hast learned what moved the Only-begotten to come down from the throne
at God’s right hand. The Father was despised, the Son must needs correct the error: for He
Through Whom All Things Were Made must bring them all as offerings to the Lord of all.
The wound must be healed: for what could be worse than this disease, that a stone should
be worshipped instead of God?</p>

brood of heretics, those most ungodly men of evil name, pretending to be friends of Christ
but utterly hating Him. For he who blasphemes the Father of the Christ is an enemy of the
Son. These men have dared to speak of two Godheads, one good and one evil868! O monstrous
blindness! If a Godhead, then assuredly good. But if not good, why called a Godhead?
For if goodness is an attribute of God; if loving-kindness, beneficence, almighty power, are
proper to God, then of two things one, either in calling Him God let the name and operation
be united; or if they would rob Him of His operations, let them not give Him the bare name.</p>
<p>13. Heretics have dared to say that there are two Gods, and of good and evil two sources,
and these unbegotten. If both are unbegotten it is certain that they are also equal, and both
mighty. How then doth the light destroy the darkness? And do they ever exist together, or
are they separated? Together they cannot be; for what fellowship hath light with darkness?
saith the Apostle869. But if they are far from each other, it is certain that they hold also each
his own place; and if they hold their own separate places, we are certainly in the realm of
one God, and certainly worship one God. For thus we must conclude, even if we assent to
their folly, that we must worship one God. Let us examine also what they say of the good
God. Hath He power or no power? If He hath power, how did evil arise against His will?
And how doth the evil substance intrude, if He be not willing? For if He knows but cannot
hinder it, they charge Him with want of power; but if He has the power, yet hinders not,
they accuse Him of treachery. Mark too their want of sense. At one time they say that the
Evil One hath no communion with the good God in the creation of the world; but at another
time they say that he hath the fourth part only. Also they say that the good God is the
Father of Christ; but Christ they call this sun. If, therefore according to them, the world
was made by the Evil One, and the sun is in the world, how is the Son of the Good an unwilling
slave in the kingdom of the Evil? We bemire ourselves in speaking of these things, but
we do it lest any of those present should from ignorance fall into the mire of the heretics.
I know that I have defiled my own mouth and the ears of my listeners: yet it is expedient.
For it is much better to hear absurdities charged against others, than to fall into them from
ignorance: far better that thou know the mire and hate it, than unawares fall into it. For
the godless system of the heresies is a road with many branches, and whenever a man has
strayed from the one straight way, then he falls down precipices again and again.</p>

<p>14. The inventor of all heresy was Simon Magus870: that Simon, who in the Acts of the
Apostles thought to purchase with money the unsaleable grace of the Spirit, and heard the
words, Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter871, and the rest: concerning whom also
it is written, They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they
would have remained with us872. This man, after he had been cast out by the Apostles, came
to Rome, and gaining over one Helena a harlot873, was the first that dared with blasphemous
mouth to say that it was himself who appeared on Mount Sinai as the Father, and afterwards
appeared among the Jews, not in real flesh but in seeming874, as Christ Jesus, and afterwards
as the Holy Spirit whom Christ promised to send as the Paraclete875. And he so deceived
the City of Rome that Claudius set up his statue, and wrote beneath it, in the language of
the Romans, “Simoni Deo Sancto,” which being interpreted signifies, “To Simon the Holy
God876.”</p>

of all, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his mind the creation of Angels and Archangels.”</note>

<note type="footnote">875 Irenæus (I. xxiii. 1): “He taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, and descended
in Samaria as the Father, but came to other nations as the Holy Spirit.” Cyril here departs from his authority by
substituting Mount Sinai for Samaria, and thereby falls into error. Simon had first appeared in Samaria, being
a native of Gitton: moreover in claiming to be the Father he meant to set himself far above the inferior Deity
who had given the Law on Sinai, saying that he was “the highest of all Powers, that is the Father who is over all.”</note>
<note type="footnote">876 “Justin Martyr in his first Apology, addressed to Antoninus Pius, writes thus (c. 26): ‘There was one Simon
a Samaritan, of the village called Gitton, who in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and in your royal city of Rome,
did mighty feats of magic by the art of dæmons working in him. He was considered a god, and as a god was
honoured among you with a statue, which statue was set up in the river Tiber between the two bridges, and
bears this inscription in Latin: Simoni Deo Sancto; which is, To Simon the holy God. “The substance of this story
is repeated by Irenæus (adv. Hær. I. xxiii. 1), and by Tertullian (Apol. c. 13), who reproaches the Romans for
installing Simon Magus in their Pantheon, and giving him a statue and the title ‘Holy God.’ “In a.d. 1574, a
stone, which had formed the base of a statue, was dug up on the site described by Justin, the Island in the Tiber,
bearing an inscription—‘Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio Sacrum, U+0026c.’ Hence it has been supposed that Justin mistook
a statue of the Sabine God, ‘Semo Sancus,’ for one of Simon Magus. See the notes in Otto’s Justin Martyr, and
Stieren’s Irenæus. “On the other hand Tillemont (Memoires, t. ii. p. 482) maintains that Justin in an Apology
addressed to the emperor and written in Rome itself cannot reasonably be supposed to have fallen into so
manifest an error. Whichever view we take of Justin’s accuracy concerning the inscription and the statue, there</note>

<p>15. As the delusion was extending, Peter and Paul, a noble pair, chief rulers of the
Church, arrived and set the error right877; and when the supposed god Simon wished to
shew himself off, they straightway shewed him as a corpse. For Simon promised to rise aloft
to heaven, and came riding in a dæmons’ chariot on the air; but the servants of God fell on
their knees, and having shewn that agreement of which Jesus spake, that If two of you shall
agree concerning anything that they shall ask, it shall be done unto them878, they launched
the weapon of their concord in prayer against Magus, and struck him down to the earth.
And marvellous though it was, yet no marvel. For Peter was there, who carrieth the keys
of heaven879: and nothing wonderful, for Paul was there880, who was caught up to the third
heaven, and into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful far a man to
utter881. These brought the supposed God down from the sky to earth, thence to be taken
down to the regions below the earth. In this man first the serpent of wickedness appeared;
but when one head had been cut off, the root of wickedness was found again with many
heads.</p>

But “Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History (c. a.d. 325), quotes Justin Martyr’s story about Simon Magus (E. H.
ii. c. 13), and then, without referring to any authority, goes on to assert (c. 14) that ‘immediately in the same
reign of Claudius divine Providence led Peter the great Apostle to Rome to encounter this great destroyer of
life,’ and that he thus brought the light of the Gospel from the East to the West’ (ibidem). Eusebius probably
borrowed this story “from the strange fictions of the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies, and Apostolic
Constitutions.” See Recogn. III. 63–65; Hom. I. 15, III. 58; Apost. Constit. VI. 7, 8, 9. Cyril’s account of Simon’s

Ebionites885 also, and Marcion886, that mouthpiece of ungodliness. For he who proclaimed
different gods, one the Good, the other the Just, contradicts the Son when He says, O righteous
Father887. And he who says again that the Father is one, and the maker of the world another,
opposes the Son when He says, If then God so clothes the grass of the field which to-day is,
and to-morrow is cast into the furnace of fire888; and, Who maketh His sun to rise on the evil
and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust889. Here again is a second
inventor of more mischief, this Marcion. For being confuted by the testimonies from the
Old Testament which are quoted in the New, he was the first who dared to cut those testimonies
out890, and leave the preaching of the word of faith without witness, thus effacing
the true God: and sought to undermine the Church’s faith, as if there were no heralds of it.</p>
<note type="footnote">882 Cerinthus taught that the world was not made by the supreme God, but by a separate Power ignorant of
Him. See Irenæus, Hær. I. xxvi., Euseb. E.H. iii. 28, with the notes in this Series.</note>
<note type="footnote">883 Menander is first mentioned by Justin M. (Apolog. I. cap. 26): “Menander, also a Samaritan, of the town
Capparetæa, a disciple of Simon, and inspired by devils, we know to have deceived many while he was in Antioch
by his magical art. He persuaded those who adhered to him that they should never die.” Irenæus (I. xxiii. 5)
adds that Menander announced himself as the Saviour sent by the Invisibles, and taught that the world was
created by Angels. See also Tertullian (de Animâ, cap. 50.)</note>

got rid of the testimony of the Apostles and eye-witnesses, Matthew and John, and represented the Law and the
Gospel as contradictory revelations of two different Gods. For this Cyril calls him ‘a second inventor of mischief,’

a preacher of impurities891. The contest of wickedness was aided also by Valentinus892, a
preacher of thirty gods. The Greeks tell of but few: and the man who was called—but more
truly was not—a Christian extended the delusion to full thirty. He says, too, that Bythus
the Abyss (for it became him as being an abyss of wickedness to begin his teaching from the
Abyss) begat Silence, and of Silence begat the Word. This Bythus was worse than the Zeus
of the Greeks, who was united to his sister: for Silence was said to be the child of Bythus.
Dost thou see the absurdity invested with a show of Christianity? Wait a little, and thou
wilt be shocked at his impiety; for he asserts that of this Bythus were begotten eight Æons;
and of them, ten; and of them, other twelve, male and female. But whence is the proof of
these things? See their silliness from their fabrications. Whence hast thou the proof of the
thirty Æons? Because, saith he, it is written, that Jesus was baptized, being thirty years old893.
But even if He was baptized when thirty years old, what sort of demonstration is this from
the thirty years? Are there then five gods, because He brake five loaves among five thousand?
Or because he had twelve Disciples, must there also be twelve gods?</p>
<p>18. And even this is still little compared with the impieties which follow. For the last
of the deities being, as he dares to speak, both male and female, this, he says, is Wisdom894.
What impiety! For the Wisdom of God895 is Christ His Only-begotten Son: and he by his
doctrine degraded the Wisdom of God into a female element, and one of thirty, and the last
fabrication. He also says that Wisdom attempted to behold the first God, and not bearing
His brightness fell from heaven, and was cast out of her thirtieth place. Then she groaned,

Hadrian (a.d. 117–138). His doctrines are described by Irenæus (I. xxvii. 3–7), and very fully by Hippolytus
(Refut. omn. Hær. VII. 2–15). The charge of teaching licentiousness attaches rather to the later followers of
Basilides than to himself or his son Isidorus (Clem. Alex. Stromat. III. cap. 1). Basilides wrote a Commentary
on the Gospel in 24 books (Exegetica), of which the 23rd is quoted by Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. IV. cap.
12), and against which Agrippa Castor wrote a refutation. Origen (Hom. I. in Lucam.) says that Basilides wrote

Mark the impiety. For of Wisdom how is the Devil begotten, and of prudence wickedness,
or of light darkness? He says too that the Devil begat others, some of whom created the
world: and that the Christ came down in order to make mankind revolt from the Maker of
the world.</p>
<p>19. But hear whom they say Christ Jesus to be, that thou mayest detest them yet more.
For they say that after Wisdom had been cast down, in order that the number of the thirty
might not be incomplete, the nine and twenty Æons contributed each a little part, and
formed the Christ897: and they say that He also is both male and female898. Can anything
be more impious than this? Anything more wretched? I am describing their delusion to
thee, in order that thou mayest hate them the more. Shun, therefore, their impiety, and do
not even give greeting to899 a man of this kind, lest thou have fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness900: neither make curious inquiries, nor be willing to enter into conversation
with them.</p>
<note type="footnote">896 Irenæus, l. c., and Hippolytus, who gives an elaborate account of the doctrines of Valentinus (L. VI. capp.
xvi.–xxxii.), both represent Sophia, “Wisdom,” as giving birth not to Satan, but to a shapeless abortion, which
was the origin of matter. According to Irenæus (I. iv. 2), Achamoth, the enthymesis of Sophia, gave birth to the
Demiurge, and “from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed.” In Tertullian’s Treatise against the
Valentinians chap. xxii., Achamoth is said as by Cyril to have given birth to Satan: but in chap. xxiii. Satan seems
to be identified (or interchanged) with the Demiurge.</note>
<note type="footnote">897 The account in Irenæus (I. ii. 6) is rather different: “The whole Pleroma of the Æons, with one design
and desire, and with the concurrence of the Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also setting the seal of His
approval on their conduct, brought together whatever each one had in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness;
and uniting all these contributions so as skilfully to blend the whole, they produced, to the honour
and glory of Bythus, a being of most perfect beauty, the very star of the Pleroma, and its perfect fruit, namely
Jesus.” Tertullian, Against the Valentinians, chap. 12, gives a sarcastic description of this strange doctrine, deriving
his facts (chap. 5) from Justin, Miltiades, “Irenæus, that very exact inquirer into all doctrines,” and Proculus.</note>

that he lived a short time ago; but because of his impious doctrines hate thou the worker of
wickedness, the receptacle of all filth, who gathered up the mire of every heresy904. For aspiring
to become pre-eminent among wicked men, he took the doctrines of all, and having
combined them into one heresy filled with blasphemies and all iniquity, he makes havoc of
the Church, or rather of those outside the Church, roaming about like a lion and devouring.

<p>22. There was in Egypt one Scythianus908, a Saracen909 by birth, having nothing in
common either with Judaism or with Christianity. This man, who dwelt at Alexandria and
imitated the life of Aristotle910, composed four books911, one called a Gospel which had
not the acts of Christ, but the mere name only, and one other called the book of Chapters,
and a third of Mysteries, and a fourth, which they circulate now, the Treasure912. This man
had a disciple, Terebinthus by name. But when Scythianus purposed to come into Judæa,
and make havoc of the land, the Lord smote him with a deadly disease, and stayed the pestilence913.</p>

he resolved to pass into Persia: but lest he should be recognised there also by his name he

versies, and at last hard pressed, he took refuge with a certain widow. Then having gone
up on the housetop, and summoned the dæmons of the air, whom the Manichees to this
day invoke over their abominable ceremony of the fig918, he was smitten of God, and cast
down from the housetop, and expired: and so the second beast was cut off.</p>
<p>24. The books, however, which were the records of his impiety, remained; and both
these and his money the widow inherited. And having neither kinsman nor any other friend,
she determined to buy with the money a boy named Cubricus919: him she adopted and
educated as a son in the learning of the Persians, and thus sharpened an evil weapon against
mankind. So Cubricus, the vile slave, grew up in the midst of philosophers, and on the death
of the widow inherited both the books and the money. Then, lest the name of slavery might
be a reproach, instead of Cubricus he called himself Manes, which in the language of the
Persians signifies discourse920. For as he thought himself something of a disputant, he
surnamed himself Manes, as it were an excellent master of discourse. But though he contrived
for himself an honourable title according to the language of the Persians, yet the providence
of God caused him to become a self-accuser even against his will, that through thinking to
honour himself in Persia, he might proclaim himself among the Greeks by name a maniac.</p>
<p>25. He dared too to say that he was the Paraclete, though it is written, But whosoever
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath no forgiveness921. He committed blasphemy
therefore by saying that he was the Holy Ghost: let him that communicates with those
heretics see with whom he is enrolling himself. The slave shook the world, since by three
things the earth is shaken, and the fourth it cannot bear,—if a slave became a king922. Having
come into public he now began to promise things above man’s power. The son of the King
of the Persians was sick, and a multitude of physicians were in attendance: but Manes
promised, as if he were a godly man, to cure him by prayer. With the departure of the
physicians, the life of the child departed: and the man’s impiety was detected. So the wouldbe
philosopher was a prisoner, being cast into prison not for reproving the king in the cause
of truth, not for destroying the idols, but for promising to save and lying, or rather, if the
truth must be told, for committing murder. For the child who might have been saved by
medical treatment, was murdered by this man’s driving away the physicians, and killing
him by want of treatment.</p>

fourthly, the murder of the child, and fifthly, the disgrace of the imprisonment. And there
was not only the disgrace of the prison, but also the flight from prison. For he who called
himself the Paraclete and champion of the truth, ran away: he was no successor of Jesus,
who readily went to the Cross, but this man was the reverse, a runaway. Moreover, the King
of the Persians ordered the keepers of the prison to be executed: so Manes was the cause
of the child’s death through his vain boasting, and of the gaolers’ death through his flight.
Ought then he, who shared the guilt of murder, to be worshipped? Ought he not to have
followed the example of Jesus, and said, If ye seek Me, let these go their way923? Ought he
not to have said, like Jonas, Take me, and cast me into the sea: for this storm is because of
me924?</p>
<p>27. He escapes from the prison, and comes into Mesopotamia: but there Bishop
Archelaus, a shield of righteousness, encounters him925: and having accused him before
philosophers as judges, and having assembled an audience of Gentiles, lest if Christians gave
judgment, the judges might be thought to shew favour,—Tell us what thou preachest, said
Archelaus to Manes. And he, whose mouth was as an open sepulchre926, began first with
blasphemy against the Maker of all things, saying, The God of the Old Testament is the author
of evils, as He says of Himself, I am a consuming fire927. But the wise Archelaus undermined
his blasphemous argument by saying, “If the God of the Old Testament, as thou sayest, calls
Himself a fire, whose Son is He who saith, I came to send fire on the earth928? If thou findest
fault with Him who saith, The Lord killeth, and maketh alive929, why dost thou honour
Peter, who raised up Tabitha, but struck Sapphira dead? If again thou findest fault, because
He prepared fire, wherefore dost thou not find fault with Him who saith, Depart from Me
into everlasting fire930? If thou findest fault with Him who saith, I am God that make peace,
and create evil931, explain how Jesus saith, I came not to send peace but a sword932. Since

Jesus is blameless in so speaking. why blamest thou Him that saith the like in the Old Testament?”</p>
<p>28. Then Manes answers him: “And what sort of God causes blindness? For it is Paul
who saith, In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not,
lest the light of the Gospel should shine unto them933.” But Archelaus made a good retort,
saying, “Read a little before: But if our Gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that are perishing934.
Seest thou that in them that are perishing it is veiled? For it is not right to give the
things which are holy unto the dogs935. Again, Is it only the God of the Old Testament that
hath blinded the minds of them that believe not? Hath not Jesus Himself said, For this cause
speak I unto them in parables, that seeing they may not see936? Was it from hating them that
He wished them not to see? Or because of their unworthiness, since their eyes they had
closed937. For where there is wilful wickedness, there is also a withholding of grace: for to
him that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he
seemeth to have938.</p>

unworthy expression)—If indeed He blinded the thoughts of them that believe not he blinded
them for a good purpose, that they might look with new sight on what is good. For he said
not, He blinded their soul, but, the thoughts of them that believe not940. And the meaning
is something of this kind: ‘Blind the lewd thoughts of the lewd, and the man is saved: blind
the grasping and rapacious thought of the robber, and the man is saved.’ But wilt thou not
understand it thus? Then there is yet another interpretation. The sun also blinds those
whose sight is dim: and they whose eyes are diseased are hurt by the light and blinded. Not
that the sun’s nature is to blind, but that the substance of the eyes is incapable of seeing. In

like manner unbelievers being diseased in their heart cannot look upon the radiance of the
Godhead. Nor hath he said, ‘He hath blinded their thoughts, that they should not hear the
Gospel:’ but, that the light of the glory of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ should not shine
unto them. For to hear the Gospel is permitted to all: but the glory of the Gospel is reserved
for Christ’s true children only. Therefore the Lord spoke in parables to those who could
not hear941: but to the Disciples he explained the parables in private942: for the brightness
of the glory is for those who have been enlightened, the blinding for them that believe not.”
These mysteries, which the Church now explains to thee who art passing out of the class of
Catechumens, it is not the custom to explain to heathen. For to a heathen we do not explain
the mysteries concerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, nor before Catechumens do we
speak plainly of the mysteries: but many things we often speak in a veiled way, that the believers
who know may understand, and they who know not may get no hurt943.</p>

wrestle with Manes and threw him. Again, he who had fled from prison flees from this
place also: and having run away from his antagonist, he comes to a very poor village, like
the serpent in Paradise when he left Adam and came to Eve. But the good shepherd Archelaus
taking forethought for his sheep, when he heard of his flight, straightway hastened with all
speed in search of the wolf. And when Manes suddenly saw his adversary, he rushed out
and fled: it was however his last flight. For the officers of the King of Persia searched
everywhere, and caught the fugitive: and the sentence, which he ought to have received in
the presence of Archelaus, is passed upon him by the king’s officers. This Manes, whom
his own disciples worship, is arrested and brought before the king. The king reproached
him with his falsehood and his flight: poured scorn upon his slavish condition, avenged
the murder of his child, and condemned him also for the murder of the gaolers: he commands
him to be flayed after the Persian fashion. And while the rest of his body was given
over for food of wild beasts, his skin, the receptacle of his vile mind, was hung up before the
gates like a sack944. He that called himself the Paraclete and professed to know the future,
knew not his own flight and capture.</p>

Manicheans, who by decoctions of chaff counterfeit the sad look of fasting, who speak evil
of the Creator of meats, and greedily devour the daintiest, who teach that the man who
plucks up this or that herb is changed into it. For if he who crops herbs or any vegetable is
changed into the same, into how many will husbandmen and the tribe of gardeners be
changed946? The gardener, as we see, has used his sickle against so many: into which then
is he changed? Verily their doctrines are ridiculous, and fraught with their own condemnation
and shame! The same man, being the shepherd of a flock, both sacrifices a sheep and
kills a wolf. Into what then is he changed? Many men both net fishes and lime birds: into
which then are they transformed?</p>
<p>32. Let those children of sloth, the Manicheans, make answer; who without labouring
themselves eat up the labourers’ fruits: who welcome with smiling faces those who bring
them their food, and return curses instead of blessings. For when a simple person brings
them anything, “Stand outside a while,” saith he, “and I will bless thee.” Then having taken
the bread into his hands (as those who have repented and left them have confessed), “I did
not make thee,” says the Manichee to the bread: and sends up curses against the Most High;
and curses him that made it, and so eats what was made947. If thou hatest the food, why
didst thou look with smiling countenance on him that brought it to thee? If thou art
thankful to the bringer, why dost thou utter thy blasphemy to God, who created and made
it? So again he says, “I sowed thee not: may he be sown who sowed thee! I reaped thee not
with a sickle: may he be reaped who reaped thee! I baked thee not with fire: may he be
baked who baked thee!” A fine return for the kindness!</p>

thou mayest not be bemired: she tells of the wounds, that thou mayest not be wounded.
But for thee it is enough merely to know them: abstain from learning by experience. God
thunders, and we all tremble; and they blaspheme. God lightens, and we all bow down to
the earth; and they have their blasphemous sayings about the heavens952. These things are

with the abomination of the Manichees? Here is order, here is discipline954, here is majesty,
here is purity: here even to look upon a woman to lust after her955 is condemnation. Here
is marriage with sanctity956, here steadfast continence, here virginity in honour like unto
the Angels: here partaking of food with thanksgiving, here gratitude to the Creator of the
world. Here the Father of Christ is worshipped: here are taught fear and trembling before
Him who sends the rain: here we ascribe glory to Him who makes the thunder and the
lightning.</p>
<p>36. Make thou thy fold with the sheep: flee from the wolves: depart not from the
Church. Hate those also who have ever been suspected in such matters: and unless in time
thou perceive their repentance, do not rashly trust thyself among them. The truth of the
Unity of God has been delivered to thee: learn to distinguish the pastures of doctrine. Be
an approved banker957, holding fast that which is good, abstaining from every form of evil958.
Or if thou hast ever been such as they, recognise and hate thy delusion. For there is a way
of salvation, if thou reject the vomit, if thou from thy heart detest it, if thou depart from
them, not with thy lips only, but with thy soul also: if thou worship the Father of Christ,
the God of the Law and the Prophets, if thou acknowledge the Good and the Just to be one

<p>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,…of whom all fatherhood in heaven and earth
is named, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Of God as the sole Principle we have said enough to you yesterday960: by “enough”
I mean, not what is worthy of the subject, (for to reach that is utterly impossible to mortal
nature), but as much as was granted to our infirmity. I traversed also the bye-paths of the
manifold error of the godless heretics: but now let us shake off their foul and soul-poisoning
doctrine, and remembering what relates to them, not to our own hurt, but to our greater
detestation of them, let us come back to ourselves, and receive the saving doctrines of the
true Faith, connecting the dignity of Fatherhood with that of the Unity, and believing In
One God the Father: for we must not only believe in one God; but this also let us devoutly
receive, that He is the Father of the Only-begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. For thus shall we raise our thoughts higher than the Jews961, who admit indeed by
their doctrines that there is One God, (for what if they often denied even this by their idolatries?);
but that He is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, they admit not; being of a
contrary mind to their own Prophets, who in the Divine Scriptures affirm, The Lord said
unto me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten thee962. And to this day they rage and
gather themselves together against the Lord, and against His Anointed963, thinking that it is
possible to be made friends of the Father apart from devotion towards the Son, being ignorant
that no man cometh unto the Father but by964 the Son, who saith, I am the Door, and I am
the Way965. He therefore that refuseth the Way which leadeth to the Father, and he that
denieth the Door, how shall he be deemed worthy of entrance unto God? They contradict

God, and the helper of my salvation. And I will make him my first-born, high among the
kings of the earth966. For if they should insist that these things are said of David or Solomon
or any of their successors, let them shew how the throne of him, who is in their judgment
described in the prophecy, is as the days of heaven, and as the sun before God, and as the
moon established for ever967. And how is it also that they are not abashed at that which is
written, From the womb before the morning-star have I begotten thee968: also this, He shall
endure with the sun, and before the moon, from generation to generation969. To refer these
passages to a man is a proof of utter and extreme insensibility.</p>
<p>3. Let the Jews, however, since they so will, suffer their usual disorder of unbelief, both
in these and the like statements. But let us adopt the godly doctrine of our Faith, worshipping
one God the Father of the Christ, (for to deprive Him, who grants to all the gift of generation,
of the like dignity would be impious): and let us Believe in One God the Father, in order
that, before we touch upon our teaching concerning Christ, the faith concerning the Onlybegotten
may be implanted in the soul of the hearers, without being at all interrupted by
the intervening doctrines concerning the Father.</p>
<p>4. For the name of the Father, with the very utterance of the title, suggests the thought
of the Son: as in like manner one who names the Son thinks straightway of the Father
also970. For if a Father, He is certainly the Father of a Son; and if a Son, certainly the Son
of a Father. Lest therefore from our speaking thus, In One God, the Father Almighty, Maker
of Heaven and Earth, and of All Things Visible and Invisible, and from our then adding
this also, And in One Lord Jesus Christ, any one should irreverently suppose that the Onlybegotten
is second in rank to heaven and earth,—for this reason before naming them we
named God the Father, that in thinking of the Father we might at the same time think also
of the Son: for between the Son and the Father no being whatever comes.</p>
<p>5. God then is in an improper sense971 the Father of many, but by nature and in truth
of One only, the Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; not having attained in course

of time to being a Father, but being ever the Father of the Only-begotten972. Not that being
without a Son before, He has since by change of purpose become a Father: but before every
substance and every intelligence, before times and all ages, God hath the dignity of Father,
magnifying Himself in this more than in His other dignities; and having become a Father,
not by passion973, or union, not in ignorance, not by effluence974, not by diminution, not
by alteration, for every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow of turning975. Perfect Father,
He begat a perfect Son, and delivered all things to Him who is begotten: (for all things, He
saith, are delivered unto Me of My Father976:) and is honoured by the Only-begotten: for,
I honour My Father977, saith the Son; and again, Even as I have kept My Father’s commandments,
and abide in His love978. Therefore we also say like the Apostle, Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation979:
and, We bow our knees unto the Father from whom all fatherhood in heaven and on earth is
named980: glorifying Him with the Only-begotten: for he that denieth the Father, denieth

<note type="footnote">973 Compare vi. 6: ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἀπαθῶς. The importance attached to the assertion of a “passionless generation”
arose from the objections offered by Eusebius of Nicomedia and others to the word ὁμοούσιος when proposed
by Constantine at Nicæa. We learn from Eusebius of Cæsarea (Epist ad suæ paroeciæ homines, § 4) that the
Emperor himself explained that the word was used “not in the sense of the affections (πάθη) of bodies,” because
“the immaterial, and intellectual, and incorporeal nature could not be the subject of any corporeal affection.”
Again, in § 7, Eusebius admits that “there are grounds for saying that the Son is ‘one in essence’ with the Father,
not in the way of bodies, nor like mortal beings, for He is not such by division of essence, or by severance, no,
nor by any affection, or alteration, or changing of the Father’s essence and power.” (See the next note.)</note>
<note type="footnote">974 Athanasius (Expos. Fidei, § 1): “Word not pronounced nor mental, nor an effluence of the Perfect, nor
a dividing of the passionless nature.” Also (de Decretis, § 11): “God being without parts is Father of the Son
without partition or passion; for there is neither effluence of the Immaterial, nor influx from without, as among
men.”</note>

the Son also981: and again, He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also982; knowing that
Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father983.</p>
<p>6. We worship, therefore, as the Father of Christ, the Maker of heaven and earth, the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob984; to whose honour the former temple also, over against
us here, was built. For we shall not tolerate the heretics who sever the Old Testament from
the New985, but shall believe Christ, who says concerning the temple, Wist ye not that I must
be in My Father’s house986? and again, Take these things hence, and make not my Father’s
house a house of merchandise987, whereby He most clearly confessed that the former temple
in Jerusalem was His own Father’s house. But if any one from unbelief wishes to receive
yet more proofs as to the Father of Christ being the same as the Maker of the world, let him
hear Him say again, Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and not one of them shall fall
on the ground without My Father which is in heaven988; this also, Behold the fowls of the
heaven that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly
Father feedeth them989; and this, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work990.</p>
<p>7. But lest any one from simplicity or perverse ingenuity should suppose that Christ is
but equal in honour to righteous men, from His saying, I ascend to My Father, and your991
Father, it is well to make this distinction beforehand, that the name of the Father is one, but
the power of His operation992 manifold. And Christ Himself knowing this has spoken unerringly,
I go to My Father, and your Father: not saying ‘to our Father,’ but distinguishing,
and saying first what was proper to Himself, to My Father, which was by nature; then adding,
and your Father, which was by adoption. For however high the privilege we have received

of saying in our prayers, Our Father, which art in heaven, yet the gift is of loving-kindness.
For we call Him Father, not as having been by nature begotten of Our Father which is in
heaven; but having been transferred from servitude to sonship by the grace of the Father,
through the Son and Holy Spirit, we are permitted so to speak by ineffable loving-kindness.</p>
<p>8. But if any one wishes to learn how we call God “Father,” let him hear Moses, the excellent
schoolmaster, saying, Did not this thy Father Himself buy thee, and make thee, and
create thee993? Also Esaias the Prophet, And now, O Lord. Thou art our Father: and we all
are clay, the works of Thine hands994. For most clearly has the prophetic gift declared that
not according to nature, but according to God’s grace, and by adoption, we call Him Father.</p>
<p>9. And that thou mayest learn more exactly that in the Divine Scriptures it is not by
any means the natural father only that is called father, hear what Paul says:—For though ye
should have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus
I begat you through the Gospel995. For Paul was father of the Corinthians, not by having
begotten them after the flesh, but by having taught and begotten them again after the Spirit.
Hear Job also saying, I was a father of the needy996: for he called himself a father, not as
having begotten them all, but as caring for them. And God’s Only-begotten Son Himself,
when nailed in His flesh to the tree at the time of crucifixion, on seeing Mary, His own
Mother according to the flesh, and John, the most beloved of His disciples, said to him, Behold!
thy mother, and to her, Behold! thy Son997: teaching her the parental affection due to
him998, and indirectly explaining that which is said in Luke, and His father and His mother
marvelled at Him999: words which the tribe of heretics snatch up, saying that He was begotten
of a man and a woman. For like as Mary was called the mother of John, because of her
parental affection, not from having given him birth, so Joseph also was called the father of
Christ, not from having begotten Him (for he knew her not, as the Gospel says, until she had
brought forth her first-born Son1000), but because of the care bestowed on His nurture.</p>
<p>10. Thus much then at present, in the way of a digression, to put you in remembrance.
Let me, however, add yet another testimony in proof that God is called the Father of men
in an improper sense. For when in Esaias God is addressed thus, For Thou art our Father,

though Abraham be ignorant of us1001, and Sarah travailed not with us1002, need we inquire
further on this point? And if the Psalmist says, Let them be troubled from His countenance,
the Father of the fatherless, and Judge of the widows1003, is it not manifest to all, that when
God is called the Father of orphans who have lately lost their own fathers, He is so named
not as begetting them of Himself, but as caring for them and shielding them. But whereas
God, as we have said, is in an improper sense the Father of men, of Christ alone He is the
Father by nature, not by adoption: and the Father of men in time, but of Christ before all
time, as He saith, And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory
which I had with Thee before the world was1004.</p>
<p>11. We believe then In One God the Father the Unsearchable and Ineffable, Whom no
man hath seen1005, but the Only-begotten alone hath declared Him1006. For He which is of
God, He hath seen God1007: whose face the Angels do alway behold in heaven1008, behold,
however, each according to the measure of his own rank. But the undimmed vision of the
Father is reserved in its purity for the Son with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>12. Having reached this point of my discourse, and being reminded of the passages just
before mentioned, in which God was addressed as the Father of men, I am greatly amazed
at men’s insensibility. For God with unspeakable loving-kindness deigned to be called the
Father of men,—He in heaven, they on earth,—and He the Maker of Eternity, they made
in time,—He who holdeth the earth in the hollow of His hand, they upon the earth as
grasshoppers1009. Yet man forsook his heavenly Father, and said to the stock, Thou art my
father, and to the stone, Thou hast begotten me1010. And for this reason, methinks, the
Psalmist says to mankind, Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house1011, whom
thou hast chosen for a father, whom thou hast drawn upon thyself to thy destruction.</p>

<p>13. And not only stocks and stones, but even Satan himself, the destroyer of souls, have
some ere now chosen for a father; to whom the Lord said as a rebuke, Ye do the deeds of
your father1012, that is of the devil, he being the father of men not by nature, but by fraud.
For like as Paul by his godly teaching came to be called the father of the Corinthians, so the
devil is called the father of those who of their own will consent unto him1013.</p>
<p>For we shall not tolerate those who give a wrong meaning to that saying, Hereby know
we the children of God, and the children of the devil1014, as if there were by nature some men
to be saved, and some to be lost. Whereas we come into such holy sonship not of necessity
but by choice: nor was the traitor Judas by nature a son of the devil and of perdition; for
certainly he would never have cast out devils at all in the name of Christ: for Satan casteth
not out Satan1015. Nor on the other hand would Paul have turned from persecuting to
preaching. But the adoption is in our own power, as John saith, But as many as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the children of God, even to them that believe in His
name1016. For not before their believing, but from their believing they were counted worthy
to become of their own choice the children of God.</p>
<p>14. Knowing this, therefore, let us walk spiritually, that we may be counted worthy of
God’s adoption. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God1017.
For it profiteth us nothing to have gained the title of Christians, unless the works also follow;
lest to us also it be said, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham1018.

him1020. Wherefore, my beloved children, let us by our works offer glory to our Father
which is in heaven, that they may see our good works, and glorify our Father which is in
heaven1021. Let us cast all our care upon Him, for our Father knoweth what things we have

<p>15. But while honouring our heavenly Father let us honour also the fathers of our
flesh1023: since the Lord Himself hath evidently so appointed in the Law and the Prophets,
saying, Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and thy days shall
be long in the land1024. And let this commandment be especially observed by those here
present who have fathers and mothers. Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is
well pleasing to the Lord1025. For the Lord said not, He that loveth father or mother is not
worthy of Me, lest thou from ignorance shouldest perversely mistake what was rightly written,
but He added, more than Me1026. For when our fathers on earth are of a contrary mind to
our Father in heaven, then we must obey Christ’s word. But when they put no obstacle to
godliness in our way, if we are ever carried away by ingratitude, and, forgetting their benefits
to us, hold them in contempt, then the oracle will have place which says, He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death1027.</p>
<p>16. The first virtue of godliness in Christians is to honour their parents, to requite the
troubles of those who begat them1028, and with all their might to confer on them what tends
to their comfort (for if we should repay them ever so much, yet we shall never be able to
return their gift of life1029), that they also may enjoy the comfort provided by us, and may
confirm us in those blessings which Jacob the supplanter shrewdly seized; and that our
Father in heaven may accept1030 our good purpose, and judge us worthy to shine amid
righteous as the sun in the kingdom of our Father1031: To whom be the glory, with the Onlybegotten
our Saviour Jesus Christ, and with the Holy and Life-giving Spirit, now and ever,
to all eternity. Amen.</p>

<p>Almighty.</p>
<p>Jeremiah xxxix. 18, 19 (Septuagint).
The Great, the strong God, Lord of great Counsel, and mighty in His works, the Great God,
the Lord Almighty and of great name1032.</p>
<p>1. By believing In One God we cut off all misbelief in many gods, using this as a shield
against Greeks; and every opposing power of heretics; and by adding, In One God the
Father, we contend against those of the circumcision, who deny the Only-begotten Son of
God. For, as was said yesterday, even before explaining the truths concerning our Lord Jesus
Christ, we made it manifest at once, by saying “The Father,” that He is the Father of a Son:
that as we understand that God is, so we may understand that He has a Son. But to those
titles we add that He is also “Almighty;” and this we affirm because of Greeks and Jews1033
together, and all heretics.</p>
<p>2. For of the Greeks some have said that God is the soul of the world1034: and others
that His power reaches only to heaven, and not to earth as well. Some also sharing their
error and misusing the text which says, “And Thy truth unto the clouds1035,” have dared to
circumscribe God’s providence by the clouds and the heaven, and to alienate from God the
things on earth; having forgotten the Psalm which says, If I go up into heaven, Thou art
there, if I go down into hell, Thou art present1036. For if there is nothing higher than heaven,
and if hell is deeper than the earth, He who rules the lower regions reaches the earth also.</p>
<note type="footnote">1032 The text is translated from the Septuagint, in which S. Cyril found the title Almighty (Παντοκράτωρ),
one of the usual equivalents in the Septuagint for Lord of Hosts (Sabaoth). In the English A.V. and R.V. the
passage stands thus: Jer. xxxii. 18, 19: The Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of Hosts, is His name, Great in
counsel, and mighty in work.</note>
<note type="footnote">1033 “For even the Jewish nation had wicked heresies: for of them were…the Pharisees, who ascribe the
practice of sinners to fortune and fate; and the Basmotheans, who deny providence and say that the world is
made by spontaneous motion” (Apost. Const. VI. 6). Compare Euseb. (E.H. IV. 22.)</note>
<note type="footnote">1034 Cicero, De Natura Deorum, Lib. I. 27: “Pythagoras thought that God was the soul pervading all nature.”
The doctrine was accepted both by Stoics and Platonists, and became very general. Cf. Virg. Georg. iv. 221:
Deum namque ire per omnis Terrasque, tractusque maris, cælumque profundum. and Æn. vi. 726: Spiritus intus
alit, totamque infusa per artus Meus agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.</note>
<note type="footnote">1035 Ps. xxxvi. 5. Cyril appears to have borrowed this statement from Clement of Alexandria, who states
(Stromat. V. xiv. § 91) that from this Psalm the thought occurred to Aristotle to let Providence come down as
far as to the Moon.</note>

<p>3. But heretics again, as I have said before, know not One Almighty God. For He is
Almighty who rules all things, who has power over all things. But they who say that one
God is Lord of the soul, and some other of the body, make neither of them perfect, because
either is wanting to the other1037. For how is he almighty, who has power over the soul,
but not over the body? And how is he almighty who has dominion over bodies, but no
power over spirits? But these men the Lord confutes, saying on the contrary, Rather fear
ye Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell1038. For unless the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ has the power over both, how does He subject both to punishment? For
how shall He be able to take the body which is another’s and cast it into hell, except He first
bind the strong man, and spoil his goods1039?</p>
<p><gap reason="omitted"/>4. But the Divine Scripture and the doctrines of the truth know but One God, who rules
all things by His power, but endures many things of His will. For He rules even over the
idolaters, but endures them of His forbearance: He rules also over the heretics who set Him
at nought, but bears with them because of His long-suffering: He rules even over the devil,
but bears with him of His long-suffering, not from want of power; as if defeated. For he is
the beginning of the Lord’s creation, made to be mocked1040, not by Himself, for that were
unworthy of Him, but by the Angels whom He hath made. But He suffered him to live, for
two purposes, that he might disgrace himself the more in his defeat, and that mankind might
be crowned with victory. O all wise providence of God! which takes the wicked purpose
for a groundwork of salvation for the faithful. For as He took the unbrotherly purpose of
Joseph’s brethren for a groundwork of His own dispensation, and, by permitting them to
sell their brother from hatred, took occasion to make him king whom He would; so he
permitted the devil to wrestle, that the victors might be crowned; and that when victory was
gained, he might be the more disgraced as being conquered by the weaker, and men be
greatly honoured as having conquered him who was once an Archangel.</p>
<p>5. Nothing then is withdrawn from the power of God; for the Scripture says of Him,
for all things are Thy servants1041. All things alike are His servants, but from all these One,

His only Son, and One, His Holy Spirit, are excepted; and all the things which are His servants
serve the Lord through the One Son and in the Holy Spirit. God then rules all, and of His
long-suffering endures even murderers and robbers and fornicators, having appointed a set
time for recompensing every one, that if they who have had long warning are still impenitent
in heart, they may receive the greater condemnation. They are kings of men, who reign
upon earth, but not without the power from above: and this Nebuchadnezzar once learned
by experience, when he said; For His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His power from
generation to generation1042.</p>
<p>6. Riches, and gold, and silver are not, as some think, the devil’s1043: for the whole
world of riches is for the faithful man, but for the faithless not even a penny1044. Now nothing
is more faithless than the devil; and God says plainly by the Prophet, The gold is Mine, and
the silver is Mine, and to whomsoever I will I give it1045. Do thou but use it well, and there
is no fault to be found with money: but whenever thou hast made a bad use of that which
is good, then being unwilling to blame thine own management, thou impiously throwest
back the blame upon the Creator. A man may even be justified by money: I was hungry,
and ye gave Me meat1046: that certainly was from money. I was naked, and ye clothed Me:
that certainly was by money. And wouldest thou learn that money may become a door of
the kingdom of heaven? Sell, saith He, that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven1047.</p>

nor to treat as enemies the things which God has given thee for use. Never say then that
riches are the devil’s: for though he say, All these will I give thee, for they are delivered unto
me1049, one may indeed even reject his assertion; for we need not believe the liar: and yet
perhaps he spake the truth, being compelled by the power of His presence: for he said not,
All these will I give thee, for they are mine, but, for they are delivered unto me. He grasped
not the dominion of them, but confessed that he had been entrusted1050 with them, and
was for a time dispensing them. But at a proper time interpreters should inquire whether
his statement is false or true1051.</p>

<head>Lecture IX.</head>
<p>On the Words, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of All Things Visible and Invisible.</p>
<p>Job xxxviii. 2–3</p>
<p>Who is this that hideth counsel from Me, and keepeth words in his heart, and thinketh to hide
them from Me1058?</p>
<p>1. To look upon God with eyes of flesh is impossible: for the incorporeal cannot be
subject to bodily sight: and the Only begotten Son of God Himself hath testified, saying,
No man hath seen God at any time1059. For if according to that which is written in Ezekiel
any one should understand that Ezekiel saw Him, yet what saith the Scripture? He saw the
likeness of the glory of the Lord1060; not the Lord Himself, but the likeness of His glory, not
the glory itself, as it really is. And when he saw merely the likeness of the glory, and not the
glory itself, he fell to the earth from fear. Now if the sight of the likeness of the glory brought
fear and distress upon the prophets, any one who should attempt to behold God Himself
would to a certainty lose his life, according to the saying, No man shall see My face and
live1061. For this cause God of His great loving-kindness spread out the heaven as a veil of
His proper Godhead, that we should not perish. The word is not mine, but the Prophet’s.
If Thou shalt rend the heavens, trembling will take hold of the mountains at sight of Thee,
and they will flow down1062. And why dost thou wonder that Ezekiel fell down on seeing
the likeness of the glory? when Daniel at the sight of Gabriel, though but a servant of God,
straightway shuddered and fell on his face, and, prophet as he was, dared not answer him,
until the Angel transformed himself into the likeness of a son of man1063. Now if the appearing
of Gabriel wrought trembling in the Prophets, had God Himself been seen as He
is, would not all have perished?</p>
<note type="footnote">1058 The Septuagint, from which Cyril quotes the text, differs much from the Hebrew, and from the English
Versions: Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man:

<p>2. The Divine Nature then it is impossible to see with eyes of flesh: but from the works,
which are Divine, it is possible to attain to some conception of His power, according to Solomon,
who says, For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker
of them is seen1064. He said not that from the creatures the Maker is seen, but added proportionably.
For God appears the greater to every man in proportion as he has grasped a larger
survey of the creatures: and when his heart is uplifted by that larger survey, he gains withal
a greater conception of God.</p>
<p>3. Wouldest thou learn that to comprehend the nature of God is impossible? The Three
Children in the furnace of fire, as they hymn the praises of God, say Blessed art thou that
beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the Cherubim1065. Tell me what is the nature of the
Cherubim, and then look upon Him who sitteth upon them. And yet Ezekiel the Prophet
even made a description of them, as far as was possible, saying that every one has four faces,
one of a man, another of a lion, another of an eagle, and another of a calf; and that each one
had six wings1066, and they had eyes on all sides; and that under each one was a wheel of
four sides. Nevertheless though the Prophet makes the explanation, we cannot yet understand
it even as we read. But if we cannot understand the throne, which he has described, how
shall we be able to comprehend Him who sitteth thereon, the Invisible and Ineffable God?
To scrutinise then the nature of God is impossible: but it is in our power to send up praises
of His glory for His works that are seen.</p>
<p>4. These things I say to you because of the following context of the Creed, and because
we say, We Believe in One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of
All Things Visible and Invisible; in order that we may remember that the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ is the same as He that made the heaven and the earth1067, and that we may

since He is incomprehensible.”</note>

<note type="footnote">1066 In Ezekiel i. 6–11, the four living creatures have each four wings, as also in x. 21 according to the Hebrew.
But in the latter passage, according to the Vatican text of the Septuagint, each has eight wings, as Codd. R. and
Casaub. read here. Cyril seems to have confused the number in Ezekiel with that in Is. vi. 2: each one had six
wings. By “a wheel of four sides” Cyril explains Ez. i. 16: a wheel in the midst of a wheel, as meaning two circles
set at right angles to each other, like the equator and meridian on a globe.</note>
<note type="footnote">1067 Compare Cat. iv. 4. Irenæus (I. x. 1): “The Church, though dispersed throughout the whole world, even
to the ends of the earth, yet received from the Apostles and their disciples the Faith in One God the Father
Almighty, Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea and all that therein is.” Tertullian (de Præscriptione Hæret.
cap. xiii.) “The rule of faith is that whereby we believe that there is One God only, and none other than the
Creator of the world, who brought forth all things out of nothing through His own Word first of all sent forth.”</note>

make ourselves safe against the wrong paths of the godless heretics, who have dared to speak
evil of the All wise Artificer of all this world1068, men who see with eyes of flesh, but have
the eyes of their understanding blinded.</p>
<p>5. For what fault have they to find with the vast creation of God?—they, who ought to
have been struck with amazement on beholding the vaultings of the heavens: they, who
ought to have worshipped Him who reared the sky as a dome, who out of the fluid nature
of the waters formed the stable substance of the heaven. For God said, Let there be a firmament
in the midst of the water1069. God spake once for all, and it stands fast, and falls not.
The heaven is water, and the orbs therein, sun, moon, and stars are of fire: and how do the
orbs of fire run their course in the water? But if any one disputes this because of the opposite
natures of fire and water, let him remember the fire which in the time of Moses in Egypt
flamed amid the hail, and observe the all-wise workmanship of God. For since there was
need of water, because the earth was to be tilled, He made the heaven above of water that
when the region of the earth should need watering by showers, the heaven might from its
nature be ready for this purpose.</p>
<p>6. But what? Is there not cause to wonder when one looks at the constitution of the
sun? For being to the sight as it were a small body he contains a mighty power; appearing
from the East, and sending forth his light unto the West: whose rising at dawn the Psalmist
described, saying: And he cometh forth out of his chamber as a bridegroom1070. He was
describing the brightness and moderation of his state on first becoming visible unto men:
for when he rides at high noon, we often flee from his blaze: but at his rising he is welcome
to all as a bridegroom to look on.</p>
<p>Observe also his arrangement (or rather not his, but the arrangement of Him who by
an ordinance determined his course), how in summer he rises higher and makes the days
longer, giving men good time for their works: but in winter contracts his course, that the
period of cold may be increased, and that the nights becoming longer may contribute to
men’s rest, and contribute also to the fruitfulness of the products of the earth1071. See also

the constitution of most vegetables: or the construction of vegetables is so adjusted as to be suited to the length
which the year really has, and unsuited to a duration longer or shorter by any considerable portion. The vegetable
clock-work is so set as to go for a year.” Ibid. p. 34: “The terrestrial day, and consequently the length of the
cycle of light and darkness, being what it is, we find various parts of the constitution both of animals and vegetables,
which have a periodical character in their functions, corresponding to the diurnal succession of external</note>

how the days alternately respond each to other in due order, in summer increasing, and in
winter diminishing; but in spring and autumn granting equal intervals one to another. And
the nights again complete the like courses; so that the Psalmist also says of them, Day unto
day uttereth speech, and night unto night proclaimeth knowledge1072. For to the heretics
who have no ears, they all but cry aloud, and by their good order say, that there is none
other God save the Creator who hath set them their bounds, and laid out the order of the
Universe1073.</p>
<p>7. But let no one tolerate any who say that one is the Creator of the light, and another

and created darkness1075. Why, O man, art thou vexed thereat? Why art thou offended at
the time that is given thee for rest1076? A servant would have had no rest from his masters,
had not the darkness necessarily brought a respite. And often after wearying ourselves in
the day, how are we refreshed in the night, and he who was yesterday worn with toils, rises
vigorous in the morning because of the night’s rest1077? And what more helpful to wisdom
than the night1078? For herein oftentimes we set before our minds the things of God; and
herein we read and contemplate the Divine Oracles. And when is our mind most attuned
to Psalmody and Prayer? Is it not at night? And when have we often called our own sins
to remembrance? Is not at night1079? Let us not then admit the evil thought, that another
is the maker of darkness: for experience shews that this also is good and useful.

steers his ship by looking at the stars. For of these matters the Scripture says well, And let

their members amiss; and the Maker thereof is wise. Who prepared the recesses of the
womb for child-bearing? Who gave life to the lifeless thing within it? Who knitted us with
sinews and bones, and clothed us with skin and flesh1110, and, as soon as the child was born,
brought streams of milk out of the breasts? How grows the babe into a boy, and the boy
into a youth, and then into a man; and, still the same, passes again into an old man, while
no one notices the exact change from day to day? Of the food, how is one part changed into
blood, and another separated for excretion, and another part changed into flesh? Who gives
to the heart its unceasing motion? Who wisely guarded the tenderness of the eyes with the
fence of the eyelids1111? For as to the complicated and wonderful contrivance of the eyes,
the voluminous books of the physicians hardly give us explanation. Who distributes the
one breath to the whole body? Thou seest, O man, the Artificer, thou seest the wise Creator.</p>

<p>Note.—In the manuscripts which contain this discourse under the name of “A Homily
of S. Basil on God as Incomprehensible,” some portions are changed to suit that subject: but
the conclusion especially is marked by great addition and variation, which it is well to reproduce
here. Accordingly in place of the words in §15: τί μεμπτόν, “What is there to find
fault with?” and the following, the manuscripts before mentioned have it thus:</p>
<p>“What is there to find fault with in the framing of the body? Come forth into the midst
and speak. Control thine own will, and nothing evil shall proceed from any of thy members.
For every one of these has of necessity been made for our use. Chasten thy reasoning unto
piety, submit to God’s commandments, and none of these members sin in working and
serving in the uses for which they were made. If thou be not willing, the eye sees not amiss,
the ear hears nothing which it ought not, the hand is not stretched out for wicked greed,
the foot walketh not towards injustice, thou hast no strange loves, committest no fornication,
covetest not thy neighbour’s wife. Drive out wicked thoughts from thine heart, be as God
made thee, and thou wilt rather give thanks to thy Creator.</p>
<p>Adam at first was without clothing, faring daintily in Paradise: and after he had received
the commandment, but failed to keep it, and wickedly stretched forth his hand (not because
the hand wished this, but because his will stretched forth his hand to that which was forbidden),
because of his disobedience he lost also the good things he had received. Thus the
members are not the cause of sin to those who use them, but the wicked mind, as the Lord
says, For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, fornications, adulteries, envyings, and such
like. In what things thou choosest, therein thy limbs serve thee; they are excellently made
for the service of the soul: they are provided as servants to thy reason. Guide them well by
the motion of piety; bridle them by the fear of God; bring them into subjection to the desire
of temperance and abstinence, and they will never rise up against thee to tyrannise over
thee; but rather they will guard thee, and help thee more mightily in thy victory over the
devil, while expecting also the incorruptible and everlasting crown of the victory. Who
openeth the chambers of the womb? Who, U+0026c.” </p>

Him in His unsearchable works, and concerning Him whom thou art not capable of

in faith adore, according to the divine Word, than daringly to search after things which
neither thou canst reach, nor Holy Scripture hath delivered to thee. These points my discourse
has now treated at large, that thou mayest abhor those who blaspheme the wise and
good Artificer, and rather mayest thyself also say, How wonderful are Thy works O Lord; in
wisdom hast Thou made them all. To Thee be the glory, and power, and worship, with the

<p>On the Clause, and in One Lord Jesus Christ, with a Reading from the First Epistle
to the Corinthians</p>
<p>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth1114; yet to us there is
One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom are all things, and we through Him.</p>
<p>1. They who have been taught to believe “In One God the Father Almighty,” ought also
to believe in His Only-begotten Son. For he that denieth the Son, the same hath not the
Father1115. I am the Door1116, saith Jesus; no one cometh unto the Father but through Me1117.
For if thou deny the Door, the knowledge concerning the Father is shut off from thee. No
man knoweth the father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him1118.
For if thou deny Him who reveals, thou remainest in ignorance. There is a sentence in the
Gospels, saying, He that believeth not on the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God
abideth on him.1119 For the Father hath indignation when the Only-begotten Son is set at
nought. For it is grievous to a king that merely his soldier should be dishonoured; and when
one of his nobler officers or friends is dishonoured, then his anger is greatly increased: but
if any should do despite to the king’s only-begotten son himself, who shall appease the
father’s indignation on behalf of his only-begotten son?</p>
<p>2. If, therefore, any one wishes to shew piety towards God, let him worship the Son,
since otherwise the Father accepts not his service. The Father spake with a loud voice from
heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased1120. The Father was well
pleased; unless thou also be well pleased in Him, thou hast not life. Be not thou carried
away with the Jews when they craftily say, There is one God alone; but with the knowledge
that God is One, know that there is also an Only-begotten Son of God. I am not the first to
say this, but the Psalmist in the person of the Son saith, The Lord said unto Me, Thou art
My Son1121. Heed not therefore what the Jews say, but what the Prophets say. Dost thou
wonder that they who stoned and slew the Prophets, set at nought the Prophets’ words?</p>

<p>3. Believe thou In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God. For we say
“One Lord Jesus Christ,” that His Sonship may be “Only-begotten:” we say “One,” that
thou mayest not suppose another: we say “One,” that thou mayest not profanely diffuse the
many names1122 of His action among many sons. For He is called a Door1123; but take not
the name literally for a thing of wood, but a spiritual, a living Door, discriminating those
who enter in. He is called a Way1124, not one trodden by feet, but leading to the Father in
heaven; He is called a Sheep1125, not an irrational one, but the one which through its precious
blood cleanses the world from its sins, which is led before the shearers, and knows when to
be silent. This Sheep again is called a Shepherd, who says, I am the Good Shepherd1126: a
Sheep because of His manhood, a Shepherd because of the loving-kindness of His Godhead.
And wouldst thou know that there are rational sheep? the Saviour says to the Apostles, Behold,
I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves1127. Again, He is called a Lion1128, not as a devourer
of men, but indicating as it were by the title His kingly, and stedfast, and confident nature:
a Lion He is also called in opposition to the lion our adversary, who roars and devours those
who have been deceived1129. For the Saviour came, not as having changed the gentleness
of His own nature, but as the strong Lion of the tribe of Judah1130, saving them that believe,
but treading down the adversary. He is called a Stone, not a lifeless stone, cut out by men’s
hands, but a chief corner-stone1131, on whom whosoever believeth shall not be put to shame.</p>
<p>4. He is called Christ, not as having been anointed by men’s hands, but eternally
anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf of men1132. He is called Dead,

not as having abode among the dead, as all in Hades, but as being alone free among the
dead1133. He is called Son of Man, not as having had His generation from earth, as each of
us, but as coming upon the clouds To Judge Both Quick and Dead1134. He is called Lord,
not improperly as those who are so called among men, but as having a natural and eternal
Lordship1135. He is called Jesus by a fitting name, as having the appellation from His
salutary healing. He is called Son, not as advanced by adoption, but as naturally begotten.
And many are the titles of our Saviour; lest, therefore, His manifold appellations should
make thee think of many sons, and because of the errors of the heretics, who say that Christ

who have need of gladness He becomes a Vine; and to those who want to enter in He stands
as a Door; and to those who need to offer up their prayers He stands a mediating High
Priest. Again, to those who have sins He becomes a Sheep, that He may be sacrificed for
them. He is made all things to all men1138, remaining in His own nature what He is. For
so remaining, and holding the dignity of His Sonship in reality unchangeable, He adapts
Himself to our infirmities, just as some excellent physician or compassionate teacher; though

His Lordship from nature, and is not called Lord improperly1140, as we are, but is so in
verity, since by the Father’s bidding1141 He is Lord of His own works. For our lordship is
over men of equal rights and like passions, nay often over our elders, and often a young
master rules over aged servants. But in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lordship is not
so: but He is first Maker, then Lord1142: first He made all things by the Father’s will, then,
He is Lord of the things which were made by Him.</p>

virtue, or what advancement (προκοπή) and promotion in humiliation?” The same doctrine had been previously

was by advance (ἐκ προκοπῆς) made God, from being made by nature a mere man: see Athanas. (de Decretis,

<note type="footnote">1142 Origen (De Principiis, I. ii. 10) had argued that “even God cannot be called omnipotent, unless there
exist those over whom He may exercise His power,” and therefore creation must have been eternal, or God
could not have been eternally Omnipotent. In other passages Origen declares it an impiety to hold that matter
is co-eternal with God (De Princip. II. i. 4), and yet maintains that there were other worlds before this, and that
there was never a time when there was no world existing. Methodius, in a fragment of his work On things Created,
preserved by Photius, and quoted by Bishop Bull (Def. Fid. Nic. II. xiii. 9), argues against these theories of Origen,
that in John i. 2 the words “The same was in the beginning with God” indicate the authority (τὸ ἐξουσιαστικόν)
of the Word which He had with the Father before the world came into existence; since from all eternity God
the Father, together with His Word, possessed the Almighty power whereby whenever He would He could create
worlds to rule over. Dean Church remarks that “On the other hand Tertullian, contra Hermog. 3, considering
the attributes in question to belong not to the Divine Nature, but Office, denies that God was Almighty (Lord?)
from eternity; while the Greeks affirmed this (vid. Cyril Alex. in Joann. xvii. 8, p. 963; Athan. Orat. ii. 12–14),
as understanding by the term the inherent but latent attribute of doing what He had not yet done, τὸ
ἐξουσιαστικόν.” Cleopas, the Jerusalem Editor, regards the passage as directed against Paul of Samosata, who
asserted that Christ had become God, and received His kingdom and Lordship only after His Incarnation, and
remarks:—“S. Cyril evidently regards the Lordship of Jesus Christ as twofold: one that which from eternity belonged
to Him as God, which he calls natural, according to which ‘He was ever both Lord and King, as being
by nature God’ (Cyril Alex. in Johann. cap. xvii.); and the other the Lordship in time relative to the creatures,
by which He exercises dominion over the works created by Him, as being their Maker.“</note>

<p>6. Christ the Lord is He who was born in the city of David1143. And wouldest thou know
that Christ is Lord with the Father even before His Incarnation1144, that thou mayest not
only accept the statement by faith, but mayest also receive proof from the Old Testament?
Go to the first book, Genesis: God saith, Let us make man, not ‘in My image,’ but, in Our
image1145. And after Adam was made, the sacred writer says, And God created man; in the
image of God created He him1146. For he did not limit the dignity of the Godhead to the
Father alone, but included the Son also: that it might be shewn that man is not only the
work of God, but also of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is Himself also Very God. This Lord,
who works together with the Father, wrought with Him also in the case of Sodom, according
to the Scripture: And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone from
the Lord out of heaven1147. This Lord is He who afterwards was seen of Moses, as much as
he was able to see. For the Lord is loving unto man, ever condescending to our infirmities.</p>
<p>7. Moreover, that you may be sure that this is He who was seen of Moses, hear Paul’s
testimony, when he says, For they all drank of a spiritual rock that followed them; and the
rock was Christ1148. And again: By faith Moses forsook Egypt1149, and shortly after he says,
accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt1150. This Moses
says to Him, Shew me Thyself. Thou seest that the Prophets also in those times saw the
Christ, that is, as far as each was able. Shew me Thyself, that I may see Thee with understanding1151.
But He saith, There shall no man see My face, and live1152. For this reason then,
because no man could see the face of the Godhead and live, He took on Him the face of
human nature, that we might see this and live. And yet when He wished to shew even that
with a little majesty, when His face did shine as the sun1153, the disciples fell down affrighted.
If then His bodily countenance, shining not in the full power of Him that wrought, but ac-

cording to the capacity of the Disciples, affrighted them, so that even thus they could not
bear it, how could any man gaze upon the majesty of the Godhead? ‘A great thing,’ saith
the Lord, ‘thou desirest, O Moses: and I approve thine insatiable desire, and I will do this
thing1154 for thee, but according as thou art able. Behold, I will put thee in the clift of the
rock1155: for as being little, thou shalt lodge in a little space.’</p>
<p>8. Now here I wish you to make safe what I am going to say, because of the Jews. For
our object is to prove that the Lord Jesus Christ was with the Father. The Lord then says to
Moses, I will pass by before thee with My glory, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before
thee1156. Being Himself the Lord, what Lord doth He proclaim? Thou seest how He was
covertly teaching the godly doctrine of the Father and the Son. And again, in what follows
it is written word for word: And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed,
The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and
truth, both keeping righteousness and shewing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities,
and transgressions, and sins1157. Then in what follows, Moses bowed his head and worshipped1158
before the Lord who proclaimed the Father, and said: Go Thou then, O Lord,
in the midst of us1159.</p>
<p>9. This is the first proof: receive now a second plain one. The Lord said unto my Lord,
sit Thou on My right hand1160. The Lord says this to the Lord, not to a servant, but to the
Lord of all, and His own Son, to whom He put all things in subjection. But when He saith
that all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted, which did put all things
under Him, and what follows; that God may be all in all1161. The Only-begotten Son is Lord
of all, but the obedient Son of the Father, for He grasped not the Lordship1162, but received
it by nature of the Father’s own will. For neither did the Son grasp it, nor the Father grudge

according to the Angel who said to the shepherds, I bring you good tidings of great joy, that
unto you is born this day in the city of David Christ the Lord1164: of whom an Apostle says
elsewhere, The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace
by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all1165. But when he says, of all, do thou except nothing from
His Lordship: for whether Angels, or Archangels, or principalities, or powers, or any created
thing named by the Apostles, all are under the Lordship of the Son. Of Angels He is Lord,
as thou hast it in the Gospels, Then the Devil departed from Him, and the Angels came and
ministered unto Him1166; for the Scripture saith not, they succoured Him, but they ministered
unto Him, that is, like servants. When He was about to be born of a Virgin, Gabriel was
then His servant, having received His service as a peculiar dignity. When He was about to
go into Egypt, that He might overthrow the gods of Egypt made with hands1167, again an
Angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream1168. After He had been crucified, and had risen again,
an Angel brought the good tidings, and as a trustworthy servant said to the women, Go, tell
His disciples that He is risen, and goeth before you into Galilee; lo, I have told you1169: almost

likeness and identity of what He hath, should wander into the impiety of Sabellius, considering Him to be the
Father, therefore He has said, Was given unto Me, and I received, and Were delivered to Me, only to shew that
He is not the Father, but the Father’s Word, and the Eternal Son, who, because of His likeness to the Father, has
eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what eternally He hath.”</note>

as if he had said, “I have not neglected my command, I protest that I have told you; that if
ye disregard it, the blame may not be on me, but on those who disregard it.” This then is
the One Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the lesson just now read speaks: For though there be
many that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, and so on, yet to us there is One
God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things, and we through Him1170.</p>
<p>11. And He is called by two names, Jesus Christ; Jesus, because He saves,—Christ, because
He is a Priest1171. And knowing this the inspired Prophet Moses conferred these two
titles on two men distinguished above all1172: his own successor in the government, Auses1173,
he renamed Jesus; and his own brother Aaron he surnamed Christ1174, that by two
well-approved men he might represent at once both the High Priesthood, and the Kingship
of the One Jesus Christ who was to come. For Christ is a High Priest like Aaron; since He
glorified not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He that spake unto Him, Thou art a Priest
for ever after the order of Melchizedek1175. And Jesus the son of Nave was in many things
a type of Him. For when he began to rule over the people, he began from Jordan1176, whence
Christ also, after He was baptized, began to preach the gospel. And the son of Nave appoints
twelve to divide the inheritance1177; and twelve Apostles Jesus sends forth, as heralds of the
truth, into all the world. The typical Jesus saved Rahab the harlot when she believed: and
the true Jesus says, Behold, the publicans and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of
God1178. With only a shout the walls of Jericho fell down in the time of the type: and because

transgressors.</p>
<p>12. There is One Lord Jesus Christ, a wondrous name, indirectly announced beforehand
by the Prophets. For Esaias the Prophet says, Behold, thy Saviour cometh, having His own
reward1180. Now Jesus in Hebrew is by interpretation Saviour. For the Prophetic gift,
foreseeing the murderous spirit of the Jews against their Lord1181, veiled His name, lest
from knowing it plainly beforehand they might plot against Him readily. But He was openly
called Jesus not by men, but by an Angel, who came not by his own authority, but was sent
by the power of God, and said to Joseph, Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that
which is conceivedin her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt
call His name Jesus1182. And immediately he renders the reason of this name, saying, for
He shall save His people from their sins. Consider how He who was not yet born could have
a people, unless He was in being before He was born1183. This also the Prophet says in His
person, From the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of My name1184; because the
Angel foretold that He should be called Jesus. And again concerning Herod’s plot again he
says, And under the shadow of His hand hath He hid Me1185.</p>
<p>13. Jesus then means according to the Hebrew “Saviour,” but in the Greek tongue “The

body1186, and leading minds into light, healing the visibly lame, and guiding sinners’ steps
to repentance, saying to the palsied, Sin no more, and, Take up thy bed and walk1187. For
since the body was palsied for the sin of the soul, He ministered first to the soul that He
might extend the healing to the body. If, therefore, any one is suffering in soul from sins,
there is the Physician for him: and if any one here is of little faith, let him say to Him, Help
Thou mine unbelief1188. If any is encompassed also with bodily ailments, let him not be

Priesthood in time1192, nor having any successor in His High-Priesthood: as thou heardest
on the Lord’s day, when we were discoursing in the congregation1193 on the phrase, After
the Order of Melchizedek. He received not the High-Priesthood from bodily succession, nor
was He anointed with oil prepared by man1194, but before all ages by the Father; and He so
far excels the others as with an oath He is made Priest: For they are priests without an oath,
but He with an oath by Him that said, The Lord sware, and will not repent1195. The mere
purpose of the Father was sufficient for surety: but the mode of assurance is twofold, namely
that with the purpose there follows the oath also, that by two immutable things, in which it

others the flesh which He took upon Him from the Virgin, according to the Apostle’s word,
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels1199. The Prophet was not ignorant of Him, when
He said, and announceth unto men His Christ1200. Moses also knew Him, Isaiah knew Him,
and Jeremiah; not one of the Prophets was ignorant of Him. Even devils recognised Him,
for He rebuked them, and the Scripture says, because they knew that He was Christ1201. The
Chief-priests knew Him not, and the devils confessed Him: the Chief Priests knew Him
not, and a woman of Samaria proclaimed Him, saying, Come, see a man which told me all
things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ1202?</p>
<p>16. This is Jesus Christ who came a High-Priest of the good things to come1203; who for
the bountifulness of His Godhead imparted His own title to us all. For kings among men
have their royal style which others may not share: but Jesus Christ being the Son of God
gave us the dignity of being called Christians. But some one will say, The name of “Christians”
is new, and was not in use aforetime1204: and new-fashioned phrases are often objected
to on the score of strangeness1205. The prophet made this point safe beforehand, saying,
But upon My servants shall a new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the earth1206.
Let us question the Jews: Are ye servants of the Lord, or not? Shew then your new name.
For ye were called Jews and Israelites in the time of Moses, and the other prophets, and after
the return from Babylon, and up to the present time: where then is your new name? But
we, since we are servants of the Lord, have that new name: new indeed, but the new name,
which shall be blessed upon the earth. This name caught the world in its grasp: for Jews are
only in a certain region, but Christians reach to the ends of the world: for it is the name of
the Only-begotten Son of God that is proclaimed.</p>

but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake1208. Who then is this?
The former persecutor. O mighty wonder! The former persecutor himself preaches Christ.
But wherefore? Was he bribed? Nay there was none to use this mode of persuasion. But
was it that he saw Him present on earth, and was abashed? He had already been taken up
into heaven. He went forth to persecute, and after three days the persecutor is a preacher
in Damascus. By what power? Others call friends as witnesses for friends but I have
presented to you as a witness the former enemy: and dost thou still doubt? The testimony
of Peter and John, though weighty, was yet of a kind open to suspicion: for they were His
friends. But of one who was formerly his enemy, and afterwards dies for His sake, who can
any longer doubt the truth?</p>
<p>18. At this point of my discourse I am truly filled with wonder at the wise dispensation
of the Holy Spirit; how He confined the Epistles of the rest to a small number, but to Paul
the former persecutor gave the privilege of writing fourteen. For it was not because Peter
or John was less that He restrained the gift; God forbid! But in order that the doctrine might
be beyond question, He granted to the former enemy and persecutor the privilege of writing
more, in order that we all might thus be made believers. For all were amazed at Paul, and
said, Is not this he that was formerly a persecutor1209? Did he not come hither, that he might
lead us away bound to Jerusalem? Be not amazed, said Paul, I know that it is hard for me
to kick against the pricks: I know that I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I
persecuted the Church of God1210; but I did it in ignorance1211: for I thought that the
preaching of Christ was destruction of the Law, and knew not that He came Himself to fulfil
the Law and not to destroy it1212. But the grace of God was exceeding abundant in me1213.</p>

witness from heaven of His Son: the Holy Ghost bears witness, descending bodily in likeness

prepared before the face of all people1216. Anna also, the prophetess, a most devout widow,
of austere life, bears witness of Him. John the Baptist bears witness, the greatest among the
Prophets, and leader of the New Covenant, who in a manner united both Covenants in
Himself, the Old and the New. Jordan is His witness among rivers; the sea of Tiberias among
seas: blind and lame bear witness, and dead men raised to life, and devils saying, What have
we to do with Thee, Jesus? we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of God1217. Winds

been a little while His enemy, but for a long time His servant: the Twelve Apostles are His
witnesses, having preached the truth not only in words, but also by their own torments and

<head>On the Words, the Only-Begotten Son of God, Begotten of the Father Very God
Before All Ages, by Whom All Things Were Made.</head>
<p>Hebrews i. 1</p>
<p>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the Fathers by the
Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son.</p>
<p>1. That we have hope in Jesus Christ has been sufficiently shewn, according to our
ability, in what we delivered to you yesterday. But we must not simply believe in Christ Jesus
nor receive Him as one of the many who are improperly called Christs1232. For they were
figurative Christs, but He is the true Christ; not having risen by advancement1233 from
among men to the Priesthood, but ever having the dignity of the Priesthood from the
Father1234. And for this cause the Faith guarding us beforehand lest we should suppose
Him to be one of the ordinary Christs, adds to the profession of the Faith, that we believe
In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>2. And again on hearing of a “Son,” think not of an adopted son but a Son by nature1235,
an Only-begotten Son, having no brother. For this is the reason why He is called “Onlybegotten,”
because in the dignity of the Godhead, and His generation from the Father, He
has no brother. But we call Him the Son of God, not of ourselves, but because the Father
Himself named Christ1236 His Son1237: and a true name is that which is set by fathers upon
their children1238.</p>

Again (c. Arian. Orat. iii. 19), he says, “This is the true God and the Life eternal, and we are made sons through
Him by adoption and grace (θέσει καὶ χάριτι).” Cf. vii. 10, and § 4, below.</note>

<p>3. Our Lord Jesus Christ erewhile became Man, but by the many He was unknown.
Wishing, therefore, to teach that which was not known, He called together His disciples,
and asked them, Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am1239? —not from vain-glory,
but wishing to shew them the truth, lest dwelling with God, the Only-begotten of God1240,
they should think lightly of Him as if He were some mere man. And when they answered
that some said Elias, and some Jeremias, He said to them, They may be excused for not
knowing, but ye, My Apostles, who in My name cleanse lepers, and cast out devils, and raise
the dead, ought not to be ignorant of Him, through whom ye do these wondrous works.
And when they all became silent (for the matter was too high for man to learn), Peter, the
foremost of the Apostles and chief herald1241 of the Church, neither aided by cunning invention,
nor persuaded by human reasoning, but enlightened in his mind from the Father,
says to Him, Thou art the Christ, not only so, but the Son of the living God. And there follows
a blessing upon his speech (for in truth it was above man), and as a seal upon what he had
said, that it was the Father who had revealed it to him. For the Saviour says, Blessed art
thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but My Father which is
in heaven1242. He therefore who acknowledges our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, partakes
of this blessedness; but he who denies the Son of God is a poor and miserable man.</p>
<p>4. Again, I say, on hearing of a Son, understand it not merely in an improper sense, but
as a Son in truth, a Son by nature, without beginning1243; not as having come out of bondage

<note type="footnote">1243 Athanasius (de Synodis, § 15) quotes a passage from the Thalia of Arius, in which he says: “We praise
Him as without beginning, because of Him who has a beginning: and adore Him as eternal, because of Him
who in time has come to be. He who is without beginning made the Son a beginning of things created.” It is
important, therefore, to notice the sense in which Cyril here calls the Son ἄναρχος. The word has two meanings,
which should be clearly distinguished, (i) unoriginate, (ii) without beginning in time. The former referring to
origin, or cause, can properly be applied to the One true God, or to God the Father only, as it is used by Clement
of Alexandria (Protrept. cap. v. § 65: τὸν πάντων ποιητὴν…ἀγνοοῦντες, τὸν ἄναρχον Θεόν. [Strom. IV. cap.
xxv. § 164: ὁ Θεὸς δὲ ἄναρχος ἀρχὴ τῶν ὅλων παντελὴς ἀρχῆς ποιητικός]. [Stromat. V. cap. xiv. § 142: ἐξ
ἀρχῆς ἀνάρχου]. Methodius (ob. 312 a.d. circ.) in a fragment (On things created, § 8, English Trans. Clark’s
Ante-Nic. Libr.) comments thus on John i. 1–3: “And so after the peculiar unbeginning beginning, who is the
Father, He (the Word) is the beginning of other things, ‘by whom all things are made.’” In this sense Cyril has</note>

<pb n="219"/>
into a higher state of adoption1244, but a Son eternally begotten by an inscrutable and incomprehensible
generation. And in like manner on hearing of the First-born1245, think
not that this is after the manner of men; for the first-born among men have other brothers
also. And it is somewhere written, Israel is My son, My first-born1246. But Israel is, as Reuben
was, a first-born son rejected: for Reuben went up to his father’s couch; and Israel cast his
Father’s Son out of the vineyard, and crucified Him.</p>
<p>To others also the Scripture says, Ye are the sons of the Lord your God1247: and in another
place, I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are all sons of the Most High1248. I have said,
not, “I have begotten.” They, when God so said, received the sonship, which before they
had not: but He was not begotten to be other than He was before; but was begotten from
the beginning Son of the Father, being above all beginning and all ages, Son of the Father,
in all things like1249 to Him who begat Him, eternal of a Father eternal, Life of Life begotten,
<note type="footnote">said (iv. 4) that God alone is “unbegotten, unoriginate:” and in xi. 20 he explains this more fully,—“Suffer none
to speak of a beginning of the Son in time (χῥονικὴν ἀρχήν), but as a timeless beginning acknowledge the
Father. For the Father is the beginning of the Son, timeless, incomprehensible, without beginning.” From a
confusion of the two meanings the word came to be improperly applied in the sense of “unoriginate” to the Son,
and to the Spirit; and this improper usage is condemned in the 49th Apostolic Canon, which Hefele regards as
amongst the most ancient Canons, and taken from the Apostolic Constitutions, vi. 11: “If any Bishop or Presbyter
shall baptize not according to our Lord’s ordinance into the Father, and Son, and Spirit, but into three Unoriginates,
or three Sons, or three Paracletes let him be deposed.” (ii.) Athanasius frequently calls the Son ἄναρχος in
the sense of ‘timeless,’ as being the co-eternal brightness (ἀπαύγασμα) of the Eternal Light: see de Sent. Dionys.
§§ 15, 16, 22; “God is the Eternal Light, which never either began or shall cease: accordingly the Brightness is
ever before Him, and co-exists with Him, without beginning and ever-begotten (ἄναρχον καὶ ἀειγενές).”</note>

be both Only-begotten and Firstborn, except in different relations;—that is, Only-begotten, because of His
generation from the father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension to the creation, and

<p>5. If then thou hear the Gospel saying, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the
Son of David, the Son of Abraham1251, understand “according to the flesh.” For He is the
Son of David at the end of the ages1252, but the Son of God Before All Ages, without beginning1253.
The one, which before He had not, He received; but the other, which He hath,
He hath eternally as begotten of the Father. Two fathers He hath: one, David, according
to the flesh, and one, God, His Father in a Divine manner1254. As the Son of David, He is
subject to time, and to handling, and to genealogical descent: but as Son according to the
Godhead1255, He is subject neither to time nor to place, nor to genealogical descent: for
His generation who shall declare1256? God is a Spirit1257; He who is a Spirit hath spiritually
begotten, as being incorporeal, an inscrutable and incomprehensible generation. The Son
Himself says of the Father, The Lord said unto Me, Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten
Thee1258. Now this to-day is not recent, but eternal: a timeless to-day, before all ages. From
the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten Thee1259.</p>

generation, and “This day” to the birth in time: whereas in the received text, followed in our translation, σήμερον
refers to the timeless and eternal generation of the Son. The former interpretation of Ps. ii. 7 is found in many
Fathers, as for example in Tertullian (adv. Prax. vii. xi.), and Methodius (Conviv. Virg. VIII. cap. ix.): “He says
‘Thou art,’ and not ‘Thou hast become,’ shewing that He had not recently attained to the position of Son.…But
the expression, ‘This day have I begotten Thee,’ signifies that He willed that existing already before the ages in
heaven He should also be begotten for the world, that is that He who was before unknown should be made</note>

<p>6. Believe thou therefore on Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, and a Son Only-Begotten,
according to the Gospel which says, For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only-begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life1260.
And again,He that believeth on the Son is not judged, but hath passed out of death into life1261.
But he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him1262.
And John testified concerning Him, saying, And we beheld His glory, glory as of the onlybegotten
from the father,—full of grace and truth1263: at whom the devils trembled and said,
Ah! what have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of the living God1264.</p>
<p>7. He is then the Son of God by nature and not by adoption1265, begotten of the Father.
And he that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him1266; but he that
despiseth Him that is begotten casts back the insult upon Him who begat. And whenever
thou hear of God begetting, sink not down in thought to bodily things, nor think of a corruptible
generation, lest thou be guilty of impiety. God is a Spirit1267, His generation is
spiritual: for bodies beget bodies, and for the generation of bodies time needs must intervene;
but time intervenes not in the generation of the Son from the Father. And in our case what
is begotten is begotten imperfect: but the Son of God was begotten perfect; for what He is
now, that is He also from the beginning1268, begotten without beginning. We are begotten
so as to pass from infantile ignorance to a state of reason: thy generation, O man, is imperfect,
for thy growth is progressive. But think not that it is thus in His case, nor impute infirmity
to Him who hath begotten. For if that which He begot was imperfect, and acquired its
perfection in time, thou art imputing infirmity to Him who hath begotten; if so be, the
Father did not bestow from the beginning that which, as thou sayest, time bestowed afterwards1269.</p>

<p>8. Think not therefore that this generation is human, nor as Abraham begat Isaac. For
in begetting Isaac, Abraham begat not what he would, but what another granted. But in
God the Father’s begetting there is neither ignorance nor intermediate deliberation1270.
For to say that He knew not what He was begetting is the greatest impiety; and it is no less
impious to say, that after deliberation in time He then became a Father. For God was not
previously without a Son, and afterwards in time became a Father; but hath the Son eternally,
having begotten Him not as men beget men, but as Himself only knoweth, who begat Him
before all ages Very God.</p>
<p>9. For the Father being Very God begat the Son like unto Himself, Very God1271; not
as teachers beget disciples, not as Paul says to some, For in Christ Jesus I begat you through
the Gospel1272. For in this case he who was not a son by nature became a son by discipleship,
but in the former case He was a Son by nature, a true Son. Not as ye, who are to be illuminated,
are now becoming sons of God: for ye also become sons, but by adoption of grace, as
it is written, But as many as received Him, to them gave He the right to become children of
God, even to them that believe on His name: which were begotten not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God1273. And we indeed are begotten of water and
of the Spirit, but not thus was Christ begotten of the Father. For at the time of His Baptism
addressing Him, and saying, This is My Son1274, He did not say, “This has now become My
Son,” but, This is My Son; that He might make manifest, that even before the operation of
Baptism He was a Son.</p>

substantially existent in us; but the word when spoken is dispersed into the air and comes

<note type="footnote">1270 The Arians appear to have made use of a dilemma: If God begat with will and purpose, these preceded
the begetting, and so ἦν ποτε ὅτε οὐκ ἦν, there was a time when the Son was not: if without will and purpose,
then He begat in ignorance and of necessity. The answer is fully given by Athanasius (c. Arian. iii. 58–67, pp.

to an end1275. But we know Christ to have been begotten not as a word pronounced1276,
but as a Word substantially existing1277 and living; not spoken by the lips, and dispersed,
but begotten of the Father eternally and ineffably, in substance1278. For, In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God1279, sitting at God’s right
hand;—the Word understanding the Father’s will, and creating all things at His bidding:
the Word, which came down and went up; for the word of utterance when spoken comes
not down, nor goes up; the Word speaking and saying, The things which I have seen with
My Father, these I speak1280: the Word possessed of power, and reigning over all things:
for the Father hath committed all things unto the Son1281.</p>
<p>11. The Father then begat Him not in such wise as any man could understand, but as
Himself only knoweth. For we profess not to tell in what manner He begat Him, but we
insist that it was not in this manner. And not we only are ignorant of the generation of the
Son from the Father, but so is every created nature. Speak to the earth, if perchance it may
teach thee1282: and though thou inquire of all things which are upon the earth, they shall
not be able to tell thee. For the earth cannot tell the substance of Him who is its own potter
and fashioner. Nor is the earth alone ignorant, but the sun also1283: for the sun was created
on the fourth day, without knowing what had been made in the three days before him; and
he who knows not the things made in the three days before him, cannot tell forth the Maker
Himself. Heaven will not declare this: for at the Father’s bidding the heaven also was like
smoke established1284 by Christ. Nor shall the heaven of heavens declare this, nor the waters

which are above the heavens1285. Why then art thou cast down, O man, at being ignorant
of that which even the heavens know not? Nay, not only are the heavens ignorant of this
generation, but also every angelic nature. For if any one should ascend, were it possible,
into the first heaven, and perceiving the ranks of the Angels there should approach and ask
them how God begat His own Son, they would say perhaps, “We have above us beings
greater and higher; ask them.” Go up to the second heaven and the third; attain, if thou
canst, to Thrones, and Dominions, and Principalities, and Powers: and even if any one
should reach them, which is impossible, they also would decline the explanation, for they
know it not.</p>
<p>12. For my part, I have ever wondered at the curiosity of the bold men, who by their
imagined reverence fall into impiety. For though they know nothing of Thrones, and
Dominions, and Principalities, and Powers, the workmanship of Christ, they attempt to
scrutinise their Creator Himself. Tell me first, O most daring man, wherein does Throne
differ from Dominion, and then scrutinise what pertains to Christ. Tell me what is a Principality,
and what a Power, and what a Virtue, and what an Angel: and then search out their
Creator, for all things were made by Him1286. But thou wilt not, or thou canst not ask
Thrones or Dominions. What else is there that knoweth the deep things of God1287, save
only the Holy Ghost, who spake the Divine Scriptures? But not even the Holy Ghost Himself
has spoken in the Scriptures concerning the generation of the Son from the Father. Why
then dost thou busy thyself about things which not even the Holy Ghost has written in the
Scriptures? Thou that knowest not the things which are written, busiest thou thyself about
the things which are not written? There are many questions in the Divine Scriptures; what
is written we comprehend not, why do we busy ourselves about what is not written? It is
sufficient for us to know that God hath begotten One Only Son.</p>
<p>13. Be not ashamed to confess thine ignorance, since thou sharest ignorance with Angels.
Only He who begat knoweth Him who was begotten, and He who is begotten of Him knoweth
Him who begat. He who begat knoweth what He begat: and the Scriptures also testify that
He who was begotten is God1288. For as the Father hath life in Himself, so also hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself1289; and, that all men should honour the Son, even as

they honour the Father1290; and, as the Father quickeneth whom He will, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will1291. Neither He who begat suffered any loss, nor is anything
lacking to Him who was begotten (I know that I have said these things many times, but it
is for your safety that they are said so often): neither has He who begat, a Father, nor He
who was begotten, a brother. Neither was He who begat changed into the Son1292, nor did
He who was begotten become the Father1293. Of One Only Father there is One Only-begotten
Son: neither two Unbegotten1294, nor two Only-begotten; but One Father, Unbegotten (for
He is Unbegotten who hath no father); and One Son, eternally begotten of the Father; begotten
not in time, but before all ages; not increased by advancement, but begotten that which
He now is.</p>
<p>14. We believe then In the Only-Begotten Son of God, Who Was Begotten of the
Father Very God. For the True God begetteth not a false god, as we have said, nor did He
deliberate and afterwards beget1295; but He begat eternally, and much more swiftly than
our words or thoughts: for we speaking in time, consume time; but in the case of the Divine
Power, the generation is timeless. And as I have often said, He did not bring forth the Son
from non-existence into being, nor take the non-existent into sonship1296: but the Father,
being Eternal, eternally and ineffably begat One Only Son, who has no brother. Nor are
there two first principles; but the Father is the head of the Son1297; the beginning is One.

For the Father begot the Son Very God, called Emmanuel; and Emmanuel being interpreted

<p>15. And wouldest thou know that He who was begotten of the Father, and afterwards
became man, is God? Hear the Prophet saying, This is our God, none other shall be accounted
of in comparison with Him. He hath found out every way of knowledge, and given it to Jacob
His servant, and to Israel His beloved. Afterwards He was seen on earth, and conversed among
men1299. Seest thou herein God become man, after the giving of the law by Moses? Hear
also a second testimony to Christ’s Deity, that which has just now been read, Thy throne, O
God, is for ever and ever1300. For lest, because of His presence here in the flesh, He should
be thought to have been advanced after this to the Godhead, the Scripture says plainly,
Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows1301.
Seest thou Christ as God anointed by God the Father?</p>
<p>16. Wouldest thou receive yet a third testimony to Christ’s Godhead? Hear Esaias
saying, Egypt hath laboured, and the merchandise of Ethiopia: and soon after, In Thee shall
they make supplication, because God is in Thee, and there is no God save Thee. For Thou art
God, and we knew it not, the God of Israel, the Saviour1302. Thou seest that the Son is God,
having in Himself God the Father: saying almost the very same which He has said in the
Gospels: The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father1303. He says not, I am the Father, but
the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father. And again He said not, I and the Father am1304
one, but, I and the Father am one, that we should neither separate them, nor make a confusion
of Son-Father1305. One they are because of the dignity pertaining to the Godhead, since
God begat God. One in respect of their kingdom; for the Father reigns not over these, and
the Son over those, lifting Himself up against His Father like Absalom: but the kingdom of
the Father is likewise the kingdom of the Son. One they are, because there is no discord nor

because the creative works of Christ are no other than the Father’s; for the creation of all
things is one, the Father having made them through the Son: For He spake, and they were
made; He commanded, and they were created, saith the Psalmist1306. For He who speaks,
speaks to one who hears: and He who commands, gives His commandment to one who is
present with Him.</p>

Father; for the Father was not made man, but the Son. For let the truth be freely spoken1307.
The Father suffered not for us, but the Father sent Him who suffered. Neither let us say,
There was a time when the Son was not; nor let us admit a Son who is the Father1308: but
let us walk in the king’s highway; let us turn aside neither on the left hand nor on the right.
Neither from thinking to honour the Son, let us call Him the Father; nor from thinking to
honour the Father, imagine the Son to be some one of the creatures. But let One Father be
worshipped through One Son, and let not their worship be separated. Let One Son be proclaimed,
sitting at the right hand of the Father before all ages: sharing His throne not by
advancement in time after His Passion, but by eternal possession.</p>

to Him who begat Him1310; begotten Life of Life and Light of Light, Power of Power, God
of God; and the characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable1311 in the Son; and he who
is counted worthy to behold Godhead in the Son, attains to the fruition of the Father. This
is not my word, but that of the Only-begotten: Have I been so long time with you, and hast
thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father1312. And to be brief,

let us neither separate them, nor make a confusion1313: neither say thou ever that the Son
is foreign to the Father, nor admit those who say that the Father is at one time Father, and
at another Son: for these are strange and impious statements, and not the doctrines of the
Church. But the Father having begotten the Son, remained the Father and is not changed.
He begat Wisdom, yet lost not wisdom Himself; and begat Power, yet became not weak:
He begat God, but lost not His own Godhead: and neither did He lose anything Himself
by diminution or change; nor has He who was begotten any thing wanting. Perfect is He
who begat, Perfect that which was begotten: God was He who begat, God He who was begotten;
God of all Himself, yet entitling the Father His own God. For He is not ashamed to
say, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God1314.</p>
<p>19. But lest thou shouldest think that He is in a like sense Father of the Son and of the
creatures, Christ drew a distinction in what follows. For He said not, “I ascend to our
Father,” lest the creatures should be made fellows of the Only-begotten; but He said, My
Father and your Father; in one way Mine, by nature; in another yours, by adoption. And
again, to my God and your God, in one way Mine, as His true and Only-begotten Son, and
in another way yours, as His workmanship1315. The Son of God then is Very God, ineffably
begotten before all ages (for I say the same things often to you, that it may be graven upon
your mind). This also believe, that God has a Son: but about the manner be not curious,
for by searching thou wilt not find. Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall: think upon those things
only which have been commanded thee1316. Tell me first what He is who begat, and then
learn that which He begat; but if thou canst not conceive the nature of Him who hath begotten,
search not curiously into the manner of that which is begotten.</p>
<p>20. For godliness it sufficeth thee to know, as we have said, that God hath One Only
Son, One naturally begotten; who began not His being when He was born in Bethlehem,
but Before All Ages. For hear the Prophet Micah saying, And thou, Bethlehem, house of
Ephrata, art little to be among the thousands of Judah. Out of thee shall come forth unto Me
a Ruler, who shall feed My people Israel: and His goings forth are from the beginning, from

days of eternity1317. Think not then of Him who is now come forth out of Bethlehem1318,
but worship Him who was eternally begotten of the Father. Suffer none to speak of a beginning
of the Son in time, but as a timeless Beginning acknowledge the Father. For the Father
is the Beginning of the Son, timeless, incomprehensible, without beginning1319. The fountain
of the river of righteousness, even of the Only-begotten, is the Father, who begat Him as
Himself only knoweth. And wouldest thou know that our Lord Jesus Christ is King Eternal?
Hear Him again saying, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was
glad1320. And then, when the Jews received this hardly, He says what to them was still
harder, Before Abraham was, I am1321. And again He saith to the Father, And now, Father,
glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world
was1322. He says plainly, “before the world was, I had the glory which is with Thee.” And
again when He says, For Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world1323, He plainly
declares, “The glory which I have with thee is from eternity.”</p>
<p>21. We believe then In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God, Begotten
of His Father Very God Before All Worlds, by Whom All Things Were Made. For whether
they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were made through
Him1324, and of things created none is exempted from His authority. Silenced be every
heresy which brings in different creators and makers of the world; silenced the tongue which
blasphemes the Christ the Son of God; let them be silenced who say that the sun is the Christ,
for He is the sun’s Creator, not the sun which we see1325. Silenced be they who say that the

by the Benedictine and other Editors as an interpolation intended to avoid the apparent tendency of Cyril’s
language in the received text to separate the Virgin’s Son from the Eternal Word. Had Cyril so written after the
Nestorian controversy arose, he would have appeared to favour the Nestorian formula that “Mary did not give
birth to the Deity.” Compare Swainson (Nicene Creed, Ch. ix. § 7.) What Cyril really means is that we are not

world is the workmanship of Angels1326, who wish to steal away the dignity of the Onlybegotten.
For whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, or anything that
is named, all things were made by Christ. He reigns over the things which have been made
by Him, not having seized another’s spoils, but reigning over His own workmanship, even
as the Evangelist John has said, All things were made by Him, and without Him was not
anything made1327. All things were made by Him, the Father working by the Son.</p>
<p>22. I wish to give also a certain illustration of what I am saying, but I know that it is
feeble; for of things visible what can be an exact illustration of the Divine Power? But nevertheless
as feeble be it spoken by the feeble to the feeble. For just as any king, whose son
was a king, if he wished to form a city, might suggest to his son, his partner in the kingdom,
the form of the city, and he having received the pattern, brings the design to completion;
so, when the Father wished to form all things, the Son created all things at the Father’s bidding,
that the act of bidding might secure to the Father His absolute authority1328, and yet
the Son in turn might have authority over His own workmanship, and neither the Father
be separated from the lordship over His own works, nor the Son rule over things created
by others, but by Himself. For, as I have said, Angels did not create the world, but the Onlybegotten
Son, begotten, as I have said, before all ages, By Whom All Things Were Made,
nothing having been excepted from His creation. And let this suffice to have been spoken
by us so far, by the grace of Christ.</p>
<p>23. But let us now recur to our profession of the Faith, and so for the present finish our
discourse. Christ made all things, whether thou speak of Angels, or Archangels, of
Dominions, or Thrones. Not that the Father wanted strength to create the works Himself,
but because He willed that the Son should reign over His own workmanship, God Himself
giving Him the design of the things to be made. For honouring His own Father the Onlybegotten
saith, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what
things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise1329. And again, My Father worketh
hitherto, and I work1330, there being no opposition in those who work. For all Mine are
Thine, and Thine are Mine, saith the Lord in the Gospels1331. And this we may certainly

know from the Old and New Testaments. For He who said, Let us make man in our image
and after our likeness1332, was certainly speaking to some one present. But clearest of all
are the Psalmist’s words, He spake and they were made; He commanded, and they were created1333,
as if the Father commanded and spake, and the Son made all things at the Father’s
bidding. And this Job said mystically, Which alone spread out the heaven, and walketh upon
the sea as on firm ground1334; signifying to those who understand that He who when present
here walked upon the sea is also He who aforetime made the heavens. And again the Lord
saith, Or didst Thou take earth, and fashion clay into a living being1335? then afterwards, Are
the gates of death opened to Thee through fear, and did the door-keepers of hell shudder at
sight of Thee1336? thus signifying that He who through loving-kindness descended into hell,
also in the beginning made man out of clay.</p>
<p>24. Christ then is the Only-begotten Son of God, and Maker of the world. For He was
in the world, and the world was made by Him; and He came unto His own, as the Gospel
teaches us1337. And not only of the things which are seen, but also of the things which are
not seen, is Christ the Maker at the Father’s bidding. For in Him, according to the Apostle,
were all things created that are in the heavens, and that are upon the earth, things visible and
invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things have been
created by Him and for Him; and He is before all, and in Him all things consist1338. Even if
thou speak of the worlds, of these also Jesus Christ is the Maker by the Father’s bidding.
For in these last days God spake unto us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things,
by whom also He made the worlds1339. To whom be the glory, honour, might, now and ever,
and world without end. Amen.</p>

God1340 with lips full of purity. Deemed1341 worthy to partake of the flesh of the Spiritual
Lamb1342, let us take the head together with the feet1343, the Deity being understood as the
head, and the Manhood taken as the feet. Hearers of the Holy Gospels, let us listen to John
the Divine1344. For he who said, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God1345, went on to say, and the Word was made flesh1346. For
neither is it holy to worship the mere man, nor religious to say that He is God only without
the Manhood. For if Christ is God, as indeed He is, but took not human nature upon Him,
we are strangers to salvation. Let us then worship Him as God, but believe that He also was
made Man. For neither is there any profit in calling Him man without Godhead nor any
salvation in refusing to confess the Manhood together with the Godhead. Let us confess

head of the body, while the other may be compared with the feet,—in so far as He, for the sake of our salvation,

the presence of Him who is both King and Physician. For Jesus the King when about to
become our Physician, girded Himself with the linen of humanity1347, and healed that which
was sick. The perfect Teacher of babes1348 became a babe among babes, that He might give
wisdom to the foolish. The Bread of heaven came down on earth1349 that He might feed

<p>2. But the sons of the Jews by setting at nought Him that came, and looking for him
who cometh in wickedness, rejected the true Messiah, and wait for the deceiver, themselves
deceived; herein also the Saviour being found true, who said, I am come in My Father’s
name, and ye receive Me not: but if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive1350.
It is well also to put a question to the Jews. Is the Prophet Esaias, who saith that
Emmanuel shall be born of a virgin, true or false1351? For if they charge him with falsehood,
no wonder: for their custom is not only to charge with falsehood, but also to stone the
Prophets. But if the Prophet is true, point to the Emmanuel, and say, Whether is He who
is to come, for whom ye are looking, to be born of a virgin or not? For if He is not to be
born of a virgin, ye accuse the Prophet of falsehood: but if in Him that is to come ye expect
this, why do ye reject that which has come to pass already?</p>

glorified. For we receive God the Word made Man in truth, not, as heretics say1352, of the
will of man and woman, but of The Virgin and the Holy Ghost1353 according to the Gospel,

σαρκωθέντα καὶ ἐνανθρωπήσαντα are found in it, but no reference whatever is made to the birth from the
Virgin.” The present passage, and that in Cat. iv. § 9, “begotten of the Holy Virgin and the Holy Ghost,” seems
to shew that such a clause formed part of the Creed which Cyril was expounding. The genuineness of both
passages is attested by all the mss. and Dr. Swainson was mistaken in charging the Editors of the Oxford
Translation with having omitted to “mention that Touttée was himself doubtful as to the words within the
brackets” [ἐκ Παρθένου καὶ Πνεύματος ῾Αγίου]. The brackets are added by Dr. Swainson himself, and Touttée
had no doubt of the genuineness of the words: on the contrary he believed them to be part of the Creed itself.
His note is as follows: “The words of the Virgin and Holy Ghost I have caused to be printed in larger letters as
if taken from the Symbol: although they are wanting in the Title of this Lecture and in § 13, where the third</note>

Made Man1354, not in seeming but in truth. And that He was truly Man made of the Virgin,
wait for the proper time of instruction in this Lecture, and thou shalt receive the proofs1355:
for the error of the heretics is manifold. And some have said that He has not been born at
all of a virgin1356: others that He has been born, not of a virgin, but of a wife dwelling with
a husband. Others say that the Christ is not God made Man, but a man made God1357. For
they dared to say that not He—the pre-existent Word—was made Man; but a certain man
was by advancement crowned.</p>
<p>4. But remember thou what was said yesterday concerning His Godhead. Believe that
He the Only-begotten Son of God—He Himself was again begotten of a Virgin. Believe the
Evangelist John when he says, And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us1358. For
the Word is eternal, Begotten of the Father Before All Worlds: but the flesh He took on
Him recently for our sake. Many contradict this, and say: “What cause was there so great,
for God to come down into humanity? And, is it at all God’s nature to hold intercourse
with men? And, is it possible for a virgin to bear, without man?” Since then there is much

<note type="footnote">1354 ἐνανθρωπήσαντα. The word occurs in the true Nicene formula, where, as Dr. Swainson thinks, it is
“scarcely ambiguous,” “it is defective.” Both the Verb and the Substantive ἐνανθρώπησις are constantly used
by Athanasius to denote the Incarnation in a perfectly general way, without any indication of ambiguity or defect.
In the Creed proposed by Eusebius of Cæsarea instead of ἐνανθρωπήσαντα we find ἐν ἀνθρώποις
πολιτευσάμενον; and in the Expositio Fidei ascribed to Athanasius, but of somewhat doubtful authenticity, the
Incarnation is described thus ἐκ τῆς ἀχράντου παρθένου Μαρίας τὸν ἡμέτερον ἀνείληφεν ἄνθρωπον Χριστὸν
᾽Ιησοῦν. In the Apollinarian controversy the attempt was made to interpret ἐνηνθρώπησεν as meaning not that
“He became Man,” but that “He assumed a man,” i.e. that “the man was first formed and then assumed” (Gregory,
Epist. ad Cledon, quoted by Swainson, p. 83), or else merely that “He dwelt among men.” But the context of the
passages in which Cyril uses the word (iv. 9; xii. 3) clearly shews that he employed it in the perfectly orthodox
sense which it has in the Nicene Formula and in Athanasius.</note>
<note type="footnote">1355 See below, § 21 ff. Cyril means that the direct proof cannot be given at once, because there are many
errors to be set aside first. Compare the end of § 4.</note>

others, was made God (ἐθεοποιήθη ) by participation.” The Eusebians in the Confession of Faith called Macrostichos
(a.d. 344) condemned this view as being held by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, “who say that after
the incarnation He was by advance made God, from being made by nature a mere man.” The orthodox use of
the word Θεοποιεῖσθαι is seen in Athan. de Incarnat. § 54: αὐτὸς ἐνηνθρώπησεν, ἵνα ἡμεῖς θεοποιηθῶμεν.</note>

controversy, and the battle has many forms, come, let us by the grace of Christ, and the
prayers of those who are present, resolve each question.</p>
<p>5. And first let us inquire for what cause Jesus came down. Now mind not my argumentations,
for perhaps thou mayest be misled but unless thou receive testimony of the
Prophets on each matter, believe not what I say: unless thou learn from the Holy Scriptures
concerning the Virgin, and the place, the time, and the manner, receive not testimony from
man1359. For one who at present thus teaches may possibly be suspected: but what man
of sense will suspect one that prophesied a thousand and more years beforehand? If then
thou seekest the cause of Christ’s coming, go back to the first book of the Scriptures. In six
days God made the world: but the world was for man. The sun however resplendent with
bright beams, yet was made to give light to man, yea, and all living creatures were formed
to serve us: herbs and trees were created for our enjoyment. All the works of creation were
good, but none of these was an image of God, save man only. The sun was formed by a
mere command, but man by God’s hands: Let us make man after our image, and after our
likeness1360. A wooden image of an earthly king is held in honour; how much more a rational
image of God?</p>
<p>But when this the greatest of the works of creation was disporting himself in Paradise,
the envy of the Devil cast him out. The enemy was rejoicing over the fall of him whom he
had envied: wouldest thou have had the enemy continue to rejoice? Not daring to accost
the man because of his strength, he accosted as being weaker the woman, still a virgin: for
it was after the expulsion from Paradise that Adam knew his wife1361.</p>
<p>6. Cain and Abel succeeded in the second generation of mankind: and Cain was the
first murderer. Afterwards a deluge was poured abroad because of the great wickedness of
men: fire came down from heaven upon the people of Sodom because of their transgression.
After a time God chose out Israel: but Israel also turned aside, and the chosen race was
wounded. For while Moses stood before God in the mount, the people were worshipping
a calf instead of God. In the lifetime of Moses, the law-giver who had said, Thou shalt not
commit adultery, a man dared to enter a place of harlotry and transgress1362. After Moses,
Prophets were sent to cure Israel: but in their healing office they lamented that they were
not able to overcome the disease, so that one of them says, Woe is me! for the godly man is
perished out of the earth, and there is none that doeth right among men1363: and again, They
are all gone out of the way, they are together became unprofitable; there is none that doeth

good, no, not one1364: and again, Cursing and stealing, and adultery, and murder are poured
out upon the land1365. Their sons and their daughters they sacrificed unto devils1366. They
used auguries, and enchantments, and divinations1367. And again, they fastened their garments
with cords, and made hangings attached to the altar1368.</p>
<p>7. Very great was the wound of man’s nature; from the feet to the head there was no
soundness in it; none could apply mollifying ointment, neither oil, nor bandages1369. Then
bewailing and wearying themselves, the Prophets said, Who shall give salvation out of
Sion1370? And again, Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the son of
man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself: so will not we go back from Thee1371. And another
of the Prophets entreated, saying, Bow the heavens, O Lord and come down1372. The
wounds of man’s nature pass our healing. They slew Thy Prophets, and cast down Thine
altars1373. The evil is irretrievable by us, and needs thee to retrieve it.</p>
<p>8. The Lord heard the prayer of the Prophets. The Father disregarded not the perishing
of our race; He sent forth His Son, the Lord from heaven, as healer: and one of the Prophets
saith, The Lord whom ye seek, cometh, and shall suddenly come1374. Whither? The Lord
shall come to His own temple, where ye stoned Him. Then another of the Prophets, on
hearing this, saith to him: In speaking of the salvation of God, speakest thou quietly? In
preaching the good tidings of God’s coming for salvation, speakest thou in secret? O thou
that bringest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain. Speak to the cities of
Judah. What am I to speak? Behold our God! Behold! the Lord cometh with strength1375!
Again the Lord Himself saith, Behold! I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the
Lord. And many nations shall flee unto the Lord1376. The Israelites rejected salvation through
Me: I come to gather all nations and tongues1377. For He came to His own and His own re-

gather all nations, and I will leave on them a sign1379. For from My conflict upon the Cross
I give to each of My soldiers a royal seal to bear upon his forehead. Another also of the
Prophets said, He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under His
feet1380. For His coming down from heaven was not known by men.</p>
<p>9. Afterwards Solomon hearing his father David speak these things, built a wondrous
house, and foreseeing Him who was to come into it, said in astonishment, Will God in very
deed dwell with men on the earth1381? Yea, saith David by anticipation in the Psalm inscribed
For Solomon, wherein is this, He shall come down like rain into a fleece1382: rain, because
of His heavenly nature, and into a fleece, because of His humanity. For rain, coming down
into a fleece, comes down noiselessly: so that the Magi, not knowing the mystery of the
Nativity, say, Where is He that is born King of the Jews1383? and Herod being troubled inquired
concerning Him who was born, and said, Where is the Christ to be born1384?</p>
<p>10. But who is this that cometh down? He says in what follows, And with the sun He
endureth, and before the moon generations of generations1385. And again another of the
Prophets saith, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold!
thy King cometh unto thee, just and having salvation1386. Kings are many; of which speakest
thou, O Prophet? Give us a sign which other Kings have not. If thou say, A king clad in
purple, the dignity of the apparel has been anticipated. If thou say, Guarded by spear-men,
and sitting in a golden chariot, this also has been anticipated by others. Give us a sign peculiar
to the King whose coming thou announcest. And the Prophet maketh answer and saith,

hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water1388.</p>
<p>11. But He might perchance even sit upon a foal: give us rather a sign, where the King
that entereth shall stand. And give the sign not far from the city, that it may not be unknown
to us: and give us the sign plain before our eyes, that even when in the city we may behold
the place. And the Prophet again makes answer, saying: And His feet shall stand in that
day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the east1389. Does any one
standing within the city fail to behold the place?</p>
<p>12. We have two signs, and we desire to learn a third. Tell us what the Lord doth when
He is come. Another Prophet saith, Behold! our God, and afterwards, He will come and save
us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear: then shall
the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be distinct1390. But let
yet another testimony be told us. Thou sayest, O Prophet, that the Lord cometh, and doeth
signs such as never were: what other clear sign tellest thou? The Lord Himself entereth into
judgment with the elders of His people, and with the princes thereof1391. A notable sign! The
Master judged by His servants, the elders, and submitting to it.</p>
<p>13. These things the Jews read, but hear not: for they have stopped the ears of their
heart, that they may not hear. But let us believe in Jesus Christ, as having come in the flesh
and been made Man, because we could not receive Him otherwise. For since we could not
look upon or enjoy Him as He was, He became what we are, that so we might be permitted
to enjoy Him. For if we cannot look full on the sun, which was made on the fourth day,
could we behold God its Creator1392? The Lord came down in fire on Mount Sinai, and
the people could not bear it, but said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; and
let not God speak to us, lest we die1393: and again, For who is there of all flesh that hath heard
the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, and shall live1394? If to hear
the voice of God speaking is a cause of death, how shall not the sight of God Himself bring
death? And what wonder? Even Moses himself saith, I exceedingly fear and quake1395.</p>

<p>14. What wouldest thou then? That He who came for our salvation should become a
minister of destruction because men could not bear Him? or that He should suit His grace
to our measure? Daniel could not bear the vision of an Angel, and wert thou capable of the
sight of the Lord of Angels? Gabriel appeared, and Daniel fell down: and of what nature
or in what guise was he that appeared? His countenance was like lightning1396; not like the
sun: and his eyes as lamps of fire, not as a furnace of fire: and the voice of his words as the
voice of a multitude, not as the voice of twelve legions of angels; nevertheless the Prophet
fell down. And the Angel cometh unto him, saying, Fear not, Daniel, stand upright: be of
good courage, thy words are heard1397. And Daniel says, I stood up trembling1398: and not
even so did he make answer, until the likeness of a man’s hand touched him. And when he
that appeared was changed into the appearance of a man, then Daniel spoke: and what saith
he? O my Lord, at the vision of Thee my inward parts were turned within me, and no strength
remaineth in me, neither is there breath left in me1399. If an Angel appearing took away the
Prophet’s voice and strength, would the appearance of God have allowed him to breathe?
And until there touched me as it were a vision of a man1400, saith the Scripture, Daniel took
not courage. So then after trial shewn of our weakness, the Lord assumed that which man
required: for since man required to hear from one of like countenance, the Saviour took
on Him the nature of like affections, that men might be the more easily instructed.</p>
<p>15. Learn also another cause. Christ came that He might be baptized, and might sanctify
Baptism: He came that He might work wonders, walking upon the waters of the sea.
Since then before His appearance in flesh, the sea saw Him and fled, and Jordan was turned
back1401, the Lord took to Himself His body, that the sea might endure the sight, and Jordan
receive Him without fear. This then is one cause; but there is also a second. Through Eve
yet virgin came death; through a virgin, or rather from a virgin, must the Life appear: that
as the serpent beguiled the one, so to the other Gabriel might bring good tidings1402. Men
forsook God, and made carved images of men. Since therefore an image of man was falsely
worshipped as God, God became truly Man, that the falsehood might be done away. The
Devil had used the flesh as an instrument against us; and Paul knowing this, saith, But I see

another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity1403,
and the rest. By the very same weapons, therefore, wherewith the Devil used to
vanquish us, have we been saved. The Lord took on Him from us our likeness, that He
might save man’s nature: He took our likeness, that He might give greater grace to that
which lacked; that sinful humanity might become partaker of God. For where sin abounded,
grace did much more abound1404. It behoved the Lord to suffer for us; but if the Devil had
known Him, he would not have dared to approach Him. For had they known it, they would
not have crucified the Lord of Glory1405. His body therefore was made a bait to death that
the dragon1406, hoping to devour it, might disgorge those also who had been already devoured1407.
For Death prevailed and devoured; and again, God wiped away every tear from
off every face1408.</p>

phrases and human subtleties? Are not the Holy Scriptures our salvation? Are not the
predictions of the Prophets? Keep then, I pray thee, this deposit1409 undisturbed, and let
none remove thee: believe that God became Man. But though it has been proved possible
for Him to be made Man, yet if the Jews still disbelieve, let us hold this forth to them: What
strange thing do we announce in saying that God was made Man, when yourselves say that
Abraham received the Lord as a guest1410? What strange thing do we announce, when
Jacob says, For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved1411? The Lord, who ate
with Abraham, ate also with us. What strange thing then do we announce? Nay more, we
produce two witnesses, those who stood before Lord on Mount Sinai: Moses was in a clift
of the rock1412, and Elias was once in a clift of the rock1413: they being present with Him

the place: and I must not go away convicted of falsehood, but rather send away the Church’s
novices1416 well assured. Let us therefore inquire the time when our Lord came: because
His coming is recent, and is disputed: and because Christ Jesus is the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever1417. Moses then, the prophet, saith, A Prophet shall the Lord your God
raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me1418: but let that “like unto me” be reserved
awhile to be examined in its proper place1419. But when cometh this Prophet that is expected?
Recur, he says, to what has been written by me: examine carefully Jacob’s prophecy
addressed to Judah: Judah, thee may thy brethren praise, and afterwards, not to quote the
whole, A prince shall not fail out of Judah, nor a ruler from his loins, until He come, for whom
it is reserved; and He is the expectation, not of the Jews but of the Gentiles1420. He gave,
therefore, as a sign of Christ’s advent the cessation of the Jewish rule. If they are not now
under the Romans, the Christ is not yet come: if they still have a prince of the race of Judah
and of David1421, he is not yet come that was expected. For I am ashamed to tell of their
recent doings concerning those who are now called Patriarchs1422 among them, and what
their descent is, and who their mother: but I leave it to those who know. But He that cometh

as the expectation of the Gentiles, what further sign then hath He? He says next, Binding his
foal unto the vine1423. Thou seest that foal which was clearly announced by Zachariah1424.</p>
<p>18. But again thou askest yet another testimony of the time. The Lord said unto Me,
Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee: and a few words further on, Thou shalt rule
them with a rod of iron1425. I have said before that the kingdom of the Romans is clearly
called a rod of iron; but what is wanting concerning this let us further call to mind out of
Daniel. For in relating and interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar the image of the statue, he tells
also his whole vision concerning it: and that a stone cut out of a mountain without hands,
that is, not set up by human contrivance, should overpower the whole world: and he speaks
most clearly thus; And in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom,
which shall never be destroyed, and His kingdom shall not be left to another people1426.</p>
<p>19. But we seek still more clearly the proof of the time of His coming. For man being
hard to persuade, unless he gets the very years for a clear calculation, does not believe what
is stated. What then is the season, and what the manner of the time? It is when, on the
failure of the kings descended from Judah, Herod a foreigner succeeds to the kingdom?
The Angel, therefore, who converses with Daniel says, and do thou now mark the words,
And thou shalt know and understand: From the going forth of the word for making answer1427,
and for the building of Jerusalem, until Messiah the Prince are seven weeks and three score
and two weeks1428. Now three score and nine weeks of years contain four hundred and
eighty-three years. He said, therefore, that after the building of Jerusalem, four hundred
and eighty-three years having passed, and the rulers having failed, then cometh a certain
king of another race, in whose time the Christ is to be born. Now Darius the Mede1429 built

the Greeks. Olympiad is the name among the Greeks of the games celebrated after four
years, because of the day which in every four years of the sun’s courses is made up of the
three1430 (supernumerary) hours in each year. And Herod is king in the 186th Olympiad,
in the 4th year thereof. Now from the 66th to the 186th Olympiad there are 120 Olympiads
intervening, and a little over. So then the 120 Olympiads make up 480 years: for the other
three years remaining are perhaps taken up in the interval between the first and fourth
years. And there thou hast the proof according to the Scripture which saith, From the going
forth of the word that Jerusalem be restored and built until Messiah the Prince are seven weeks

Lo! we heard of it at Ephrathah, we found it in the plains of the wood1432. For a few years

Psalmist speaks had remained till a few years before. Ephrâthah is the ancient name of Bethlehem (Gen. xxxv.

what part of the region round Jerusalem cometh He? From east, or west, or north, or south?
Tell us exactly. And he makes answer most plainly and says, God shall come from Teman1436

truth: and they say that it is not written “the virgin,” but “the damsel.” But though I assent
to what they say, even so I find the truth. For we must ask them, If a virgin be forced, when
does she cry out and call for helpers, after or before the outrage? If, therefore, the Scripture

other mss. of the Sept. and in some Fathers ζώων (“living creatures”) is found in place of ζωῶν “lives;” but the
latter reading is evidently required by the interpretation which follows in Cyril. Origen (de Principiis, I. 4), who
recognises both readings (“In medio vel duorum animalium, vel duarum vitarum, cognosceris,”) interprets the
“two living beings” of the Son and the Spirit. Eusebius (Demonstr. Evang VI. 15) observes that ζωων is to be
read as perispomenon from the Singular ζωή, and interprets it of Christ’s life with God, and life on earth.
Theodoret says, in commenting on the passage, “To me it seems that the Prophet means not “living beings”

Eusebius (Dem. Evang. VI. 15) mentions this as the rendering of Theodotion in his Greek Version, about
180 a.d. As a proper name Teman denotes a district and town in the southern part of Idumea, so called from a
grandson of Esau (Gen. xxxvi. 11, 15, 42; Jer. xlix. 7, 20; Ezek. xxv. 13; Amos i. 12; Obad. 9).</note>
<note type="footnote">1437 The following note is slightly abridged from the Edition of Alexandrides of Jerusalem. “Previous Editions
read ἔξ ὄρους φαρὰν κατασκίου δασέος. This reading is found in Cod. Vat. and other mss. of the Septuagint,
but φαράν is omitted in the Aldine and many other copies nor was it read in the mss. of the Sept. in Jerome’s
time, as is clear from his comments on the passage. In the mss. of Cyril, Ottob. R.C.V. Monac. I. and II. it is
wanting. Paran is the name of the desert towards the S. of Palestine lying between it and Egypt (Gen. xxi. 21;
Num. i. 12). There was also a Mount Paran (Deut. xxxiii. 2). But since Cyril applies the prophecy to Bethlehem,
and the “shady thickly-wooded mountain” of Habakkuk is identified with “the plains of the wood” of David,
we may safely conclude that Cyril did not read φαράν in his copies of the Septuagint, nor write it in his Lecture:
but the reading crept in from the later copyists, accustomed to the reading φαράν in the Septuagint.”</note>

elsewhere says, The betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her1439, doth it not
speak of a virgin?</p>
<p>But that you may learn more plainly that even a virgin is called in Holy Scripture a
“damsel,” hear the Book of the Kings, speaking of Abishag the Shunamite, And the damsel
was very fair1440: for that as a virgin she was chosen and brought to David is admitted.</p>
<p>22. But the Jews say again, This was said to Ahaz in reference to Hezekiah. Well, then,
let us read the Scripture: Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height1441.
And the sign certainly must be something astonishing. For the water from the rock was a
sign, the sea divided, the sun turning back, and the like. But in what I am going to mention
there is still more manifest refutation of the Jews. (I know that I am speaking at much length,
and that my hearers are wearied: but bear with the fulness of my statements, because it is
for Christ’s sake these questions are moved, and they concern no ordinary matters.) Now
as Isaiah spoke this in the reign of Ahaz, and Ahaz reigned only sixteen years, and the
prophecy was spoken to him within these years, the objection of the Jews is refuted by the
fact that the succeeding king, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign: for as the prophecy is confined within sixteen years, he must have been begotten
of Ahaz full nine years before the prophecy. What need then was there to utter the
prophecy concerning one who had been already begotten even before the reign of father
Ahaz1442? For he said not, hath conceived, but “the virgin shall conceive,” speaking as with
foreknowledge1443.</p>
<p>23. We know then for certain that the Lord was to be born of a Virgin, but we have to
shew of what family the Virgin was. The Lord sware in truth unto David, and will not set it
aside. Of the fruit of body will I set upon thy throne1444: and again, seed will I establish for
ever, and his throne as the days of heaven1445. And afterwards, Once have I sworn by My
holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the
sun before Me, and as the moon established for ever1446. Thou seest that the discourse is of

Christ, not of Solomon. For Solomon’s throne endured not as the sun. But if any deny this,
because Christ sat not on David’s throne of wood, we will bring forward that saying, The
Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat1447: for it signifies not his wooden seat, but the
authority of his teaching. In like manner then I would have you seek for David’s throne not
the throne of wood, but the kingdom itself. Take, too, as my witnesses the children who
cried aloud,Hosanna to the Son of David1448, blessed is the King of Israel1449. And the blind
men also say, Son of David, have mercy on us1450. Gabriel too testifies plainly to Mary,
saying, And the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David1451. Paul also
saith, Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my
Gospel1452: and in the beginning of the Epistle to the Romans he saith, Which was made of
the seed of David according to the flesh1453. Receive thou therefore Him that was born of
David, believing the prophecy which saith, And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and
He that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles: in Him shall the Gentiles trust1454.</p>
<p>24. But the Jews are much troubled at these things. This also Isaiah foreknew, saying,
And they shall wish that they had been burnt with fire: for unto us a child is born (not unto
them), unto us a Son is given1455. Mark thou that at first He was the Son of God, then was
given to us. And a little after he says, And of His peace there is no bound1456. The Romans
have bounds: of the kingdom of the Son of God there is no bound. The Persians and the
Medes have bounds, but the Son has no bound. Then next, upon the throne of David, and
upon his kingdom to order it. The Holy Virgin, therefore, is from David.</p>
<p>25. For it became Him who is most pure, and a teacher of purity, to have come forth
from a pure bride-chamber. For if he who well fulfils the office of a priest of Jesus abstains
from a wife, how should Jesus Himself be born of man and woman? For thou, saith He in
the Psalms, art He that took Me out of the womb1457. Mark that carefully, He that took Me
out of the womb, signifying that He was begotten without man, being taken from a virgin’s

womb and flesh. For the manner is different with those who are begotten according to the
course of marriage.</p>
<p>26. And from such members He is not ashamed to assume flesh, who is the framer of
those very members. But then who telleth us this? The Lord saith unto Jeremiah: Before I
formed thee in the belly, I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified
thee1458. If, then, in fashioning man He was not ashamed of the contact, was He ashamed
in fashioning for His own sake the holy Flesh, the veil of His Godhead? It is God who even
now creates the children in the womb, as it is written in Job, Hast thou not poured me out
as milk, and curdled me like cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast knit
me together with bones and sinews1459. There is nothing polluted in the human frame except
a man defile this with fornication and adultery. He who formed Adam formed Eve also,
and male and female were formed by God’s hands. None of the members of the body as
formed from the beginning is polluted. Let the mouths of all heretics be stopped who slander
their bodies, or rather Him who formed them. But let us remember Paul’s saying, Know ye
not that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost which is in you1460? And again the
Prophet hath spoken before in the person of Jesus, My flesh is from them1461: and in another
place it is written, Therefore will He give them up, until the time that she bringeth forth1462.
And what is the sign? He tells us in what follows, She shall bring forth, and the remnant of
their brethren shall return. And what are the nuptial pledges of the Virgin, the holy bride?
And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness1463. And Elizabeth, talking with Mary, speaks
in like manner: And blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those
things which were told her from the Lord1464.</p>

how say ye that it is impossible for a son to have been born from a virgin’s womb? Ye who
falsely say that Dionysus was born from the thigh of your Zeus1467, how set ye at nought
our truth? I know that I am speaking of things unworthy of the present audience: but in
order that thou in due season mayest rebuke the Greeks, we have brought these things forward
answering them from their own fables.</p>
<p>28. But those of the circumcision meet thou with this question: Whether is harder, for
an aged woman, barren and past age, to bear, or for a virgin in the prime of youth to conceive?
Sarah was barren, and though it had ceased to be with her after the manner of women,
yet, contrary to nature, she bore a child. If, then, it is against nature for a barren woman to
conceive, and also for a virgin, either, therefore, reject both, or accept both. For it is the
same God1468 who both wrought the one and appointed the other. For thou wilt not dare
to say that it was possible for God in that former case, and impossible in this latter. And
again: how is it natural for a man’s hand to be changed in a single hour into a different appearance
and restored again? How then was the hand of Moses made white as snow, and
at once restored again? But thou sayest that God’s will made the change. In that case God’s
will has the power, and has it then no power in this case? That moreover was a sign concerning
the Egyptians only, but this was a sign given to the whole world. But whether is the
more difficult, O ye Jews? For a virgin to bear, or for a rod to be quickened into a living
creature? Ye confess that in the case of Moses a perfectly straight rod became like a serpent,
and was terrible to him who cast it down, and he who before held the rod fast, fled from it
as from a serpent; for a serpent in truth it was: but he fled not because he feared that which
he held, but because he dreaded Him that had changed it. A rod had teeth and eyes like a
serpent: do then seeing eyes grow out of a rod, and cannot a child be born of a virgin’s
womb, if God wills? For I say nothing of the fact that Aaron’s rod also produced in a single
night what other trees produce in several years. For who knows not that a rod, after losing
its bark, will never sprout, not even if it be planted in the midst of rivers? But since God is
not dependent on the nature of trees, but is the Creator of their natures, the unfruitful, and
dry, and barkless rod budded, and blossomed, and bare almonds. He, then, who for the
sake of the typical high-priest gave fruit supernaturally to the rod, would He not for the sake
of the true High-Priest grant to the Virgin to bear a child?</p>
<p>29. These are excellent suggestions of the narratives: but the Jews still contradict, and
do not yield to the statements concerning the rod, unless they may be persuaded by similar
strange and supernatural births. Question them, therefore, in this way: of whom in the
beginning was Eve begotten? What mother conceived her the motherless? But the Scripture
saith that she was born out of Adam’s side. Is Eve then born out of a man’s side without a

<pb n="249"/>
mother, and is a child not to be born without a father, of a virgin’s womb? This debt of
gratitude was due to men from womankind: for Eve was begotten of Adam, and not conceived
of a mother, but as it were brought forth of man alone. Mary, therefore, paid the
debt, of gratitude, when not by man but of herself alone in an immaculate way she conceived
of the Holy Ghost by the power of God.</p>
<p>30. But let us take what is yet a greater wonder than this. For that of bodies bodies
should be conceived, even if wonderful, is nevertheless possible: but that the dust of the
earth should become a man, this is more wonderful. That clay moulded together should
assume the coats and splendours of the eyes, this is more wonderful. That out of dust of
uniform appearance should be produced both the firmness of bones, and the softness of
lungs, and other different kinds of members, this is wonderful. That clay should be animated
and travel round the world self moved, and should build houses, this is wonderful. That
clay should teach, and talk, and act as carpenter, and as king, this is wonderful. Whence,
then, O ye most ignorant Jews, was Adam made? Did not God take dust from the earth,
and fashion this wonderful frame? Is then clay changed into an eye, and cannot a virgin
bear a son. Does that which for men is more impossible take place, and is that which is
possible never to occur?</p>
<p>31. Let us remember these things, brethren: let us use these weapons in our defence.
Let us not endure those heretics who teach Christ’s coming as a phantom. Let us abhor
those also who say that the Saviour’s birth was of husband and wife; who have dared to say
that He was the child of Joseph and Mary, because it is written, And he took unto him his
wife1469. For let us remember Jacob who before he received Rachel, said to Laban, Give me
my wife1470. For as she before the wedded state, merely because there was a promise, was
called the wife of Jacob, so also Mary, because she had been betrothed, was called the wife
of Joseph. Mark also the accuracy of the Gospel, saying, And in the sixth month the Angel
Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a
man whose name was Joseph1471, and so forth. And again when the census took place, and
Joseph went up to enrol himself, what saith the Scripture? And Joseph also went up from
Galilee, to enrol himself with Mary who was espoused to him, being great with child1472. For
though she was with child, yet it said not “with his wife,” but with her who was espoused to
him. For God sent forth His Son, says Paul, not made of a man and a woman, but made of

a woman1473 only, that is of a virgin. For that the virgin also is called a woman, we shewed
before1474. For He who makes souls virgin, was born of a Virgin.</p>
<p>32. But thou wonderest at the event: even she herself who bare him wondered at this.
For she saith to Gabriel, How shall this be to me, since I know not a man? But he says, The
Holy Ghost shall came upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
wherefore also the holy thing which is to be born shall be called the Son of God1475. Immaculate
and undefiled was His generation: for where the Holy Spirit breathes, there all pollution is
taken away: undefiled from the Virgin was the incarnate generation of the Only-begotten.
And if the heretics gainsay the truth, the Holy Ghost shall convict them: that overshadowing
power of the Highest shall wax wroth: Gabriel shall stand face to face against them in the
day of judgment: the place of the manger, which received the Lord, shall put them to shame.
The shepherds, who then received the good tidings, shall bear witness; and the host of the
Angels who sang praises and hymns, and said, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace among men of His good pleasure1476: the Temple into which He was then carried up
on the fortieth day: the pairs of turtle-doves, which were offered on His behalf1477: and
Symeon who then took Him up in his arms, and Anna the prophetess who was present.</p>
<p>33. Since God then beareth witness, and the Holy Ghost joins in the witness, and Christ
says, Why do ye seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth1478? let the heretics be silenced
who speak against His humanity, for they speak against Him, who saith, Handle me,
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have1479. Adored be the Lord the
Virgin-born, and let Virgins acknowledge the crown of their own state: let the order also
of Solitaries acknowledge the glory of chastity for we men are not deprived of the dignity
of chastity. In the Virgin’s womb the Saviour’s period of nine months was passed: but the
Lord was for thirty and three years a man: so that if a virgin glories1480 because of the nine
months, much more we because of the many years.</p>

<p>34. But let us all by God’s grace run the race of chastity, young men and maidens, old
men and children1481; not going after wantonness, but praising the name of Christ. Let us
not be ignorant of the glory of chastity: for its crown is angelic, and its excellence above
man. Let us be chary of our bodies which are to shine as the sun: let us not for short
pleasure defile so great, so noble a body: for short and momentary is the sin, but the shame
for many years and for ever. Angels walking upon earth are they who practise chastity: the
Virgins have their portion with Mary the Virgin. Let all vain ornament be banished, and
every hurtful glance, and all wanton gait, and every flowing robe, and perfume enticing to
pleasure. But in all for perfume let there be the prayer of sweet odour, and the practice1482
of good works, and the sanctification of our bodies: that the Virgin-born Lord may say even
of us, both men who live in chastity and women who wear the crown, I will dwell in them;
and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people1483. To whom be the
glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Isaiah liii. 1, 7</p>
<p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?…He is brought
as a lamb to the slaughter, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Every deed of Christ is a cause of glorying to the Catholic Church, but her greatest
of all glorying is in the Cross; and knowing this, Paul says, But God forbid that I should glory,
save in the Cross of Christ1484. For wondrous indeed it was, that one who was blind from
his birth should receive sight in Siloam1485; but what is this compared with the blind of the
whole world? A great thing it was, and passing nature, for Lazarus to rise again on the fourth
day; but the grace extended to him alone, and what was it compared with the dead in sins
throughout the world? Marvellous it was, that five loaves should pour forth food for the
five thousand; but what is that to those who are famishing in ignorance through all the
world? It was marvellous that she should have been loosed who had been bound by Satan
eighteen years: yet what is this to all of us, who were fast bound in the chains of our sins?
But the glory of the Cross led those who were blind through ignorance into light, loosed all
who were held fast by sin, and ransomed the whole world of mankind.</p>
<p>2. And wonder not that the whole world was ransomed; for it was no mere man, but
the only-begotten Son of God, who died on its behalf. Moreover one man’s sin, even Adam’s,
had power to bring death to the world; but if by the trespass of the one death reigned over
the world, how shall not life much rather reign by the righteousness of the One1486? And if
because of the tree of food they were then cast out of paradise, shall not believers now more
easily enter into paradise because of the Tree of Jesus? If the first man formed out of the
earth brought in universal death, shall not He who formed him out of the earth bring in
eternal life, being Himself the Life? If Phinees, when he waxed zealous and slew the evildoer,
staved the wrath of God, shall not Jesus, who slew not another, but gave up Himself
for a ransom1487, put away the wrath which is against mankind?</p>
<p>3. Let us then not be ashamed of the Cross of our Saviour, but rather glory in it. For
the word of the Cross is unto Jews a stumbling-block, and unto Gentiles foolishness, but to us
salvation: and to them that are perishing it is foolishness, but unto us which are being saved

it is the power of God1488. For it was not a mere man who died for us, as I said before, but
the Son of God, God made man. Further; if the lamb under Moses drove the destroyer1489
far away, did not much rather the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world1490,
deliver us from our sins? The blood of a silly sheep gave salvation; and shall not the Blood
of the Only-begotten much rather save? If any disbelieve the power of the Crucified, let
him ask the devils; if any believe not words, let him believe what he sees. Many have been
crucified throughout the world, but by none of these are the devils scared; but when they
see even the Sign of the Cross of Christ, who was crucified for us, they shudder1491. For
those men died for their own sins, but Christ for the sins of others; for He did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth1492. It is not Peter who says this, for then we might suspect
that he was partial to his Teacher; but it is Esaias who says it, who was not indeed present
with Him in the flesh, but in the Spirit foresaw His coming in the flesh. Yet why now bring
the Prophet only as a witness? take for a witness Pilate himself, who gave sentence upon
Him, saying, I find no fault in this Man1493: and when he gave Him up, and had washed
his hands, he said, I am innocent of the blood of this just person1494. There is yet another
witness of the sinlessness of Jesus,—the robber, the first man admitted into Paradise; who
rebuked his fellow, and said, “We receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath
done nothing amiss1495; for we were present, both thou and I, at His judgment.”</p>
<p>4. Jesus then really suffered for all men; for the Cross was no illusion1496, otherwise
our redemption is an illusion also. His death was not a mere show1497, for then is our salvation
also fabulous. If His death was but a show, they were true who said, We remember
that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three days I rise again1498. His Passion

then was real: for He was really crucified, and we are not ashamed thereat; He was crucified,
and we deny it not, nay, I rather glory to speak of it. For though I should now deny it, here
is Golgotha to confute me, near which we are now assembled; the wood of the Cross confutes
me, which was afterwards distributed piecemeal from hence to all the world1499. I confess
the Cross, because I know of the Resurrection; for if, after being crucified, He had remained
as He was, I had not perchance confessed it, for I might have concealed both it and my
Master; but now that the Resurrection has followed the Cross, I am not ashamed to declare
it.</p>
<p>5. Being then in the flesh like others, He was crucified, but not for the like sins. For He
was not led to death for covetousness, since He was a Teacher of poverty; nor was He condemned
for concupiscence, for He Himself says plainly, Whosoever shall look upon a woman
to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already1500; not for smiting or striking
hastily, for He turned the other cheek also to the smiter; not for despising the Law, for He
was the fulfiller of the Law; not for reviling a prophet, for it was Himself who was proclaimed
by the Prophets; not for defrauding any of their hire, for He ministered without reward and
freely; not for sinning in words, or deeds, or thoughts, He who did no sin, neither was guile
found in His mouth; who when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened
not1501; who came to His passion, not unwillingly, but willing; yea, if any dissuading Him say
even now, Be it far from Thee, Lord, He will say again, Get thee behind Me, Satan1502.</p>
<p>6. And wouldest thou be persuaded that He came to His passion willingly? others, who
foreknow it not, die unwillingly; but He spoke before of His passion: Behold, the Son of man
is betrayed to be crucified1503. But knowest thou wherefore this Friend of man shunned not
death? It was lest the whole world should perish in its sins. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem,
and the Son of man shall be betrayed, and shall be crucified1504; and again, He stedfastly set
His face to go to Jerusalem1505. And wouldest thou know certainly, that the Cross is a glory
to Jesus? Hear His own words, not mine. Judas had become ungrateful to the Master of
the house, and was about to betray Him. Having but just now gone forth from the table,
and drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that drought of salvation he sought to shed
righteous blood. He who did eat of His bread, was lifting up his heel against Him1506; his

he was plotting His death. And being reproved, and having heard that word, Thou hast
said1508, he again went out: then said Jesus, The hour is come, that the Son of man should
be glorified1509. Seest thou how He knew the Cross to be His proper glory? What then, is
Esaias not ashamed of being sawn asunder1510, and shall Christ be ashamed of dying for
the world? Now is the Son of man glorified1511. Not that He was without glory before: for
He was glorified with the glory which was before the foundation of the world1512. He was
ever glorified as God; but now He was to be glorified in wearing the Crown of His patience.
He gave not up His life by compulsion, nor was He put to death by murderous violence,
but of His own accord. Hear what He says: I have power to lay down My life, and I have
power to take it again1513: I yield it of My own choice to My enemies; for unless I chose,
this could not be. He came therefore of His own set purpose to His passion, rejoicing in
His noble deed, smiling at the crown, cheered by the salvation of mankind; not ashamed of
the Cross, for it was to save the world. For it was no common man who suffered, but God
in man’s nature, striving for the prize of His patience.</p>
<p>7. But the Jews contradict this1514, ever ready, as they are, to cavil, and backward to
believe; so that for this cause the Prophet just now read says, Lord, who hath believed our

Hefele (Councils II. p. 308) says—“It was a custom in the ancient Church, not indeed to consecrate, but to bless
those of the several breads of the same form laid on the altar which were not needed for the Communion, and
to employ them partly for the maintenance of the Clergy, and partly for distributing them to those of the faithful
who did not communicate at the Mass.” See Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. V. 24), with the note thereon in this Series.</note>

not spoken of, and they that have not heard shall understand1517, while they who study these
things shall set at nought what they study. They speak against us, and say, “Does the Lord
then suffer? What? Had men’s hands power over His sovereignty?” Read the Lamentations;
for in those Lamentations, Jeremias, lamenting you, wrote what is worthy of lamentations.
He saw your destruction, he beheld your downfall, he bewailed Jerusalem which then was;
for that which now is1518 shall not be bewailed; for that Jerusalem crucified the Christ, but
that which now is worships Him. Lamenting then he says, The breath of our countenance,
Christ the Lord was taken in our corruptions1519. Am I then stating views of my own? Behold
he testifies of the Lord Christ seized by men. And what is to follow from this? Tell me, O
Prophet. He says, Of whom we said, Under His shadow we shall live among the nations1520.
For he signifies that the grace of life is no longer to dwell in Israel, but among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>8. But since there has been much gainsaying by them, come, let me, with the help of
your prayers, (as the shortness of the time may allow,) set forth by the grace of the Lord
some few testimonies concerning the Passion. For the things concerning Christ are all put
into writing, and nothing is doubtful, for nothing is without a text. All are inscribed on the
monuments of the Prophets; clearly written, not on tablets of stone, but by the Holy Ghost.
Since then thou hast heard the Gospel speaking concerning Judas, oughtest thou not to receive
the testimony to it? Thou hast heard that He was pierced in the side by a spear; oughtest
thou not to see whether this also is written? Thou hast heard that He was crucified in a
garden; oughtest thou not to see whether this also is written? Thou hast heard that He was
sold for thirty pieces of silver; oughtest thou not to learn what prophet spake this? Thou
hast heard that He was given vinegar to drink; learn where this also is written. Thou hast
heard that His body was laid in a rock, and that a stone was set over it; oughtest thou not
to receive this testimony also from the prophet? Thou hast heard that He was crucified with
robbers; oughtest thou not to see whether this also is written? Thou hast heard that He was
buried; oughtest thou not to see whether the circumstances of His burial are anywhere accurately
written? Thou hast heard that He rose again; oughtest thou not to see whether we
mock thee in teaching these things? For our speech and our preaching is not in persuasive
words of man’s wisdom1521. We stir now no sophistical contrivances; for these become ex-

posed; we do not conquer words with words1522, for these come to an end; but we preach
Christ Crucified1523, who has already been preached aforetime by the Prophets. But do
thou, I pray, receive the testimonies, and seal them in thine heart. And, since they are many,
and the rest of our time is narrowed into a short space, listen now to a few of the more important
as time permits; and having received these beginnings, be diligent and seek out the
remainder. Let not thine hand be only stretched out to receive, but let it be also ready to
work1524. God gives all things freely. For if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God who
giveth1525, and he shall receive. May He through your prayer grant utterance to us who

<p>9. Let us then seek the testimonies to the Passion of Christ: for we are met together,
not now to make a speculative exposition of the Scriptures, but rather to be certified of the
things which we already believe. Now thou hast received from me first the testimonies
concerning the coming of Jesus; and concerning His walking on the sea, for it is written,
Thy way is in the sea1526. Also concerning divers cures thou hast on another occasion received
testimony. Now therefore I begin from whence the Passion began. Judas was the
traitor, and he came against Him, and stood, speaking words of peace, but plotting war.
Concerning him, therefore, the Psalmist says, My friends and My neighbours drew near
against Me, and stood1527. And again, Their words were softer than oil, yet be they spears1528.

My praise in silence; for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful, are opened
against Me; they have spoken against Me with a treacherous tongue, they have compassed Me
about also with words of hatred1532. But that some of the chief-priests also were present,
and that He was put in bonds before the gates of the city, thou hast heard before, if thou
rememberest the exposition of the Psalm, which has told the time and the place; how they
returned at evening, and hungered like dogs, and encompassed the city1533.</p>
<p>10. Listen also for the thirty pieces of silver. And I will say to them, If it be good in your
sight, give me my price, or refuse1534, and the rest. One price is owing to Me from you for
My healing the blind and lame, and I receive another; for thanksgiving, dishonour, and for
worship, insult. Seest thou how the Scripture foresaw these things? And they weighed for
My price thirty pieces of silver1535. How exact the prophecy! how great and unerring the
wisdom of the Holy Ghost! For he said, not ten, nor twenty, but thirty, exactly as many as
there were. Tell also what becomes of this price, O Prophet! Does he who received it keep
it? or does he give it back? and after he has given it back, what becomes of it? The Prophet
says then, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the house of the Lord, into
the foundry1536. Compare the Gospel with the Prophecy: Judas, it says, repented himself,
and cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed1537.</p>
<p>11. But now I have to seek the exact solution of this seeming discrepancy. For they
who make light of the prophets, allege that the Prophet says on the one hand, And I cast
them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry, but the Gospel on the other hand, And
they gave them for the potter’s field1538. Hear then how they are both true. For those conscientious
Jews forsooth, the high-priests of that time, when they saw that Judas repented
and said, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed innocent blood, reply, What is that to us, see
thou to that1539. Is it then nothing to you, the crucifiers? but shall he who received and restored
the price of murder see to it, and shall ye the murderers not see to it? Then they say
among themselves, It is not lawful to cast them into the treasury, because it is the price of
blood1540. Out of your own mouths is your condemnation; if the price is polluted, the deed

is polluted also: but if thou art fulfilling righteousness in crucifying Christ, why receivest
thou not the price of it? But the point of iniquity is this: how is there no disagreement, if
the Gospel says, the potter’s field, and the Prophet, the foundry? Nay, but not only people
who are goldsmiths, or brass-founders, have a foundry, but potters also have foundries for
their clay. For they sift off the fine and rich and useful earth from the gravel, and separate
from it the mass of the refuse matter, and temper the clay first with water, that they may
work it with ease into the forms intended. Why then wonderest thou that the Gospel says
plainly the potter’s field, whereas the Prophet spoke his prophecy like an enigma, since
prophecy is in many places enigmatical?</p>
<p>12. They bound Jesus, and brought Him into the hall of the High-priest. And wouldest
thou learn and know that this also is written? Esaias says, Woe unto their soul, for they have
taken evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the Just, for He is troublesome to
us1541. And truly, Woe unto their soul! Let us see how Esaias was sawn asunder, yet after
this the people was restored. Jeremias was cast into the mire of the cistern, yet was the
wound of the Jews healed; for the sin was less, since it was against man. But when the Jews
sinned, not against man, but against God in man’s nature, Woe unto their soul!—Let us bind
the Just; could He not then set Himself free, some one will say; He, who freed Lazarus from
the bonds of death on the fourth day, and loosed Peter from the iron bands of a prison?
Angels stood ready at hand, saying, Let us burst their bands in sunder1542; but they hold
back, because their Lord willed to undergo it. Again, He was led to the judgment-seat before
the Elders; thou hast already the testimony to this, The Lord Himself will come into judgment
with the ancients of His people, and with the princes thereof1543.</p>

wicked officer of wicked men smites Him; and the countenance, which had shone as the
sun, endured to be smitten by lawless hands. Others also come and spit on the face of Him,
who by spittle had healed the man who was blind from his birth. Do ye thus requite the
Lord? This people is foolish and unwise1544. And the Prophet greatly wondering, says, Lord,
who hath believed our report1545? for the thing is incredible, that God, the Son of God, and
the Arm of the Lord1546, should suffer such things. But that they who are being saved may

not disbelieve, the Holy Ghost writes before, in the person of Christ, who says, (for He who
then spake these things, was afterward Himself an actor in them,) I gave My back to the
scourges; (for Pilate, when he had scourged Him, delivered Him to be crucified1547;) and My
cheeks to smitings; and My face I turned not away from the shame of spittings; saying, as it
were, “Though knowing before that they will smite Me, I did not even turn My cheek aside;
for how should I have nerved My disciples against death for truth’s sake, had I Myself dreaded
this?” I said. He that loveth his life shall lose it1548: if I had loved My life, how was I to teach
without practising what I taught? First then, being Himself God, He endured to suffer these
things at the hands of men; that after this, we men, when we suffer such things at the hands
of men for His sake, might not be ashamed. Thou seest that of these things also the prophets
have clearly written beforehand. Many, however, of the Scripture testimonies I pass by for
want of time, as I said before; for if one should exactly search out all, not one of the things
concerning Christ would be left without witness.</p>
<p>14. Having been bound, He came from Caiaphas to Pilate,—is this too written? yes;
And having bound Him, they led Him away as a present to the king of Jarim1549. But here
some sharp hearer will object, “Pilate was not a king,” (to leave for a while the main parts
of the question,) “how then having bound Him, led they Him as a present to the king?” But
read thou the Gospel; When Pilate heard that He was of Galilee, he sent Him to Herod1550;
for Herod was then king, and was present at Jerusalem. And now observe the exactness of
the Prophet; for he says, that He was sent as a present; for the same day Pilate and Herod
were made friends together, for before they were at enmity1551. For it became Him who was
on the eve of making peace between earth and heaven, to make the very men who condemned
Him the first to be at peace; for the Lord Himself was there present, who reconciles1552 the
hearts of the princes of the earth. Mark the exactness of the Prophets, and their true testimony.</p>

<p>15. Look with awe then at the Lord who was judged. He suffered Himself to be led and
carried by soldiers. Pilate sat in judgment, and He who sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, stood and was judged1553. The people whom He had redeemed from the land of
Egypt, and oftimes from other places, shouted against Him, Away with Him, away with
Him, crucify Him1554. Wherefore, O ye Jews? because He healed your blind? or because He
made your lame to walk, and bestowed His other benefits? So that the Prophet in amazement
speaks of this too, Against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye let
loose your tongue1555? and the Lord Himself says in the Prophets, Mine heritage became
unto Me as a lion in the forest; it gave its voice against Me; therefore have I hated it1556. I
have not refused them, but they have refused Me; in consequence thereof I say, I have forsaken
My house1557.</p>
<p>16. When He was judged, He held His peace; so that Pilate was moved for Him, and
said, Hearest Thou not what these witness against Thee1558? Not that He knew Him who
was judged, but he feared his own wife’s dream which had been reported to him. And Jesus
held His peace. The Psalmist says, And I became as a man that heareth not; and in whose
mouth are no reproofs1559; and again, But I was as a deaf man and heard not; and as a dumb
man that openeth not his mouth1560. Thou hast before heard concerning this1561, if thou
rememberest.</p>
<p>17. But the soldiers who crowd around mock Him, and their Lord becomes a sport to
them, and upon their Master they make jests. When they looked on Me, they shaked their
heads1562. Yet the figure of kingly state appears; for though in mockery, yet they bend the
knee. And the soldiers before they crucify Him, put on Him a purple robe, and set a crown
on His head; for what though it be of thorns? Every king is proclaimed by soldiers; and Jesus
also must in a figure be crowned by soldiers; so that for this cause the Scripture says in the
Canticles, Go forth, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, and look upon King Solomon in the crown
wherewith His mother crowned Him1563. And the crown itself was a mystery; for it was a
remission of sins, a release from the curse.</p>

<p>18. Adam received the sentence, Cursed is the ground in thy labours; thorns and thistles
shall it bring forth to thee1564. For this cause Jesus assumes the thorns, that He may cancel
the sentence; for this cause also was He buried in the earth, that the earth which had been
cursed might receive the blessing instead of a curse. At the time of the sin, they clothed
themselves with fig-leaves; for this cause Jesus also made the fig-tree the last of His signs.
For when about to go to His passion, He curses the fig-tree, not every fig-tree, but that one
alone, for the sake of the figure; saying, No more let any man eat fruit of thee1565; let the
doom be cancelled. And because they aforetime clothed themselves with fig-leaves, He
came at a season when food was not wont to be found on the fig-tree. Who knows not that
in winter-time the fig-tree bears no fruit, but is clothed with leaves only? Was Jesus ignorant
of this, which all knew? No, but though He knew, yet He came as if seeking; not ignorant
that He should not find, but shewing that the emblematical curse extended to the leaves
only.</p>
<p>19. And since we have touched on things connected with Paradise, I am truly astonished
at the truth of the types. In Paradise was the Fall, and in a Garden was our Salvation. From
the Tree came sin, and until the Tree sin lasted. In the evening, when the Lord walked in the
Garden, they hid themselves1566; and in the evening the robber is brought by the Lord into
Paradise. But some one will say to me, “Thou art inventing subtleties; shew me from some
prophet the Wood of the Cross; except thou give me a testimony from a prophet, I will not
be persuaded. Hear then from Jeremias, and assure thyself; I was like a harmless lamb led
to be slaughtered; did I not know it1567? (for in this manner read it as a question, as I have
read it; for He who said, Ye know that after two days comes the passover, and the Son of Man
is betrayed to be crucified1568, did He not know?) I was like a harmless lamb led to be
slaughtered; did I not know it? (but what sort of lamb? let John the Baptist interpret it, when
he says, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world1569.) They devised

of them? And what said they?)—Come, and let us place a beam upon His bread1571—(and

Gospel bore the figure of bread;)—Come then, and let us place a beam upon His bread, and
cut Him off out of the land of the living;—(life is not cut off, why labour ye for nought?)—And
His name shall be remembered no more. Vain is your counsel; for before the sun His Name1572
abideth in the Church. And that it was Life, which hung on the Cross, Moses says, weeping,
And thy life shall be hanging before thine eyes; and thou shalt be afraid day and night, and
thou shalt not trust thy life1573. And so too, what was just now read as the text, Lord, who
hath believed our report?</p>
<p>20. This was the figure which Moses completed by fixing the serpent to a cross, that
whoso had been bitten by the living serpent, and looked to the brasen serpent, might be
saved by believing1574. Does then the brazen serpent save when crucified, and shall not the
Son of God incarnate save when crucified also? On each occasion life comes by means of
wood. For in the time of Noe the preservation of life was by an ark of wood. In the time of
Moses the sea, on beholding the emblematical rod, was abashed at him who smote it; is then
Moses’ rod mighty, and is the Cross of the Saviour powerless? But I pass by the greater part
of the types, to keep within measure. The wood in Moses’ case sweetened the water; and
from the side of Jesus the water flowed upon the wood.</p>
<p>21. The beginning of signs under Moses was blood and water; and the last of all Jesus’
signs was the same. First, Moses changed the river into blood; and Jesus at the last gave
forth from His side water with blood. This was perhaps on account of the two speeches, his
who judged Him, and theirs who cried out against Him; or because of the believers and the
unbelievers. For Pilate said, I am innocent and washed his hands in water; they who cried
out against Him said, His blood be upon us1575: there came therefore these two out of His
side; the water, perhaps, for him who judged Him; but for them that shouted against Him
the blood. And again it is to be understood in another way; the blood for the Jews, and the
<note type="footnote">the Greek. Hence arose the fanciful application of the passage to the cross laid on the body of Christ to be borne
by Him. Justin M. (Tryph. lxxii.) charges the Jews with having recently cut out the passage because of the supposed
reference to Christ. Tertullian (adv. Judæos, c. 10) writes: “Of course on His body that ‘wood’ was put; for so
Christ has revealed, calling His body ‘bread.’” He gives the same interpretation elsewhere (adv. Marcion. III.
19; IV. 40). Cf. Cyprian (Testimonia ad Quirinum, Lib. II. 15); Athanas. (de Incarn. § 33).</note>

water for the Christians: for upon them as plotters came the condemnation from the blood;
but to thee who now believest, the salvation which is by water. For nothing has been done
without a meaning. Our fathers who have written comments have given another reason of
this matter. For since in the Gospels the power of salutary Baptism is twofold, one which
is granted by means of water to the illuminated, and a second to holy martyrs, in persecutions,
through their own blood, there came out of that saving Side blood and water1576, to confirm
the grace of the confession made for Christ, whether in baptism, or on occasions of martyrdom.
There is another reason also for mentioning the Side. The woman, who was formed
from the side, led the way to sin; but Jesus who came to bestow the grace of pardon on men
and women alike, was pierced in the side for women, that He might undo the sin.</p>
<p>22. And whoever will inquire, will find other reasons also; but what has been said is
enough, because of the shortness of the time, and that the attention of my hearers may not
become sated. And yet we never can be tired of hearing concerning the crowning of our
Lord, and least of all in this most holy Golgotha. For others only hear, but we both see and
handle. Let none be weary; take thine armour against the adversaries in the cause of the
Cross itself; set up the faith of the Cross as a trophy against the gainsayers. For when thou
art going to dispute with unbelievers concerning the Cross of Christ, first make with thy
hand the sign of Christ’s Cross, and the gainsayer will be silenced. Be not ashamed to confess
the Cross; for Angels glory in it, saying, We know whom ye seek, Jesus the Crucified1577.
Mightest thou not say, O Angel, “I know whom ye seek, my Master?” But, “I,” he says with
boldness, “I know the Crucified.” For the Cross is a Crown, not a dishonour.</p>
<p>23. Now let us recur to the proof out of the Prophets which I spoke of. The Lord was
crucified; thou hast received the testimonies. Thou seest this spot of Golgotha! Thou answerest
with a shout of praise, as if assenting. See that thou recant not in time of persecution.
Rejoice not in the Cross in time of peace only, but hold fast the same faith in time of persecution
also; be not in time of peace a friend of Jesus, and His foe in time of wars. Thou receivest
now remission of thy sins, and the gifts of the King’s spiritual bounty; when war shall
come, strive thou nobly for thy King. Jesus, the Sinless, was crucified for thee; and wilt not
thou be crucified for Him who was crucified for thee? Thou art not bestowing a favour, for
thou hast first received; but thou art returning a favour, repaying thy debt to Him who was

crucified for thee in Golgotha. Now Golgotha is interpreted, “the place of a skull.” Who
were they then, who prophetically named this spot Golgotha, in which Christ the true Head
endured the Cross? As the Apostle says, Who is the Image of the Invisible God; and a little
after, and He is the Head of the body, the Church1578. And again, The Head of every man is
Christ1579; and again, Who is the Head of all principality and power1580. The Head suffered
in “the place of the skull.” O wondrous prophetic appellation! The very name also reminds
thee, saying, “Think not of the Crucified as of a mere man; He is the Head of all principality
and power. That Head which was crucified is the Head of all power, and has for His Head
the Father; for the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God1581.”</p>
<p>24. Christ then was crucified for us, who was judged in the night, when it was cold, and
therefore a fire of coals1582 was laid. He was crucified at the third hour; and from the sixth
hour there was darkness until the ninth hour1583; but from the ninth hour there was light
again. Are these things also written? Let us inquire. Now the Prophet Zacharias says, And
it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light, and there shall be cold and frost
one day; (the cold on account of which Peter warmed himself;) And that day shall be known
unto the Lord1584; (what, knew He not the other days? days are many, but this is the day of
the Lord’s patience, which the Lord made1585;)—And that day shall be known unto the Lord,
not day, and not night: what is this dark saying which the Prophet speaks? That day is
neither day nor night? what then shall we name it? The Gospel interprets it, by relating the
event. It was not day; for the sun shone not uniformly from his rising to his setting, but
from the sixth hour till the ninth hour, there was darkness at mid-day. The darkness
therefore was interposed; but God called the darkness night1586. Wherefore it was neither
day nor night: for neither was it all light, that it should be called day; nor was it all darkness,
that it should be called night; but after the ninth hour the sun shone forth. This also the
Prophet foretels; for after saying, Not day, nor night, he added, And at evening time it shall

which were written aforetime?</p>
<p>25. But dost thou ask exactly at what hour the sun failed1588? was it the fifth hour, or
the eighth, or the tenth? Tell, O Prophet, the exact time thereof to the Jews, who are unwilling
to hear; when shall the sun go down? The Prophet Amos answers, And it shall come to pass
in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at noon (for there was darkness
from the sixth hour;) and the light shall grow dark over the earth in the day1589.” What sort
of season is this, O Prophet, and what sort of day? And I will turn your feasts into mourning;
for this was done in the days of unleavened bread, and at the feast of the Passover: then afterwards
he says, And I will make Him as the mourning of an Only Son, and those with Him
as a day of anguish1590; for in the day of unleavened bread, and at the feast, their women
were wailing and weeping, and the Apostles had hidden themselves and were in anguish.
Wonderful then is this prophecy.</p>
<p>26. But, some one will say, “Give me yet another sign; what other exact sign is there of
that which has come to pass? Jesus was crucified; and He wore but one coat, and one cloak:
now His cloak the soldiers shared among themselves, having rent it into four; but His coat
was not rent, for when rent it would have been no longer of any use; so about this lots are
cast by the soldiers; thus the one they divide, but for the other they cast lots. Is then this
also written? They know, the diligent chanters1591 of the Church, who imitate the Angel
hosts, and continually sing praises to God: who are thought worthy to chant Psalms in this
Golgotha, and to say, They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture they did

purple? For Bosor has some such meaning in Hebrew1595.) Why are Thy garments red,
and Thy raiment as from a trodden wine-press? But He answers and says, All day long have
I stretched forth Mine hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people1596.</p>
<p>28. He stretched out His hands on the Cross, that He might embrace the ends of the
world; for this Golgotha is the very centre of the earth. It is not my word, but it is a prophet
who hath said, Thou hast wrought salvation in the midst of the earth1597. He stretched forth
human hands, who by His spiritual hands had established the heaven; and they were fastened
with nails, that His manhood, which here the sins of men, having been nailed to the tree,
and having died, sin might die with it, and we might rise again in righteousness. For since
by one man came death, by One Man came also life1598; by One Man, the Saviour, dying of
His own accord: for remember what He said, I have power to lay down My life, and I have
power to take it again1599.</p>
<p>29. But though He endured these things, having come for the salvation of all, yet the
people returned Him an evil recompense. Jesus saith, I thirst1600,—He who had brought
forth the waters for them out of the craggy rock; and He asked fruit of the Vine which He
had planted. But what does the Vine? This Vine, which was by nature of the holy fathers,
but of Sodom by purpose of heart;—(for their Vine is of Sodom, and their tendrils of Gomorrah1601;)—
this Vine, when the Lord was athirst, having filled a sponge and put it on a reed,
offers Him vinegar. They gave Me also gall for My meat, and in My thirst, they gave Me
vinegar to drink1602. Thou seest the clearness of the Prophets’ description. But what sort
of gall put they into My mouth? They gave Him, it says, wine mingled with myrrh1603. Now

myrrh is in taste like gall, and very bitter. Are these things what ye recompense unto the
Lord? Are these thy offerings, O Vine, unto thy Master? Rightly did the Prophet Esaias
aforetime bewail you, saying, My well-beloved had a vineyard in a hill in a fruitful place; and
(not to recite the whole) I waited, he says, that it should bring forth grapes; I thirsted that it
should give wine; but it brought forth thorns1604; for thou seest the crown, wherewith I am
adorned. What then shall I now decree? I will command the clouds that they rain no rain
upon it1605. For the clouds which are the Prophets were removed from them, and are for
the future in the Church; as Paul says, Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the others
judge1606; and again, God gave in the Church, some, Apostles, and some, Prophets1607.
Agabus, who bound his own feet and hands, was a prophet.</p>
<p>30. Concerning the robbers who were crucified with Him, it is written, And He was
numbered with the transgressors1608. Both of them were before this transgressors, but one
was so no longer. For the one was a transgressor to the end, stubborn against salvation;
who, though his hands were fastened, smote with blasphemy by his tongue. When the Jews
passing by wagged their heads, mocking the Crucified, and fulfilling what was written, When
they looked on Me, they shaked their heads1609, he also reviled with them. But the other rebused
the reviler; and it was to him the end of life and the beginning of restoration; the
surrender of his soul a first share in salvation. And after rebuking the other, he says, Lord,
remember me1610; for with Thee is my account. Heed not this man, for the eyes of his understanding
are blinded; but remember me. I say not, remember my works, for of these I
am afraid. Every man has a feeling for his fellow-traveller; I am travelling with Thee towards
death; remember me, Thy fellow-wayfarer. I say not, Remember me now, but, when Thou

reached unto a distant time; but the grace was very speedy. Verily I say unto thee, This day
shalt thou be with Me in Paradise; because to-day thou hast heard My voice, and hast not
hardened thine heart1612. Very speedily I passed sentence upon Adam, very speedily I pardon
thee. To him it was said, In the day wherein ye eat, ye shall surely die1613; but thou to-day
hast obeyed the faith, to-day is thy salvation. Adam by the Tree fell away; thou by the Tree
art brought into Paradise. Fear not the serpent; he shall not cast thee out; for he is fallen
from heaven1614. And I say not unto thee, This day shalt thou depart, but, This day shalt
thou be with Me. Be of good courage: thou shalt not be cast out. Fear not the flaming sword;
it shrinks from its Lord1615. O mighty and ineffable grace! The faithful Abraham had not
yet entered, but the robber enters1616! Moses and the Prophets had not yet entered, and
the robber enters though a breaker of the law. Paul also wondered at this before thee, saying,
Where sin abounded, there grace did much more abound1617. They who had borne the heat
of the day had not yet entered; and he of the eleventh hour entered. Let none murmur
against the goodman of the house, for he says, Friend, I do thee no wrong; is it not lawful for
Me to do what I will with Mine own1618? The robber has a will to work righteousness, but
death prevents him; I wait not exclusively for the work, but faith also I accept. I am come
who feed My sheep among the lilies1619, I am come to feed them in the gardens. I have found

For the mystery has been fulfilled; the things that are written have been accomplished; sins
are forgiven. For Christ being come an High-Priest of the good things to come, by the greater
and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, nor yet
by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, entered in once for all into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption; for if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes
of an heifer, sprinkling the defiled, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more
the blood of Christ1625? And again, Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us,
through the veil, that is to say, His flesh1626. And because His flesh, this veil, was dishonoured,
therefore the typical veil of the temple was rent asunder, as it is written, And, behold, the
veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom1627; for not a particle of it was
left; for since the Master said, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate1628, the house
brake all in pieces.</p>
<p>33. These things the Saviour endured, and made peace through the Blood of His Cross,
for things in heaven, and things in earth1629. For we were enemies of God through sin, and
God had appointed the sinner to die. There must needs therefore have happened one of
two things; either that God, in His truth, should destroy all men, or that in His lovingkindness
He should cancel the sentence. But behold the wisdom of God; He preserved both
the truth of His sentence, and the exercise of His loving-kindness. Christ took our sins in
His body on the tree, that we by His death might die to sin, and live unto righteousness1630.
Of no small account was He who died for us; He was not a literal sheep; He was not a mere
man; He was more than an Angel; He was God made man. The transgression of sinners
was not so great as the righteousness of Him who died for them; the sin which we committed
was not so great as the righteousness which He wrought who laid down His life for us,—who
laid it down when He pleased, and took it again when He pleased. And wouldest thou know
that He laid not down His life by violence, nor yielded up the ghost against His will? He
cried to the Father, saying, Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit1631; I commend it,

any long time, for He quickly rose again from the dead.</p>
<p>34. The Sun was darkened, because of the Sun of Righteousness1633. Rocks were rent,
because of the spiritual Rock. Tombs were opened, and the dead arose, because of Him
who was free among the dead1634; He sent forth His prisoners out of the pit wherein is no
water1635. Be not then ashamed of the Crucified, but be thou also bold to say, He beareth
our sins, and endureth grief for us, and with His stripes we are healed1636. Let us not be unthankful
to our Benefactor. And again; for the transgression of my people was He led to death;
and I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death1637. Therefore Paul says
plainly, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and
that He hath risen again the third day according to the Scriptures1638.</p>
<p>35. But we seek to know clearly where He has been buried. Is His tomb made with
hands? Is it, like the tombs of kings, raised above the ground? Is the Sepulchre made of
stones joined together? And what is laid upon it? Tell us, O Prophets, the exact truth concerning
His tomb also, where He is laid, and where we shall seek Him? And they say, Look
into the solid rock which ye have hewn1639. Look in and behold. Thou hast in the Gospels
In a sepulchre hewn in stone, which was hewn out of a rock1640. And what happens next?
What kind of door has the sepulchre? Again another Prophet says, They cut off My life in
a dungeon1641, and cast a stone upon Me. I, who am the Chief corner-stone, the elect, the
precious1642, lie for a little time within a stone—I who am a stone of stumbling to the Jews,
and of salvation to them who believe. The Tree of life1643, therefore was planted in the earth,
that the earth which had been cursed might enjoy the blessing, and that the dead might be
released.</p>

grace is from God. It is the Sign of the faithful, and the dread of devils: for He triumphed
over them in it, having made a shew of them openly1645; for when they see the Cross they
are reminded of the Crucified; they are afraid of Him, who bruised the heads of the
dragon1646. Despise not the Seal, because of the freeness of the gift; out for this the rather
honour thy Benefactor.</p>
<p>37. And if thou ever fall into disputation and hast not the grounds of proof, yet let Faith
remain firm in thee; or rather, become thou well learned, and then silence the Jews out of
the prophets, and the Greeks out of their own fables. They themselves worship men who
have been thunderstricken1647: but the thunder when it comes from heaven, comes not at
random. If they are not ashamed to worship men thunderstricken and abhorred of God,
art thou ashamed to worship the beloved Son of God, who was crucified for thee? I am
ashamed to tell the tales about their so-called Gods, and I leave them because of time; let
those who know, speak. And let all heretics also be silenced. If any say that the Cross is an
illusion, turn away from him. Abhor those who say that Christ was crucified to our fancy1648
only; for if so, and if salvation is from the Cross, then is salvation a fancy also. If the Cross
is fancy, the Resurrection is fancy also; but if Christ be not risen, we are yet in our sins1649.
If the Cross is fancy, the Ascension also is fancy; and if the Ascension is fancy, then is the
second coming also fancy, and everything is henceforth unsubstantial.</p>
<p>38. Take therefore first, as an indestructible foundation, the Cross, and build upon it
the other articles of the faith. Deny not the Crucified; for, if thou deny Him, thou hast many
to arraign thee. Judas the traitor will arraign thee first; for he who betrayed Him knows that
He was condemned to death by the chief-priests and elders. The thirty pieces of silver bear
witness; Gethsemane bears witness, where the betrayal occurred; I speak not yet of the Mount
of Olives, on which they were with Him at night, praying. The moon in the night bears
witness; the day bears witness, and the sun which was darkened; for it endured not to look
on the crime of the conspirators. The fire will arraign thee, by which Peter stood and warmed

himself; if thou deny the Cross, the eternal fire awaits thee. I speak hard words, that thou
may not experience hard pains. Remember the swords that came against Him in Gethsemane,
that thou feel not the eternal sword. The house of Caiaphas1650 will arraign thee, shewing
by its present desolation the power of Him who was erewhile judged there. Yea, Caiaphas
himself will rise up against thee in the day of judgment, the very servant will rise up against
thee, who smote Jesus with the palm of his hand; they also who bound Him, and they who
led Him away. Even Herod shall rise up against thee; and Pilate; as if saying, Why deniest
thou Him who was slandered before us by the Jews, and whom we knew to have done no
wrong? For I Pilate then washed my hands. The false witnesses shall rise up against thee,
and the soldiers who arrayed Him in the purple robe, and set on Him the crown of thorns,
and crucified Him in Golgotha, and cast lots for His coat. Simon the Cyrenian will cry out
upon thee, who bore the Cross after Jesus.</p>
<p>39. From among the stars there will cry out upon thee, the darkened Sun; among the
things upon earth, the Wine mingled with myrrh; among reeds, the Reed; among herbs, the
Hyssop; among the things of the sea, the Sponge; among trees, the Wood of the Cross;—the
soldiers, too, as I have said, who nailed Him, and cast lots for His vesture; the soldier who
pierced His side with the spear; the women who then were present; the veil of the temple
then rent asunder; the hall of Pilate, now laid waste by the power of Him who was then
crucified; this holy Golgotha, which stands high above us, and shews itself to this day, and
displays even yet how because of Christ the rocks were then riven1651; the sepulchre nigh
at hand where He was laid; and the stone which was laid on the door, which lies to this day
by the tomb; the Angels who were then present; the women who worshipped Him after His
resurrection; Peter and John, who ran to the sepulchre; and Thomas, who thrust his hand
into His side, and his fingers into the prints of the nails. For it was for our sakes that he so
carefully handled Him; and what thou, who wert not there present, wouldest have sought,
he being present, by God’s Providence, did seek.</p>
<note type="footnote">1650 The house of Caiaphas and Pilate’s Prætorium (§ 41), and Mount Zion itself (Cat. xvi. 18), on which
they both stood are described by Cyril as being in his time ruined and desolate. Eusebius (Dem. Ev. VIII. 406),
referring to the prophecy of Micah (iii. 12), repeated by Jeremiah (xxvi. 18), that Zion shall be plowed as a field,
and Jerusalem shall become heaps, testifies that he had seen with his own eyes the place being ploughed and
sown by strangers, and adds that in his own time the stones for both public and private buildings were taken
from the ruins. The Bordeaux Pilgrim (333 a.d.) says, “It is evident where the house of Caiaphas the Priest was;
and there is still the pillar at which Christ was scourged:” this pillar is described by Jerome (Ep. 86) as supporting
the portico of the Church which by his time had been built on the spot. Prudentius circ. 400 a.d.):— “Impia
blasphemi cecidit domus alta Caiphae.… Vinctus in his Dominus stetit ædibus atque columnae Annexus tergum

<p>40. Thou hast Twelve Apostles, witnesses of the Cross; and the whole earth, and the
world of men who believe on Him who hung thereon. Let thy very presence here now persuade
thee of the power of the Crucified. For who now brought thee to this assembly? what
soldiers? With what bonds wast thou constrained? What sentence held thee fast here now?
Nay, it was the Trophy of salvation, the Cross of Jesus that brought you all together. It was
this that enslaved the Persians, and tamed the Scythians; this that gave to the Egyptians, for
cats and dogs and their manifold errors, the knowledge of God; this, that to this day heals
diseases; that to this day drives away devils, and overthrows the juggleries of drugs and
charms.</p>
<p>41. This shall appear again with Jesus from heaven1652; for the trophy shall precede the
king: that seeing Him whom they pierced1653, and knowing by the Cross Him who was
dishonoured, the Jews may repent and mourn; (but they shall mourn tribe by tribe1654, for
they shall repent, when there shall be no more time for repentance;) and that we may glory,
exulting in the Cross, worshipping the Lord who was sent, and crucified for us, and worshipping
also God His Father who sent Him, with the Holy Ghost: To whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>On the Words, And Rose Again from the Dead on the Third Day, and Ascended
into the Heavens, and Sat on the Right Hand of the Father.</head>
<p>1 Cor. xv. 1–4</p>
<p>Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you….that He hath
been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, U+0026c. </p>
<p>Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and keep high festival, all ye that love Jesus; for He is risen. Rejoice,
all ye that mourned before1655, when ye heard of the daring and wicked deeds of the Jews:
for He who was spitefully entreated of them in this place is risen again. And as the discourse
concerning the Cross was a sorrowful one, so let the good tidings of the Resurrection bring
joy to the hearers. Let mourning be turned into gladness, and lamentation to joy: and let
our mouth be filled with joy and gladness, because of Him, who after His resurrection, said
Rejoice1656. For I know the sorrow of Christ’s friends in these past days; because, as our
discourse stopped short at the Death and the Burial, and did not tell the good tidings of the
Resurrection, your mind was in suspense, to hear what you were longing for.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, the Dead is risen, He who was free among the dead1657, and the deliverer
of the dead. He who in dishonour wore patiently the crown of thorns, even He arose, and
crowned Himself with the diadem of His victory over death.</p>
<p>2. As then we set forth the testimonies concerning His Cross, so come let us now verify
the proofs of His Resurrection also: since the Apostle before us1658 affirms, He was buried,
and has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. As an Apostle, therefore,
has sent us back to the testimonies of the Scriptures, it is good that we should get full
knowledge of the hope of our salvation; and that we should learn first whether the divine
Scriptures tell us the season of His resurrection, whether it comes in summer or in autumn,
or after winter; and from what kind of place the Saviour has risen, and what has been announced
in the admirable Prophets as the name of the place of the Resurrection, and
whether the women, who sought and found Him not, afterwards rejoice at finding Him; in
order that when the Gospels are read, the narratives of these holy Scriptures may not be
thought fables nor rhapsodies.</p>

<p>3. That the Saviour then was buried, ye have heard distinctly in the preceding discourse,
as Isaiah saith, His burial shall be in peace1659: for in His burial He made peace between
heaven and earth, bringing sinners unto God: and, that the righteous is taken out of the way
of unrighteousness1660: and, His burial shall be in peace: and, I will give the wicked for His
burial1661. There is also the prophecy of Jacob saying in the Scriptures, He lay down and
couched as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp: who shall rouse Him up1662? And the similar passage
in Numbers, He couched, He lay down as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp1663. The Psalm also
ye have often heard, which says, And Thou hast brought me down into the dust of death1664.
Moreover we took note of the spot, when we quoted the words, Look unto the rock, which
ye have hewn1665. But now let the testimonies concerning His resurrection itself go with
us on our way.</p>
<p>4. First, then, in the 11th Psalm He says, For the misery of the poor, and the sighing of
the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord1666. But this passage still remains doubtful with
some: for He often rises up also in anger1667, to take vengeance upon His enemies.
Come then to the 15th Psalm, which says distinctly: Preserve Me, O Lord, for in Thee
have I put my trust1668: and after this, their assemblies of blood will I not join, nor make
mention of their names between my lips1669; since they have refused me, and chosen Cæsar
as their king1670: and also the next words, I foresaw the Lord alway before Me, because He
is at My right hand, that I may not be moved1671: and soon after Yea and even until night
my reins chastened me1672. And after this He says most plainly, For Thou wilt not leave My
soul in hell1673; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption. He said not,

neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see death, since then He would not have died;
but corruption, saith He, I see not, and shall not abide in death. Thou hast made known to
Me the ways of life1674. Behold here is plainly preached a life after death. Come also to the
29th Psalm, I will extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted Me up, and hast not made My foes
to rejoice over Me1675. What is it that took place? Wert thou rescued from enemies, or wert
thou released when about to be smitten? He says himself most plainly, O Lord, Thou hast
brought up My soul from hell1676. There he says, Thou wilt not leave, prophetically: and
here he speaks of that which is to take place as having taken place, Thou hast brought up.
Thou hast saved Me from them that go down into the pit1677. At what time shall the event
occur? Weeping shall continue for the evening, and joy cometh in the morning1678: for in
the evening was the sorrow of the disciplines, and in the morning the joy of the resurrection.</p>
<p>5. But wouldst thou know the place also? Again He saith in Canticles, I went down into
the garden of nuts1679; for it was a garden where He was crucified1680. For though it has
now been most highly adorned with royal gifts, yet formerly it was a garden, and the signs
and the remnants of this remain. A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed1681, by the Jews who
said, We remember that that deceiver said while He was yet alive, After three days, I will rise:
command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure; and further on, So they went, and made
the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone with the guard1682. And aiming well at these, one saith,
and in rest Thou shalt judge them1683. But who is the fountain that is sealed, or who is interpreted
as being a well-spring of living water1684? It is the Saviour Himself, concerning
whom it is written, For with Thee is the fountain of life1685.</p>
<p>6. But what says Zephaniah in the person of Christ to the disciples? Prepare thyself, be
rising at the dawn: all their gleaning is destroyed1686: the gleaning, that is, of the Jews, with

whom there is not a cluster, nay not even a gleaning of salvation left; for their vine is cut
down. See how He says to the disciples, Prepare thyself, rise up at dawn: at dawn expect
the Resurrection.</p>
<p>And farther on in the same context of Scripture He says, Therefore wait thou for Me,
saith the Lord, until the day of My Resurrection at the Testimony1687. Thou seest that the
Prophet foresaw the place also of the Resurrection, which was to be surnamed “the Testimony.”
For what is the reason that this spot of Golgotha and of the Resurrection is not
called, like the rest of the Churches, a Church, but a Testimony? Why, perhaps, it was because
of the Prophet, who had said, until the day of My Resurrection at the Testimony.</p>
<p>7. And who then is this, and what is the sign of Him that rises? In the words of the
Prophet that follow in the same context, He says plainly, For then will I turn to the peoples
a language1688: since, after the Resurrection, when the Holy Ghost was sent forth the gift
of tongues was granted, that they might serve the Lord under one yoke1689. And what other
token is set forth in the same Prophet, that they should serve the Lord under one yoke? From
beyond the rivers of Ethiopia they shall bring me offerings1690. Thou knowest what is written
in the Acts, when the Ethiopian eunuch came from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia1691. When
therefore the Scriptures tell both the time and the peculiarity of the place, when they tell
also the signs which followed the Resurrection, have thou henceforward a firm faith in the
Resurrection, and let no one stir thee from confessing Christ risen from the dead1692.</p>
<p>8. Now take also another testimony in the 87th Psalm, where Christ speaks in the
Prophets, (for He who then spoke came afterwards among us): O Lord, God of My salvation,
I have cried day and night before Thee, and a little, farther on, I became as it were a man
without help, free among the dead1693. He said not, I became a man without help; but, as it
were a man without help. For indeed He was crucified not from weakness, but willingly and
His Death was not from involuntary weakness. I was counted with them that go down into
the pit1694. And what is the token? Thou hast put away Mine acquaintance far from Me1695
<note type="footnote">1687 Zeph. iii. 8: until the day that I rise up to the prey. For 􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀, to the prey, the LXX. seem to have read 􀀀􀀀􀀀“􀀀􀀀,
to the testimony. About ten years before these Lectures were delivered, Eusebius (Life of Constantine, III. c.
xxviii.), speaking of the discovery of the Holy Sepulchre, a.d. 326, calls it “a testimony to the Resurrection of the
Saviour clearer than any voice could give.”</note>

(for the disciples have fled). Wilt Thou shew wonders to the dead1696? Then a little while
afterwards: And unto Thee have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer come
before Thee1697. Seest thou how they shew the exact point of the Hour, and of the Passion
and of the Resurrection?</p>
<p>9. And whence hath the Saviour risen? He says in the Song of Songs: Rise up, come,
My neighbour1698: and in what follows, in a cave of the rock1699! A cave of the rock He
called the cave which was erewhile before the door of the Saviour’s sepulchre, and had been
hewn out of the rock itself, as is wont to be done here in front of the sepulchres. For now
it is not to be seen, since the outer cave was cut away at that time for the sake of the present
adornment. For before the decoration of the sepulchre by the royal munificence, there was
a cave in the front of the rock1700. But where is the rock that had in it the cave? Does it lie
near the middle of the city, or near the walls and the outskirts? And whether is it within
the ancient walls, or within the outer walls which were built afterwards? He says then in
the Canticles: in a cave of the rock, close to the outer wall1701.</p>
<p>10. At what season does the Saviour rise? Is it the season of summer, or some other?
In the same Canticles immediately before the words quoted He says, The winter is past, the
rain is past and gone1702; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the pruning is
come1703. Is not then the earth full of flowers now, and are they not pruning the vines?
Thou seest how he said also that the winter is now past. For when this month Xanthicus1704
is come, it is already spring. And this is the season, the first month with the Hebrews, in
which occurs the festival of the Passover, the typical formerly, but now the true. This is the
season of the creation of the world: for then God said, Let the earth bring forth herbage of

grass, yielding seed after his kind and after his likeness1705. And now, as thou seest, already
every herb is yielding seed. And as at that time God made the sun and moon and gave them
courses of equal day (and night), so also a few days since was the season of the equinox.</p>
<p>At that time God said, let us make man after our image and after our likeness1706. And
the image he received, but the likeness through his disobedience he obscured. At the same
season then in which he lost this the restoration also took place. At the same season as the
created man through disobedience was cast out of Paradise, he who believed was through
obedience brought in. Our Salvation then took place at the same season as the Fall: when
the flowers appeared, and the pruning was come.</p>
<p>11. A garden was the place of His Burial, and a vine that which was planted there: and
He hath said, I am the vine1707! He was planted therefore in the earth in order that the curse
which came because of Adam might be rooted out. The earth was condemned to thorns
and thistles: the true Vine sprang up out of the earth, that the saying might be fulfilled,
Truth sprang up out of the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven1708. And what
will He that is buried in the garden say? I have gathered My myrrh with My spices: and
again, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices1709. Now these are the symbols of the burying;

(likeness), and the Greek Church does the same in its Confession. The latter phrase expresses man’s destination,
which is not to be regarded as carried out at the moment of creation. (Dorner, System of Christian Doctrine, E.
Tr. II. p. 78). The image lies in the permanent capacities of man’s nature (Gen. ix. 6; 1 Cor. xi. 7; Jas. iii. 9), the
likeness in their realisation in moral conformity with God (ὁμοήθειαν Θεοῦ, Ignatius, Magnes vi). “The image
of God is a comprehensive thing.…To this belongs man’s intellective power, his liberty of will, his dominion
over the other creatures flowing from the two former. These make up the τὸ οὐσιῶδες, that part of that divine
image which is natural and essential to man, and consequently can never be wholly blotted out, defaced, or extinguished,
but still remains even in man fallen. But beside these the Church of God hath ever acknowledged,
in the first man, certain additional ornaments, and as it were complements of the divine image, such as immortality,
grace, holiness, righteousness, whereby man approached more nearly to the similitude and likeness of
God. These were (if I may so speak) the lively colours wherein the grace, the beauty, and lustre of the divine
image principally consisted; these colours faded, yea, were defaced and blotted out by man’s transgression.

farther on it is written, I did eat My bread with My honey1712: the bitter before the Passion,
and the sweet after the Resurrection. Then after He had risen He entered through closed
doors: but they believed not that it was He: for they supposed that they beheld a spirit1713.
But He said, Handle Me and see. Put your fingers into the print of the nails, as Thomas required.
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them, Have ye
here anything to eat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and honeycomb1714. Seest
thou how that is fulfilled, I did eat My bread with My honey.</p>
<p>12. But before He entered through the closed doors, the Bridegroom and Suitor1715 of
souls was sought by those noble and brave women. They came, those blessed ones, to the
sepulchre, and sought Him Who had been raised, and the tears were still dropping from
their eyes, when they ought rather to have been dancing with joy for Him that had risen.
Mary came seeking Him, according to the Gospel, and found Him not: and presently she
heard from the Angels, and afterwards saw the Christ. Are then these things also written?
He says in the Song of Songs, On my bed I sought Him whom my soul loved. At what season?
By night on my bed I sought Him Whom my soul loved: Mary, it says, came while it was yet
dark. On my bed I sought Him by night, I sought Him, and I found Him not1716. And in the
Gospels Mary says, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid
Him1717. But the Angels being then present cure their want of knowledge; for they said,
Why seek ye the living among the dead1718? He not only rose, but had also the dead with
Him when He rose1719. But she knew not, and in her person the Song of Songs said to the
Angels, Saw ye Him Whom my soul loved? It was but a little that I passed from them (that
is, from the two Angels), until I found Him Whom my soul loved. I held Him, and would
not let Him go1720.</p>

<p>13. For after the vision of the Angels, Jesus came as His own Herald; and the Gospel
says, And behold Jesus met them, saying, All hail! and they came and took hold of His feet1721.
They took hold of Him, that it might be fulfilled, I will hold Him, and will not let Him go.
Though the woman was weak in body, her spirit was manful. Many waters quench not love,
neither do rivers drown it1722; He was dead whom they sought, yet was not the hope of the
Resurrection quenched. And the Angel says to them again, Fear not ye; I say not to the
soldiers, fear not, but to you1723; as for them, let them be afraid, that, taught by experience,
they may bear witness and say, Truly this was the Son of God1724; but you ought not to be
afraid, for perfect love casteth out fear1725. Go, tell His disciples that He is risen1726; and the
rest. And they depart with joy, yet full of fear; is this also written? yes, the second Psalm,
which relates the Passion of Christ, says, Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with
trembling1727;—rejoice, because of the risen Lord; but with trembling, because of the earthquake,
and the Angel who appeared as lightning.</p>
<p>14. Though, therefore, Chief Priests and Pharisees through Pilate’s means sealed the
tomb; yet the women beheld Him who was risen. And Esaias knowing the feebleness of the
Chief Priests, and the women’s strength of faith, says, Ye women, who come from beholding,
come hither1728; for the people hath no understanding;—the Chief Priests want understanding,
while women are eye-witnesses. And when the soldiers came into the city to them, and told
them all that had come to pass, they said to them, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and
stole Him away while we slept1729? Well therefore did Esaias foretell this also, as in their
persons, But tell us, and relate to us another deceit1730. He who rose again, is up, and for a
gift of money they persuade the soldiers; but they persuade not the kings of our time. The
soldiers then surrendered the truth for silver; but the kings of this day have, in their piety,
built this holy Church of the Resurrection of God our Saviour, inlaid with silver and wrought
with gold, in which we are assembled1731; and embellished it with the treasures of silver and

gold and precious stones. And if this come to the governor’s ears, they say, we will persuade
him1732. Yea, though ye persuade the soldiers, yet ye will not persuade the world; for why,
as Peter’s guards were condemned when he escaped out of the prison, were not they also
who watched Jesus Christ condemned? Upon the former, sentence was pronounced by
Herod, for they were ignorant and had nothing to say for themselves; while the latter, who
had seen the truth, and concealed it for money, were protected by the Chief Priests. Nevertheless,
though but a few of the Jews were persuaded at the time, the world became obedient.
They who hid the truth were themselves hidden; but they who received it were made
manifest by the power of the Saviour, who not only rose from the dead, but also raised the
dead with Himself. And in the person of these the Prophet Osee says plainly, After two days
will He revive us, and in the third day we shall rise again, and shall live in His sight1733.</p>
<p>15. But since the disobedient Jews will not be persuaded by the Divine Scriptures, but
forgetting all that is written gainsay the Resurrection of Jesus, it were good to answer them
thus: On what ground, while you say that Eliseus and Elias raised the dead, do you gainsay
the Resurrection of our Saviour? Is it that we have no living witnesses now out of that generation
to what we say? Well, do you also bring forward witnesses of the history of that
time. But that is written;—so is this also written: why then do ye receive the one, and reject
the other? They were Hebrews who wrote that history; so were all the Apostles Hebrews:
why then do ye disbelieve the Jews1734? Matthew who wrote the Gospel wrote it in the
Hebrew tongue1735; and Paul the preacher was a Hebrew of the Hebrews; and the twelve
Apostles were all of Hebrew race: then fifteen Bishops of Jerusalem were appointed in succession
from among the Hebrews1736. What then is your reason for allowing your own
accounts, and rejecting ours, though these also are written by Hebrews from among
yourselves.</p>

<p>16. But it is impossible, some one will say, that the dead should rise; and yet Eliseus
twice raised the dead,—when he was alive, and also when dead. Do we then believe, that
when Eliseus was dead, a dead man who was cast upon him and touched him, arose and is
Christ not risen? But in that case, the dead man who touched Eliseus, arose, yet he who
raised him continued nevertheless dead: but in this case both the Dead of whom we speak
Himself arose, and many dead were raised without having even touched Him. For many
bodies of the Saints which slept arose, and they came out of the graves after His Resurrection,
and went into the Holy City1737, (evidently this city, in which we now are1738,) and appeared
unto many. Eliseus then raised a dead man, but he conquered not the world; Elias raised a
dead man, but devils are not driven away in the name of Elias. We are not speaking evil of
the Prophets, but we are celebrating their Master more highly; for we do not exalt our own
wonders by disparaging theirs; for theirs also are ours; but by what happened among them,
we win credence for our own.</p>
<p>17. But again they say, “A corpse then lately dead was raised by the living; but shew us
that one three days dead can possibly arise, and that a man should be buried, and rise after
three days.” If we seek for Scripture testimony in proof of such facts, the Lord Jesus Christ
Himself supplies it in the Gospels, saying, For as Jonas was three days and three nights in
the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth1739. And when we examine the story of Jonas, great is the force1740 of the resemblance.
Jesus was sent to preach repentance; Jonas also was sent: but whereas the one fled, not
knowing what should come to pass; the other came willingly, to give repentance unto salvation.
Jonas was asleep in the ship, and snoring amidst the stormy sea; while Jesus also slept,
the sea, according to God’s providence1741, began to rise, to shew in the sequel the might
of Him who slept. To the one they said, Why art thou snoring? Arise, call upon thy God,
that God may save us1742; but in the other case they say unto the Master, Lord, save us1743.
Then they said, Call upon thy God; here they say, save Thou. But the one says, Take me, and
cast me into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you1744; the other, Himself rebuked the

winds and the sea, and there was a great calm1745. The one was cast into a whale’s belly:
but the other of His own accord went down thither, where the invisible whale of death is.
And He went down of His own accord, that death might cast up those whom he had devoured,
according to that which is written, I will ransom them from the power of the grave;
and from the hand of death I will redeem them1746.</p>
<p>18. At this point of our discourse, let us consider whether is harder, for a man after
having been buried to rise again from the earth, or for a man in the belly of a whale, having
come into the great heat of a living creature, to escape corruption. For what man knows
not, that the heat of the belly is so great, that even bones which have been swallowed moulder
away? How then did Jonas, who was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, escape
corruption? And, seeing that the nature of all men is such that we cannot live without
breathing, as we do, in air, how did he live without a breath of this air for three days? But
the Jews make answer and say, The power of God descended with Jonas when he was tossed
about in hell. Does then the Lord grant life to His own servant, by sending His power with
him, and can He not grant it to Himself as well? If that is credible, this is credible also; if
this is incredible, that also is incredible. For to me both are alike worthy of credence. I believe
that Jonas was preserved, for all things are possible with God1747; I believe that Christ also
was raised from the dead; for I have many testimonies of this, both from the Divine Scriptures,
and from the operative power even at this day1748 of Him who arose,—who descended into
hell alone, but ascended thence with a great company; for He went down to death, and many
bodies of the saints which slept arose1749 through Him.</p>
<p>19. Death was struck with dismay on beholding a new visitant descend into Hades, not
bound by the chains of that place. Wherefore, O porters of Hades, were ye scared at sight
of Him? What was the unwonted fear that possessed you? Death fled, and his flight betrayed
his cowardice. The holy prophets ran unto Him, and Moses the Lawgiver, and Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob; David also, and Samuel, and Esaias, and John the Baptist, who bore
witness when he asked, Art Thou He that should come, or look we for another1750? All the
Just were ransomed, whom death had swallowed; for it behoved the King whom they had
proclaimed, to become the redeemer of His noble heralds. Then each of the Just said, O

death, where is thy victory? O grave, where is thy sting1751? For the Conqueror hath redeemed
us.</p>
<p>20. Of this our Saviour the Prophet Jonas formed the type, when he prayed out of the
belly of the whale, and said, I cried in my affliction, and so on; out of the belly of hell1752, and
yet he was in the whale; but though in the whale, he says that he is in Hades; for he was a
type of Christ, who was to descend into Hades. And after a few words, he says, in the person
of Christ, prophesying most clearly, My head went down to the chasms of the mountains1753;
and yet he was in the belly of the whale. What mountains then encompass thee? I know,
he says, that I am a type of Him, who is to be laid in the Sepulchre hewn out of the rock.
And though he was in the sea, Jonas says, I went down to the earth, since he was a type of
Christ, who went down into the heart of the earth. And foreseeing the deeds of the Jews
who persuaded the soldiers to lie, and told them, Say that they stole Him away, he says, By
regarding lying vanities they forsook their own mercy1754. For He who had mercy on them
came, and was crucified, and rose again, giving His own precious blood both for Jews and
Gentiles; yet say they, Say that they stole Him away, having regard to lying vanities1755. But
concerning His Resurrection, Esaias also says, He who brought up from the earth the great
Shepherd of the sheep1756; he added the word, great, lest He should be thought on a level
with the shepherds who had gone before Him.</p>
<p>21. Since then we have the prophecies, let faith abide with us. Let them fall who fall
through unbelief, since they so will; but thou hast taken thy stand on the rock of the faith
in the Resurrection. Let no heretic ever persuade thee to speak evil of the Resurrection.
For to this day the Manichees say, that, the resurrection of the Saviour was phantom-wise,
and not real, not heeding Paul who says, Who was made of the seed of David according to

he aims at them, and speaks thus, Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven; or
who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ from the dead1758; and in like
manner warning as he has elsewhere written again, Remember Jesus Christ raised from the
dead1759; and again, And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith
also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we testified of God that He
raised up Christ, whom He raised not up1760. But in what follows he says, But now is Christ
risen from the dead, the first fruits of them that are asleep1761;—And He was seen of Cephas,
then of the twelve; (for if thou believe not the one witness, thou hast twelve witnesses;) then
He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once1762; (if they disbelieve the twelve, let
them admit the five hundred;) after that He was seen of James1763, His own brother, and
first Bishop of this diocese. Seeing then that such a Bishop originally1764 saw Christ Jesus
when risen, do not thou, his disciple, disbelieve him. But thou sayest that His brother James
was a partial witness; afterwards He was seen also of me1765 Paul, His enemy; and what

ceived Him; the stone also shall rise up against the face of the Jews, for it saw the Lord; even
the stone which was then rolled away1768, itself bears witness to the Resurrection, lying
there to this day. Angels of God who were present testified of the Resurrection of the Onlybegotten:
Peter and John, and Thomas, and all the rest of the Apostles; some of whom ran
to the sepulchre, and saw the burial-clothes, in which He was wrapped before, lying there
after the Resurrection; and others handled His hands and His feet, and beheld the prints of
the nails; and all enjoyed together that Breath of the Saviour, and were counted worthy to
forgive sins in the power of the Holy Ghost. Women too were witnesses, who took hold of
His feet, and who beheld the mighty earthquake, and the radiance of the Angel who stood
by: the linen clothes also which were wrapped about Him, and which He left when He
rose;—the soldiers, and the money given to them; the spot itself also, yet to be seen;—and
this house of the holy Church, which out of the loving affection to Christ of the Emperor
Constantine of blessed memory, was both built and beautified as thou seest.</p>

from the dead1769; for how shall we disbelieve that Christ is risen, when even His Name
raised the dead? The sea also bears witness to the resurrection of Jesus, as thou hast heard

he alludes to the legend, according to which the marks of Christ’s feet were indelibly impressed on the spot from
which He ascended. In the next generation St. Augustine seems to countenance the miraculous story (In Joh.

towards the east; thou hast also for witnesses the Angels which there bore testimony;
and the cloud on which He went up, and the disciples who came down from that place.</p>
<p>24. The course of instruction in the Faith would lead me to speak of the Ascension also;
but the grace of God so ordered1773 it, that thou heardest most fully concerning it, as far as
our weakness allowed, yesterday, on the Lord’s day; since, by the providence of divine grace,
the course of the Lessons1774 in Church included the account of our Saviour’s going up into
the heavens1775; and what was then said was spoken principally for the sake of all, and for
the assembled body of the faithful, yet especially for thy sake1776. But the question is, didst
thou attend to what was said? For thou knowest that the words which come next in the
Creed teach thee to believe in Him “Who rose again the third day, and ascended into
Heaven, and sat down on the right hand of the Father.” I suppose then certainly that thou
rememberest the exposition; yet I will now again cursorily put thee in mind of what was
then said. Remember what is distinctly written in the Psalms, God is gone up with a shout1777;
remember that the divine powers also said to one another, Lift up your gates, ye Princes1778,
and the rest; remember also the Psalm which says, He ascended on high, He led captivity
captive1779; remember the Prophet who said, Who buildeth His ascension unto heaven1780;
and all the other particulars mentioned yesterday because of the gainsaying of the Jews.</p>

the account of the carrying away of Habakkuk: for if Habakkuk was transported

Prophets and Angels, able by His own power to make His ascent into the Heavens on a
cloud from the Mount of Olives. Wonders like this thou mayest call to mind, but reserve
the preeminence for the Lord, the Worker of wonders; for the others were borne up, but
He bears up all things. Remember that Enoch was translated1782; but Jesus ascended: remember
what was said yesterday concerning Elias, that Elias was taken up in a chariot of
fire1783; but that the chariots of Christ are ten thousand-fold even thousands upon thousands1784:
and that Elias was taken up, towards the east of Jordan; but that Christ ascended
at the east of the brook Cedron: and that Elias went as into heaven1785; but Jesus, into
heaven: and that Elias said that a double portion in the Holy Spirit should be given to his
holy disciple; but that Christ granted to His own disciples so great enjoyment of the grace
of the Holy Ghost, as not only to have It in themselves, but also, by the laying on of their
hands, to impart the fellowship of It to them who believed.</p>
<p>26. And when thou hast thus wrestled against the Jews,—when thou hast worsted them
by parallel instances, then come further to the pre-eminence of the Saviour’s glory; namely,
that they were the servants, but He the Son of God. And thus thou wilt be reminded of His
pre-eminence, by the thought that a servant of Christ was caught up to the third heaven.
For if Elias attained as far as the first heaven, but Paul as far as the third, the latter, therefore,
has obtained a more honourable dignity. Be not ashamed of thine Apostles; they are not
inferior to Moses, nor second to the Prophets; but they are noble among the noble, yea,
nobler still. For Elias truly was taken up into heaven; but Peter has the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, having received the words, Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven1786. Elias was taken up only to heaven; but Paul both into heaven, and into
paradise1787 (for it behoved the disciples of Jesus to receive more manifold grace), and heard
unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter. But Paul came down again from
above, not because he was unworthy to abide in the third heaven, but in order that after
having enjoyed things above man’s reach, and descended in honour, and having preached

of Elijah into heaven, and therefore ὡς is rightly used (Kühner, Gramm. § 604, note; Jelf, § 626, Obs. 1), while
here the thing is referred to as an accomplished historical fact.” The distinction here drawn by Cyril is therefore
hypercritical, as is seen below in § 26, where he writes, ᾽Ηλίας μὲν γὰρ ἀνελήφθη εἰς οὐρανόν.</note>

Christ, and died for His sake, he might receive also the crown of martyrdom. But I pass
over the other parts of this argument, of which I spoke yesterday in the Lord’s-day congregation;
for with understanding hearers, a mere reminder is sufficient for instruction.</p>
<p>27. But remember also what I have often said1788 concerning the Son’s sitting at the
right hand of the Father; because of the next sentence in the Creed, which says, “and ascended
into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the Father.” Let us not curiously pry into
what is properly meant by the throne; for it is incomprehensible: but neither let us endure
those who falsely say, that it was after His Cross and Resurrection and Ascension into
heaven, that the Son began to sit on the right hand of the Father. For the Son gained not
His throne by advancement1789; but throughout His being (and His being is by an eternal
generation1790) He also sitteth together with the Father. And this throne the Prophet Esaias
having beheld before the incarnate coming of the Saviour, says, I saw the Lord sitting on a
throne, high and lifted up1791, and the rest. For the Father no man hath seen at any time1792,
and He who then appeared to the Prophet was the Son. The Psalmist also says, Thy throne
is prepared of old; Thou art from everlasting1793. Though then the testimonies on this point
are many, yet because of the lateness of the time, we will content ourselves even with these.</p>
<p>28. But now I must remind you of a few things out of many which are spoken concerning
the Son’s sitting at the right hand of the Father. For the hundred and ninth Psalm says
plainly, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies
Thy footstool1794. And the Saviour, confirming this saying in the Gospels, says that David
spoke not these things of himself, but from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, saying, How
then doth David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou
on My right hand1795? and the rest. And in the Acts of the Apostles, Peter on the day of

in the brief Confession of Hippolytus (circ. 220 a.d.) Contra Hæres. Noeti, c. 1: “καὶ ὄντα ἐν δεξίᾳ τοῦ Πατρός,”

Pentecost standing with the Eleven1796, and discoursing to the Israelites, has in very words
cited this testimony from the hundred and ninth Psalm.</p>
<p>29. But I must remind you also of a few other testimonies in like manner concerning
the Son’s sitting at the right hand of the Father. For in the Gospel according to Matthew it
is written, Nevertheless, I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the
right hand of power1797, and the rest: in accordance with which the Apostle Peter also writes,
By the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven1798.
And the Apostle Paul, writing to the Romans, says, It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God1799. And charging the Ephesians,
he thus speaks, According to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ
when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand1800; and the rest.
And the Colossians he taught thus, If ye then be risen with Christ, seek the things above,
where Christ is seated at the right hand of God1801. And in the Epistle to the Hebrews he
says, When He had made purification of our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
on high1802. And again, But unto which of the Angels hath He said at any time, Sit thou at
My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool1803? And again, But He, when He
had offered one sacrifice for all men, for ever sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth
expecting till His enemies be made His footstool1804. And again, Looking unto Jesus, the author
and perfecter of our faith; Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross, despising
shame, and is set down on the right hand of the throne of God1805.</p>
<p>30. And though there are many other texts concerning the session of the Only-begotten
on the right hand of God, yet these may suffice us at present; with a repetition of my remark,
that it was not after His coming in the flesh1806 that He obtained the dignity of this seat;
no, for even before all ages, the Only-begotten Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, ever possesses
the throne on the right hand of the Father. Now may He Himself, the God of all, who
is Father of the Christ, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who came down, and ascended, and sitteth

together with the Father, watch over your souls; keep unshaken and unchanged your hope
in Him who rose again; raise you together with Him from your dead sins unto His heavenly
gift; count you worthy to be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air1807, in His
fitting time; and, until that time arrive of His glorious second advent, write all your names
in the Book of the living, and having written them, never blot them out (for the names of
many, who fall away, are blotted out); and may He grant to all of you to believe on Him who
rose again, and to look for Him who is gone up, and is to come again, (to come, but not
from the earth; for be on your guard, O man, because of the deceivers who are to come;)
Who sitteth on high, and is here present together with us, beholding the order of each, and
the steadfastness of his faith1808. For think not that because He is now absent in the flesh,
He is therefore absent also in the Spirit. He is here present in the midst of us, listening to

hearts1809;—who also is now ready to present those who are coming to baptism, and all of

<head>On the Clause, And Shall Come in Glory to Judge the Quick and the Dead; Of
Whose Kingdom There Shall Be No End.</head>
<p>Daniel vii. 9–14</p>
<p>I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit, and then, I saw in
a vision of the night, and behold one like unto the Son of Man came with the clouds of
heaven, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. We preach not one advent only of Christ, but a second also, far more glorious than
the former. For the former gave a view of His patience; but the latter brings with it the
crown of a divine kingdom. For all things, for the most part, are twofold in our Lord Jesus
Christ: a twofold generation; one, of God, before the ages; and one, of a Virgin, at the close
of the ages: His descents twofold; one, the unobserved, like rain on a fleece1811; and a second
His open coming, which is to be. In His former advent, He was wrapped in swaddling
clothes in the manger; in His second, He covereth Himself with light as with a garment1812.
In His first coming, He endured the Cross, despising shame1813; in His second, He comes
attended by a host of Angels, receiving glory1814. We rest not then upon His first advent
only, but look also for His second. And as at His first coming we said, Blessed is He that
cometh in the Name of the Lord1815, so will we repeat the same at His second coming; that
when with Angels we meet our Master, we may worship Him and say, Blessed is He that
cometh in the Name of the Lord. The Saviour comes, not to be judged again, but to judge
them who judged Him; He who before held His peace when judged1816, shall remind the
transgressors who did those daring deeds at the Cross, and shall say, These things hast thou
done, and I kept silence1817. Then, He came because of a divine dispensation, teaching men
with persuasion; but this time they will of necessity have Him for their King, even though
they wish it not.</p>

<p>2. And concerning these two comings, Malachi the Prophet says, And the Lord whom
ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple1818; behold one coming. And again of the second
coming he says, And the Messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in. Behold, He cometh,
saith1819 the Lord Almighty. But who shall abide the day of His coming? or who shall stand
when He appeareth? Because He cometh in like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ herb; and He
shall sit as a refiner and purifier. And immediately after the Saviour Himself says, And I
will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and
against the adulteresses, and against those who swear falsely in My Name1820, and the rest.
For this cause Paul warning us beforehand says, If any man buildeth on the foundation gold,
and silver, and precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man’s work shall be made manifest;
for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire1821. Paul also knew these two
comings, when writing to Titus and saying, The grace of God hath appeared which bringeth
salvation unto all men, instructing us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, and godly, and righteously in this present world; looking for the blessed hope, and
appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ1822. Thou seest how he
spoke of a first, for which he gives thanks; and of a second, to which we look forward.
Therefore the words also of the Faith which we are announcing were just now delivered
thus1823; that we believe in Him, who also ascended into the heavens, and sat down on the
right hand of the Father, and shall come in glory to judge quick and dead; whose kingdom
shall have no end.</p>
<p>3. Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, comes from heaven; and He comes with glory at the
end of this world, in the last day. For of this world there is to be an end, and this created

Cyril first announces (ἐπαγγέλλω) the words which the learners repeat after him (ἀπαγγέλλω). The clause,
Whose Kingdom shall have no end, was not contained in the original form of the Creed of Nicæa, a.d. 325, but
its substance is found in many earlier writings. Compare Justin M. (Tryph. § 46: καὶ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ αἰώνιος
βασιλεία); Const. Apost. vii. 41; the Eusebian Confessions 1st and 4th Antioch, and the Macrostich, a.d. 341,
342, 344. Bp. Bull asserts that the Creed of Jerusalem, containing this clause, was no other than the ancient
Eastern Creed, first directed against the Gnostics of the Sub-Apostolic age (Judicium Eccl. Cathol. vi. 16).</note>

world is to be re-made anew1824. For since corruption, and theft, and adultery, and every
sort of sins have been poured forth over the earth, and blood has been mingled with blood1825
in the world, therefore, that this wondrous dwelling-place may not remain filled with iniquity,
this world passeth away, that the fairer world may be made manifest. And wouldest thou
receive the proof of this out of the words of Scripture? Listen to Esaias, saying, And the
heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all the stars shall fall, as leaves from a vine, and
as leaves fall from a fig-tree1826. The Gospel also says, The sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven1827. Let us not sorrow, as
if we alone died; the stars also shall die; but perhaps rise again. And the Lord rolleth up the
heavens, not that He may destroy them, but that He may raise them up again more beautiful.
Hear David the Prophet saying, Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the
earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest1828.
But some one will say, Behold, he says plainly that they shall perish. Hear in what sense he
says, they shall perish; it is plain from what follows; And they all shall wax old as doth a
garment; and as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed. For as a man
is said to “perish,” according to that which is written, Behold, how the righteous perisheth,
and no man layeth it to heart1829, and this, though the resurrection is looked for; so we look
for a resurrection, as it were, of the heavens also. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and
the moon into blood1830. Here let converts from the Manichees gain instruction, and no
longer make those lights their gods; nor impiously think, that this sun which shall be darkened
is Christ1831. And again hear the Lord saying, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My
words shall not pass away1832; for the creatures are not as precious as the Master’s words.</p>
<p>4. The things then which are seen shall pass away, and there shall come the things which
are looked for, things fairer than the present; but as to the time let no one be curious. For
it is not for you, He says, to know times or seasons, which the Father hath put in His own

power1833. And venture not thou to declare when these things shall be, nor on the other
hand supinely slumber. For he saith, Watch, for in such an hour as ye expect not the Son of
Man cometh1834. But since it was needful for us to know the signs of the end, and since we
are looking for Christ, therefore, that we may not die deceived and be led astray by that false
Antichrist, the Apostles, moved by the divine will, address themselves by a providential arrangement
to the True Teacher, and say, Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall
be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world1835? We look for Thee to come again,
but Satan transforms himself into an Angel of light; put us therefore on our guard, that we
may not worship another instead of Thee. And He, opening His divine and blessed mouth,
says, Take heed that no man mislead you. Do you also, my hearers, as seeing Him now with
the eyes of your mind, hear Him saying the same things to you; Take heed that no man
mislead you. And this word exhorts you all to give heed to what is spoken; for it is not a
history of things gone by, but a prophecy of things future, and which will surely come. Not
that we prophesy, for we are unworthy; but that the things which are written will be set before
you, and the signs declared. Observe thou, which of them have already come to pass, and
which yet remain; and make thyself safe.</p>
<p>5. Take heed that no man mislead you: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am
Christ, and shall mislead many. This has happened in part: for already Simon Magus has
said this, and Menander1836, and some others of the godless leaders of heresy; and others
will say it in our days, or after us.</p>

against nation and kingdom against kingdom, or no? And there shall be famines and pesti
lences and earthquakes in divers places. These things have already come to pass; and again,
And fearful sights from heaven, and mighty storms1838. Watch therefore, He says; for ye know

and clergy against clergy, and laity against laity even unto blood, be not troubled1842; for it

<note type="footnote">1842 “S. Cyril here describes the state of the Church, when orthodoxy was for a while trodden under foot, its
maintainers persecuted, and the varieties of Arianism, which took its place, were quarreling for the ascendancy.
Gibbon quotes two passages, one from a pagan historian of the day, another from a Father of the Church, which
fully bear out S. Cyril’s words. What made the state of things still more deplorable, was the defection of some
of the orthodox party, as Marcellus, into opposite errors: while the subsequent secessions of Apollinaris and
Lucifer show what lurking disorders there were within it at the time when S. Cyril wrote. (Vid. infr. 9.) The
passages referred to are as follows: ‘The Christian Religion,’ says Ammianus, ‘in itself plain and simple, he
(Constantius) confounded by the dotage of superstition. Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his
authority, he cherished and propagated, by vain disputes, the differences which his vain curiosity had excited.
The highways were covered with troops of Bishops, galloping from every side to the assemblies, which they
called synods; and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions, the public establishment
of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys.’ Hist. xxi. 16. S. Hilary of
Poictiers thus speaks of Asia Minor, the chief seat of the Arian troubles: ‘It is a thing equally deplorable and
dangerous, that there are as many creeds as opinions among men, as many doctrines as inclinations, and as
many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us; because we make creeds arbitrarily, and explain them
as arbitrarily. The Homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods. The partial
or total resemblance of the Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy divines. Every year,
nay, every moon, we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries. We repent of what we have done, we
defend those who repent, we anathematize those whom we defended. We condemn either the doctrine of others
in ourselves, or our own in that of others; and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces, we have been the cause
of each other’s ruin,’ ad Constant. ii. 4, 5. Gibbon’s translations are used, which, though diffuse, are faithful in
their matter. What a contrast do these descriptions present to Athanasius’ uniform declaration, that the whole
question was really settled at Nicæa, and no other synod or debate was necessary!”—(R.W.C.). Compare, for
example, the account of the seditions in Antioch and in Constantinople, in Socrates, Eccles. Hist. i. 24; i., 12–14,

treason, dost thou wonder that hatred of brethren is found among bishops? But the sign
concerns not only rulers, but the people also; for He says, And because iniquity shall abound,
the love of the many shall wax cold1843. Will any then among those present boast that he
entertains friendship unfeigned towards his neighbour? Do not the lips often kiss, and the
countenance smile, and the eyes brighten forsooth, while the heart is planning guile, and
the man is plotting mischief with words of peace?</p>
<p>8. Thou hast this sign also: And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come1844. And as we see, nearly
the whole world is now filled with the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p>9. And what comes to pass after this? He says next, When therefore ye see the abomination
of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the Holy Place,
let him that readeth understand1845. And again, Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo,
here is the Christ, or, Lo, there; believe it not1846. Hatred of the brethren makes room next
for Antichrist; for the devil prepares beforehand the divisions among the people, that he
who is to come may be acceptable to them. But God forbid that any of Christ’s servants
here, or elsewhere, should run over to the enemy! Writing concerning this matter, the
Apostle Paul gave a manifest sign, saying, For that day shall not come, except there came first
the falling away, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth
himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of
God, shewing himself that he is God. Remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told
you these things? And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed
in his own season. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work, only there is one that restraineth
now, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall the lawless one be revealed,
whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of His coming. Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are
perishing1847. Thus wrote Paul, and now is the falling away. For men have fallen away from

dare to say that Christ was brought into being out of nothing1850. And formerly the heretics
were manifest; but now the Church is filled with heretics in disguise1851. For men have
fallen away from the truth, and have itching ears1852. Is it a plausible discourse? all listen
to it gladly. Is it a word of correction? all turn away from it. Most have departed from right
words, and rather choose the evil, than desire the good1853. This therefore is the falling
away, and the enemy is soon to be looked for: and meanwhile he has in part begun to send
forth his own forerunners1854, that he may then come prepared upon the prey. Look
therefore to thyself, O man, and make safe thy soul. The Church now charges thee before
the Living God; she declares to thee the things concerning Antichrist before they arrive.

the Roman power; and of the kings who reigned before him, three he shall humble1865, and

show of mildness (as though he were a learned and discreet person), and of soberness and
benevolence1866: and by the lying signs and wonders of his magical deceit1867 having beguiled
the Jews, as though he were the expected Christ, he shall afterwards be characterized
by all kinds of crimes of inhumanity and lawlessness, so as to outdo all unrighteous and
ungodly men who have gone before him; displaying against all men, but especially against
us Christians, a spirit murderous and most cruel, merciless and crafty1868. And after perpetrating

Jesus, the true Christ, who shall slay Antichrist with the breath of His mouth1869, and shall
deliver him over to the fire of hell.</p>
<p>13. Now these things we teach, not of our own invention, but having learned them out
of the divine Scriptures used in the Church1870, and chiefly from the prophecy of Daniel
just now read; as Gabriel also the Archangel interpreted it, speaking thus: The fourth beast
shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms1871. And that this
kingdom is that of the Romans, has been the tradition of the Church’s interpreters. For as
the first kingdom which became renowned was that of the Assyrians, and the second, that
of the Medes and Persians together, and after these, that of the Macedonians was the third,
so the fourth kingdom now is that of the Romans1872. Then Gabriel goes on to interpret,
saying, His ten horns are ten kings that shall arise; and another king shall rise up after them,
who shall surpass in wickedness all who were before him1873; (he says, not only the ten, but
also all who have been before him;) and he shall subdue three kings; manifestly out of the
ten former kings: but it is plain that by subduing three of these ten, he will become the
eighth king; and he shall speak words against the Most High1874. A blasphemer the man is
and lawless, not having received the kingdom from his fathers, but having usurped the
power by means of sorcery.</p>

him; for knowing that his judgment shall now no longer have respite, he wages war no more
by his ministers, as is his wont, but henceforth by himself more openly1876. And with all

or that is worshipped; (against every God; Antichrist forsooth will abhor the idols,) so that
he seateth himself in the temple of God1878. What temple then? He means, the Temple of
the Jews which has been destroyed. For God forbid that it should be the one in which we
are! Why say we this? That we may not be supposed to favour ourselves. For if he comes
to the Jews as Christ, and desires to be worshipped by the Jews, he will make great account
of the Temple, that he may more completely beguile them; making it supposed that he is
the man of the race of David, who shall build up the Temple which was erected by Solomon1879.
And Antichrist will come at the time when there shall not be left one stone upon
another in the Temple of the Jews, according to the doom pronounced by our Saviour1880;
for when, either decay of time, or demolition ensuing on pretence of new buildings, or from
any other causes, shall have overthrown all the stones, I mean not merely of the outer circuit,
but of the inner shrine also, where the Cherubim were, then shall he come with all signs and
lying wonders, exalting himself against all idols; at first indeed making a pretence of benevolence,
but afterwards displaying his relentless temper, and that chiefly against the Saints of
God. For he says, I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints1881; and again
elsewhere, there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation upon
earth, even to that same time1882. Dreadful is that beast, a mighty dragon, unconquerable

<p>16. For this cause the Lord knowing the greatness of the adversary grants indulgence
to the godly, saying, Then let them which be in Judæa flee to the mountains1883. But if any
man is conscious that he is very stout-hearted, to encounter Satan, let him stand (for I do
not despair of the Church’s nerves), and let him say, Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ and the rest1884? But, let those of us who are fearful provide for our own safety; and
those who are of a good courage, stand fast: for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath
not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be1885. But thanks be
to God who hath confined the greatness of that tribulation to a few days; for He says, But
for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened1886; and Antichrist shall reign for three years
and a half only. We speak not from apocryphal books, but from Daniel; for he says, And
they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time1887. A time is the one
year in which his coming shall for a while have increase; and the times are the remaining
two years of iniquity, making up the sum of the three years; and the half a time is the six
months. And again in another place Daniel says the same thing, And he sware by Him that
liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, and times, and half a time1888. And some peradventure
have referred what follows also to this; namely, a thousand two hundred and ninety
days1889; and this, Blessed is he that endureth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and
five and thirty days1890. For this cause we must hide ourselves and flee; for perhaps we shall

<p>17. Who then is the blessed man, that shall at that time devoutly witness for Christ?
For I say that the Martyrs of that time excel all martyrs. For the Martyrs hitherto have
wrestled with men only; but in the time of Antichrist they shall do battle with Satan in his
own person1892. And former persecuting kings only put to death; they did not pretend to
raise the dead, nor did they make false shows1893 of signs and wonders. But in his time
there shall be the evil inducement both of fear and of deceit, so that if it be possible the very
elect shall be deceived1894. Let it never enter into the heart of any then alive to ask, “What
did Christ more? For by what power does this man work these things? Were it not God’s
will, He would not have allowed them.” The Apostle warns thee, and says beforehand, And
for this cause God shall send them a working of error; (send, that is, shall allow to happen;)
not that they might make excuse, but that they might be condemned1895. Wherefore? They,
he says, who believed not the truth, that is, the true Christ, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,
that is, in Antichrist. But as in the persecutions which happen from time to time, so also
then God will permit these things, not because He wants power to hinder them, but because
according to His wont He will through patience crown His own champions like as He did
His Prophets and Apostles; to the end that having toiled for a little while they may inherit
the eternal kingdom of heaven, according to that which Daniel says, And at that time thy
people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book (manifestly, the
book of life); and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting
life, and same to shame and everlasting contempt; and they that be wise shall shine as

Antichrist.</p>

shall Angelic trumpets sound; the dead in Christ shall rise first1900,—the godly persons who
are alive shall be caught up in the clouds, receiving as the reward of their labours more than
human honour, inasmuch as theirs was a more than human strife; according as the Apostle
Paul writes, saying, For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord1901.</p>

blossom, and the grasshopper shall grow heavy, and the caper-berry shall be scattered
abroad1910. And as the interpreters say, the blossoming almond signifies the departure of
winter; and our bodies shall then after the winter blossom with a heavenly flower1911. And
the grasshopper shall grow in substance (that means the winged soul clothing itself with the
body1912,) and the caper-berry shall be scattered abroad (that is, the transgressors who are

And fearful will be that descent of our Master. David says, God shall manifestly come, even
our God, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall burn before Him, and a fierce tempest round
about Him, and the rest1916. The Son of Man shall come to the Father, according to the
Scripture which was just now read, on the clouds of heaven, drawn by a stream of fire1917,
which is to make trial of men. Then if any man’s works are of gold, he shall be made
brighter; if any man’s course of life be like stubble, and unsubstantial, it shall be burnt up
by the fire1918. And the Father shall sit, having His garment white as snow, and the hair of

He is the King of those who have not been defiled with sins; for, He says, I will make your
sins white as snow, and as wool1920, which is an emblem of forgiveness of sins, or of sinlessness
itself. But the Lord who shall come from heaven on the clouds, is He who ascended
on the clouds; for He Himself hath said, And they shall see the Son of Man coming on the
clouds of heaven, with power and great glory1921.</p>

then shall appear, He says, the sign of the Son of Man in heaven1922. Now Christ’s own true

Him who was formerly crucified: that the Jews who before pierced Him and plotted against
Him, when they see it, may mourn tribe by tribe1924, saying, “This is He who was buffeted,
this is He whose face they spat on, this is He whom they bound with chains, this is He whom
of old they crucified, and set at nought1925. Whither, they will say, shall we flee from the
face of Thy wrath?” But the Angel hosts shall encompass them, so that they shall not be
able to flee anywhere. The sign of the Cross shall be a terror to His foes; but joy to His
friends who have believed in Him, or preached Him, or suffered for His sake. Who then is
the happy man, who shall then be found a friend of Christ? That King, so great and glorious,
attended by the Angel-guards, the partner of the Father’s throne, will not despise His own

will not judge according to a man’s appearance, nor reprove according to his speech1928. He
honours not the learned before the simple, nor the rich before the needy. Though thou be
in the field, the Angels shall take thee; think not that He will take the landowners, and leave
thee the husbandman. Though thou be a slave, though thou be poor, be not any whit distressed;
He who took the form of a servant1929 despises not servants. Though thou be lying

of mankind will then be present. Reckon, therefore, how many are the Roman nation;
reckon how many the barbarian tribes now living, and how many have died within the last
hundred years; reckon how many nations have been buried during the last thousand years;
reckon all from Adam to this day. Great indeed is the multitude; but yet it is little, for the
Angels are many more. They are the ninety and nine sheep, but mankind is the single
one1936. For according to the extent of universal space, must we reckon the number of its
inhabitants. The whole earth is but as a point in the midst of the one heaven, and yet contains
so great a multitude; what a multitude must the heaven which encircles it contain? And
must not the heaven of heavens contain unimaginable numbers1937? And it is written,
Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
Him1938; not that the multitude is only so great, but because the Prophet could not express
more than these. So there will be present at the judgment in that day, God, the Father of
all, Jesus Christ being seated with Him, and the Holy Ghost present with Them; and an angel’s
trumpet shall summon us all to bring our deeds with us. Ought we not then from this time
forth to be sore troubled? Think it not a slight doom, O man, even apart from punishment,
to be condemned in the presence of so many. Shall we not choose rather to die many deaths,
than be condemned by friends?</p>
<p>25. Let us dread then, brethren, lest God condemn us; who needs not examination or
proofs, to condemn. Say not, In the night I committed fornication, or wrought sorcery, or
did any other thing, and there was no man by. Out of thine own conscience shalt thou be
judged, thy thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing, in the day when God shall judge
the secrets of men1939. The terrible countenance of the Judge will force thee to speak the
truth; or rather, even though thou speak not, it will convict thee. For thou shalt rise clothed
with thine own sins, or else with thy righteous deeds. And this has the Judge Himself declared—
for it is Christ who judges—for neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath
given all judgment unto the Son1940, not divesting Himself of His power, but judging through
the Son; the Son therefore judgeth by the will1941 of the Father; for the wills of the Father

and of the Son are not different, but one and the same. What then says the Judge, as to
whether thou shalt bear thy works, or no? And before Him shall they gather all nations1942:
(for in the presence of Christ every knee must bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth1943:) and He shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd
divideth his sheep from the goats. How does the shepherd make the separation? Does he
examine out of a book which is a sheep and which a goat? or does he distinguish by their
evident marks? Does not the wool show the sheep, and the hairy and rough skin the goat?
In like manner, if thou hast been just now cleansed from thy sins, thy deeds shall be henceforth
as pure wool; and thy robe shall remain unstained, and thou shalt ever say, I have put
off my coat, how shall I put it on1944? By thy vesture shalt thou be known for a sheep. But
if thou be found hairy, like Esau, who was rough with hair, and wicked in mind, who for
food lost his birthright and sold his privilege, thou shalt be one of those on the left hand.
But God forbid that any here present should be cast out from grace, or for evil deeds be
found among the ranks of the sinners on the left hand!</p>
<p>26. Terrible in good truth is the judgment, and terrible the things announced. The
kingdom of heaven is set before us, and everlasting fire is prepared. How then, some one
will say, are we to escape the fire? And how to enter into the kingdom? I was an hungered,
He says, and ye gave Me meat. Learn hence the way; there is here no need of allegory, but
to fulfil what is said. I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited
Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto Me1945. These things if thou do, thou shalt reign together
with Him; but if thou do them not, thou shalt be condemned. At once then begin
to do these works, and abide in the faith; lest, like the foolish virgins, tarrying to buy oil,
thou be shut out. Be not confident because thou merely possessest the lamp, but constantly
keep it burning. Let the light of thy good works shine before men1946, and let not Christ
be blasphemed on thy account. Wear thou a garment of incorruption1947, resplendent in
good works; and whatever matter thou receivest from God to administer as a steward, administer
profitably. Hast thou been put in trust with riches? Dispense them well. Hast
thou been entrusted with the word of teaching? Be a good steward thereof. Canst thou attach

Such are the disciples of Marcellus and Scotinus of Galatian Ancyra, U+0026c.” See Newman on Athanasius, de Synodis,
§ 26, (5), notes a and b. Compare the description of Marcellus in the Letter of the Oriental Bishops who
had withdrawn from the Council of Sardica to Philippopolis (a.d. 344). “There has arisen in our days a certain
Marcellus of Galatia, the most execrable pest of all heretics, who with sacrilegious mind, and impious mouth,

by the Bishops at the Council of Jerusalem, a.d. 335, for holding false opinions, and being ordered to recant his
opinions promised to burn his book. Afterwards he applied to Constantine, by whom he was remitted to the
Council of Constantinople, a.d. 336, and deposed by the Bishops. As however he was acquitted by the Councils
of Rome, a.d. 342, and of Sardica, a.d. 347, it became a matter of dispute whether he was really heretical.…From
the fragments of his books transcribed by Eusebius, you may possibly acquit him of the Sabellian heresy and
the confusion of the Father and the Son, but certainly not of the heresy concerning the end of Christ’s kingdom,

of the earth, U+0026c., they shall perish, but Thou remainest, U+0026c.; but Thou art the same, and Thy

But further, how shall all things be made subject unto Him? By perishing, or by abiding?

the Father’s will (for from eternity He doth always those things that please Him1962), but

shall have an end, and have presumed to set bounds to the eternal kingdom of Christ, and
to bring to an end, as far as words go, His never-ending sovereignty, come then, let us read
the like expressions in the Apostle: Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam till Moses1963.
Did men then die up to that time, and did none die any more after Moses, or after the Law
has there been no more death among men? Well then, thou seest that the word “unto” is
not to limit time; but that Paul rather signified this,—“And yet, though Moses was a righteous
and wonderful man, nevertheless the doom of death, which was uttered against Adam,
reached even unto him, and them that came after him; and this, though they had not committed
the like sins as Adam, by his disobedience in eating of the tree.”</p>
<p>32. Take again another similar text. For until this day…when Moses is read, a vail lieth
upon their heart1964. Does until this day mean only “until Paul?” Is it not until this day
present, and even to the end? And if Paul say to the Corinthians, For we came even as far
as unto you in preaching the Gospel of Christ, having hope when your faith increases to preach
the Gospel in the regions beyond you1965, thou seest manifestly that as far as implies not the
end, but has something following it. In what sense then shouldest thou remember that
Scripture, till He hath put all enemies under His feet1966? According as Paul says in another
place, And exhort each other daily, while it is called to-day1967; meaning, “continually.” For
as we may not speak of the “beginning of the days” of Christ, so neither suffer thou that any

Prophets.</head>
<p>1 Corinthians xii. 1, 4</p>
<p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<gap reason="omitted"/>Now there are diversities
of gifts, but the same Spirit, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Spiritual in truth is the grace we need, in order to discourse concerning the Holy
Spirit; not that we may speak what is worthy of Him, for this is impossible, but that by
speaking the words of the divine Scriptures, we may run our course without danger. For a
truly fearful thing is written in the Gospels, where Christ has plainly said, Whosoever shall
speak a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor
in that which is to come1970. And there is often fear, lest a man should receive this condemnation,
through speaking what he ought not concerning Him, either from ignorance, or
from supposed reverence. The Judge of quick and dead, Jesus Christ, declared that he hath
no forgiveness; if therefore any man offend, what hope has he?</p>
<p>2. It must therefore belong to Jesus Christ’s grace itself to grant both to us to speak
without deficiency, and to you to hear with discretion; for discretion is needful not to them
only who speak, but also to them that hear, lest they hear one thing, and misconceive another
in their mind. Let us then speak concerning the Holy Ghost nothing but what is written;
and whatsoever is not written, let us not busy ourselves about it. The Holy Ghost Himself
spoke the Scriptures; He has also spoken concerning Himself as much as He pleased, or as
much as we could receive. Let us therefore speak those things which He has said; for
whatsoever He has not said, we dare not say.</p>
<p>3. There is One Only Holy Ghost, the Comforter; and as there is One God the Father,
and no second Father;—and as there is One Only-begotten Son and Word of God, who hath
no brother;—so is there One Only Holy Ghost, and no second spirit equal in-honour to
Him. Now the Holy Ghost is a Power most mighty, a Being divine and unsearchable; for
He is living and intelligent, a sanctifying principle of all things made by God through Christ.
He it is who illuminates the souls of the just; He was in the Prophets, He was also in the
Apostles in the New Testament. Abhorred be they who dare to separate the operation of
the Holy Ghost! There is One God, the Father, Lord of the Old and of the New Testament:
and One Lord, Jesus Christ, who was prophesied of in the Old Testament, and came in the
<note type="footnote">1970 Matt. xii. 32.</note>

<pb n="318"/>
New; and One Holy Ghost, who through the Prophets preached of Christ, and when Christ
was come, descended, and manifested Him1971.</p>
<p>4. Let no one therefore separate the Old from the New Testament1972; let no one say
that the Spirit in the former is one, and in the latter another; since thus he offends against
the Holy Ghost Himself, who with the Father and the Son together is honoured, and at the
time of Holy Baptism is included with them in the Holy Trinity. For the Only-begotten Son
of God said plainly to the Apostles, Go ye, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost1973. Our hope is in
<note type="footnote">1971 At the end of this section there follows in the Coislin ms. a long interpolation consisting of two parts.
The former is an extract taken word for word from Gregory of Nyssa, Oratio Catechetica, ii. c, which may be
read in this series: ᾽Αλλ᾽ ὡς Θεοῦ Λόγον ἀκούσαντες .…σύνδρομον ἔχουσαν τῇ βουλήσει τὴν δύναμιν. Of the
second passage the Benedictine Editor says: “I have not been able to discover who is the author. No one can
assign it to our Cyril, although the doctrine it contains is in full agreement with his: but he explains all the same
points more at large in his two Lectures (xvi. xvii.). The passage is very ancient and undoubtedly older than the
eleventh century, which is the date of the Cod. Coislin. Therefore in the controversy of the Latins against the
Greeks concerning the Procession of the Holy Ghost it is important to notice what is taught in this passage, and
also brought forward as a testimony by S. Thomas (Aquinas), that “The Holy Ghost is of the Godhead of the
Father and the Son (ex Patris et Filii divinitate existere).” To me indeed these words seem to savour altogether
not of the later but of the more ancient theology of the Greeks, and to be earlier than the controversies of the
Greeks against the Latins.” This second passage is as follows:— “For the Spirit of God is good. And Thy good
Spirit, says David, shall lead me in the land of righteousness. This then is the Spirit of God in which we believe:
the blessed Spirit, the eternal, immutable, unchangeable, ineffable: which rules and reigns over all productive
being, both visible and invisible natures: which is Lord both of Angels and Archangels, Powers, Principalities,
Dominions, Thrones: the Creator of all being, enthroned with the glory of the Father and the Son, reigning
without beginning and without end with the Father and the Son, before the created substances: Who sanctifies
the ministering spirits sent forth for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation: Who came down upon the
holy and blessed Virgin Mary, of whom was born Christ according to the flesh; came down also upon the Lord
Himself in bodily form of a dove in the river Jordan: Who came upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost in
form of fiery tongues; Who gives and supplies all spiritual gifts in the Church, Who Proceedeth from the Father:
Who is of the Godhead of the Father and the Son; Who is of one substance with the Father and the Son, inseparable
and indivisible.”</note>

Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. We preach not three Gods1974; let the Marcionites be silenced;
but with the Holy Ghost through One Son, we preach One God. The Faith is indivisible;
the worship inseparable. We neither separate the Holy Trinity, like some; nor do
we as Sabellius work confusion.1975 But we know according to godliness One Father, who
sent His Son to be our Saviour; we know One Son, who promised that He would send the
Comforter from the Father; we know the Holy Ghost, who spake in the Prophets, and who
on the day of Pentecost descended on the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues, here, in
Jerusalem, in the Upper Church of the Apostles1976; for in all things the choicest privileges
are with us. Here Christ came down from heaven; here the Holy Ghost came down from
heaven. And in truth it were most fitting, that as we discourse concerning Christ and Golgotha
here in Golgotha, so also we should speak concerning the Holy Ghost in the Upper
Church; yet since He who descended there jointly partakes of the glory of Him who was
crucified here, we here speak concerning Him also who descended there: for their worship
is indivisible.</p>
<p>5. We would now say somewhat concerning the Holy Ghost; not to declare His substance
with exactness, for this were impossible; but to speak of the diverse mistakes of some concerning
him, lest from ignorance we should fall into them; and to block up the paths of error,
that we may journey on the King’s one highway. And if we now for caution’s sake repeat
any statement of the heretics, let it recoil on their heads, and may we be guiltless, both we
who speak, and ye who hear.</p>
<p>6. For the heretics, who are most profane in all things, have sharpened their tongue1977
against the Holy Ghost also, and have dared to utter impious things; as Irenæus the interpreter
has written in his injunctions against heresies1978. For some of them have dared to

against the Spirit1980, and the wicked Valentinians1981 again something else; and the profane
Manes dared to call himself the Paraclete sent by Christ1982. Others again have taught that
the Spirit is different in the Prophets and in the New Testament.1983 Yea, and great is their
error, or rather their blasphemy. Such therefore abhor, and flee from them who blaspheme
the Holy Ghost, and have no forgiveness. For what fellowship hast thou with the desperate,

to a thief, and consenteth with him, is subject to punishment, what hope shall he have, who
offends against the Holy Ghost?</p>

sayings of the Old1985. For Marcion first, that most impious of men, who first asserted three

concerning Christ, cut out the testimonies taken from the Old Testament, that the King

all uncleanness and lasciviousness; for it suffices but to hint at this, out of respect for the
women who are present. And having taken possession of Pepuza, a very small hamlet of
Phrygia, he falsely named it Jerusalem; and cutting the throats of wretched little children,
and chopping them up into unholy food, for the purpose of their so-called mysteries1988,—(
wherefore till but lately in the time of persecution we were suspected of doing
this, because these Montanists were called, falsely indeed, by the common name of Christians;)—
yet he dared to call himself the Holy Ghost, filled as he was with all impiety and inhuman
cruelty, and condemned by an irrevocable sentence.</p>
<p>9. And he was seconded, as was said before, by that most impious Manes also, who
combined what was bad in every heresy1989; who being the very lowest pit of destruction,
collected the doctrines of all the heretics, and wrought out and taught a yet more novel error,
and dared to say that he himself was the Comforter, whom Christ promised to send. But
the Saviour when He promised Him, said to the Apostles, But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
until ye be endued with power from on high1990. What then? did the Apostles who had been
dead two hundred years, wait for Manes, until they should be endued with the power; and
will any dare to say, that they were not forthwith full of the Holy Ghost? Moreover it is
written, Then they laid their hands on and they received the Holy Ghost1991; was not this
before Manes, yea, many years before, when the Holy Ghost descended on the day of
Pentecost?</p>
<p>10. Wherefore was Simon the sorcerer condemned? Was it not that he came to the
Apostles, and said, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive
the Holy Ghost? For he said not, “Give me also the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,” but “Give
me the power;” that he might sell to others that which could not be sold, and which he did
not himself possess. He offered money also to them who had no possessions1992; and this,
though he saw men bringing the prices of the things sold, and laying them at the Apostles’
feet. And he considered not that they who trod under foot the wealth which was brought
for the maintenance of the poor, were not likely to give the power of the Holy Ghost for a
bribe. But what say they to Simon? Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought
to purchase the gift of God with money1993; for thou art a second Judas, for expecting to buy

is to perish, how great is the impiety of Manes, who said that he was the Holy Ghost? Let
us hate them who are worthy of hatred; let us turn away from them from whom God turns
away; let us also ourselves say unto God with all boldness concerning all heretics, Do not I
hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee, and am not I grieved with Thine enemies1994? For there
is also an enmity which is right, according as it is written, I will put enmity between thee and
her seed1995; for friendship with the serpent works enmity with God, and death.</p>
<p>11. Let then thus much suffice concerning those outcasts; and now let us return to the
divine Scriptures, and let us drink waters out of our own cisterns <del>that is, the holy Fathers1996</del>,
and out of our own springing wells1997. Drink we of living water, springing up into everlasting
life1998; but this spake the Saviour of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive1999.
For observe what He says, He that believeth on Me (not simply this, but), as the
Scripture hath said (thus He hath sent thee back to the Old Testament), out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water, not rivers perceived by sense, and merely watering the earth with
its thorns and trees, but bringing souls to the light. And in another place He says, But the
water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of living water springing up into everlasting
life,—a new kind of water living and springing up, springing up unto them who are worthy.</p>
<p>12. And why did He call the grace of the Spirit water? Because by water all things subsist;
because water brings forth grass and living things; because the water of the showers comes
down from heaven; because it comes down one in form, but works in many forms. For one
fountain watereth the whole of Paradise, and one and the same rain comes down upon all
the world, yet it becomes white in the lily, and red in the rose, and purple in violets and
hyacinths, and different and varied in each several kind: so it is one in the palm-tree, and
another in the vine, and all in all things; and yet is one in nature, not diverse from itself; for
the rain does not change itself, and come down first as one thing, then as another, but adapting
itself to the constitution of each thing which receives it, it becomes to each what is
suitable2000. Thus also the Holy Ghost, being one, and of one nature, and indivisible, divides
to each His grace, according as He will2001: and as the dry tree, after partaking of water,

puts forth shoots, so also the soul in sin, when it has been through repentance made worthy
of the Holy Ghost, brings forth clusters of righteousness. And though He is One in nature,
yet many are the virtues which by the will of God and in the Name of Christ He works. For
He employs the tongue of one man for wisdom; the soul of another He enlightens by
Prophecy; to another He gives power to drive away devils; to another He gives to interpret
the divine Scriptures. He strengthens one man’s self-command; He teaches another the
way to give alms; another He teaches to fast and discipline himself; another He teaches to
despise the things of the body; another He trains for martyrdom: diverse in different men,
yet not diverse from Himself, as it is written, But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to
every man to profit withal. For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to
another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith, in the same
Spirit; and to another gifts of healing, in the same Spirit; and to another workings of miracles;
and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another divers kinds of
tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the
same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will2002.</p>
<p>13. But since concerning spirit in general many diverse things are written in the divine
Scriptures, and there is fear lest some out of ignorance fall into confusion, not knowing to
what sort of spirit the writing refers; it will be well now to certify you, of what kind the
Scripture declares the Holy Spirit to be. For as Aaron is called Christ, and David and Saul
and others are called Christs2003, but there is only one true Christ, so likewise since the
name of spirit is given to different things, it is right to see what is that which is distinctively
called the Holy Spirit. For many things are called spirits. Thus an Angel is called spirit, our
soul is called spirit, and this wind which is blowing is called spirit; great virtue also is spoken
of as spirit; and impure practice is called spirit; and a devil our adversary is called spirit.
Beware therefore when thou hearest these things, lest from their having a common name
thou mistake one for another. For concerning our soul the Scripture says, His spirit shall
go forth, and he shall return to his earth2004: and of the same soul it says again, Which formeth
the spirit of man within him2005. And of the Angels it is said in the Psalms, Who maketh
His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire2006. And of the wind it saith, Thou shalt
break the ships of Tarshish with a violent spirit2007; and, As the tree in the wood is shaken by

the spirit2008; and, Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirit of storm2009. And of good doctrine the Lord
Himself says, The words that I have spoken unto you, they are spirit2010, and they are life;
instead of, “are spiritual.” But the Holy Spirit is not pronounced by the tongue; but He is
a Living Spirit, who gives wisdom of speech, Himself speaking and discoursing.</p>
<p>14. And wouldest thou know that He discourses and speaks? Philip by revelation of
an Angel went down to the way which leads to Gaza, when the Eunuch was coming; and
the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot2011. Seest thou the Spirit
talking to one who hears Him? Ezekiel also speaks thus, The Spirit of the Lord came upon
me, and said unto me, Thus saith the Lord2012. And again, The Holy Ghost said2013, unto
the Apostles who were in Antioch, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them. Beholdest thou the Spirit living, separating, calling, and with
authority sending forth? Paul also said, Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city,
saying that bonds and afflictions await me2014. For this good Sanctifier of the Church, and
her Helper, and Teacher, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, of whom the Saviour said, He shall
teach you all things (and He said not only, He shall teach, but also, He shall bring to your
remembrance whatever I have said unto you2015; for the teachings of Christ and of the Holy
Ghost are not different, but the same)—He, I say, testified before to Paul what things should
befall him, that he might be the more stout-hearted, from knowing them beforehand. Now
I have spoken these things unto you because of the text, The words which I have spoken unto
you, they are spirit; that thou mayest understand this, not of the utterance of the lips2016,
but of the good doctrine in this passage.</p>
<p>15. But sin also is called spirit, as I have already said; only in another and opposite sense,
as when it is said, The spirit of whoredom caused them to err2017. The name “spirit” is given
also to the unclean spirit, the devil; but with the addition of, “the unclean;” for to each is
joined its distinguishing name, to mark its proper nature. If the Scripture speak of the soul
of man, it says the spirit with the addition, of the man; if it mean the wind, it says, spirit of

storm; if sin, it says, spirit of whoredom; if the devil, it says, an unclean spirit: that we may
know which particular thing is spoken of, and thou mayest not suppose that it means the
Holy Ghost; God forbid! For this name of spirit is common to many things; and every thing
which has not a solid body is in a general way called spirit2018. Since, therefore, the devils
have not such bodies, they are called spirits: but there is a great difference; for the unclean
devil, when he comes upon a man’s soul (may the Lord deliver from him every soul of those
who hear me, and of those who are not present), he comes like a wolf upon a sheep, ravening
for blood, and ready to devour. His coming is most fierce; the sense of it most oppressive;
the mind becomes darkened; his attack is an injustice also, and so is his usurpation of another’s
possession. For he makes forcible use of another’s body, and another’s instruments, as
if they were his own; he throws down him who stands upright (for he is akin to him who
fell from heaven2019); he twists the tongue and distorts the lips; foam comes instead of words;
the man is filled with darkness; his eye is open, yet the soul sees not through it; and the
miserable man gasps convulsively at the point of death. The devils are verily foes of men,
using them foully and mercilessly.</p>
<p>16. Such is not the Holy Ghost; God forbid! For His doings tend the contrary way, towards
what is good and salutary. First, His coming is gentle; the perception of Him is fragrant;
His burden most light; beams of light and knowledge gleam forth before His coming2020.
He comes with the bowels of a true guardian: for He comes to save, and to heal,
to teach, to admonish, to strengthen, to exhort, to enlighten the mind, first of him who receives
Him, and afterwards of others also, through him. And as a man, who being previously
in darkness then suddenly beholds the sun, is enlightened in his bodily sight, and sees plainly
things which he saw not, so likewise he to whom the Holy Ghost is vouchsafed, is enlightened
in his soul, and sees things beyond man’s sight, which he knew not; his body is on earth, yet
his soul mirrors forth the heavens. He sees, like Esaias, the Lord sitting upon a throne high
and lifted up2021; he sees, like Ezekiel, Him who is above the Cherubim2022; he sees like
Daniel, ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands2023; and the man, who
is so little, beholds the beginning of the world, and knows the end of the world, and the
times intervening, and the successions of kings,—things which he never learned: for the

True Enlightener is present with him. The man is within the walls of a house; yet the power
of his knowledge reaches far and wide, and he sees even what other men are doing.</p>
<p>17. Peter was not with Ananias and Sapphira when they sold their possessions, but he
was present by the Spirit; Why, he says, hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy
Ghost2024? There was no accuser; there was no witness; whence knew he what had happened?
Whiles it remained was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?
why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart2025? The unlettered2026 Peter, through the
grace of the Spirit, learnt what not even the wise men of the Greeks had known. Thou hast
the like in the case also of Elisseus. For when he had freely healed the leprosy of Naaman,
Gehazi received the reward, the reward of another’s achievement; and he took the money
from Naaman, and bestowed it in a dark place. But the darkness is not hidden from the
Saints2027. And when he came, Elisseus asked him; and like Peter, when he said, Tell me
whether ye sold the land for so much2028? he also enquires, Whence comest thou, Gehazi2029?
Not in ignorance, but in sorrow ask I whence comest thou? From darkness art thou come,
and to darkness shalt thou go; thou hast sold the cure of the leper, and the leprosy is thy
heritage. I, he says, have fulfilled the bidding of Him who said to me, Freely ye have received,
freely give2030; but thou hast sold this grace; receive now the condition of the sale. But what
says Elisseus to him? Went not mine heart with thee? I was here shut in by the body, but
the spirit which has been given me of God saw even the things afar off, and shewed me
plainly what was doing elsewhere. Seest thou how the Holy Ghost not only rids of ignorance,
but invests with knowledge? Seest thou how He enlightens men’s souls?</p>

like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers. As Cyril at that time saw the Prophet’s prediction fulfilled, so we also to
the present day see most plainly the fulfilment of the divine oracle, and Sion ploughed before our eyes: for except
the Church of the Apostles, with the houses lying around it, and the house of Caiaphas and the cemeteries, all

the exactness of the prophecy; for he said, And the daughter of Zion shall be left as a booth
in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers2033. And now the place is filled with
gardens of cucumbers. Seest thou how the Holy Spirit enlightens the saints? Be not therefore
carried away to other things, by the force of a common term, but keep fast the exact meaning.</p>
<p>19. And if ever, while thou hast been sitting here, a thought concerning chastity or
virginity has come into thy mind, it has been His teaching. Has not often a maiden, already
at the bridal threshold2034, fled away, He teaching her the doctrine of virginity? Has not
often a man distinguished at court2035, scorned wealth and rank, under the teaching of the
Holy Ghost? Has not often a young man, at the sight of beauty, closed his eyes, and fled
from the sight, and escaped the defilement? Askest thou whence this has come to pass?
The Holy Ghost taught the soul of the young man. Many ways of covetousness are there
in the world; yet Christians refuse possessions: wherefore? because of the teaching of the
Holy Ghost. Worthy of honour is in truth that Spirit, holy and good; and fittingly are we
baptized into Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. A man, still clothed with a body, wrestles with
many fiercest demons; and often the demon, whom many men could not master with iron
bands, has been mastered by the man himself with words of prayer, through the power
which is in him of the Holy Ghost; and the mere breathing of the Exorcist2036 becomes as
fire to that unseen foe. A mighty ally and protector, therefore, have we from God; a great
Teacher of the Church, a mighty Champion on our behalf. Let us not be afraid of the
demons, nor of the devil; for mightier is He who fighteth for us. Only let us open to Him
our doors; for He goeth about seeking such as are worthy2037 and searching on whom He
may confer His gifts.</p>
<p>20. And He is called the Comforter, because He comforts and encourages us, and helpeth
our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself

maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered2038, that is, makes intercession
to God. Oftentimes a man for Christ’s sake has been outraged and dishonoured
unjustly; martyrdom is at hand; tortures on every side, and fire, and sword, and savage
beasts, and the pit. But the Holy Ghost softly whispers to him, “Wait thou on the Lord2039,
O man; what is now befalling thee is a small matter, the reward will be great. Suffer a little
while, and thou shalt be with Angels for ever. The sufferings of this present time art not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us2040.” He portrays to the
man the kingdom of heaven; He gives him a glimpse of the paradise of delight; and the
martyrs, whose bodily countenances are of necessity turned to their judges, but who in
spirit are already in Paradise, despise those hardships which are seen.</p>
<p>21. And wouldest thou be sure that by the power of the Holy Ghost the Martyrs bear
their witness? The Saviour says to His disciples, And when they bring you unto the synagogues,
and the magistrates, and authorities, be not anxious how ye shall answer, or what ye shall
say; for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour, what ye ought to say2041. For it is
impossible to testify as a martyr for Christ’s sake, except a man testify by the Holy Ghost;
for if no man can say that Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost2042, how shall any
man give his own life for Jesus’ sake, but by the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>22. Great indeed, and all-powerful in gifts, and wonderful, is the Holy Ghost. Consider,
how many of you are now sitting here, how many souls of us are present. He is working
suitably for each, and being present in the midst, beholds the temper of each, beholds also
his reasoning and his conscience, and what we say, and think, and believe2043. Great indeed

Him, how many Christians there are in all this diocese, and how many in the whole
province2044 of Palestine, and carry forward thy mind from this province, to the whole
Roman Empire; and after this, consider the whole world; races of Persians, and nations of
Indians, Garbs and Sarmatians, Gauls and Spaniards, and Moors, Libyans and Ethiopians,
and the rest for whom we have no names; for of many of the nations not even the names
have reached us. Consider, I pray, of each nation, Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, Solitaries,

gifts;—how throughout the world He gives to one chastity, to another perpetual virginity,
to another almsgiving, to another voluntary poverty, to another power of repelling hostile
spirits. And as the light, with one touch of its radiance sheds brightness on all things, so
also the Holy Ghost enlightens those who have eyes; for if any from blindness is not
vouchsafed His grace, let him not blame the Spirit, but his own unbelief.</p>
<p>23. Thou hast seen His power, which is in all the world; tarry now no longer upon earth,
but ascend on high. Ascend, I say, in imagination even unto the first heaven, and behold
there so many countless myriads of Angels. Mount up in thy thoughts, if thou canst, yet
higher; consider, I pray thee, the Archangels, consider also the Spirits; consider the Virtues,
consider the Principalities, consider the Powers, consider the Thrones, consider the
Dominions2045;—of all these the Comforter is the Ruler from God, and the Teacher, and
the Sanctifier. Of Him Elias has need, and Elisseus, and Esaias, among men; of Him Michael
and Gabriel have need among Angels. Naught of things created is equal in honour to Him:
for the families of the Angels, and all their hosts assembled together, have no equality with
the Holy Ghost. All these the all-excellent power of the Comforter overshadows. And they
indeed are sent forth to minister2046, but He searches even the deep things of God, according
as the Apostle says, For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what
man knoweth the thing of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him? even so the
things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God2047.</p>
<p>24. He preached concerning Christ in the Prophets; He wrought in the Apostles; He to
this day seals the souls in Baptism. And the Father indeed gives to the Son; and the Son
shares with the Holy Ghost. For it is Jesus Himself, not I, who says, All things are delivered
unto Me of My Father2048; and of the Holy Ghost He says, When He, the Spirit of Truth,
shall come, and the rest.<gap reason="omitted"/>He shall glorify Me; for He shall receive of Mine, and shall shew it
unto you2049. The Father through the Son, with the Holy Ghost, is the giver of all grace; the
gifts of the Father are none other than those of the Son, and those of the Holy Ghost; for
there is one Salvation, one Power, one Faith; One God, the Father; One Lord, His only-begotten
Son; One Holy Ghost, the Comforter. And it is enough for us to know these things;

but inquire not curiously into His nature or substance2050: for had it been written, we would

the length of the discourse, beloved, produce weariness in you: but may He the very subject
of our discourse grant strength to every one, both to us who speak, and to you who listen!)
This Spirit, as I was saying, came down upon the seventy Elders in the time of Moses; and
this I say to thee, that I may now prove, that He knoweth all things, and worketh as He
will2051. The seventy Elders were chosen; And the Lord came down in a cloud, and took of
the Spirit that was upon Moses, and put it upon the seventy Elders2052; not that the Spirit
was divided, but that His grace was distributed in proportion to the vessels, and the capacity
of the recipients. Now there were present sixty and eight, and they prophesied; but Eldad
and Modad were not present: therefore that it might be shewn that it was not Moses who
bestowed the gift, but the Spirit who wrought, Eldad and Modad, who though called, had
not as yet presented themselves, did also prophesy2053.</p>
<p>26. Jesus the Son of Nun, the successor of Moses, was amazed; and came to him and
said, “Hast thou heard that Eldad and Modad are prophesying? They were called, and they
came not; my lord Moses, forbid them2054.” “I cannot forbid them,” he says, “for this grace
is from Heaven; nay, so far am I from forbidding them, that I myself am thankful for it. I
think not, however, that thou hast said this in envy; art thou jealous for my sake, because
that they prophesy, and thou prophesiest not yet? Wait for the proper season; and oh that
all the Lord’s people may be prophets, whenever the Lord shall give His Spirit upon them2055!”
saying this also prophetically, whenever the Lord shall give; “For as yet then He has not given
it; so thou hast it not yet.”—Had not then Abraham this, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph?
And they of old, had they it not? Nay, but the words, “whenever the Lord shall give” evidently
mean “give it upon all; as yet indeed the grace is partial, then it shall be given lavishly.” And
he secretly alluded to what was to happen among us on the day of Pentecost; for He Himself
came down among us. He had however also come down upon many before. For it is written,

And Jesus the son of Nun was filled with a spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon
him2056. Thou seest the figure everywhere the same in the Old and New Testament;—in
the days of Moses, the Spirit was given by laying on of hands; and by laying on of hands
Peter2057 also gives the Spirit. And on thee also, who art about to be baptized, shall His
grace come; yet in what manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper season.</p>
<p>27. He also came down upon all righteous men and Prophets; Enos, I mean, and Enoch,
and Noah, and the rest; upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for as regards Joseph, even Pharaoh
perceived that he had the Spirit of God within him2058. As to Moses, and the wonderful
works wrought by the Spirit in his days, thou hast heard often: This Spirit Job also had, that
most enduring man, and all the saints, though we repeat not all their names. He also was
sent forth when the Tabernacle was in making, and filled with wisdom the wise-hearted
men who were with Bezaleel2059.</p>
<p>28. In the might of this Spirit, as we have it in the Book of Judges, Othniel judged2060;
Gideon2061 waxed strong; Jephtha conquered2062; Deborah, a woman, waged war; and
Samson, so long as he did righteously, and grieved Him not, wrought deeds above man’s
power. And as for Samuel and David, we have it plainly in the Books of the Kingdoms, how
by the Holy Ghost they prophesied themselves, and were rulers of the prophets;—and Samuel
was called the Seer2063; and David says distinctly, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me2064,
and in the Psalms, And take not thy Holy Spirit from me2065, and again, Thy good Spirit shall
lead me in the land of righteousness2066. And as we have it in Chronicles, Azariah2067, in
the time of King Asa, and Jahaziel2068 in the time of King Jehoshaphat, partook of the Holy
Ghost; and again, another Azariah, he who was stoned2069. And Ezra says, Thou gavest also

of the others, he will find many testimonies concerning. the Holy Ghost; as when Micah
says in the person of God, surely I will perfect power by the Spirit the Lord2072; and Joel cries,

remaineth in the midst of you2075; and in like manner Zechariah, But receive My words and
My statutes which I command by My Spirit, to My servants the Prophets2076; and other passages.</p>

the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
and godliness; and the Spirit of the fear of God shall fill Him2077; signifying that the Spirit is
one and undivided, but His operations various. So again, Jacob My servant,<gap reason="omitted"/>.I have put

a judge of Elders. The chaste Susanna was condemned as a wanton; there was none to plead
her cause; for who was to deliver her from the rulers? She was led away to death, she was
now in the hands of the executioners. But her Helper was at hand, the Comforter, the
Spirit who sanctifies every rational nature. Come hither to me, He says to Daniel; young
though thou be, convict old men infected with the sins of youth; for it is written, God raised
up the Holy Spirit upon a young stripling2092; and nevertheless, (to pass on quickly,) by the
sentence of Daniel that chaste lady was saved. We bring this forward as a testimony; for
this is not the season for expounding. Nebuchadnezzar also knew that the Holy Spirit was
in Daniel; for he says to him, O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, of whom I know, that
the Holy Spirit of God is in thee2093. One thing he said truly, and one falsely; for that he had
the Holy Spirit was true, but he was not the master of the magicians, for he was no magician,
but was wise through the Holy Ghost. And before this also, he interpreted to him the vision
of the Image, which he who had seen it himself knew not; for he says, Tell me the vision,
which I who saw it know not2094. Thou seest the power of the Holy Ghost; that which they
who saw it, know not, they who saw it not, know and interpret.</p>
<p>32. And indeed it were easy to collect very many texts out of the Old Testament, and
to discourse more largely concerning the Holy Ghost. But the time is short; and we must

<head>Continuation of the Discourse on the Holy Ghost.</head>
<p>1 Corinthians xii. 8</p>
<p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, U+0026c.</p>
<p>1. In the preceding Lecture, according to our ability we set before you, our beloved
hearers2095, some small portion of the testimonies concerning the Holy Ghost; and on the
present occasion, we will, if it be God’s pleasure, proceed to treat, as far as may be, of those
which remain out of the New Testament: and as then to keep within due limit of your attention
we restrained our eagerness (for there is no satiety in discoursing concerning the
Holy Ghost), so now again we must say but a small part of what remains. For now, as well
as then, we candidly own that our weakness is overwhelmed by the multitude of things
written. Neither to-day will we use the subtleties of men, for that is unprofitable; but merely
call to mind what comes from the divine Scriptures; for this is the safest course, according
to the blessed Apostle Paul, who says, Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual2096.
Thus we act like travellers or voyagers, who having one goal to a very long journey,
though hastening on with eagerness, yet by reason of human weakness are wont to touch
in their way at divers cities or harbours.</p>
<p>2. Therefore though our discourses concerning the Holy Ghost are divided, yet He
Himself is undivided, being one and the same. For as in speaking concerning the Father,
at one time we taught how He is the one only Cause2097; and at another, how He is called
Father2098, or Almighty2099; and at another, how He is the Creator2100 of the universe; and
yet the division of the Lectures made no division of the Faith, in that He, the Object of devotion,
both was and is One;—and again, as in discoursing concerning the Only-begotten
Son of God we taught at one time concerning His Godhead2101, and at another concerning

His Manhood2102, dividing into many discourses the doctrines concerning our Lord Jesus
Christ, yet preaching undivided faith towards Him;—so now also though the Lectures concerning
the Holy Spirit are divided, yet we preach faith undivided towards Him. For it is
one and the Self-same Spirit who divides His gifts to every man severally as He will2103,
Himself the while remaining undivided. For the Comforter is not different from the Holy
Ghost, but one and the self-same, called by various names; who lives and subsists, and speaks,
and works; and of all rational natures made by God through Christ, both of Angels and of
men, He is the Sanctifier2104.</p>
<p>3. But lest any from lack of learning, should suppose from the different titles of the
Holy Ghost that these are divers spirits, and not one and the self-same, which alone there
is, therefore the Catholic Church guarding thee beforehand hath delivered to thee in the
profession of the faith, that thou “believe in one Holy Ghost the Comforter, who spake by
the Prophets;” that thou mightest know, that though His names be many, the Holy Spirit is
but one;—of which names, we will now rehearse to you a few out of many.</p>
<p>4. He is called the Spirit, according to the Scripture just now read, For to one is given
by the Spirit the word of wisdom2105. He is called the Spirit of Truth, as the Saviour says,
When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come2106. He is called also the Comforter, as He said, For
if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you2107. But that He is one and the same,
though called by different titles, is shewn plainly from the following. For that the Holy
Spirit and the Comforter are the same, is declared in those words, But the Comforter, which
is the Holy Ghost2108; and that the Comforter is the same as the Spirit of Truth, is declared,
when it is said, And I will give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever,
even the Spirit of Truth2109; and again, But when the Comforter is come whom I will send
unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth2110. And He is called the Spirit of God,
according as it is written, And I saw the Spirit of God descending2111; and again, For as many

as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God2112. He is called also the Spirit of the
Father, as the Saviour says, For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you2113; and again Paul saith, For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, and
the rest;<gap reason="omitted"/>that He would grant you to be strengthened by His Spirit2114. He is also called the
Spirit of the Lord, according to that which Peter spake, Why is it that ye have agreed together
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord2115? He is called also the Spirit of God and Christ, as Paul
writes, But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His2116. He is called also the Spirit
of the Son of God, as it is said, And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His
Son2117. He is called also the Spirit of Christ, as it is written, Searching what or what manner
of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify2118; and again, Through your prayer,
and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ2119.</p>
<p>5. Thou wilt find many other titles of the Holy Ghost besides. Thus He is called the
Spirit of Holiness, as it is written, According to the Spirit of Holiness2120. He is also called
the Spirit of adoption, as Paul saith, For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear,
but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father2121. He is also called
the Spirit of revelation, as it is written, May give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in
the knowledge of Him2122. He is also called the Spirit of promise, as the same Paul says, In
whom ye also after that ye believed, were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise2123. He is
also called the Spirit of grace, as when he says again, And hath done despite to the Spirit of
grace2124. And by many other such-like titles is He named. And thou heardest plainly in
the foregoing Lecture, that in the Psalms He is called at one time the good Spirit2125, and at
another the princely Spirit2126; and in Esaias He was styled the Spirit of wisdom and under-

standing, of counsel, and might, of knowledge, and of godliness, and of the fear of God2127.
By all which Scriptures both those before and those now alleged, it is established, that though
the titles of the Holy Ghost be different, He is one and the same; living and subsisting, and
always present together with the Father and the Son2128; not uttered or breathed from the
mouth and lips of the Father or the Son, nor dispersed into the air, but having a real substance2129,
Himself speaking, and working, and dispensing, and sanctifying; even as the
Economy of salvation which is to usward from the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,
is inseparable and harmonious and one, as we have also said before. For I wish you to keep
in mind those things which were lately spoken, and to know clearly that there is not one
Spirit in the Law and the Prophets, and another in the Gospels and Apostles; but that it is
One and the Self-same Holy Spirit, which both in the Old and in the New Testament, spoke
the divine Scriptures2130.</p>
<p>6. This is the Holy Ghost, who came upon the Holy Virgin Mary; for since He who was
conceived was Christ the Only-begotten, the power of the Highest overshadowed her, and
the Holy Ghost came upon her2131, and sanctified her, that she might be able to receive Him,
by whom all things were made2132. But I have no need of many words to teach thee that
generation was without defilement or taint, for thou hast learned it. It is Gabriel who says
to her, I am the herald of what shall be done, but have no part in the work. Though an
Archangel, I know my place; and though I joyfully bid thee All hail, yet how thou shalt bring
forth, is not of any grace of mine. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee
shall be called the Son of God2133.</p>

not, as some suppose, an energy of God, having according to them no individuality of subsistence. And the
Apostle also, after enumerating the gifts of the Spirit, immediately added, But all these worketh the one and the
same Spirit, dividing to each one severally as He will. Now if He willeth and worketh and divideth, He is surely
an energizing Being, but not an energy” (Suicer, Thesaurus, Πνευμα).</note>

<p>7. This Holy Spirit wrought in Elisabeth; for He recognises not virgins only, but matrons
also, so that their marriage be lawful. And Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost2134, and
prophesied; and that noble hand-maiden says of her own Lord, And whence is this to me,
that the Mother of my Lord should come to me2135? For Elisabeth counted herself blessed.
Filled with this Holy Spirit, Zacharias also, the father of John, prophesied2136, telling how
many good things the Only-begotten should procure, and that John should be His harbinger2137
through baptism. By this Holy Ghost also it was revealed to just Symeon, that
he should not see death, till he had seen the Lord’s Christ2138; and he received Him in his
arms, and bore clear testimony in the Temple concerning Him.</p>
<p>8. And John also, who had been filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother’s womb2139,
was for this cause sanctified, that he might baptize the Lord; not giving the Spirit himself,
but preaching glad tidings of Him who gives the Spirit. For he says, I indeed baptize you
with water unto repentance, but He that cometh after me, and the rest; He shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost and with fire2140. But wherefore with fire? Because the descent of the
Holy Ghost was in fiery tongues; concerning which the Lord says joyfully, I am come to send
fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled2141?</p>
<p>9. This Holy Ghost came down when the Lord was baptized, that the dignity of Him
who was baptized might not be hidden; as John says, But He which sent me to baptize with
water, the same said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining
upon Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost2142. But see what
saith the Gospel; the heavens were opened; they were opened because of the dignity of Him
who descended; for, lo, he says, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
as a dove, and lighting upon Him2143: that is, with voluntary motion in His descent.
For it was fit, as some have interpreted, that the primacy and first-fruits2144 of the Holy
Spirit promised to the baptized should be conferred upon the manhood of the Saviour, who

is the giver of such grace. But perhaps He came down in the form of a dove, as some say,
to exhibit a figure of that dove who is pure and innocent and undefiled, and also helps the
prayers for the children she has begotten, and for forgiveness of sins2145; even as it was
emblematically foretold that Christ should be thus manifested in the appearance of His eyes;
for in the Canticles she cries concerning the Bridegroom, and says, Thine eyes are as doves
by the rivers of water2146.</p>
<p>10. Of this dove, the dove of Noe, according to some, was in part a figure2147. For as
in his time by means of wood and of water there came salvation to themselves, and the beginning
of a new generation, and the dove returned to him towards evening with an olive
branch; thus, say they, the Holy Ghost also descended upon the true Noe, the Author of the
second birth, who draws together into one the wills of all nations, of whom the various dispositions
of the animals in the ark were a figure:—Him at whose coming the spiritual wolves
feed with the lambs, in whose Church the calf, and the lion, and the ox, feed in the same
pasture, as we behold to this day the rulers of the world guided and taught by Churchmen.
The spiritual dove therefore, as some interpret, came down at the season of His baptism,
that He might shew that it is He who by the wood of the Cross saves them who believe, He
who at eventide should grant salvation through His death.</p>
<p>11. And these things perhaps should be otherwise explained; but now again we must
hear the words of the Saviour Himself concerning the Holy Ghost. For He says, Except a
<note type="footnote">2145 The Benedictine Editor adds the two last words τύπον παραδηλοῦν from mss. Roe. Casaub. as necessary
to the construction, and adds the following note. “The text thus emended is capable of two senses. The first,
that the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove, a pure and harmless bird, to shew that He is Himself as
it were a mystic dove in His simplicity and love of children, for whose new birth and remission of sins at Baptism
He unites His prayers with Christ’s, as Cyril teaches in Cat. xvi. 20: and that Christ was for the like cause mystically
foreshown in Canticles as having eyes like a dove’s. The other sense is, that the Spirit descended in the
form of a dove on Christ’s Humanity in order to shew this to be as it were a dove in innocence, holiness, love
of children, and concurrence with the Holy Spirit in their regeneration.…Either sense is admissible, and maintained
by many of the Fathers: but I prefer the former.” This interpretation is confirmed by Tertullian (de
Baptismo, c. viii.), who says that the Holy Spirit glided down on the Lord “in the shape of a dove” in order that
the nature of the Holy Spirit might be declared by means of a creature of simplicity and innocence.”</note>

baptism, so to say, of the world—a dove was the herald which announced to the earth the assuagement of celestial
wrath,.…so to our flesh, as it emerges from the font after its old sins, flies the dove of the Holy Spirit,
bringing us the peace of God, sent out from heaven where the Church is, the typified ark.” Compare also Hippolytus,

man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God2148. And
that this grace is from the Father, He thus states, How much more shall your heavenly Father
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him2149. And that we ought to worship God in the
Spirit, He shews thus, But the hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in Spirit and in truth; for the Father also seeketh such to worship Him.
God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth2150. And
again, But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils2151; and immediately afterwards, Therefore
I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the
Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak a word against the Holy Ghost,
it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come2152. And again
He says, And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may
be with you for ever, the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him
not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know Him, for He abideth with you, and shall be in you2153.
And again He says, These things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you. But the
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach
you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said unto you2154. And again
He says, But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even
the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me2155. And again
the Saviour says, For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you2156<gap reason="omitted"/>..And when
He is come, He will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment2157; and afterwards
again, I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit,
when He the Spirit of Truth is come, He will declare unto you all the truth; for He shall not
speak from Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear that shall He speak, and He shall announce
unto you the things to come. He shall glorify Me, for He shall take of Mine, and shall announce
it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I, That He shall take of

Only-begotten Himself, that thou mayest not give heed to men’s words.</p>
<p>12. The fellowship of this Holy Spirit He bestowed on the Apostles; for it is written,
And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,
they are retained2159. This was the second time He breathed on man (His first breath2160
having been stifled through wilful sins); that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He went up
breathing upon thy face, and delivering thee from affliction2161. But whence went He up?
From Hades; for thus the Gospel relates, that then after His resurrection He breathed on
them. But though He bestowed His grace then, He was to lavish it yet more bountifully;
and He says to them, “I am ready to give it even now, but the vessel cannot yet hold it; for
a while therefore receive ye as much grace as ye can bear; and look forward for yet more;
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed with power from on high2162. Receive
it in part now; then, ye shall wear it in its fulness. For he who receives, often possesses the
gift but in part; but he who is clothed, is completely enfolded by his robe. “Fear not,” He
says, “the weapons and darts of the devil; for ye shall bear with you the power of the Holy
Ghost.” But remember what was lately said, that the Holy Ghost is not divided, but only
the grace which is given by Him.</p>
<p>13. Jesus therefore went up into heaven, and fulfilled the promise. For He said to them,
I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter2163. So they were sitting,
looking for the coming of the Holy Ghost; and when the day of Pentecost was fully come,
here, in this city of Jerusalem,—(for this honour also belongs to us2164; and we speak not
of the good things which have happened among others, but of those which have been
vouchsafed among ourselves,)—on the day of Pentecost, I say, they were sitting, and the
Comforter came down from heaven, the Guardian and Sanctifier of the Church, the Ruler
of souls, the Pilot of the tempest-tossed, who leads the wanderers to the light, and presides
over the combatants, and crowns the victors.</p>

not in part, but His power was in full perfection; for as he who plunges into the waters and
is baptized is encompassed on all sides by the waters, so were they also baptized completely
by the Holy Ghost. The water however flows round the outside only, but the Spirit baptizes
also the soul within, and that completely. And wherefore wonderest thou? Take an example
from matter; poor indeed and common, yet useful for the simpler sort. If the fire passing
in through the mass of the iron makes the whole of it fire, so that what was cold becomes
burning and what was black is made bright,—if fire which is a body thus penetrates and
works without hindrance in iron which is also a body, why wonder that the Holy Ghost
enters into the very inmost recesses of the soul?</p>
<p>15. And lest men should be ignorant of the greatness of the mighty gift coming down
to them, there sounded as it were a heavenly trumpet, For suddenly there came from heaven
a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind2166, signifying the presence of Him who was to
grant power unto men to seize with violence the kingdom of God; that both their eyes might
see the fiery tongues, and their ears hear the sound. And it filled all the house where they
were sitting; for the house became the vessel of the spiritual water; as the disciples sat within,
the whole house was filled. Thus they were entirely baptized according to the promise, and
invested soul and body with a divine garment of salvation. And there appeared unto them
cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost. They partook of fire, not of burning but of saving fire; of fire which consumes
the thorns of sins, but gives lustre to the soul. This is now coming upon you also, and that
to strip away and consume your sins which are like thorns, and to brighten yet more that
precious possession of your souls, and to give you grace; for He gave it then to the Apostles.
And He sat upon them in the form of fiery tongues, that they might crown themselves with
new and spiritual diadems by fiery tongues upon their heads. A fiery sword barred of old
the gates of Paradise; a fiery tongue which brought salvation restored the gift.</p>
<p>16. And they began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance2167.
The Galilean Peter or Andrew spoke Persian or Median. John and the rest of the Apostles
spoke every tongue to those of Gentile extraction; for not in our time have multitudes of
strangers first begun to assemble here from all quarters, but they have done so since that
time. What teacher can be found so great as to teach men all at once things which they have
not learned? So many years are they in learning by grammar and other arts to speak only
Greek well; nor yet do all speak this equally well; the Rhetorician perhaps succeeds in

speaking well, and the Grammarian sometimes not well, and the skilful Grammarian is ignorant
of the subjects of philosophy. But the Holy Spirit taught them many languages at
once, languages which in all their life they never knew. This is in truth vast wisdom, this is
power divine. What a contrast of their long ignorance in time past to their sudden, complete
and varied and unaccustomed exercise of these languages!</p>
<p>17. The multitude of the hearers was confounded;—it was a second confusion, in the
room of that first evil one at Babylon. For in that confusion of tongues there was division
of purpose, because their thought was at enmity with God; but here minds were restored
and united, because the object of interest was godly. The means of falling were the means
of recovery. Wherefore they marvelled, saying2168, How hear we them speaking? No marvel
if ye be ignorant; for even Nicodemus was ignorant of the coming of the Spirit, and to him
it was said, The Spirit breatheth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but canst
not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth2169; but if, even though I hear His voice, I
know not whence he cometh, how can I explain, what He is Himself in substance?</p>
<p>18. But others mocking said, They are full of new wine2170, and they spoke truly though
in mockery. For in truth the wine was new, even the grace of the New Testament; but this
new wine was from a spiritual Vine, which had oftentimes ere this borne fruit in Prophets,
and had budded in the New Testament. For as in things sensible, the vine ever remains the
same, but bears new fruits in its seasons, so also the self-same Spirit continuing what He is,
as He had often wrought in Prophets, now manifested a new and marvellous work. For
though His grace had come before to the Fathers also, yet here it came exuberantly; for
formerly men only partook of the Holy Ghost, but now they were baptized completely.</p>
<p>19. But Peter who had the Holy Ghost, and who knew what he possessed, says, “Men
of Israel, ye who preach Joel, but know not the things which are written, these men are not
drunken as ye suppose2171. Drunken they are, not however as ye suppose, but according to
that which is written, They shall be drunken with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt
make them drink of the torrents of thy pleasure2172. They are drunken, with a sober drunkenness,
deadly to sin and life-giving to the heart, a drunkenness contrary to that of the body;
for this last causes forgetfulness even of what was known, but that bestows the knowledge
even of what was not known. They are drunken, for they have drunk the wine of the spir-

itual vine, which says, I am the vine and ye are the branches2173. But if ye are not persuaded
by me, understand what I tell you from the very time of the day; for it is the third hour of
the day2174. For He who, as Mark relates, was crucified at the third hour, now at the third
hour sent down His grace. For His grace is not other than the Spirit’s grace, but He who
was then crucified, who also gave the promise, made good that which He promised. And
if ye would receive a testimony also, Listen, he says: “But this is that which was spoken by
the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass after this, saith God, I will pour forth of My Spirit2175—(
and this word, I will pour forth, implied a rich gift; for God giveth not the Spirit by
measure, for the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand2176; and He
has given Him the power also of bestowing the grace of the All-holy Spirit on whomsoever
He will);—I will pour forth of My Spirit unto all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy; and afterwards, Yea, and on My servants and on My handmaidens I will pour out
in those days of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy2177.” The Holy Ghost is no respecter of
persons; for He seeks not dignities, but piety of soul. Let neither the rich be puffed up, nor
the poor dejected, but only let each prepare himself for reception of the Heavenly gift.</p>
<p>20. We have said much to-day, and perchance you are weary of listening; yet more still
remains. And in truth for the doctrine of the Holy Ghost there were need of a third lecture;
and of many besides. But we must have your indulgence on both points. For as the Holy
Festival of Easter is now at hand we have this day lengthened our discourse and yet we had
not room to bring before you all the testimonies from the New Testament which we ought.
For many passages are still to come from the Acts of the Apostles in which the grace of the
Holy Ghost wrought mightily in Peter and in all the Apostles together; many also from the
Catholic Epistles, and the fourteen Epistles of Paul; out of all which we will now endeavour
to gather a few, like flowers from a large meadow, merely by way of remembrance.</p>
<p>21. For in the power of the Holy Ghost, by the will of Father and Son, Peter stood with
the Eleven, and lifting up his voice, (according to the text, Lift up thy voice with strength,
thou that bringest good tidings to Jerusalem2178), captured in the spiritual net of his words,
about three thousand souls. So great was the grace which wrought in all the Apostles together,
that, out of the Jews, those crucifiers of Christ, this great number believed, and were baptized
in the Name of Christ, and continued steadfastly in the Apostles’ doctrine and in the prayers2179.
And again in the same power of the Holy Ghost, Peter and John went up into the

Temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour2180, and in the Name of Jesus healed
the man at the Beautiful gate, who had been lame from his mother’s womb for forty years;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken, Then shall the lame man leap as an hart2181.
And thus, as they captured in the spiritual net of their doctrine five thousand believers at
once, so they confuted the misguided rulers of the people and chief priests, and that, not
through their own wisdom, for they were unlearned and ignorant men2182, but through the
mighty power of the Holy Ghost; for it is written, Then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said
to them2183. So great also was the grace of the Holy Ghost, which wrought by means of the
Twelve Apostles in them who believed, that they were of one heart and of one soul2184, and
their enjoyment of their goods was common, the possessors piously offering the prices of
their possessions, and no one among them wanting aught; while Ananias and Sapphira,
who attempted to lie to the Holy Ghost, underwent their befitting punishment.</p>
<p>22. And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the
people2185. And so great was the spiritual grace shed around the Apostles, that gentle as
they were, they were the objects of dread; for of the rest durst no man join himself to them;
but the people magnified them; and multitudes were added of those who believed on the Lord,
both of men and women; and the streets were filled with the sick on their beds and couches,
that as Peter passed by, at least his shadow might overshadow some of them. And the multitude
also of the cities round about came unto this holy Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and them that
were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were healed every one in this power of the Holy
Ghost2186.</p>
<p>23. Again, after the Twelve Apostles had been cast into prison by the chief priests for
preaching Christ, and had been marvellously delivered from it at night by an Angel, and
were brought before them in the judgment hall from the Temple, they fearlessly rebuked
them in their discourse to them concerning Christ, and added this, that God hath also given
His Holy Spirit to them that obey Him2187. And when they had been scourged, they went
their way rejoicing, and ceased not to teach and preach Jesus as the Christ2188.</p>

<p>24. And it was not in the Twelve Apostles only that the grace of the Holy Spirit wrought,
but also in the first-born children of this once barren Church, I mean the seven Deacons;
for these also were chosen, as it is written, being full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom2189.
Of whom Stephen, rightly so named2190, the first fruits of the Martyrs, a man full of faith
and of the Holy Ghost, wrought great wonders and miracles among the people, and vanquished
those who disputed with him; for they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by
which he spake2191. But when he was maliciously accused and brought to the judgment
hall, he was radiant with angelic brightness; for all they who sat in the council, looking
steadfastly on him, saw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel2192. And having by his
wise defence confuted the Jews, those stiffnecked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears, ever
resisting the Holy Ghost2193, he beheld the heavens opened, and saw the Son of Man standing
on the right hand of God. He saw Him, not by his own power, but, as the Divine Scripture
says, being full of the Holy Ghost, he looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of
God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God2194.</p>
<p>25. In this power of the Holy Ghost, Philip also in the Name of Christ at one time in
the city of Samaria drove away the unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice; and healed
the palsied and the lame, and brought to Christ great multitudes of them that believe. To
whom Peter and John came down, and with prayer, and the laying on of hands, imparted
the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, from which Simon Magus alone was declared an alien,
and that justly. And at another time Philip was called by the Angel of the Lord in the way,
for the sake of that most godly Ethiopian, the Eunuch, and heard distinctly the Spirit Himself
saying, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot2195. He instructed the Eunuch, and baptized
him, and so having sent into Ethiopia a herald of Christ, according as it is written, Ethiopia
shall soon stretch out her hand unto God2196, he was caught away by the Angel, and preached
the Gospel in the cities in succession.</p>
<p>26. With this Holy Spirit Paul also had been filled after his calling by our Lord Jesus
Christ. Let godly Ananias come as a witness to what we say, he who in Damascus said to
him, The Lord, even Jesus who appeared to thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me,
that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost2197. And straightway

the Spirit’s mighty working changed the blindness of Paul’s eyes into newness of sight; and
having vouchsafed His seal unto his soul, made him a chosen vessel to bear the Name of the
Lord who had appeared to him, before kings and the children of Israel, and rendered the
former persecutor an ambassador and good servant,—one, who from Jerusalem, and even
unto Illyricum, fully preached the Gospel2198, and instructed even imperial Rome, and carried
the earnestness of his preaching as far as Spain, undergoing conflicts innumerable, and
performing signs and wonders. Of him for the present enough.</p>
<p>27. In the power of the same Holy Spirit Peter also, the chief of the Apostles and the
bearer of the keys2199 of the kingdom of heaven, healed Æneas the paralytic in the Name
of Christ at Lydda, which is now Diospolis, and at Joppa raised from the dead Tabitha rich
in good works. And being on the housetop in a trance, he saw heaven opened, and by means
of the vessel let down as it were a sheet full of beasts of every shape and sort, he learnt plainly
to call no man common or unclean, though he should be of the Greeks2200. And when he
was sent for by Cornelius, he heard clearly the Holy Ghost Himself saying, Behold, men seek
thee; but arise and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting; for I have sent them2201.
And that it might be plainly shewn that those of the Gentiles also who believe are made
partakers of the grace of the Holy Ghost, when Peter was come to Cesarea, and was teaching
the things concerning Christ, the Scripture says concerning Cornelius and them who were
with him; While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the
word; so that they of the circumcision also which came with Peter were astonished, and when
they understood it said that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost2202.</p>
<p>28. And in Antioch also, a most renowned city of Syria, when the preaching of Christ
took effect, Barnabas was sent hence as far as Antioch to help on the good work, being a
good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith2203; who seeing a great harvest of believers
in Christ, brought Paul from Tarsus to Antioch, as his fellow-combatant. And when crowds
had been instructed by them and assembled in the Church, it came to pass that the disciples
were called Christians first in Antioch2204; the Holy Ghost, methinks, bestowing on the be-

lievers that new Name, which had been promised before by the Lord. And the grace of the
Spirit being shed forth by God more abundantly in Antioch, there were there prophets and
teachers of whom Agabus was one2205. And as they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the
Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
And after hands had been laid on them, they were sent forth by the Holy Ghost2206. Now it
is manifest, that the Spirit which speaks and sends, is a living Spirit, subsisting, and operating,
as we have said.</p>
<p>29. This Holy Spirit, who in unison with Father and Son has established the New Covenant
in the Church Catholic, has set us free from the burdens of the law grievous to be
borne,—those I mean, concerning things common and unclean, and meats, and sabbaths,
and new moons, and circumcision, and sprinklings, and sacrifices; which were given for a
season, and had a shadow of the good things to come2207, but which, when the truth had
come, were rightly withdrawn. For when Paul and Barnabas were sent to the Apostles, because
of the question moved at Antioch by them who said that it was necessary to be circumcised
and to keep the customs of Moses, the Apostles who were here at Jerusalem by a
written injunction set free the whole world from all the legal and typical observances; yet
they attributed not to themselves the full authority in so great a matter, but send an injunction
in writing, and acknowledge this: For it hath seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and to us,
to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from things
sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication2208;
shewing evidently by what they wrote, that though the writing was by the hands of human
Apostles, yet the decree is universal from the Holy Ghost: which decree Paul and Barnabas
took and confirmed unto all the world.</p>
<p>30. And now, having proceeded thus far in my discourse, I ask indulgence from your
love2209, or rather from the Spirit who dwelt in Paul, if I should not be able to rehearse
everything, by reason of my own weakness, and your weariness who listen. For when shall
I in terms worthy of Himself declare the marvellous deeds wrought by the operation of the
Holy Ghost in the Name of Christ? Those wrought in Cyprus upon Elymas the sorcerer,
and in Lystra at the healing of the cripple, and in Cilicia and Phrygia and Galatia and Mysia
and Macedonia? or those at Philippi (the preaching, I mean, and the driving out of the
spirit of divination in the Name of Christ; and the salvation by baptism of the jailer with his
whole house at night after the earthquake); or the events at Thessalonica; and the address

at Areopagus in the midst of the Athenians; or the instructions at Corinth, and in all Achaia?
How shall I worthily recount the mighty deeds which were wrought at Ephesus through
Paul, by the Holy Ghost2210? Whom they of that City knew not before, but came to know
Him by the doctrine of Paul; and when Paul had laid his hands on them, and the Holy Ghost
had come upon them, they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And so great spiritual grace
was upon him, that not only his touch wrought cures, but even the handkerchiefs and napkins2211,
brought from his body, healed diseases, and scared away the evil spirits; and at last
they also who practised curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all
men2212.</p>
<p>31. I pass by the work wrought at Troas on Eutychus, who being borne down by his sleep
fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead; yet was saved alive by Paul2213. I also
pass by the prophecies addressed to the Elders of Ephesus whom he called to him in Miletus,
to whom he openly said, That the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying2214—and the
rest; for by saying, in every city, Paul made manifest that the marvellous works done by him
in each city, were from the operative power of the Holy Ghost, by the will of God, and in
the Name of Christ who spoke in him. By the power of this Holy Ghost, the same Paul was
hastening to this holy city Jerusalem, and this, though Agabus by the Spirit foretold what
should befall him; and yet he spoke to the people with confidence, declaring the things
concerning Christ. And when brought to Cesarea, and set amid tribunals of justice, at one
time before Felix, and at another before Festus the governor and King Agrippa, Paul obtained
of the Holy Ghost grace so great, and triumphant in wisdom, that at last Agrippa himself
the king of the Jews said, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian2215. This Holy Spirit
granted to Paul, when he was in the island of Melita also, to receive no harm when bitten
by the viper, and to effect divers cures on the diseased. This Holy Spirit guided him, the
persecutor of old, as a herald of Christ, even as far as imperial Rome, and there he persuaded
many of the Jews to believe in Christ, and to them who gainsaid he said plainly, Well spake
the Holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet, saying unto your fathers, and the rest2216.</p>
<p>32. And that Paul was full of the Holy Ghost, and all his fellow Apostles, and they who
after them believed in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, hear from himself as he writes plainly

man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power2217. And again, But He who
sealed us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the earnest of the Spirit2218. And again,
He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit
which dwelleth in you2219. And again, writing to Timothy, That good thing which was
committed to thee guard through the Holy Ghost which was given to us2220.</p>
<p>33. And that the Holy Ghost subsists, and lives, and speaks, and foretells, I have often
said in what goes before, and Paul writes it plainly to Timothy: Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,
that in later times some shall depart from the faith2221,—which we see in the divisions
not only of former times but also of our own; so motley and diversified are the errors of the
heretics. And again the same Paul says, Which in other generations was not made known
unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets in
the Spirit2222. And again, Wherefore, as saith the Holy Ghost2223; and again, The Holy Ghost
also witnesseth to us2224. And again he calls unto the soldiers of righteousness, saying, And
take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, with all
prayer and supplication2225. And again, Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be
filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs2226.

Ghost be with you all2227.</p>

sanctifying, and effectual power of the Holy Ghost established for those who can understand;
for the time would fail me in my discourse if I wished to quote what yet remains concerning
the Holy Ghost from the fourteen Epistles of Paul, wherein he has taught with such variety,
completeness, and reverence. And to the power of the Holy Ghost Himself it must belong,
to grant to us forgiveness for what we have omitted because the days are few, and upon you
the hearers to impress more perfectly the knowledge of what yet remains; while from the

frequent reading of the sacred Scriptures those of you who are diligent come to understand
these things, and by this time, both from these present Lectures, and from what has before
been told you, hold more steadfastly the Faith in “One God the Father Almighty; and in our
Lord Jesus Christ, His Only-Begotten Son; and in the Holy Ghost the Comforter.” Though
the word itself and title of Spirit is applied to Them in common in the sacred Scriptures,—for
it is said of the Father, God is a Spirit2228, as it is written in the Gospel according to John;
and of the Son, A Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord2229, as Jeremias the prophet says;
and of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, the Holy Ghost2230, as was said;—yet the arrangement
of articles in the Faith, if religiously understood, disproves the error of Sabellius also2231.
Return we therefore in our discourse to the point which now presses and is profitable to
you.</p>
<p>35. Beware lest ever like Simon thou come to the dispensers of Baptism in hypocrisy,
thy heart the while not seeking the truth. It is ours to protest, but it is thine to secure thyself.
If thou standest in faith2232, blessed art thou; if thou hast fallen in unbelief, from this day
forward cast away thine unbelief, and receive full assurance. For, at the season of baptism,
when thou art come before the Bishops, or Presbyters, or Deacons2233,—(for its grace is
everywhere, in villages and in cities, on them of low as on them of high degree, on bondsmen
and on freemen, for this grace is not of men, but the gift is from God through men,)—approach

with faith, though men minister in what is seen, the Holy Ghost bestows that which is unseen.
Thou art coming to a great trial, to a great muster2236, in that one hour, which if thou throw
away, thy disaster is irretrievable; but if thou be counted worthy of the grace, thy soul will
be enlightened, thou wilt receive a power which thou hadst not, thou wilt receive weapons
terrible to the evil spirits; and if thou cast not away thine arms, but keep the Seal upon thy
soul, no evil spirit will approach thee; for he will be cowed; for verily by the Spirit of God
are the evil spirits cast out.</p>
<p>37. If thou believe, thou shalt not only receive remission of sins, but also do things
which pass man’s power2237. And mayest thou be worthy of the gift of prophecy also! For
thou shalt receive grace according to the measure of thy capacity and not of my words; for
I may possibly speak of but small things, yet thou mayest receive greater; since faith is a
large affair2238. All thy life long will thy guardian the Comforter abide with thee; He will
care for thee, as for his own soldier; for thy goings out, and thy comings in, and thy plotting
foes. And He will give thee gifts of grace of every kind, if thou grieve Him not by sin; for it
is written, And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye were sealed unto the day of redemption2239.
What then, beloved, is it to preserve grace? Be ye ready to receive grace, and
when ye have received it, cast it not away.p</p>
<p>38. And may the very God of All, who spake by the Holy Ghost through the prophets,
who sent Him forth upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost in this place, Himself send
Him forth at this time also upon you; and by Him keep us also, imparting His benefit in
common to us all, that we may ever render up the fruits of the Holy Ghost, love, joy, peace,
long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance2240, in Christ Jesus our
Lord:—By whom and with whom, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory to the Father,

<head>Lecture XVIII.</head>
<head>On the Words, And in One Holy Catholic Church, and in the Resurrection of
the Flesh, and the Life Everlasting.</head>
<p>Ezekiel xxxvii. 1</p>
<p>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me
down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones.</p>
<p>1. The root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the
recompense nerves the soul to good works. For every labourer is ready to endure the toils,
if he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart
soon sinks as well as their body. A soldier who expects a prize is ready for war, but no one
is forward to die for a king who is indifferent about those who serve under him, and bestows
no honours on their toils. In like manner every soul believing in a Resurrection is naturally
careful of itself; but, disbelieving it, abandons itself to perdition. He who believes that his
body shall remain to rise again, is careful of his robe, and defiles it not with fornication; but
he who disbelieves the Resurrection, gives himself to fornication, and misuses his own body,
as though it were not his own. Faith therefore in the Resurrection of the dead, is a great
commandment and doctrine of the Holy Catholic Church; great and most necessary, though
gainsaid by many, yet surely warranted by the truth. Greeks contradict it2241, Samaritans2242
disbelieve it, heretics2243 mutilate it; the contradiction is manifold, but the truth is uniform.</p>
<p>2. Now Greeks and Samaritans together argue against us thus. The dead man has fallen,
and mouldered away, and is all turned into worms; and the worms have died also; such is
the decay and destruction which has overtaken the body; how then is it to be raised? The
shipwrecked have been devoured by fishes, which are themselves devoured. Of them who
fight with wild beasts the very bones are ground to powder, and consumed by bears and
lions. Vultures and ravens feed on the flesh of the unburied dead, and then fly away over
all the world; whence then is the body to be collected? For of the fowls who have devoured
it some may chance to die in India, some in Persia, some in the land of the Goths. Other

Compare Iren. I. xxiii. 5, on Menander’s assertion that his disciples attain to the resurrection by being baptized
into him, and can die no more, but retain immortal youth: ib. xxiv. 5. Basilides taught that “salvation belongs
to the soul alone.” On the other forms of heresy concerning the Resurrection, see Suicer, Thesaurus, ᾽Ανάστασις.</note>

men again are consumed by fire, and their very ashes scattered by rain or wind; whence is
the body to be brought together again2244?</p>
<p>3. To thee, poor little feeble man, India is far from the land of the Goths, and Spain
from Persia; but to God, who holds the whole earth in the hollow of His hand2245, all things
are near at hand. Impute not then weakness to God, from a comparison of thy feebleness,
but rather dwell on His power2246. Does then the sun, a small work of God, by one glance
of his beams give warmth to the whole world; does the atmosphere, which God has made,
encompass all things in the world; and is God, who is the Creator both of the sun, and of
the atmosphere, far off from the world? Imagine a mixture of seeds of different plants (for
as thou art weak concerning the faith, the examples which I allege are weak also), and that
these different seeds are contained in thy single hand; is it then to thee, who art a man, a
difficult or an easy matter to separate what is in thine hand, and to collect each seed according
to its nature, and restore it to its own kind? Canst thou then separate the things in thine
hand, and cannot God separate the things contained in His hand, and restore them to their
proper place? Consider what I say, whether it is not impious to deny it?</p>
<p>4. But further, attend, I pray, to the very principle of justice, and come to thine own
case. Thou hast different sorts of servants: and some are good and some bad; thou honourest
therefore the good, and smitest the bad. And if thou art a judge, to the good thou awardest
praise, and to the transgressors, punishment. Is then justice observed by thee a mortal man;
and with God, the ever changeless King of all, is there no retributive justice2247? Nay, to
deny it is impious. For consider what I say. Many murderers have died in their beds unpunished;
where then is the righteousness of God? Yea, ofttimes a murderer guilty of fifty
murders is beheaded once; where then shall he suffer punishment for the forty and nine?
Unless there is a judgment and a retribution after this world, thou chargest God with unrighteousness.
Marvel not, however, because of the delay of the judgment; no combatant
is crowned or disgraced, till the contest is over; and no president of the games ever crowns
men while yet striving, but he waits till all the combatants are finished, that then deciding
between them he may dispense the prizes and the chaplets2248. Even thus God also, so long

as the strife in this world lasts, succours the just but partially, but afterwards He renders to
them their rewards fully.</p>
<p>5. But if according to thee there is no resurrection of the dead, wherefore condemnest
thou the robbers of graves? For if the body perishes, and there is no resurrection to be hoped
for, why does the violator of the tomb undergo punishment? Thou seest that though thou
deny it with thy lips, there yet abides with thee an indestructible instinct of the resurrection.</p>
<p>6. Further, does a tree after it has been cut down blossom again, and shall man after
being cut down blossom no more? And does the corn sown and reaped remain for the
threshing floor, and shall man when reaped from this world not remain for the threshing?
And do shoots of vine or other trees, when clean cut off and transplanted, come to life and
bear fruit; and shall man, for whose sake all these exist, fall into the earth and not rise again?
Comparing efforts, which is greater, to mould from the beginning a statue which did not
exist, or to recast in the same shape that which had fallen? Is God then, who created us out
of nothing, unable to raise again those who exist and are fallen2249? But thou believest not
what is written of the resurrection, being a Greek: then from the analogy of nature consider
these matters, and understand them from what is seen to this day. Wheat, it may be, or
some other kind of grain, is sown; and when the seed has fallen, it dies and rots, and is
henceforth useless for food. But that which has rotted, springs up in verdure; and though
small when sown, springs up most beautiful. Now wheat was made for us; for wheat and
all seeds were created not for themselves, but for our use; are then the things which were
made for us quickened when they die, and do we for whom they were made, not rise again
after our death2250?</p>
<p>7. The season is winter2251, as thou seest; the trees now stand as if they were dead: for
where are the leaves of the fig-tree? where are the clusters of the vine? These in winter time
are dead, but green in spring; and when the season is come, there is restored to them a
quickening as it were from a state of death. For God, knowing thine unbelief, works a resur-

men, and their original elements, He will, when they are dissolved, in whatever manner that may take place,
raise them again with equal ease.” Lactant. Institt. VII. 23 fin.: Apost. Const. V. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">2250 An eloquent statement of the argument for the resurrection from the analogies of nature occurs in
Tertull. De Resurr. c. xii. That it was not unknown to Cyril, seems probable from the concluding sentence:
“And surely if all things rise again for man, for whom they have been provided—but not for man unless for his
flesh also—how can the flesh itself perish utterly, for the sake and service of which nothing is allowed to perish.”
Tertullian himself was probably indebted, as Bp. Lightfoot suggests, to Clemens. Rom. Epist. ad Corinth. xxiv.

rection year by year in these visible things; that, beholding what happens to things inanimate,
thou mayest believe concerning things animate and rational. Further, flies and bees are often
drowned in water, yet after a while revive2252; and species of dormice2253, after remaining
motionless during the winter, are restored in the summer (for to thy slight thoughts like
examples are offered); and shall He who to irrational and despised creatures grants life supernaturally,
not bestow it upon us, for whose sake He made them?</p>
<p>8. But the Greeks ask for a resurrection of the dead still manifest; and say that, even if
these creatures are raised, yet they had not utterly mouldered away; and they require to see
distinctly some creature rise again after complete decay. God knew men’s unbelief, and
provided for this purpose a bird, called a Phoenix2254. This bird, as Clement writes, and as
many more relate, being the only one of its kind2255, arrives in the land of the Egyptians at
periods of five hundred years, shewing forth the resurrection, not in desert places, lest the
occurrence of the mystery should remain unknown, but appearing in a notable city2256,
that men might even handle what would otherwise be disbelieved. For it makes itself a

i. 185), by others the marmot (mus Alpinus). More probably it is the dormouse (myoxis glis), which stores up
provisions for the winter, though it sleeps through much of that season.</note>
<note type="footnote">2254 The story of the Phoenix as told by Herodotus, II. 73, is as follows: “They have also another sacred bird
called the Phoenix, which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity even in Egypt,
only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the
old phoenix dies.…They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible; that he
comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the
Sun, and there buries the body.” The many variations and fabulous accretions of the story are detailed by Suicer,
Thesaurus, Φοῖνιξ, and by Bp. Lightfoot in a long and interesting note on Clemens Rom. Epist. ad Cor. xxv.
Cyril borrows the story from Clement almost verbally, yet not without some variations, which will be noticed
below. The legend with all its miraculous features is told by Ovid, Metamorph. xv. 392, by Claudian, Phoenix,
and by the Pseudo-Lactantius in an Elegiac poem, Phoenix, included in Weber’s Corpus Poetarum Latinorum,
and literally translated in Clark’s Ante-Nicene Library. See also Tertull. De Resurr. Carn. c. xiii.</note>

coffin2257 of frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and entering into this when its years
are fulfilled, it evidently dies and moulders away. Then from the decayed flesh of the dead
bird a worm is engendered, and this worm when grown large is transformed into a bird;—and
do not disbelieve this, for thou seest the offspring of bees also fashioned thus out of
worms2258, and from eggs which are quite fluid thou hast seen wings and bones and sinews
of birds issue. Afterwards the aforesaid Phoenix, becoming fledged and a full-grown Phoenix,
like the former one, soars up into the air such as it had died, shewing forth to men a most
evident resurrection of the dead. The Phoenix indeed is a wondrous bird, yet it is irrational,
nor ever sang praise to God; it flies abroad through the sky, but it knows not who is the
Only-begotten Son of God. Has then a resurrection from the dead been given to this irrational
creature which knows not its Maker, and to us who ascribe glory to God and keep
His commandments, shall there no resurrection be granted?</p>
<p>9. But since the sign of the Phoenix is remote and uncommon, and men still disbelieve
our resurrection, take again the proof of this from what thou seest every day. A hundred
or two hundred years ago, we all, speakers and hearers, where were we? Know we not the
groundwork of the substance of our bodies? Knowest thou not how from weak and shapeless
and simple2259 elements we are engendered, and out of what is simple and weak a living
man is formed? and how that weak element being made flesh is changed into strong sinews,
and bright eyes, and sensitive nose, and hearing ears, and speaking tongue, and beating
heart, and busy hands, and swift feet, and into members of all kinds2260? and how that once
weak element becomes a shipwright, and a builder, and an architect, and a craftsman of
various arts, and a soldier, and a ruler, and a lawgiver, and a king? Cannot God then, who
has made us out of imperfect materials, raise us up when we have fallen into decay? He who
thus flames a body out of what is vile, cannot He raise the fallen body again? And He who
fashions that which is not, shall He not raise up that which is and is fallen?</p>
<p>10. Take further a manifest proof of the resurrection of the dead, witnessed month by
month in the sky and its luminaries2261. The body of the moon vanishes completely, so

that no part of it is any more seen, yet it fills again, and is restored to its former state2262;
and for the perfect demonstration of the matter, the moon at certain revolutions of years
suffering eclipse and becoming manifestly changed into blood, yet recovers its luminous
body: God having provided this, that thou also, the man who art formed of blood, mightest
not refuse credence to the resurrection of the dead, but mightest believe concerning thyself
also what thou seest in respect of the moon. These therefore use thou as arguments against
the Greeks; for with them who receive not what is written fight thou with unwritten weapons,
by reasonings only and demonstrations; for these men know not who Moses is, nor Esaias,
nor the Gospels, nor Paul.</p>
<p>11. Turn now to the Samaritans, who, receiving the Law only, allow not the Prophets.
To them the text just now read from Ezekiel appears of no force, for, as I said, they admit
no Prophets; whence then shall we persuade the Samaritans also? Let us go to the writings
of the Law. Now God says to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob2263;
this must mean of those who have being and subsistence. For if Abraham has come to an
end, and Isaac and Jacob, then He is the God of those who have no being. When did a king
ever say, I am the king of soldiers, whom he had not? When did any display wealth which
he possessed not? Therefore Abraham and Isaac and Jacob must subsist, that God may be
the God of those who have being; for He said not, “I was their God,” but I am. And that
there is a judgment, Abraham shews in saying to the Lord, He who judgeth all the earth,
shall He not execute judgment2264?</p>
<p>12. But to this the foolish Samaritans object again, and say that the souls possibly of
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob continue, but that their bodies cannot possibly rise again.
Was it then possible that the rod of righteous Moses should become a serpent, and is it impossible
that the bodies of the righteous should live and rise again? And was that done
contrary to nature, and shall they not be restored according to nature? Again, the rod of
Aaron, though cut off and dead, budded, without the scent of waters2265, and though under
a roof, sprouted forth into blossoms as in the fields; and though set in dry places, yielded in
one night the flowers and fruit of plants watered for many years. Did Aaron’s rod rise, as
it were, from the dead, and shall not Aaron himself be raised? And did God work wonders
in wood, to secure to him the high-priesthood, and will He not vouchsafe a resurrection to
Aaron himself? A woman also was made salt contrary to nature; and flesh was turned into
salt; and shall not flesh be restored to flesh? Was Lot’s wife made a pillar of salt, and shall

<pb n="360"/>
not Abraham’s wife be raised again? By what power was Moses’ hand changed, which even
within one hour became as snow, and was restored again? Certainly by God’s command.
Was then His command of force then, and has it no force now?</p>
<p>13. And whence in the beginning came man into being at all, O ye Samaritans, most
senseless of all men? Go to the first book of the Scripture, which even you receive; And God
formed man of the dust of the ground2266. Is dust transformed into flesh, and shall not flesh
be again restored to flesh? You must be asked too, whence the heavens had their being, and
earth, and seas? Whence sun, and moon, and stars? How from the waters were made the
things which fly and swim? And how from earth all its living things? Were so many myriads
brought from nothing into being, and shall we men, who bear God’s image, not be raised
up? Truly this course is full of unbelief, and the unbelievers are much to be condemned;
when Abraham addresses the Lord as the Judge of all the earth, and the learners of the Law
disbelieve; when it is written that man is of the earth, and the readers disbelieve it2267.</p>
<p>14. These questions, therefore, are for them, the unbelievers: but the words of the
Prophets are for us who believe. But since some who have also used the Prophets believe
not what is written, and allege against us that passage, The ungodly shall not rise up in
judgment2268, and, For if man go down to the grave he shall come up no more2269, and, The
dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord2270,—for of what is well written, they have made ill use—it
will be well in a cursory manner, and as far as is now possible, to meet them. For if it is said,
that the ungodly shall not rise up in judgment, this shews that they shall rise, not in judgment,
but in condemnation; for God needs not long scrutiny, but close on the resurrection of the
ungodly follows also their punishment. And if it is said, The dead shall not praise Thee, O
Lord, this shews, that since in this life only is the appointed time for repentance and pardon,
for which they who enjoy it shall praise the Lord, it remains not after death for them who
have died in sins to give praise as the receivers of a blessing, but to bewail themselves; for
praise belongs to them who give thanks, but to them who are under the scourge, lamentation.
Therefore the just then offer praise; but they who have died in sins have no further season
for confession2271.</p>

<p>15. And respecting that passage, If a man go down to the grave, he shall come up no
more, observe what follows, for it is written, He shall come up no more, neither shall he return
to his own house. For since the whole world shall pass away, and every house shall be destroyed,
how shall he return to his own house, there being henceforth a new and different
earth? But they ought to have heard Job, saying, For there is hope of a tree; for if it be cut
down, it will sprout again, and the tender branch thereof will not cease. For though the root
thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the rocky ground; yet from the scent
of water it will bud, and bring forth a crop like a new plant. But man when he dies, is gone;
and when mortal man falls, is he no more2272? As it were remonstrating and reproving (for
thus ought we to read the words is no more with an interrogation2273); he says since a tree
falls and revives, shall not man, for whom all trees were made, himself revive? And that
thou mayest not suppose that I am forcing the words, read what follows; for after saying by
way of question, When mortal man falls, is he no more? he says, For if a man die, he shall
live again2274; and immediately he adds, I will wait till I be made again2275; and again elsewhere,
Who shall raise up on the earth my skin, which endures these things2276. And Esaias
the Prophet says, The dead men shall rise again, and they that are in the tombs shall
awake2277. And the Prophet Ezekiel now before us, says most plainly, Behold I will open
your graves, and bring you up out of your graves2278. And Daniel says, Many of them that

rending of the rocks, and how there arose many bodies of the saints which slept2280, their
graves having been opened. But specially be it remembered that Christ has been raised from
the dead2281. I speak but in passing of Elias, and the widow’s son whom he raised; of Elisseus
also, who raised the dead twice; once in his lifetime, and once after his death. For when
alive he wrought the resurrection by means of his own soul2282; but that not the souls only
of the just might be honoured, but that it might be believed that in the bodies also of the
just there lies a power, the corpse which was cast into the sepulchre of Elisseus, when it
touched the dead body of the prophet, was quickened, and the dead body of the prophet
did the work of the soul, and that which was dead and buried gave life to the dead, and
though it gave life, yet continued itself among the dead. Wherefore? Lest if Elisseus should
rise again, the work should be ascribed to his soul alone; and to shew, that even though the
soul is not present, a virtue resides in the body of the saints, because of the righteous soul
which has for so many years dwelt in it, and used it as its minister2283. And let us not foolishly
disbelieve, as though this thing had not happened: for if handkerchiefs and aprons,
which are from without, touching the bodies of the diseased, raised up the sick, how much
more should the very body of the Prophet raise the dead?</p>
<p>17. And with respect to these instances we might say much, rehearsing in detail the
marvellous circumstances of each event: but as you have been already wearied both by the

Paul raised Eutychus in Troas; and thus did all the other Apostles, even though the wonders
wrought by each have not all been written. Further, remember all the sayings in the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, which Paul wrote against them who said, How are the dead raised,
and with what manner of body do they come2286? And how he says, For if the dead rise not,
then is not Christ raised2287; and how he called them fools2288, who believed not; and remember
the whole of his teaching there concerning the resurrection of the dead, and how he
wrote to the Thessalonians, But we would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
<note type="footnote">2284 ἐκ τῆς ὑπερθέσεως τῆς νηστείας τῆς παρασκευῆς, Ed. Bened. “The ecclesiastical term τῆς ὑπερθέσεως
we have rendered, according to the interpretation received among the Latins, by the word ‘superpositio.’ The
ancients meant by it a fast continued for two or three days without food. Moreover, since the great week was
observed with severer fastings, there were many who passed either the whole week or four, three, or two days,
namely the Preparation and the Holy Sabbath (Easter Eve), entirely fasting as is testified by S. Irenæus (Euseb.
Hist. V. 24) and others. The continuance of the fast throughout the Friday and Saturday was highly approved,
as may be seen from the Apostolical Constitutions, V. 18.” The passage referred to is as follows: “Do you
therefore fast on the days of the Passover, beginning from the second day of the week until the Preparation and
the Sabbath, six days, making use only of bread, and salt, and herbs, and water for your drink: but abstain on
these days from wine and flesh, for they are days of lamentation and not of fasting. Do ye who are able fast
throughout the Preparation and the Sabbath entirely, tasting nothing till the cockcrowing at night; but if any
one is not able to combine them both, let the Sabbath at least be observed.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2285 The fast of the Great Sabbath was to be continued through the night, as prescribed in the Apost. Const.
V. 19: “Continue until cock-crowing and break off your fast at dawn of the first day of the week, which is the
Lord’s day, keeping awake from evening until cock-crowing: and assembling together in the Church, watch
and pray and beseech God, in your night-long vigil, reading the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, until the
crowing of the cocks: and after baptizing your Catechumens, and reading the Gospel in fear and trembling, and
speaking to the people the things pertaining to salvation, so cease from your mourning.” A chief reason for the
watching was that Christ was expected to return at the same hour in which He rose. On the meaning of “superposition”
see Routh’s note on the Synodical Epistle of Irenæus to Victor of Rome (Rell. Sac. ii. p. 45, ss.), and

them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as the rest which have no hope2289, and all
that follows: but chiefly that, And the dead in Christ shall rise first2290.</p>
<p>18. But especially mark this, how very pointedly2291 Paul says, For this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality2292. For this body shall be
raised not remaining weak as now; but raised the very same body, though by putting on
incorruption it shall be fashioned anew2293,—as iron blending with fire becomes fire, or
rather as He knows how, the Lord who raises us. This body therefore shall be raised, but it
shall abide not such as it now is, but an eternal body; no longer needing for its life such
nourishment as now, nor stairs for its ascent, for it shall be made spiritual, a marvellous
thing, such as we cannot worthily speak of. Then, it is said, shall the righteous shine forth
as the sun2294, and the moon, and as the brightness of the firmament2295. And God, foreknowing
men’s unbelief, has given to little worms in the summer to dart beams of light from
their body2296, that from what is seen, that which is looked for might be believed; for He
who gives in part is able to give the whole also, and He who made the worm radiant with
light, will much more illuminate a righteous man.</p>
<p>19. We shall be raised therefore, all with our bodies eternal, but not all with bodies
alike: for if a man is righteous, he will receive a heavenly body, that he may be able worthily
to hold converse with Angels; but if a man is a sinner, he shall receive an eternal body, fitted
to endure the penalties of sins, that he may burn eternally in fire, nor ever be consumed2297.
And righteously will God assign this portion to either company; for we do nothing without
the body. We blaspheme with the mouth, and with the mouth we pray. With the body we
commit fornication, and with the body we keep chastity. With the hand we rob, and by the
hand we bestow alms; and the rest in like manner. Since then the body has been our minister
in all things, it shall also share with us in the future the fruits of the past2298.</p>

<p>20. Therefore, brethren, let us be careful of our bodies, nor misuse them as though not
our own. Let us not say like the heretics, that this vesture of the body belongs not to us, but
let us be careful of it as our own; for we must give account to the Lord of all things done
through the body. Say not, none seeth me; think not, that there is no witness of the deed.
Human witness oftentimes there is not; but He who fashioned us, an unerring witness, abides
faithful in heaven2299, and beholds what thou doest. And the stains of sin also remain in
the body; for as when a wound has gone deep into the body, even if there has been a healing,
the scar remains, so sin wounds soul and body, and the marks of its scars remain in all; and
they are removed only from those who receive the washing of Baptism. The past wounds
therefore of soul and body God heals by Baptism; against future ones let us one and all
jointly guard ourselves, that we may keep this vestment of the body pure, and may not for
practising fornication and sensual indulgence or any other sin for a short season, lose the
salvation of heaven, but may inherit the eternal kingdom of God; of which may God, of His
own grace, deem all of you worthy.</p>
<p>21. Thus much in proof of the Resurrection of the dead; and now, let me again recite
to you the profession of the faith, and do you with all diligence pronounce it while I speak2300,
and remember it.</p>
<p>22. The Faith which we rehearse contains in order the following, “And in one Baptism
of repentance for the remission of sins; and in one Holy Catholic Church; and in the resurrection
of the flesh; and in eternal life.” Now of Baptism and repentance I have spoken in
the earliest Lectures; and my present remarks concerning the resurrection of the dead have
been made with reference to the Article “In the resurrection of the flesh.” Now then let me
finish what still remains to be said for the Article, “In one Holy Catholic Church,” on which,
though one might say many things, we will speak but briefly.</p>
<p>23. It is called Catholic then because it extends over all the world, from one end of the
earth to the other; and because it teaches universally and completely one and all the doctrines
which ought to come to men’s knowledge, concerning things both visible and invisible,
heavenly and earthly2301; and because it brings into subjection to godliness the whole race

<note type="footnote">2300 Cat. V. 12, notes 7 and 4. Cf. Plat. Theaet. 204 C: ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστης λέξεως, “each time we speak.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2301 Bishop Lightfoot (Ignatius, ad Smyrnæos, viii.) traces the original and later senses of the word “Catholic”
very fully. “In its earliest usages, therefore, as a fluctuating epithet of ἐκκλησία, ‘catholic’ means ‘universal,’ as
opposed to ‘individual,’ ‘particular.’ In its later sense, as a fixed attribute, it implies orthodoxy as opposed to
heresy, conformity as opposed to dissent.” Commenting on this passage of Cyril, the Bishop adds that “these
two latter reasons, that it (the Church) is comprehensive in doctrine, and that it is universal in application, can
only be regarded as secondary glosses.”</note>

<pb n="366"/>
of mankind, governors and governed, learned and unlearned; and because it universally
treats and heals the whole class of sins, which are committed by soul or body, and possesses
in itself every form of virtue which is named, both in deeds and words, and in every kind
of spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>24. And it is rightly named (Ecclesia) because it calls forth2302 and assembles together
all men; according as the Lord says in Leviticus, And make an assembly for all the congregation
at the door of the tabernacle of witness2303. And it is to be noted, that the word assemble, is
used for the first time in the Scriptures here, at the time when the Lord puts Aaron into the
High-priesthood. And in Deuteronomy also the Lord says to Moses, Assemble the people
unto Me, and let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me2304. And he again
mentions the name of the Church, when he says concerning the Tables, And on them were
written all the words which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire
in the day of the Assembly2305; as if he had said more plainly, in the day in which ye were
called and gathered together by God. The Psalmist also says, I will give thanks unto Thee,
O Lord, in the great Congregation; I will praise Thee among much people2306.</p>
<p>25. Of old the Psalmist sang, Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, (ye that
are) from the fountains of Israel2307. But after the Jews for the plots which they made against
the Saviour were cast away from His grace, the Saviour built out of the Gentiles a second
Holy Church, the Church of us Christians, concerning which he said to Peter, And upon
this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it2308. And
David prophesying of both these, said plainly of the first which was rejected, I have hated
the Congregation of evil doers2309; but of the second which is built up he says in the same
Psalm, Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thine house2310; and immediately afterwards, In the
Congregations will I bless thee, O Lord2311. For now that the one Church in Judæa is cast
off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the world; and of them it is said in the
Psalms, Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints2312. Agreeably

to which the prophet also said to the Jews, I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord
Almighty2313; and immediately afterwards, For from the rising of the sun even unto the going
down of the same, My name is glorified among the Gentiles2314. Concerning this Holy
Catholic Church Paul writes to Timothy, That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
thyself in the House of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the pillar and ground of
the truth2315.</p>
<p>26. But since the word Ecclesia is applied to different things (as also it is written of the
multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the
Assembly2316), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a Church of evil doers,
I mean the meetings of the heretics, the Marcionists and Manichees, and the rest, for this
cause the Faith has securely delivered to thee now the Article, “And in one Holy Catholic
Church;” that thou mayest avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy
Church Catholic in which thou wast regenerated. And if ever thou art sojourning in cities,
inquire not simply where the Lord’s House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt
to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the
Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all,
which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God (for it is written,
As Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for it2317, and all the rest,) and is a figure
and copy of Jerusalem which is above, which is free, and the mother of us all2318; which before
was barren, but now has many children.</p>
<p>27. For when the first Church was cast off, in the second, which is the Catholic Church,
God hath set, as Paul says, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles,
then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues2319, and every sort of virtue,
I mean wisdom and understanding, temperance and justice, mercy and loving-kindness,
and patience unconquerable in persecutions. She, by the armour of righteousness on the
right hand and on the left, by honour and dishonour2320, in former days amid persecutions
and tribulations crowned the holy martyrs with the varied and blooming chaplets of patience,
and now in times of peace by God’s grace receives her due honours from kings and those
who are in high place2321, and from every sort and kindred of men. And while the kings of

particular nations have bounds set to their authority, the Holy Church Catholic alone extends
her power without limit over the whole world; for God, as it is written, hath made her border
peace2322. But I should need many more hours for my discourse, if I wished to speak of all
things which concern her.</p>
<p>28. In this Holy Catholic Church receiving instruction and behaving ourselves virtuously,
we shall attain the kingdom of heaven, and inherit eternal life; for which also we endure all
toils, that we may be made partakers thereof from the Lord. For ours is no trifling aim, but
our endeavour is for eternal life. Wherefore in the profession of the Faith, after the words,
“And in the resurrection of the flesh,” that is, of the dead (of which we have discoursed),
we are taught to believe also “in the life eternal,” for which as Christians we are striving.</p>
<p>29. The real and true life then is the Father, who through the Son in the Holy Spirit
pours forth as from a fountain His heavenly gifts to all; and through His love to man, the
blessings of the life eternal are promised without fail to us men also. We must not disbelieve
the possibility of this, but having an eye not to our own weakness but to His power, we must
believe; for with God all things are possible. And that this is possible, and that we may look
for eternal life, Daniel declares, And of the many righteous shall they shine as the stars for
ever and ever2323. And Paul says, And so shall we be ever with the Lord2324: for the being
for ever with the Lord implies the life eternal. But most plainly of all the Saviour Himself
says in the Gospel, And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
life eternal2325.</p>
<p>30. And many are the proofs concerning the life eternal. And when we desire to gain
this eternal life, the sacred Scriptures suggest to us the ways of gaining it; of which, because
of the length of our discourse, the texts we now set before you shall be but few, the rest being
left to the search of the diligent. They declare at one time that it is by faith; for it is written,
He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life2326, and what follows; and again He says
Himself, Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth Him that sent
Me, hath eternal life2327, and the rest. At another time, it is by the preaching of the Gospel;
for He says, that He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal2328.
At another time, by martyrdom and confession in Christ’s name; for He says, And he that

hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal2329. And again, by preferring Christ
to riches or kindred; And every one that hath forsaken brethren, or sisters2330, and the rest,
shall inherit eternal life. Moreover it is by keeping the commandments, Thou shalt not
commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill2331, and the rest which follow; as He answered to him
that came to Him, and said, Good Master, what shall I do that I may have eternal life2332?
But further, it is by departing from evil works, and henceforth serving God; for Paul says,
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
sanctification, and the end eternal life2333.</p>
<p>31. And the ways of finding eternal life are many, though I have passed over them by
reason of their number. For the Lord in His loving-kindness has opened, not one or two
only, but many doors, by which to enter into the life eternal, that, as far as lay in Him, all
might enjoy it without hindrance. Thus much have we for the present spoken within compass
concerning the life eternal, which is the last doctrine of those professed in the Faith, and its
termination; which life may we all, both teachers and hearers, by God’s grace enjoy!</p>
<p>32. And now, brethren beloved, the word of instruction exhorts you all, to prepare your
souls for the reception of the heavenly gifts. As regards the Holy and Apostolic Faith delivered
to you to profess, we have spoken through the grace of the Lord as many Lectures,
as was possible, in these past days of Lent; not that this is all we ought to have said, for many
are the points omitted; and these perchance are thought out better by more excellent
teachers. But now the holy day of the Passover is at hand, and ye, beloved2334 in Christ, are
to be enlightened by the Laver of regeneration. Ye shall therefore again be taught what is
requisite, if God so will; with how great devotion and order you must enter in when
summoned, for what purpose each of the holy mysteries of Baptism is performed, and with
what reverence and order you must go from Baptism to the Holy Altar of God, and enjoy
its spiritual and heavenly mysteries; that your souls being previously enlightened by the
word of doctrine, ye may discover in each particular the greatness of the gifts bestowed on
you by God.</p>
<p>33. And after Easter’s Holy Day of salvation, ye shall come on each successive day, beginning
from the second day of the week, after the assembly into the Holy Place of the Re-

next, how ye were cleansed from your sins by the Lord, by the washing of water with
the word2336,—and how like Priests ye have become partakers of the Name of Christ,—and
how the Seal of the fellowship of the Holy Ghost was given to you,—and concerning the
mysteries at the Altar of the New Testament, which have taken their beginning from this

And there is now the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord2338; and the Prophet cries, Ho, ye that thirst, come ye to the water2339; and immediately
afterwards, Hearken unto me, and ye shall eat that which is good, and your soul shall delight
itself in good things2340. And within a little while ye shall hear that excellent lesson which
says, Shine, shine, O thou new Jerusalem; for thy light is come2341. Of this Jerusalem the
prophet hath said, And afterwards thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, Zion, the
faithful mother of cities2342; because of the law which went forth out of Zion, and the word
of the Lord from Jerusalem2343, which word has from hence been showered forth on the

nature, and doves, from their purity). And again, she says, Who knoweth such things? or

grace, wherein He abounded towards us2352, and what follows; and again, But God being rich

man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to His
mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,
which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified by His
grace, we might be made heirs, according to hope, of eternal life2354. And may God Himself
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give unto you a spirit of wisdom and
revelation in the knowledge of Himself, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened2355,

TO THE NEWLY BAPTIZED2357.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<head>Lecture XIX.</head>
<head>First Lecture on the Mysteries.</head>
<p>With a Lesson from the First General Epistle of Peter, beginning at Be sober, be vigilant, to
the end of the Epistle.</p>
<p>1. I have long been wishing, O true-born and dearly beloved children of the Church,
to discourse to you concerning these spiritual and heavenly Mysteries; but since I well knew
that seeing is far more persuasive than hearing, I waited for the present season; that finding
you more open to the influence of my words from your present experience, I might lead
you by the hand into the brighter and more fragrant meadow of the Paradise before us; especially
as ye have been made fit to receive the more sacred Mysteries, after having been
found worthy of divine and life-giving Baptism2358. Since therefore it remains to set before
you a table of the more perfect instructions, let us now teach you these things exactly, that
ye may know the effect2359 wrought upon you on that evening of your baptism.</p>
<note type="footnote">2357 THIS GENERAL TITLE OF THE FIVE FOLLOWING LECTURES IS OMITTED IN MANY MSS. “IN
COD. OTTOB. AT THE END OF THE SPECIAL TITLE OF THIS FIRST MYSTAGOGIC LECTURE, AFTER
THE WORDS “TO THE END OF THE EPISTLE,” THERE FOLLOWS THE STATEMENT “OF THE SAME
AUTHOR CYRIL, AND OF JOHN THE BISHOP” (BENED. ED.). SEE INDEX, AUTHENTICITY.</note>

read τῶν.…γεγενημένων, which Grodecq either read or substituted” (Ben. Ed.). With the proposed reading the
meaning would be—“the significance of the things done to you,” which agrees better with the meaning of
ἔμφασις.</note>

<p>2. First ye entered into the vestibule2360 of the Baptistery, and there facing towards the
West ye listened to the command to stretch forth your hand, and as in the presence of Satan
ye renounced him. Now ye must know that this figure is found in ancient history. For when
Pharaoh, that most bitter and cruel tyrant, was oppressing the free and high-born people
of the Hebrews, God sent Moses to bring them out of the evil bondage of the Egyptians.
Then the door posts were anointed with the blood of a lamb, that the destroyer might flee
from the houses which had the sign of the blood; and the Hebrew people was marvellously
delivered. The enemy, however, after their rescue, pursued after them2361, and saw the sea
wondrously parted for them; nevertheless he went on, following close in their footsteps, and
was all at once overwhelmed and engulphed in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>3. Now turn from the old to the new, from the figure to the reality. There we have
Moses sent from God to Egypt; here, Christ, sent forth from His Father into the world:
there, that Moses might lead forth an afflicted people out of Egypt; here, that Christ might
rescue those who are oppressed in the world under sin: there, the blood of a lamb was the
spell against2362 the destroyer; here, the blood of the Lamb without blemish Jesus Christ is
made the charm to scare2363 evil spirits: there, the tyrant was pursuing that ancient people
even to the sea; and here the daring and shameless spirit, the author of evil, was following
thee even to the very streams of salvation. The tyrant of old was drowned in the sea; and
this present one disappears in the water of salvation.</p>
<p>4. But nevertheless thou art bidden to say, with arm outstretched towards him as though
he were present, “I renounce thee, Satan.” I wish also to say wherefore ye stand facing to
the West; for it is necessary. Since the West is the region of sensible darkness, and he being
darkness has his dominion also in darkness, therefore, looking with a symbolical meaning
towards the West, ye renounce that dark and gloomy potentate. What then did each of you
stand up and say? “I renounce thee, Satan,”—thou wicked and most cruel tyrant! meaning,
“I fear thy might no longer; for that Christ hath overthrown, having partaken with me of
<note type="footnote">2360 τὁν προαύλιον, called below in § 11 “the outer chamber.” Cf. Procat. § 1, note 3. It appears from Tertullian,
De Corona, § 3, that the renunciation was made first in the Church, and afterwards in the Baptistery:
“When we are going to enter the water, at that moment as well as just before in the Church under the hand of
the President, we solemnly profess that we disown the devil, and his pomp, and his angels.”</note>

is Transitive in 2 Macc. ix. 4, as well as in Xenophon and Demosthenes. The application of the blood of Christ
in Baptism is represented by marking the sign of the Cross on the forehead. Compare the lines of Prudentius
quoted by the Benedictine Editor: “Passio quæ nostram defendit sanguine frontem, Corporeamque domum
signato collinit ore.”</note>

flesh and blood, that through these He might by death destroy death2364, that I might not
be made subject to bondage for ever.” “I renounce thee,”—thou crafty and most subtle serpent.
“I renounce thee,”—plotter as thou art, who under the guise of friendship didst contrive
all disobedience, and work apostasy in our first parents. “I renounce thee, Satan,”—the artificer
and abettor of all wickedness.</p>
<p>5. Then in a second sentence thou art taught to say, “and all thy works.” Now the works
of Satan are all sin, which also thou must renounce;—just as one who has escaped a tyrant
has surely escaped his weapons also. All sin therefore, of every kind, is included in the works
of the devil. Only know this; that all that thou sayest, especially at that most thrilling hour,
is written in God’s books; when therefore thou doest any thing contrary to these promises,
thou shalt be judged as a transgressor2365. Thou renouncest therefore the works of Satan;
I mean, all deeds and thoughts which are contrary to reason.</p>
<p>6. Then thou sayest, “And all his pomp2366.” Now the pomp of the devil is the madness
of theatres2367, and horse-races, and hunting, and all such vanity: from which that holy
man praying to be delivered says unto God, Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity2368.
Be not interested in the madness of the theatre, where thou wilt behold the wanton gestures
of the players2369, carried on with mockeries and all unseemliness, and the frantic dancing

were opened and also to any grand ceremony or pageant.</note>
<note type="footnote">2367 θεατρομανίαι. Cf. Tertull. Apologet. 38; “We renounce all your spectacles.…Among us nothing is ever
said, or seen, or heard, which has anything in common with the madness of the Circus, the immodesty of the
theatre, the atrocities of the arena, the useless exercises of the wrestling-ground.” He calls the theatre “that citadel
of all impurities,” De Spectaculis, c. 10, “immodesty’s peculiar abode,” c. 17, and gives a vivid description of the
rage and fury of the Circus in c. 16.</note>

<note type="footnote">2369 μίμων, the name either of a species of low comedy, “consisting more of gestures and mimicry than of

of the mimes is more than justified by the impartial testimony of Ovid, Trist. ii. 497: “Quid si scripsissem mimos
obscoena jocantes, Qui semper vetiti crimen amoris habent; In quibus assidue cultus procedit adulter, Verbaque
dat stulto callida nupta viro. Nubilis hos virgo, matronaque, virque, puerque Spectat, et e magna parte Senatus
adest. Nec satis incestis temerari vocibus aures; Assuescunt oculi multa pudenda pati.” A theatre is mentioned
as one of the buildings erected by Hadrian in his new City Aelia Capitolina built on the site of Jerusalem; and
that theatrical performances were continued in the time of Cyril we know from the accusation that in a time of
famine he had sold one of the Church vestments, which was afterwards used upon the stage.</note>

of effeminate men2370;—nor in the madness of them who in hunts2371 expose themselves
to wild beasts, that they may pamper their miserable appetite; who, to serve their belly with
meats, become themselves in reality meat for the belly of untamed beasts; and to speak justly,
for the sake of their own god, their belly, they cast away their life headlong in single combats2372.
Shun also horse-races, that frantic and soul-subverting spectacle2373. For all these
are the pomp of the devil.</p>
<p>7. Moreover, the things which are hung up at idol festivals2374, either meat or bread,
or other such things polluted by the invocation of the unclean spirits, are reckoned in the
pomp of the devil. For as the Bread and Wine of the Eucharist before the invocation of the
Holy and Adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, while after the invocation the Bread
becomes the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood of Christ2375, so in like manner such
meats belonging to the pomp of Satan, though in their own nature simple, become profane
by the invocation of the evil spirit.</p>

Apologet. § 42: “I do not recline in public at the feast of Bacchus, after the manner of the beast-fighters at their
last banquet.” Ib. § 9: “Those also who dine on the flesh of wild beasts from the arena, who have keen appetites
for bear and stag.” These latter, however, were chiefly the poor, to whom flesh was a rarity: Apuleius Metam.
iv. 14, quoted by Oehler.</note>
<note type="footnote">2373 ψυχὰς ἐκτραχήλιζον, an allusion to the risk of a broken neck in the chariot-race. Tertull. de Spectaculis,
§ 9: “Equestrianism was formerly practised in a simple way on horseback, and certainly its ordinary use was
innocent: but when it was dragged into the games, it passed from a gift of God into the service of demons.”
The presiding deity of the chariot-race was Poseidon (Hom. Il. xxiii, 307; Pind. Ol. i. 63; Pyth. vi. 50; Soph. OEdip.
Col. 712), and both this and the other shows of the Circus, and of the theatre, were connected with the worship
of the gods of Greece and Rome, and therefore forbidden as idolatrous: “What high religious rites, what sacrifices
precede, intervene, and follow, how many guilds, how many priesthoods, how many services are set astir” (Tert.
de Spect. § 7).</note>
<note type="footnote">2374 πανηγύρεσι. The Panegyris was strictly a religious festival, but was commonly accompanied by a great
fair or market, in which were sold not only such things as the worshippers might need for their offerings, e.g.
frankincense, but also the flesh of the animals which had been sacrificed. Cf. Dictionary of Greek and Rom.
Antiq. “Panegyris.” Tertull. Apolog. § 42: “We do not go to your spectacles: yet the articles that are sold there,
if I need them, I shall obtain more readily at their proper places. We certainly buy no frankincense.”</note>

doctrine, see notes on Cat. xxii.</note>

<p>8. After this thou sayest, “and all thy service2376.” Now the service of the devil is prayer
in idol temples; things done in honour of lifeless idols; the lighting of lamps2377, or burning
of incense by fountains or rivers2378, as some persons cheated by dreams or by evil spirits
do <del>resort to this2379</del>, thinking to find a cure even for their bodily ailments. Go not after
such things. The watching of birds, divination, omens, or amulets, or charms written on
leaves, sorceries, or other evil arts2380, and all such things, are services of the devil; therefore
shun them. For if after renouncing Satan and associating thyself with Christ2381, thou fall
under their influence, thou shalt find2382 the tyrant more bitter; perchance, because he
treated thee of old as his own, and relieved thee from his hard bondage, but has now been
greatly exasperated by thee; so thou wilt be bereaved of Christ, and have experience of the
other. Hast thou not heard the old history which tells us of Lot and his daughters? Was
not he himself saved with his daughters, when he had gained the mountain, while his wife
became a pillar of salt, set up as a monument for ever, in remembrance of her depraved will
and her turning back. Take heed therefore to thyself, and turn not again to what is behind2383,
<note type="footnote">2376 The form of renunciation before Baptism is given in the Apostolic Constitutions, VII. 41: “I renounce
Satan, and his works, and his pomps, and his services, and his angels, and his inventions, and all things that are
under him.” Cf. Tertull. De Spectaculis, § 4: “When on entering the water, we make profession of the Christian
faith in the words of its rule, we bear public testimony that we have renounced the devil, his pomp, and his angels.”</note>

having put thine hand to the plough, and then turning back to the salt savour of this life’s
doings; but escape to the mountain, to Jesus Christ, that stone hewn without hands2384,
which has filled the world.</p>
<p>9. When therefore thou renouncest Satan, utterly breaking all thy covenant with him,
that ancient league with hell2385, there is opened to thee the paradise of God, which He
planted towards the East, whence for his transgression our first father was banished; and a
symbol of this was thy turning from West to East, the place of light2386. Then thou wert
told to say, “I believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one Baptism
of repentance2387.” Of which things we spoke to thee at length in the former Lectures, as
God’s grace allowed us.</p>
<p>10. Guarded therefore by these discourses, be sober. For our adversary the devil, as was
just now read, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour2388. But though
in former times death was mighty and devoured, at the holy Laver of regeneration God has
wiped away every tear from off all faces2389. For thou shalt no more mourn, now that thou
hast put off the old man; but thou shalt keep holy-day2390, clothed in the garment of salvation2391,
even Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Romans vi. 3–14</p>
<p>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His
death? U+0026c <gap reason="omitted"/> for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.</p>
<p>1. These daily introductions into the Mysteries2393, and new instructions, which are
the announcements of new truths, are profitable to us; and most of all to you, who have
been renewed from an old state to a new. Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the
sequel of yesterday’s Lecture, that ye may learn of what those things, which were done by
you in the inner chamber2394, were symbolical.</p>
<p>2. As soon, then, as ye entered, ye put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting
off the old man with his deeds2395. Having stripped yourselves, ye were naked; in this also
imitating Christ, who was stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness put off from
Himself the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the tree2396. For
since the adverse powers made their lair in your members, ye may no longer wear that old
garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the old man, which waxeth corrupt in the
lusts of deceit2397. May the soul which has once put him off, never again put him on, but
say with the Spouse of Christ in the Song of Songs, I have put off my garment, how shall I
put it on2398? O wondrous thing! ye were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed2399;
for truly ye bore the likeness of the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and
was not ashamed.</p>
<note type="footnote">2393 μυσταγωγίαι.</note>
<note type="footnote">2394 The renunciation and the profession of faith were made in the outer chamber or vestibule of the Baptistery.</note>
<note type="footnote">2395 Col. iii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2396 Ib. ii. 15. Cyril’s use of this passage agrees best with the interpretation that Christ, having been clothed
with the likeness of sinful flesh during His life on earth, submitted therein to the assaults of the powers of evil,
but on the Cross threw off from Himself both it and them.</note>

signify their putting off the body of sin, and the old man with his deeds.”</note>

<p>3. Then, when ye were stripped, ye were anointed with exorcised oil2400, from the very
hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.
For ye were cut off from the wild olive-tree2401, and grafted into the good one, and were
made to share the fatness of the true olive-tree. The exorcised oil therefore was a symbol
of the participation of the fatness of Christ, being a charm to drive away every trace of hostile
influence. For as the breathing of the saints, and the invocation of the Name of God, like
fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits2402, so also this exorcised oil receives such
virtue by the invocation of God and by prayer, as not only to burn and cleanse away the
traces of sins, but also to chase away all the invisible powers of the evil one.</p>
<p>4. After these things, ye were led to the holy pool2403 of Divine Baptism, as Christ was
carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was
asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
and ye made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended
again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ2404. For as our Saviour
passed three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, so you also in your first ascent

(χρῖσμα) may be a participation of the Holy Spirit, and the water a symbol of the death, and the ointment the
seal of the Covenants. But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water suffices both for anointing, and for a seal,
and for a confession of Him who died, or indeed is dying with us.” The previous anointing “with oil sanctified
by prayer” is mentioned in the Clementine Recognitions, III. c. 67, and in the Pseudo-Justin, Quæstiones ad Orthodoxos,
Qu. 137. It was not however universal, and seems to have been unknown in Africa, not being mentioned
by Clement of Alexandria (Pæd. II. c. viii. On the use of ointments), nor Tertullian, nor Augustine.</note>

was wrought in three days: and this we do, not receiving the Sacrament in silence, but while there are spoken

out of the water, represented the first day of Christ in the earth, and by your descent, the
night; for as he who is in the night, no longer sees, but he who is in the day, remains in the
light, so in the descent, as in the night, ye saw nothing, but in ascending again ye were as in
the day. And at the self-same moment ye were both dying and being born; and that Water
of salvation was at once your grave and your mother. And what Solomon spoke of others
will suit you also; for he said, in that case, There is a time to bear and a time to die2405; but
to you, in the reverse order, there was a time to die and a time to be born; and one and the
same time effected both of these, and your birth went hand in hand with your death.</p>
<p>5. O strange and inconceivable thing! we did not really die, we were not really buried,
we were not really crucified and raised again; but our imitation was in a figure, and our
salvation in reality. Christ was actually crucified, and actually buried, and truly rose again;
and all these things He has freely bestowed upon us, that we, sharing His sufferings by imitation,
might gain salvation in reality. O surpassing loving-kindness! Christ received nails
in His undefiled hands and feet, and suffered anguish; while on me without pain or toil by
the fellowship of His suffering He freely bestows salvation.</p>
<p>6. Let no one then suppose that Baptism is merely the grace of remission of sins, or
further, that of adoption; as John’s was a baptism2406 conferring only remission of sins:
whereas we know full well, that as it purges our sins, and ministers2407 to us the gift of the
Holy Ghost, so also it is the counterpart2408 of the sufferings of Christ. For this cause Paul
just now cried aloud and said, Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ
Jesus, were baptized into His death? We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into His
death2409. These words he spoke to some who were disposed to think that Baptism ministers

<note type="footnote">2406 Tertullian (De Baptismo, c. 10) denies that John’s Baptism availed for the remission of sins: “If repentance
is a thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: else if it had been celestial, it would have
given both the Holy Spirit and the remission of sins.” Cyril’s doctrine is more in accordance with the language
of the Fathers generally, and of St. Mark i. 4; Luke iii. 3.</note>

that in Rom. vi. 3, 4, there is no reference to adoption, but only to the fellowship of Christ’s Passion, and that
Cyril quotes the passage only to prove the latter, the gift of adoption being generally admitted, and therefore
not in question.</note>

to us the remission of sins, and adoption, but has not further the fellowship also, by representation,
of Christ’s true sufferings.</p>
<p>7. In order therefore that we might learn, that whatsoever things Christ endured, for
us and for our salvation2410 He suffered them in reality and not in appearance, and that we
also are made partakers of His sufferings, Paul cried with all exactness of truth, For if we
have been planted together with the likeness of His death, we shall be also with the likeness of
His resurrection. Well has he said, planted together2411. For since the true Vine was planted
in this place, we also by partaking in the Baptism of death have been planted together with
Him. And fix thy mind with much attention on the words of the Apostle. He said not, “For
if we have been planted together with His death,” but, with the likeness of His death. For in
Christ’s case there was death in reality, for His soul was really separated from His body, and
real burial, for His holy body was wrapt in pure linen; and everything happened really to
Him; but in your case there was only a likeness of death and sufferings, whereas of salvation
there was not a likeness but a reality.</p>
<p>8. Having been sufficiently instructed in these things, keep them, I beseech you, in your
remembrance; that I also, unworthy though I be, may say of you, Now I love you2412, because
ye always remember me, and hold fast the traditions, which I delivered unto you. And God,
who has presented you as it were alive from the dead2413, is able to grant unto you to walk
in newness of life2414: because His is the glory and the power, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

Coisl. Ottob. Roe, Casaub., U+0026c…But we must write χρώτων from χρῶτα, not χρῶτων from χρῶτες. Authors
use the word χρῶτα to signify the effluence of an odour. So Gregory of Nyssa takes it in his 3rd Homily on the
Song of Songs, p. 512; and S. Maximus in Question 37 on Scripture: ‘χρῶτα we say is the godliness (εὐσέβειαν)
whereby S. Paul was to the one a savour of life unto life.’…In the Procatechesis, § 15, Cyril calls the waters of
Baptism ὑδάτων χριστοφόρων ἐχόντων εὐωδίαν. If however any one prefers the reading φώτων, he may defend
himself by the authority of Epiphanius, who in the Exposition of the Faith, c. 15, says that Christ descending
into the water gave rather than received,.…illuminating them, and empowering them for a type of what was to
be accomplished in Him.” According to the Ebionite Gospel of St. Matthew in Epiphanius (Hær. xxx. Ebionitæ.
c. 13), when Jesus came up out of the water a great light shone around the place: a tradition to which the Benedictine
Editor thinks the reading φώτων may refer. Justin M. (Dialog. c. lxxxviii.): “When Jesus had stepped
into the water, a fire was kindled in the Jordan.” Otto quotes the legend, as found in Orac. Sibyll. vii. 81–83:—</note>

Godhead to the waters, He came up from them; and the Holy Ghost in the fulness of His
being2423 lighted on Him, like resting upon like2424. And to you in like manner, after you
had come up from the pool of the sacred streams, there was given an Unction2425, the antitype
of that wherewith Christ was anointed; and this is the Holy Ghost; of whom also the
blessed Esaias, in his prophecy respecting Him, said in the person of the Lord, The Spirit of
the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me: He hath sent Me to preach glad tidings
to the poor2426.</p>
<p>2. For Christ was not anointed by men with oil or material ointment, but the Father
having before appointed Him to be the Saviour of the whole world, anointed Him with the
Holy Ghost, as Peter says, Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost2427.
David also the Prophet cried, saying, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of
righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom; Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity;
therefore God even Thy God hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows2428.
And as Christ was in reality crucified, and buried, and raised, and you are in Baptism accounted
worthy of being crucified, buried, and raised together with Him in a likeness, so is
it with the unction also. As He was anointed with an ideal2429 oil of gladness, that is, with
the Holy Ghost, called oil of gladness, because He is the author of spiritual gladness, so ye
were anointed with ointment, having been made partakers and fellows of Christ.</p>

<note type="footnote">2423 οὐσιώδης ἐπιφοίησις ἐγένετο. The Benedictine Editor understands this phrase as an allusion to the
descent of the Holy Ghost on Jesus in a substantial bodily form. So Gregory Nazianzen (Orat xliv. 17), says that
the Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles οὐσιωδῶς καὶ σωματικῶς. But Anastasius Sinaita interprets οὐσιωδῶς
in this latter passage as meaning “in the essence and reality of His (Divine ) Person:” and this latter sense
agreeing with the frequent use of οὐσιωδής by Athanasius is well rendered by Canon Mason (The Relation of
Confirmation to Baptism, p. 343, “in the fulness of His being.”</note>

<p>3. But beware of supposing this to be plain ointment. For as the Bread of the Eucharist,
after the invocation of the Holy Ghost, is mere bread no longer2430, but the Body of Christ,
so also this holy ointment is no more simple ointment, nor (so to say) common, after invocation,
but it is Christ’s gift of grace, and, by the advent of the Holy Ghost, is made fit to impart
His Divine Nature2431. Which ointment is symbolically applied to thy forehead and thy
other senses2432; and while thy body is anointed with the visible ointment, thy soul is sanctified
by the Holy and life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>4. And ye were first anointed on the forehead, that ye might be delivered from the
shame, which the first man who transgressed bore about with him everywhere; and that
with unveiled face ye might reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord2433. Then on your ears;
that ye might receive the ears which are quick to hear the Divine Mysteries, of which Esaias
said, The Lord gave me also an ear to hear2434; and the Lord Jesus in the Gospel, He that
hath ears to hear let him hear2435. Then on the nostrils; that receiving the sacred ointment
ye may say, We are to God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved2436. Afterwards

<note type="footnote">2431 Χριστοῦ χάρισμα καὶ Πνεύματος ἁγίου παρουσίᾳ τῆς αὐτοῦ Θεότητος ἐνεργητικὸν γινόμενον. The
meaning of this passage seems to have been obscured by divergent views of the order and construction of the
words. In the Oxford translation, followed by Dr. Pusey (Real Presence, p. 357), the Chrism is “the gift of Christ,
and by the presence of His godhead it causes in us the Holy Ghost.” The order of the operations proper to the
two Divine Persons seems thus to be inverted. According to the Benedictine Editor, and Canon Mason (Relation
of Confirmation to Baptism, p. 344), it is “Christ’s gracious gift, and is made effectual to convey the Holy Ghost
by the presence of His own Godhead,”—i.e. apparently, the Godhead of the Holy Ghost conveys the Holy Ghost.
But according to the context “the presence” must be that of the Divine Person who has been invoked, namely
the Holy Ghost: and this is clearly expressed in the order of the words Πνεύματος ἁγίου παρουσίᾳ τῆς αὐτοῦ
θεότητος ἐνεργητικόν. The connexion of the words Πν. ἁγ. παρουσίᾳ is put beyond doubt by the Invocation
in the Liturgy of S. James quoted in Myst. V. 7, note 8. The true meaning thus seems to be that the Chrism is
Christ’s gift of grace, and imparts His Divine nature by the presence of the Holy Ghost after the Invocation.
This meaning is confirmed by the formula given in Apost. Const. vii. 44, for the consecration of the Chrism:
“Grant also now that this ointment may be made effectual in the baptized, that the sweet savour of Thy Christ
may remain firm and stable in him, and that, having died with Him, he may rise again and live with Him.” The
Chrism is thus regarded as “the Seal” which confirms the proper benefits of Baptism.</note>

on your breast; that having put on the breast-plate of righteousness, ye may stand against
the wiles of the devil2437. For as Christ after His Baptism, and the visitation of the Holy
Ghost, went forth and vanquished the adversary, so likewise ye, after Holy Baptism and the
Mystical Chrism, having put on the whole armour of the Holy Ghost, are to stand against
the power of the adversary, and vanquish it, saying, I can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me2438.</p>
<p>5. Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying
the name also by your new birth. For before you were deemed worthy of this grace, ye had
properly no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being Christians.</p>
<p>6. Moreover, you should know that in the old Scripture there lies the symbol of this
Chrism. For what time Moses imparted to his brother the command of God, and made him
High-priest, after bathing in water, he anointed him; and Aaron was called Christ or
Anointed, evidently from the typical Chrism. So also the High-priest, in advancing Solomon
to the kingdom, anointed him after he had bathed in Gihon2439. To them however these
things happened in a figure, but to you not in a figure, but in truth; because ye were truly
anointed by the Holy Ghost. Christ is the beginning of your salvation; for He is truly the
First-fruit, and ye the mass2440; but if the First-fruit be holy, it is manifest that Its holiness
will pass to the mass also.</p>
<p>7. Keep This unspotted: for it shall teach you all things, if it abide in you, as you have
just heard declared by the blessed John, discoursing much concerning this Unction2441.
For this holy thing is a spiritual safeguard of the body, and salvation of the soul. Of this the
blessed Esaias prophesying of old time said, And on this mountain,—(now he calls the
Church a mountain elsewhere also, as when he says, In the last days the mountain of the
Lord’s house shall be manifest2442;)—on this mountain shall the Lord make unto all nations
a feast; they shall drink wine, they shall drink gladness, they shall anoint themselves with
ointment2443. And that he may make thee sure, hear what he says of this ointment as being

night in which He was betrayed, took bread, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. Even of itself2445 the teaching of the Blessed Paul is sufficient to give you a full assurance
concerning those Divine Mysteries, of which having been deemed worthy, ye are become
of the same body2446 and blood with Christ. For you have just heard him say distinctly,
That our Lord Jesus Christ in the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and when He
had given thanks He brake it, and gave to His disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is My Body:
and having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, Take, drink, this is My Blood2447. Since
then He Himself declared and said of the Bread, This is My Body, who shall dare to doubt
any longer? And since He has Himself affirmed and said, This is My Blood, who shall ever
hesitate, saying, that it is not His blood?</p>

blood itself. If Cyril thus seems to teach a physical change of the wine, it must be remembered that we are not
bound to accept his view, but only to state it accurately. See however the section of the Introduction on his
Eucharistic doctrine.</note>

in the figure2452 of Bread is given to thee His Body, and in the figure of Wine His Blood;
that thou by partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, mayest be made of the same body
and the same blood with Him. For thus we come to bear Christ2453 in us, because His Body
and Blood are distributed2454 through our members; thus it is that, according to the blessed
Peter, we become partakers of the divine nature2455.</p>
<p>4. Christ on a certain occasion discoursing with the Jews said, Except ye eat My flesh
and drink My blood, ye have no life in you2456. They not having heard His saying in a spir-
itual sense were offended, and went back, supposing that He was inviting them to eat flesh.</p>
<p>5. In the Old Testament also there was shew-bread; but this, as it belonged to the Old
Testament, has come to an end; but in the New Testament there is Bread of heaven, and a
Cup of salvation, sanctifying soul and body; for as the Bread corresponds to our body, so is
the Word2457 appropriate to our soul.</p>

<note type="footnote">2451 Ben. Ed.: “That the force of Cyril’s argument may be the better understood, we must observe that in
Baptism is celebrated the marriage of Christ with the Christian soul; and that the consummation of this marriage
is perfected through the union of bodies in the mystery of the Eucharist. Read Chrysostom’s Hom. xx. in Ephes.”
Chrysostom’s words are: “In like manner therefore we become one flesh with Christ by participation
(μετουσίας).” But the participation expressed by μετουσία does not necessarily refer to the Eucharist. From
the use of the word in Cat. xxiii. 11, and in Athanasius (Contra Arianos, Or. i.; de Synodis. 19, 22, 25) the
meaning rather seems to be that we are one flesh with Christ not by nature but by His gift.</note>

<p>7. Also the blessed David shall advise thee the meaning of this, saying, Thou hast prepared
a table before me in the presence of them that afflict me2458. What he says, is to this
effect: Before Thy coming, the evil spirits prepared a table for men2459, polluted and defiled
and full of devilish influence2460; but since Thy coming. O Lord, Thou hast prepared a table
before me. When the man says to God, Thou hast prepared before me a table, what other
does he indicate but that mystical and spiritual Table, which God hath prepared for us over
against, that is, contrary and in opposition to the evil spirits? And very truly; for that had
communion with devils, but this, with God. Thou hast anointed my head with oil2461. With
oil He anointed thine head upon thy forehead, for the seal which thou hast of God; that
thou mayest be made the engraving of the signet, Holiness unto God2462. And thy cup intoxicateth
me, as very strong2463. Thou seest that cup here spoken of, which Jesus took in His
hands, and gave thanks, and said, This is My blood, which is shed for many for the remission
of sins2464.</p>
<note type="footnote">says, in Cat. xxiii. 15, that the Eucharistic food is “appointed for the substance of the soul,” for its benefit, that
cannot be said of Christ’s body or of His soul, but only of the Word which is conjoined with both. Moreover
that the Divine Word is the food of Angels and of the soul, is a common mode of speaking with all the Fathers.
They often play on the ambiguity of this word (λόγος), saying sometimes that the Divine Word, sometimes the
word and oracles of God, are the food of our souls: both statements are true. For the whole life-giving power
of the Eucharist is derived from the Word of God united to the flesh which He assumed: and the whole benefit
of Eucharistic eating consists in the union of our soul with the Word, in meditation on His mysteries and sayings,
and conformity thereto.”</note>

<p>8. Therefore Solomon also, hinting at this grace, says in Ecclesiastes, Come hither, eat
thy bread with joy (that is, the spiritual bread; Come hither, he calls with the call to salvation
and blessing), and drink thy wine with a merry heart (that is, the spiritual wine); and let oil
be poured out upon thy head (thou seest he alludes even to the mystic Chrism); and let thy
garments be always white, for the Lord is well pleased with thy works2465; for before thou
camest to Baptism, thy works were vanity of vanities2466. But now, having put off thy old
garments, and put on those which are spiritually white, thou must be continually robed in
white: of course we mean not this, that thou art always to wear white raiment; but thou
must be clad in the garments that are truly white and shining and spiritual, that thou mayest
say with the blessed Esaias, My soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with
a garment of salvation, and put a robe of gladness around me2467.</p>

<p>1 Pet. ii. 1</p>
<p>Wherefore putting away all filthiness, and all guile, and evil speaking2472, U+0026c. </p>
<p>1. By the loving-kindness of God ye have heard sufficiently at our former meetings
concerning Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ; and now
it is necessary to pass on to what is next in order, meaning to-day to set the crown on the
spiritual building of your edification.</p>
<p>2. Ye have seen then the Deacon who gives to the Priest water to wash2473, and to the
Presbyters who stand round God’s altar. He gave it not at all because of bodily defilement;
it is not that; for we did not enter the Church at first2474 with defiled bodies. But the
washing of hands is a symbol that ye ought to be pure from all sinful and unlawful deeds;
for since the hands are a symbol of action, by washing2475 them, it is evident, we represent
the purity and blamelessness of our conduct. Didst thou not hear the blessed David opening

<note type="footnote">2472 The text is made up from memory of James i. 21: διὸ ἀποθέμενοι πᾶσαν ῥυπαρίαν, and 1 Pet. ii. 1:

<note type="footnote">2473 In the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII. xi, this duty is assigned to a sub-deacon: “Let one of the sub-deacons
bring water to wash the hands of the priests, which is a symbol of the purity of those souls that are devoted to
God.” See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, “Lavabo.” The Priest who celebrates the Eucharist is here distinguished
by the title ἱερεύς from the other Presbyters who stood round the altar.</note>
<note type="footnote">2474 Cyril evidently refers to the custom of placing vessels of water outside the entrance of the Church.
Bingham, Antiquities, VIII. iii. 6. Chrysost. In Johannem Hom. lxxiii. 3: “Do we then wash our hands when
going into Church, and shall we not wash our hearts also?” That the same custom was observed in heathen
Temples appears from Herod. I. 51: περιῤῥαντήρια δύο ἀνέθηκε (See Bähr’s note). Compare also Joseph. Ant.

in the Liturgy of St. James.</note>

this very mystery, and saying, I will wash my hands in innocency, and so will compass Thine
Altar, O Lord2476? The washing therefore of hands is a symbol of immunity2477 from sin.</p>
<p>3. Then the Deacon cries aloud, “Receive ye one another; and let us kiss one another2478.”
Think not that this kiss is of the same character with those given in public by
common friends. It is not such: but this kiss blends souls one with another, and courts
entire forgiveness for them. The kiss therefore is the sign that our souls are mingled together,
and banish all remembrance of wrongs. For this cause Christ said, If thou art offering thy
gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against time, leave there
thy gift upon the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift2479. The kiss therefore is reconciliation, and for this reason holy: as the blessed
Paul somewhere cried, saying, Greet ye one another with a holy kiss2480; and Peter, with a
kiss of charity2481.</p>
<p>4. After this the Priest cries aloud, “Lift up your hearts2482.” For truly ought we in that
most awful hour to have our heart on high with God, and not below, thinking of earth and
earthly things. In effect therefore the Priest bids all in that hour to dismiss all cares of this

washing their hands at the Prothesis or Credence.</note>
<note type="footnote">2477 ἀνυπεύθυνος.</note>
<note type="footnote">2478 These two directions by the Deacon are separated in the Liturgy of St. James: after the dismissal of the
Catechumens, the Deacon says, “Take note one of another;” and after the Incense, Cherubic hymn, Oblation,
Creed, and a short prayer “that we may be united one to another in the bond of peace and charity,” the Deacon
says, “Let us salute (ἀγαπῶμεν) one another with a holy kiss.” In the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII. 11, there is
but one such direction, and this comes before the washing of hands and the dismissal of the Catechumens,
“Salute (ἀσπάσασθε) ye one another with a holy kiss.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2479 Matt. v. 23. From Cyril’s reference to this passage “it may be inferred that the kiss of peace had been
given before the gifts were brought to the altar, according to ancient custom attested by Justin M. Apolog. i. c.
65: ‘Having ended the prayers’ (for the newly baptized) ‘we salute one another with a kiss. Then there is brought
to the President of the brethren bread, and a cup of wine mixed with water’” (Ben. Ed.). There is the same order
in the Apost. Const. VIII. 12, and in the 19th Canon of the Synod of Laodicea; but in the Liturgy of S. James the
gifts are offered before the kiss of peace.</note>

<note type="footnote">2482 The words are slightly varied in the Liturgies: thus in the Liturgy of St. James, “Let us lift up our mind
and hearts;” in the Apost. Const. viii. 12, “Lift up your mind.”</note>

life, or household anxieties, and to have their heart in heaven with the merciful God. Then
ye answer, “We lift them up unto the Lord:” assenting to it, by your avowal. But let no one
come here, who could say with his mouth, “We lift up our hearts unto the Lord,” but in his
thoughts have his mind concerned with the cares of this life. At all times, rather, God should
be in our memory but if this is impossible by reason of human infirmity, in that hour above
all this should be our earnest endeavour.</p>
<p>5. Then the Priest says, “Let us give thanks unto the Lord.” For verily we are bound to
give thanks, that He called us, unworthy as we were, to so great grace; that He reconciled
us when we were His foes; that He vouchsafed to us the Spirit of adoption. Then ye say, “It
is meet and right:” for in giving thanks we do a meet thing and a right; but He did not right,
but more than right, in doing us good, and counting us meet for such great benefits.</p>
<p>6. After this, we make mention of heaven, and earth, and sea2483; of sun and moon; of
stars and all the creation, rational and irrational, visible and invisible; of Angels, Archangels,
Virtues, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Thrones; of the Cherubim with many faces: in
effect repeating that call of David’s Magnify the Lord with me2484. We make mention also
of the Seraphim, whom Esaias in the Holy Spirit saw standing around the throne of God,
and with two of their wings veiling their face, and with twain their feet, while with twain
they did fly, crying Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth2485. For the reason of our reciting
this confession of God2486, delivered down to us from the Seraphim, is this, that so we may
be partakers with the hosts of the world above in their Hymn of praise.</p>
<note type="footnote">2483 Compare the noble Eucharistic Preface in the Liturgy of St. James: “It is verily meet, right, becoming,
and our bounden duty to praise Thee, to sing of Thee, to bless Thee, to worship Thee, to glorify Thee, to give
thanks to Thee the Maker of every creature, visible and invisible, the Treasure of eternal blessings; the Fount of
life and immortality, the God and Lord of all, whom the heavens of heavens do praise, and all the powers
thereof, sun and moon and all the choir of the stars, earth, sea, and all that in them is, Jerusalem the heavenly
assembly, Church of the firstborn that are written in the heavens, spirits of righteous men and prophets, souls
of martyrs and Apostles. Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Authorities, and Powers
dread, also the many-eyed Cherubim, and the six-winged Seraphim, which with twain of their wings cover their
faces, and with twain their feet, and with twain do fly, crying one to another with unresting lips, in unceasing
praises, singing with loud voice the triumphant hymn of Thy majestic glory, shouting, and glorifying, and crying
aloud, and saying,—Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the
highest; blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”</note>

<p>7. Then having sanctified ourselves by these spiritual Hymns, we beseech the merciful
God to send forth His Holy Spirit upon the gifts lying before Him; that He may make the
Bread the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood of Christ2487; for whatsoever the Holy
Ghost has touched, is surely sanctified and changed.</p>
<p>8. Then, after the spiritual sacrifice, the bloodless service, is completed, over that sacrifice
of propitiation2488 we entreat God for the common peace of the Churches, for the welfare
of the world2489; for kings; for soldiers and allies; for the sick; for the afflicted; and, in a
word, for all who stand in need of succour we all pray and offer this sacrifice.</p>
<p>9. Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first Patriarchs,
Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, that at their prayers and intercessions God would receive our
petition2490. Then on behalf also of the Holy Fathers and Bishops who have fallen asleep
before us, and in a word of all who in past years have fallen asleep among us, believing that
it will be a very great benefit to the souls2491, for whom the supplication is put up, while
that holy and most awful sacrifice is set forth.</p>
<note type="footnote">2487 In the Liturgy of St. James the Triumphal Hymn is followed by the ‘Recital of the work of Redemption,’
and of ‘the Institution,’ by the ‘Great Olbation,’ and then by the ‘Invocation,’ as follows: “Have mercy upon us,
O God, after Thy great mercy, and send forth on us, and on these gifts here set before Thee, Thine all-holy
Spirit,.…that He may come, and by His holy, good, and glorious advent (παρουσίᾳ) may sanctify this Bread and
make it the holy Body of Thy Christ (Amen), and this Cup the precious Blood of Thy Christ” (Amen). In Cat.
xix. 7, Cyril calls this prayer “the holy Invocation of the Adorable Trinity,” and in xxi. 3, “the Invocation of the
Holy Ghost.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2488 See Index, “Sacrifice,” and the reference there to the Introduction. Compare Athenagoras (Apol. c. xiii.):
“What have I to do with burnt-offerings, of which God has no need? Though indeed it behoves us to bring a
bloodless sacrifice, and the reasonable service.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2489 Cyril here gives a brief summary of the “Great Intercession,” in which, according to the common text
of the Liturgy of St. James, there is a suffrage “for the peace and welfare (εὐστάθεια) of the whole world, and of
the holy Churches of God.” Mr. Hammond thinks that it has been taken from the Deacon’s Litany, and repeated
by mistake in the Great Intercession. But from Chrysostom’s language (In Ep. ad Phil. Hom. iii. p. 218; Guame,
T. xi. p. 251), we must infer that the prayer ὑπὲρ εἰρήνης καὶ εὐσταθείας τοῦ κόσμου formed part of the ‘Great
Intercession’ in his Liturgy, as it does in the Clementine (Apost. Constit. VIII. § 10).</note>
<note type="footnote">2490 In the Liturgies of St. James and St. Mark, and in the Clementine, there are similar commemorations of
departed saints, especially “patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs,” but nothing corresponding to the words,
“that at their prayers and intercessions God would receive our petition.” See Index, Prayer and Intercession.</note>
<note type="footnote">2491 So Chrysostom (In 1 Cor. Hom. 41, p. 457 A): “Not in vain was this rule ordained by the Apostles, that
in the dread Mysteries remembrance should be made of the departed: for they knew that it is a great gain to
them, and a great benefit.”</note>

<pb n="397"/>
<p>10. And I wish to persuade you by an illustration. For I know that many say, what is a
soul profited, which departs from this world either with sins, or without sins, if it be commemorated
in the prayer? For if a king were to banish certain who had given him offence,
and then those who belong to them2492 should weave a crown and offer it to him on behalf
of those under punishment, would he not grant a remission of their penalties? In the same
way we, when we offer to Him our supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though
they be sinners, weave no crown, but offer up Christ sacrificed for our sins2493, propitiating
our merciful God for them as well as for ourselves.</p>
<p>11. Then, after these things, we say that Prayer which the Saviour delivered to His own
disciples, with a pure conscience entitling God our Father, and saying, Our Father, which
art in heaven. O most surpassing loving-kindness of God! On them who revolted from
Him and were in the very extreme of misery has He bestowed such a complete forgiveness
of evil deeds, and so great participation of grace, as that they should even call Him Father.
Our Father, which art in heaven; and they also are a heaven who bear the image of the
heavenly2494, in whom is God, dwelling and walking in them2495.</p>
<p>12. Hallowed be Thy Name. The Name of God is in its nature holy, whether we say so
or not; but since it is sometimes profaned among sinners, according to the words, Through
you My Name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles2496, we pray that in us God’s
Name may be hallowed; not that it comes to be holy from not being holy, but because it
becomes holy in us, when we are made holy, and do things worthy of holiness.</p>
<p>13. Thy kingdom come. A pure soul can say with boldness, Thy kingdom come; for he
who has heard Paul saying, Let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body2497, and has
cleansed himself in deed, and thought, and word, will say to God, Thy kingdom come.</p>
<p>14. Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth. God’s divine and blessed Angels do the
will of God, as David said in the Psalm, Bless the Lord, all ye Angels of His, mighty in strength,

Thy will is done, so likewise be it done on earth in me, O Lord.”</p>
<p>15. Give us this day our substantial bread. This common bread is not substantial bread,
but this Holy Bread is substantial, that is, appointed for the substance of the soul2499. For
this Bread goeth not into the belly and is cast out into the draught2500, but is distributed into
thy whole system for the benefit of body and soul2501. But by this day, he means, “each
day,” as also Paul said, While it is called to-day2502.</p>
<p>16. And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors. For we have many sins. For
we offend both in word and in thought, and very many things we do worthy of condemnation;
and if we say that we have no sin, we lie, as John says2503. And we make a covenant with
God, entreating Him to forgive us our sins, as we also forgive our neighbours their debts.
Considering then what we receive and in return for what, let us not put off nor delay to
forgive one another. The offences committed against us are slight and trivial, and easily
settled; but those which we have committed against God are great, and need such mercy as
His only is. Take heed therefore, lest for the slight and trivial sins against thee thou shut
out for thyself forgiveness from God for thy very grievous sins.</p>
<p>17. And lead us not into temptation, O Lord. Is this then what the Lord teaches us to
pray, that we may not be tempted at all? How then is it said elsewhere, “a man untempted,
is a man unproved2504;” and again, My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations2505? But does perchance the entering into temptation mean the being over-

whelmed by the temptation? For temptation is, as it were, like a winter torrent difficult to
cross. Those therefore who are not overwhelmed in temptations, pass through, shewing
themselves excellent swimmers, and not being swept away by them at all; while those who
are not such, enter into them and are overwhelmed. As for example, Judas having entered
into the temptation of the love of money, swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and
was strangled2506 both in body and spirit. Peter entered into the temptation of the denial;
but having entered, he was not overwhelmed by it, but manfully swam through it, and was
delivered from the temptation2507. Listen again, in another place, to a company of unscathed
saints, giving thanks for deliverance from temptation, Thou, O God hast proved us; Thou
hast tried us by fire like as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst afflictions
upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and
water; and thou broughtest us out into a place of rest2508. Thou seest them speaking boldly
in regard to their having passed through and not been pierced2509. But Thou broughtest us
out into a place of rest; now their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from
temptation.</p>
<p>18. But deliver us from the evil. If Lead us not into temptation implied the not being
tempted at all, He would not have said, But deliver us from the evil. Now evil is our adversary
the devil, from whom we pray to be delivered2510. Then after completing the prayer thou
sayest, Amen2511; by this Amen, which means “So be it,” setting thy seal to the petitions of
the divinely-taught prayer.</p>
<p>19. After this the Priest says, “Holy things to holy men.” Holy are the gifts presented,
having received the visitation of the Holy Ghost; holy are ye also, having been deemed
worthy of the Holy Ghost; the holy things therefore correspond to the holy persons2512.
Then ye say, “One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ2513.” For One is truly holy, by

And having hollowed thy palm, receive the Body of Christ, saying over it, Amen. So then
after having carefully hallowed thine eyes by the touch of the Holy Body, partake of it; giving
heed lest thou lose any portion thereof2519; for whatever thou losest, is evidently a loss to
thee as it were from one of thine own members. For tell me, if any one gave thee grains of
gold, wouldest thou not hold them with all carefulness, being on thy guard against losing
any of them, and suffering loss? Wilt thou not then much more carefully keep watch, that
not a crumb fall from thee of what is more precious than gold and precious stones?</p>

<head>Section I.—The Life.</head>
<p>S. Gregory Nazianzen, called by the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus “The Great,” and
universally known as “The Theologian” or “The Divine,” a title which he shares with S. John
the Evangelist alone among the Fathers of the Church, was, like the great Basil of Cæsarea
and his brother Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, by birth a Cappadocian. He was born at Arianzus,
a country estate belonging to his father, in the neighbourhood of Nazianzus.</p>
<p>This latter, sometimes called Nazianzum, is a place quite unknown to early writers, and
derives all its importance from its connection with our Saint. The Romans seem to have
called it Diocæsarea. This would place it in the south-western portion of the district called
Cappadocia Secunda, a sub-division of the Province, which had previously included the
whole country of Cappadocia under the Prefect of Cæsarea. The Emperor Valens made the
division for financial purposes about a.d. 371, and assigned Tyana as its civil Metropolis,
and, as we shall see, thereby caused an ecclesiastical quarrel which had considerable effect
on the life of S. Gregory. Tyana was situated at no great distance south and east of Nazianzus,
which place is usually identified with some interesting ruins about eighteen miles southeast
of Ak Serai, on a rocky platform at the foot of the mountains called Hassan Dagh.
Amongst other ruined buildings here are the remains of three Byzantine churches of great
age, but more recent than the rest of the town.</p>
<p>His father, who bore the same name with himself, had originally belonged to an obscure
sect called Hypsistarians or Hypsistians, of whom we know little except what we learn from
Gregory of Nazianzus and his namesake of Nyssa. They seem to have held a sort of syncretist
doctrine, containing elements derived from heathen, Christian, and Jewish sources. They
were very strict monotheists, rejecting both polytheism and the doctrine of the Trinity, and
worshipping the One Supreme Being under the names of The Most High and The Almighty,
and the emblems of Fire and Light, but with no external cultus; for they rejected sacrifice
and every outward form of worship, holding adoration to be an exclusively interior and
spiritual act. With singular inconsistency, however, they adopted the observance of the
Jewish Sabbath, and the Levitical prohibition of certain kinds of food. They were but few
in number, and their influence was insignificant even in Cappadocia, which was the
headquarters of sect.2525 From this form of error the elder Gregory was converted by the
<note type="footnote">2525 ἐκ δύοιν ἐναντιωτάτοιν συγκεκραμένης, ἑλληνικῆς τε καὶ νομικῆς τερατείας· ὧν αμφοτέρων τὰ μέρη

<pb n="404"/>
influence of his wife, Nonna; and soon after his conversion was consecrated to the bishopric
of Nazianzus.</p>
<p>Nonna, the mother of our Saint, was the daughter of Christian parents, and had been
very carefully brought up. Like S. John Chrysostom and S. Augustine, Gregory had the in-
estimable advantage of being reared at the knee of a mother of conspicuous holiness. There
were three children of the marriage—a sister, Gorgonia, probably somewhat older than
Gregory, who was devotedly fond of her, and a brother, Cæsarius, perhaps younger, who
was a distinguished physician, and occupied a post of confidence at the Court of Constantinople.
Gregory was certainly born at a late period of the life of his mother. He tells
us that, like so many other holy men of whom we read both in the Bible and outside its
pages, he was consecrated to God by his mother even before his birth. The precise date is
uncertain. There are two lines in his poem on his own life which seem to indicate clearly
that it took place after his father’s elevation to the Episcopate, or at any rate after his ordination
to the Priesthood. Speaking of the great desire of the elder Gregory to see his son ordained
to the Priesthood, in order that he might have him as a coadjutor and aid to his own
declining years and failing strength, he gives the arguments by which the old man sought
to persuade him to take upon himself a burden which he dreaded; and among them we find
the father saying to the son:2526 “You have not been yet so long in life as I have spent in
sacrifice.” And though the Roman Catholic writers on the subject strain every nerve to get
rid of the obvious meaning, by ingenious manipulation of the text or by far-fetched interpretations,
yet the conclusion remains unshaken, and is supported also by another passage,
to be cited presently, that he was at any rate born during the Priesthood of his father. He
tells us that he left Athens in or about his thirtieth year,2527 and also that the Emperor Julian
was his contemporary there. Now Julian was at Athens in 355; so that we must place
Gregory’s birth not earlier than 325; and if we give its natural meaning to the first passage
quoted, not earlier than 330, the latest date available for his father’s consecration as Bishop.
This is not inconsistent with the Athenian chronology of his life, as he certainly spent many
years there, and probably did not leave the place till 357.</p>
<p>As soon as the children’s age permitted, Gregory and his brother Cæsarius were sent
to school at Cæsarea, under the care of a good man named Carterius, who as long as he
lived retained a great influence over the mind of his elder pupil. This is perhaps the same
Carterius who afterwards presided over the monasteries of Antioch in Syria, and was one
of the instructors of S. John Chrysostom. The following is a free rendering of one of four
funeral epigrams written in later years by our Saint in honour of his old friend and tutor:
<lg>
<l>“Whither, Carterius, best beloved of friends,</l>

<l>The words and stories of a learned age;</l>
<l>Thou who didst bind me to the uncarnal life.</l>

</lg>
</p>
<p>It was probably at Cæsarea that the acquaintance between Gregory and S. Basil the Great
began, which was afterwards to ripen into a lifelong friendship. But their association did
not last long at this period, for Basil soon went to Constantinople to continue his education,
while Gregory and his brother removed to the Palestinian Cæsarea; probably as much for
the sake of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, as for the advantage of the schools
of that learned resort. Cæsarius soon went on to Alexandria; but Gregory was tempted by
the flourishing Palestinian school of rhetoric to remain a while and study that art. One of
his fellow-students here was Euzoius, the future heresiarch. From Palestine he too went on
to Alexandria, where he found his brother enjoying an excellent character, and highly distinguished
among the students of the University. S. Athanasius was at this time the Bishop,
and Didymus head of the famous Catechetical School; but as Gregory, though one of his
orations is a panegyric on S. Athanasius, does not mention having ever met either of these
two great men, we must suppose that the former was at this time suffering one of his many
periods of exile—his second banishment lasted from 340 to 347. Gregory does not seem to
have remained very long at Alexandria; the fascination exercised on his mind by a yet more
famous seat of learning—Athens—soon drew him thither. He could not even wait for a favourable
time of year, but must start at once. He took passage in the month of November
in a ship bound for Ægina, with some of whose crew he was acquainted. They had a prosperous
voyage until they were in sight of Cyprus, when they were assailed by a tremendous
storm, and the ship, swept by the heavy seas, became waterlogged, and would not answer
her helm. At the same time the violence of the sea burst the water-tanks, and the ship’s
company were left in dire distress. Gregory, who was not yet baptized, was thrown into
terrible distress at thus finding himself in peril of death while yet outside the Covenant of
God. In earnest prayer he renewed his self-dedication, and vowed to give himself wholly

<pb n="406"/>
to the service of God, if his life might be spared to receive Holy Baptism. He tells the story
at some length and with great graphic power in his long poem on his own life, from which
we subjoin a cento,2528 and also in his oration spoken at his father’s funeral (Orat. XVIII,
c. 31, p. 352 Ed. Ben.). It is, however, uncertain whether he was baptized immediately after
this deliverance, or whether he waited till his return to Nazianzus. At any rate he reached
Athens in safety, and shortly afterwards was joined there by Basil; when the early acquaintance
which was now renewed soon deepened into an intimacy of brotherly affection, which,
though often sorely tried, never grew cold in Gregory’s heart. In the funeral oration which
<note type="footnote">2528 What time I parted from Egyptian shores, Whence I had somewhat culled of ancient lore, We weighed,
and under Cyprus cut the waves In a straight course for Hellas, when there rose A mighty strife of winds, and
shook the ship; And all was night; earth, seas, and darkened skies; And thunders echoed to the lightning’s shock.
Whistled the rigging of the swelling sails, And bent the mast; the helm had lost its power, For none could hold
it in the raging seas. The ship was filled with overwhelming waves; Mingled the shout of sailor, and the cries Of
helmsman, captain, and of passenger, And those who till that fearful hour had been Unconscious of a God; for
fear can teach. And, worst of all our dread impending woes, No water had we, for the ship began To labour, and
the beakers soon were broke Which held our treasure of sweet water scant; And famine fought with surging and
with storm To slay us. But God sent a swift release. For Punic sailors suddenly appeared, Who in their own sore
terror soon perceived By our sad cries our danger, and with oars (For they were strong) came up and saved our
barque And us, who now all but sea-corpses were; Like fish forsaken of their native wave, Or lamp that dies for
want of nourishment. But while we all were fearing sudden death, Mine was a worse, because a secret, fear. The
cleansing waters ne’er had passed on me, That slay our foe and join us to our God. This was my lamentation,
this my dread. For this I stretched my hands and cried to God, And cried above the noise of surging waves, And
rent my clothes, and lay in misery. But, though ye scarce believe it, yet ‘tis true, All those on whom our common
danger pressed Forgot themselves, and came and prayed with me. And Thou wast then, O Christ, my great defence,
Who now deliverest from the storm of life. For when no good hope dawned upon our eyes, Nor isle, nor continent,
nor mountain top, Nor torch, nor star to light the mariners, Nor small nor great of earthly things appeared,
What port was left for troubled sailor-folk? Despairing of all else, I look to thee; Life, breath, salvation, light,
and strength to men, Who frightest, smitest, smilest, healest all, And ever weavest good from human ill. I call
to mind Thy wonders of old time, By which we recognize Thy mighty hand; The sea divided—Israel’s host
brought through— Their foes defeated by Thy lifted hand— And Egypt crushed by scourges, chiefs and all—
Nature subdued, and walls thrown down by shout. And, adding mine to those old famous acts, Thine own, I
said, am I, both erst and now; Twice shalt Thou take me for Thine own, a gift Of earth and sea, a doubly hallowed
gift, By prayers of mother and by fateful sea. To Thee I live, if I escape the waves, And gain baptismal dews; and
Thou wilt lose A faithful servant if Thou cast me off, E’en now Thine own disciple, in the deep; Shake off for
me Thy slumber, and arise, And stay my fear. So prayed I—and the noise Of winds grew still, the surges ceased,
the ship Held straight upon her course; my prayer was heard.</note>

<pb n="407"/>
he pronounced over his friend, Gregory has left us a most interesting account of University
life in the middle of the fourth century, of which we give a summary here, referring the
reader for details to the oration itself, which will be found in the present volume. Basil’s
reputation, he says, preceded him to Athens, where he was received with much enthusiasm.
Many of the silliest students there are mad upon Sophists, and are divided upon the respective
merits of their teachers with as much excitement as is shown by the partisans of the various
chariots in the Hippodromes. And so a new-comer is laid hold of by them in this fashion.
First of all, he is entertained by the first who can get hold of him—either a relation or a
friend or a fellow-countryman, or a leading Sophister, who is in favour with his master, and
touts for him. There he is unmercifully chaffed, and with more or less of rough horseplay,
by everybody, to take down his pride; and is then escorted processionally through the streets
to the Baths; after which process he is regarded as free of the students’ guild. Basil, however,
through the good offices of his friend Gregory, was spared this trial of his nerves, out of respect
for his great attainments; and this kind action was the beginning of their long and affectionate
intimacy. Among the students, however, were a number of young Armenians,
some of whom had been at school with Basil, and were very jealous of him. These young
men, with the object of destroying his reputation if possible, were continually harassing him
with disputations upon hard and sophistical questions. Basil was quite able to hold his own
against them, but Gregory, jealous for the honour of his University, and not at first perceiving
the malice of these young men, sided with them and made the conflict more equal. As soon,
however, as he began to see their real purpose, he forsook them and took his stand by his
friend, whose victory was thus made not only assured but easy. The young gentlemen naturally
did not like this, and Gregory became, much to Basil’s distress, very unpopular among
them, as they chose to regard his conduct in the matter as treason against his University,
and especially against the students of his own year.</p>
<p>The city of Athens at this time was full of dangerous distractions for young men; feasts,
theatres, assemblies, wine parties, etc. Gregory and his friend resolved to renounce all these,
and to allow themselves to know only two roads—one, that which led to the Church and
its holy teachers; the other, that which took them to their University lectures. Amongst
other famous students of Gregory’s day was Prince Julian, afterwards the Emperor who
apostatized and endeavoured to restore the ancient heathenism, and galvanize it into
something like a new life. Gregory claims even at this early period to have foreseen and
dreaded the result of Julian’s accession. “I had long foreseen,” he says, “how matters would
be, from the time that I was with him at Athens. He had come there shortly after the violent
measures against his brother, having asked permission of the Emperor to do so. He had
two reasons for this sojourn—the one more honest, namely, to visit Greece and its schools,
the other more secret and known only to a few persons, namely, to consult with the heathen
priests and charlatans about his plans, because his wickedness was not as yet declared. Even

<pb n="408"/>
then I made no bad guess about the man, although I am not one of those skilled in such
matters; but I was made a prophet by the unevenness of his disposition and the very unsettled
condition of his mind. I used these very words about him: ‘What an evil the Roman State
is nourishing,’ though I prefaced them with a wish that I might prove a false prophet.”
(Orat. V. 23, 24.) Gregory must have been a long time at Athens. He seems to have gone
there at about the age of eighteen, and not to have left till he was past thirty. Basil left before
him and returned to Cappadocia, and as soon as he could follow he went to Constantinople,
where he met his brother, who had just come there to practice as a Court Physician, but
resolved to throw up his practice and return with his brother to Nazianzus. They found
their parents still living and their father occupying the Episcopal Throne. From this time
onward Gregory divided his time between his parents and his friend, living partly at
Arianzus, and partly with Basil in Pontus, in monastic seclusion. At his Baptism, which it
seems most probable took place at this period, he made a solemn vow never to swear, and
to devote his whole energies and powers solely to the glory of God, and the defence and
spreading of the faith. Cæsarius did not remain long in the retirement of home, but soon
returned to the Capital, where a brilliant career seemed opening before him. Gregory, whose
mind was strongly impressed with the dangers and temptations of a life at Court, did not
altogether approve of this step, yet he does not very severely blame it. He himself, however,
felt very strongly drawn to the monastic life; but as retirement from the world did not seem
to him to be his vocation, he resolved to continue to live in the world, and to be a help and
support to his now aged parents, and especially to his father in the duties of his Episcopate,
but at the same time to live under the strictest ascetic rule. He had, however, always a secret
hankering after the Solitary life, which he had once (Ep. i.) promised Basil to share with
him; and he did find himself able for some years to spend part of his time with his friend in
his retirement in the wilds of Pontus. They portioned out their days very carefully between
prayer, meditation and study, and manual labour, on the principles laid down by Basil in a
letter to his friend, which afterwards were developed into the celebrated Rule still observed
by the entire body of the Religious of the Eastern Church. Retirement, he says, does not
consist in the act of removal from the world in bodily presence, but in this, that we tear away
the soul from those bodily influences which stir up the passions; that we give up our parental
city and our father’s house, our possessions and goods, friendship and wedlock, business
and profession, art and science, and everything, and are quite ready to take into our hearts
nothing but the impressions of the divine teaching.</p>
<p>In solitude, Basil thinks, it is possible altogether to tame the passions, like wild beasts,
by gentle treatment; to lull them to sleep, to disarm them. By turning away the soul from
the enticements of sense, and withdrawing into one’s self for the contemplation of God and
of Eternal Beauty, it is possible to raise man to a forgetfulness of natural wants, and to a
spiritual freedom from care. The means to this spiritual elevation are in his view the reading

<pb n="409"/>
of Holy Scripture, which sets before us rules of life—but especially the pictures of the lives
of godly men; Prayer which draws down the Godhead to us, and makes our mind a pure
abode for It; and an earnest silence, more inclined to learn than to teach, but by no means
morose or unfriendly. At the same time Basil desires that the outward appearance of one
who thus practises solitude shall be in keeping with his inner life; with humble downcast
eye, and dishevelled hair, in dirty untidy clothes he must go about, neither lazily loitering
nor passionately quick, but quietly. His garment, girt upon his loins with a belt, is to be
coarse, not of a bright colour, suited for both summer and winter, close enough to keep the
body warm without additional clothing; and his shoes adapted to their purpose, but without
ornament. For food, let him use only the most necessary, chiefly vegetables; for drink, water—
at least in health. For mealtime, which begins and ends with prayer, one hour is to be
fixed. Sleep is to be short, light, and never so dead as to let the soul be open to the impressions
of corrupting dreams.</p>
<p>They gave themselves especially to the study of Holy Scripture, and to the practice of
devotional exercises. In their study their great principle was to interpret the holy writings
not by their own individual judgment, but on the lines laid down for them by the authority
of ancient interpreters. Of uninspired commentators they had the greatest respect for Origen,
whose errors, however, they happily avoided. From his exegetical writings they compiled
a book of Extracts, which they published in twenty-seven books, to which they gave the
name of Philocalia, i.e., what in modern language is called a Christology. This is happily
still extant, and is valuable as preserving for us many passages otherwise lost, or existing
only in a Latin translation. Gregory sent a copy of this work to his friend and subsequent
companion at Constantinople, Theodore, Bishop of Tyana, as an Easter gift many years afterwards,
and accompanied it with a letter, in which he speaks of the work as a memorial
of himself and Basil, and as intended for an aid to scholars; and begs that his friend will give
a proof of its usefulness, with the help of diligence and the Holy Spirit. Socrates says that
this careful study of Origen was of the greatest service to the two friends in their subsequent
controversies with the Arians; for these heretics quoted him in support of their errors, but
the two Fathers were enabled to confute them readily, by shewing that they were completely
ignorant of the meaning of Origen’s argument.</p>
<p>But Gregory does not appear to have stayed long in Basil’s Monastery;—although Rufinus
speaks of a sojourn of thirteen years. This cannot for chronological reasons have been a
continuous stay, although it is true that Basil’s monastic life in Pontus, and Gregory’s various
visits to him there extended over a period of about that length, from his first retirement in
357 to his consecration to the Episcopate in 370. It was after about three years that Gregory
returned to Nazianzus (360), possibly, as Ullmann suggests, because of circumstances which
had arisen at his home, which seemed to call imperatively for his presence in the interests

<pb n="410"/>
of the peace of the Diocese, and for the assistance which he might, though a layman, be able
to give to his aged Father, who had got into trouble through a piece of imprudent conduct.</p>
<p>The Emperor Constantius, who was an Arian, had in 359 assembled at Ariminum (the
modern Rimini) a Council of 400 Western Bishops, and these, partly duped, partly compelled
by the Imperial Officers, had put out a Creed, which, while acknowledging the proper Deity
of the Son, and confessing Him to be Like the Father, omitted to say Like In All Points, and
refused the word Consubstantial; thus, while condemning the extreme followers of Arius,
favouring the views of the Semi-Arian party. At the same time another Synod, of 150 Eastern
Bishops, was assembled under Court influence at Seleucia, and promulgated a similar formula.
The Bishop of Nazianzus, though still as always a staunch upholder of Nicene orthodoxy,
was in some way induced to attach his signature to this compromising Creed; and
this action led to most important consequences. The Monks of his Diocese took the matter
up with the usual earnestness of Religious, and, with several also of the Bishops, withdrew
from Communion with their own Bishop. This may have been the reason for his son’s return.
He induced his Father to apologize for his involuntary error and to put out an orthodox
Confession, and so he healed the schism. To this period belongs his first Oration on Peace;
in which, after an eloquent encomium on the Religious life, he sets forth the blessings of
peace and concord, and contrasts them with the misery of discord; begging the people to
be very slow indeed on this account to sever themselves from the Communion of those
whom they think to be erring brethren; and thanking God for the restoration of peace. He
concludes the whole with a splendid setting forth of the Catholic doctrine concerning the
Trinity, in the following terms:—</p>
<p>“Would to God that none of us may perish, but that we may all abide in one spirit, with
one soul labouring together for the faith of the Gospel, of one mind, minding the same
thing, armed with the shield of faith, girt about the loins with truth, knowing only the one
war against the Evil One, and those who fight under his orders, not fearing them that kill
the body but cannot lay hold of the soul; but fearing Him Who is the Lord both of soul and
body; guarding the good deposit which we have received from our fathers, adoring Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, knowing the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Holy Ghost—into
which Names we were baptized, in Which we have believed, under Whose banner we have
been enlisted ; dividing Them before we combine Them, and combining before we divide;
not receiving the Three as one Person (for They are not impersonal, or names of one Person,
as though our wealth lay in Names alone and not in facts), but the Three as one Thing. For
They are One, not in Person, but in Godhead, Unity adored in Trinity, and Trinity summed
up in Unity; all adorable, all royal, of one throne and one glory; above the world, above time,
uncreated, invisible, impalpable, uncircumscript; in Its relation to Itself known only to Itself;
but to us equally venerable and adorable; Alone dwelling in the Holiest, and leaving all
creatures outside and shut off, partly by the First Veil, and partly also by the Second;—by

<pb n="411"/>
the first, the heavenly and angelic host, parted from Godhead; and by the second, we men,
severed from the Angels. This let us do; let this be our mind, Brethren; and those that are
otherwise minded let us look upon as diseased in regard to the truth, and as far as may be,
let us take and cure them; but if they be incurable let us withdraw from them, lest we share
their disease before we impart to them our own health. And the God of Peace that passeth
all understanding shall be with you in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.”</p>
<p>Gregory the Elder was now aged and infirm, and began to feel his need of a Coadjutor
in his pastoral duties. So, by the great desire of the people of Nazianzus, he ordained his
son to the Priesthood, much against the will of the said son. This Ordination took place at
some great Festival, probably at Christmas of the year 361. Gregory the Younger was much
aggrieved at this gentle violence, which even in after years he describes as an act of tyranny,
and says he cannot bring himself to speak of it in other terms, though he asks pardon of the
Holy Spirit for his language. Immediately after his Ordination he made his escape to Pontus,
apparently reaching Basil about Epiphany, 362. Here he had time for reflection on the
obedience he now owed to his father, not only as son to father, but as Priest to Bishop; and
with a truer view of his duty he returned to Nazianzus, where he was present in the Church
on Easter day 362, and preached his first Sermon as a Priest, in apology for his reluctance.
Strange to say, though it was so great a Festival, and though the preacher was so well known
and so much beloved in Nazianzus, the congregation was very small;—probably many refrained
from going to Church in order to mark their feeling about Gregory’s flight to Pontus.
Anyhow he felt the discourtesy keenly, and in his next sermon took occasion to reprove
them severely for their inconsistency in receiving him so badly after having compelled him
for their sakes to finally renounce the solitude he loved so well. Of this discourse the Abbé
Benoît speaks as follows:—</p>
<p>“It is not very long, and it seems to us a model of the tact and art which a Minister of
the Gospel ought to use in his speech when just grievances compel him to address deserved
reproaches to the faithful. It would be impossible to blame with greater force, to complain
with more frankness, and yet to do it in a way less offensive to the hearers. Praise, indeed,
is so mingled with blame in this discourse, and there is in its tone something so earnest and
affectionate, that the audience, though sharply reprimanded, not only could not take offence,
but was compelled to conceive a yet greater affection and admiration for him who so reproved
them.”</p>
<p>Gregory took the opportunity to write another very long Oration as his apology for his
flight. In it he sets forth at great length his conception of the nature and responsibilities of
the Priestly Office, and justifies himself both for having shrunk from such a charge, and for
having so soon returned to take it up. It is very improbable that this Oration, numbered II.
in the Benedictine Edition, was ever delivered vivâ voce; but it was published, and is a
complete Treatise on the Priesthood, used both by S. John Chrysostom as the foundation

<pb n="412"/>
of his Six Books on the Priesthood, and by S. Gregory the Great as the basis of his Treatise
on the Pastoral Rule. It has also furnished material to many of the best Ecclesiastical writers
of all ages.</p>
<p>Julian had now succeeded to the Empire, and had entered Constantinople in 361. He
had by this time completely broken with the Church, and renounced even the outward
semblance of Christianity. He persuaded Cæsarius, however, to retain his position at Court,
hoping perhaps that he might succeed in perverting him. This was a matter of deep regret
to his father and brother, and they felt, the latter says, obliged to keep the fact from the
knowledge of his mother. Gregory wrote his brother a letter of most affectionate though
earnest remonstrance; with the result that Cæsarius soon made up his mind to retire, and
put his resolution in practice on the opportunity afforded by the departure of the Emperor
from Constantinople to assume the direction of his campaign against the Persians. Nazianzus
was not allowed to remain without attempts being made against its Christianity, for the
Prefect of the Province was sent with an armed escort of considerable strength to demand
possession of the Church. But the aged Bishop, supported by his son and by his people,
boldly refused to comply with the Imperial commands, and there seemed such a probability
of powerful resistance that the Prefect felt compelled to withdraw his force, and never came
to Nazianzus again on such an errand. The Gregorys, father and son, frequently came into
collision with Julian during his stay in Cappadocia on his way to Persia; and indeed it is not
too much to say that the firm stand which they made on behalf of the right was, under God,
the means of diverting the Emperor from his purpose of making a vehement assault upon
the faith and rights of the Church in that Province. As the Abbé Benoît remarks, Julian saw
that he must be careful in dealing with a province where Christian faith was such a living
power, and where a simple village Bishop could dare to make so stout a stand against Imperial
Authority; but he declared his intention of avenging himself upon his opponents on his
return from his expedition. The Providence of God, however, interfered, and he never did
return, but was defeated and killed.</p>
<p>In 363 or 364 Basil, like Gregory, was ordained Priest much against his will. The Bishop
of Cæsarea, Metropolitan of Cappadocia, was Eusebius. He had been elected in 362 by a
popular clamour, while yet only a Catechumen, and was very unwillingly consecrated by
the Bishops of the Province. He felt it necessary to have at hand a Priest who by his skill in
Theology would be a help to him in the controversies of the times, and he selected Basil.
But for some unknown reason, possibly no more than a certain jealousy of Basil’s superior
reputation and influence, within a very short time Eusebius quarrelled with him, and endeavoured
to deprive him. This might easily have led to a serious schism, had Basil been a

<pb n="413"/>
self-seeking man, but as it was, he quietly retired to his Community in Pontus, accompanied
by his friend Gregory, who, however, was not able to remain long in that congenial society,
as his presence was still much needed by his father. On the succession of Valens, an Arian,
to the Throne of the Empire, Eusebius wrote to Gregory, entreating him to come to Cæsarea
and give him the benefit of his advice. Gregory, however, respectfully declined the invitation
on the grounds of his sense of the wrong which his friend had suffered, and after some
correspondence he succeeded in effecting a reconciliation between the latter and his Metropolitan,
in the year 365.</p>
<p>Cæsarius meantime had returned to the Court and had received from Valens a valuable
piece of preferment in Bithynia; but in the end of 368 or beginning of 369, having been terrified
by a great earthquake, during which he had been in considerable danger, he was arranging
matters for his final retirement, when he was seized with illness, and very soon died,
leaving all his property, which must have amounted to a considerable sum, to his brother
in trust for the poor. He was buried at Nazianzus, and on the occasion of his funeral his
brother preached the Sermon which is numbered VIII. in the Benedictine Edition. About
the same time, but a little later, Gorgonia also departed, and he preached a funeral sermon
on her too. Eusebius of Cæsarea died in 370, and Basil at once wrote an urgent letter to
Gregory, begging him to come to Cæsarea, probably in order to get him elected Archbishop.
Gregory, however, declined to go, and he and his father exerted themselves to the utmost
of their power to procure the election of Basil; the elder Gregory writing through his son
two letters, one addressed to the people of Cæsarea, the other to the Provincial Synod, urging
Basil’s claims very strongly. Though ill at the time, he managed to convey himself to the
Metropolis in time for the meeting of the Synod; and Basil was elected and consecrated.
Gregory wrote him a letter of congratulation; not, however, a very warm one; but when
troubles began to arise he spoke out with all the fervour of their early friendship in support
of the Archbishop. About this time Valens divided the civil Province of Cappadocia into
two, one of which had Cæsarea, the other Tyana, for its Metropolis. Anthimus, Bishop of
the latter See, thereupon claimed to be ipso facto Metropolitan of the new Province, a claim
which Basil strenuously resisted, as savouring of what we call Erastianism. A long dispute
followed, in the course of which Basil, to assert his rights as Metropolitan, and to strengthen
his own hands, erected several new Bishoprics in the disputed Province; and to one of these,
Sasima, a miserable little village he consecrated his friend Gregory, almost by force. Gregory
was, not unnaturally, indignant at this treatment; while Basil, whose great object had been
to strengthen himself against Anthimus, took it as unkind of Gregory to be so reluctant to
comply with his friend’s wishes. So the two were for a long time in very strained relations
to one another. Although, however, Gregory ultimately yielded to the earnest wish of his
father, and submitted to the authority of the Archbishop, yet he did not disguise his reluctance,
and in the Sermons which he preached on the occasion (Or. ix. x.) he spoke very

<pb n="414"/>
strongly on the point. Anthimus, however, occupied the village of Sasima with troops, and
prevented Gregory from taking peaceable possession of his See, which it is probable he
never actually administered, for his father begged him to remain at Nazianzus and continue
his services as coadjutor Bishop. The contest about the Metropolitanate of Tyana went on
for some time, but in the end, mainly by Gregory’s mediation, it was amicably settled. In
374 Gregory the elder died, and his wife also, and thus our Saint was set free from the charge
of the diocese. He spoke a panegyric at his father’s funeral, and wrote a number of little “In
Memoriam” poems to his mother’s memory; and out of respect for his father continued to
administer the See of Nazianzus for about a year, making great efforts meanwhile to secure
the appointment of a Bishop. But, perceiving that his efforts would be fruitless, because of
the devotion of the people to himself, he at length withdrew, after a very serious illness, to
Seleucia in Isauria (375,) where he lived three or four years, attached to the famous Church
of S. Thecla. Very little is known of his life there; but it must have been at this period that
he heard of the death of Basil, upon whom two years later in the Cathedral of Cæsarea he
pronounced a splendid panegyric.</p>
<p>In 379 the Church at Constantinople, which for forty years had been oppressed by a
succession of Arian Archbishops, and was well nigh crushed out of existence by the multitude
of other heresies, Eunomian, Macedonian, Novatian, Apollinarian, etc., which Arian rule
had fostered, besought the great Theologian to come to their aid. Theodosius the new Emperor,
who was a fervent Catholic, backed their entreaty, as did also numerous Bishops.
Gregory resisted the call for a long time; but at last he came to see that it was the will of God
that he should accept the Mission, and he consented to go and fill the gap, until such time
as the Catholics of the Capital might be able to elect an Archbishop.</p>
<p>The following account of the religious condition of Constantinople at this time is condensed
from Ullmann:—</p>
<p>“Religious feeling like everything else had become to the idle and empty mind a subject
of joke and amusement. What belonged to the theatre was brought into the Church, and
what belonged to the Church into the theatre. The better Christian feelings were not seldom
held up in comedies to the sneer of the multitude. Everything was so changed by the Constantinopolitans
into light jesting, that earnestness was stripped of its worth by wit, and that
which is holy became a subject for banter and scoffing in the refined conversation of worldly
people. Yet worse was it that the unbridled delight of these men in dissipating enjoyments
threatened to turn the Church into a theatre, and the Preacher into a play actor. If he would
please the multitude, he must adapt himself to their taste, and entertain them amusingly in
the Church. They demanded also in the preaching something that should please the ear,
glittering declamation with theatrical gesticulation; and they clapped with the same pleasure
the comedian in the holy place and him on the stage. And alas there were found at that
period too many preachers who preferred the applause of men to their souls’ health. At this

<pb n="415"/>
period the objects of the faith excited, particularly in Constantinople, a very universal and
lively interest, which was entertained from the Court downwards, though not always in the
most creditable manner; but it was in great part not the interest of the heart, but that of a
hypercritical and disputatious intellect, where it was not something far lower, to which the
dispute about matters of faith served only as a pretext for attaining the exterior aims of avarice
or ambition. While the sanctifying and beatifying doctrines of the Gospel, which are directed
to the conversion of the whole inner man were let lie quiet, everyone from the Emperor to
the beggar busied himself with incredible interest about a few questions concerning which
the Gospel communicates only just so much as is beneficial to the human spirit and necessary
to salvation, and whose fuller expression at any rate belongs rather to the school than to
practical life. But the more violently these doctrinal disputes were kindled, disturbing and
dividing States, cities, and families, so much the more people lost sight of the practical essentials
of Christianity; it seemed more important to maintain the Tri-unity of God than to
love God with all the heart; to acknowledge the Consubstantiality of the Son, than to follow
Him in humility and self-denial; to defend the Personality of the Holy Spirit, than to bring
forth the fruits of the Spirit, love, peace, righteousness<gap reason="omitted"/>.In addition to these religious disputes
came also political struggles, namely, the hard-fought wars of the Roman Empire with
the Goths; so that the Empire at large presented the picture of a sea, tossed by violent storms.
But the unhappy schisms which at this time were severing Christians everywhere, shewed
themselves in a particularly discouraging form in the Capital. Under the late reigns several
parties had been favoured; but especially those which, though again divided among themselves
by differences of opinion, yet agreed in this that they all rejected the Nicene system
of doctrine. Constantius had bestowed his favour on the Arians; Julian during his short
reign on all parties, at least in appearance,—to crush them all. After Jovian’s early death
Valens succeeded to power in the East, and with him, even more than with Constantius,
Arianism, which he not only protected, but also sought to make predominant by horrible
atrocities against the friends of the Nicene Decrees. These had now been forbidden the use
of all Churches and Church property, and the Arians had been put in possession of them.
But Constantinople still remained the scene of ecclesiastical strifes and partizanships. Here
where with a little good so much evil flowed from all three parts of the world, all opinions
had their adherents; but the following parties in particular shewed themselves:—The Eunomians,
professing an intellectual theology, which claimed to be able completely to explore
the Being of God by logical definitions, and maintained in strict Arian fashion the Unlikeness
of the Son to the Father, were very numerous in Constantinople (as is shewn by the fact that
most of Gregory’s polemical utterances were directed against them), and injured earnest
religious thought principally by this, that they used the doctrines of the faith exclusively as
subjects for an argumentative dialectic. The Macedonians, addicted to the Semi-Arian
dogma of the Like Substance, and thereby somewhat more nearly approaching the Orthodox,

<pb n="416"/>
and distinguished besides by an estimable earnestness of demeanour, and a monk-like
strictness of manner, were indeed themselves excluded by the pure Arians from the property
of the Church, but were ever being abundantly multiplied, partly in Constantinople itself,
partly in the neighbouring regions of the Hellespont, Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia. The
Novatians, who even overstepped the Macedonians in the strictness of their practical principles,
had somewhat earlier been on the point of uniting themselves with the Orthodox,
from whom they did not differ on the chief doctrine in dispute, and with whom they found
themselves under like oppression from the Arians; but the malevolent disposition of a few
of the party leaders had stood in the way, and so they remained separate, and swelled the
number of the opponents of Orthodoxy. Lastly the Apollinarians too began to establish
themselves there. Their teaching was opposed to the acknowledgment of true and perfect
Manhood in Jesus (for true Manhood lies in the reason especially); and there was at that
time, as Gregory informs us, a report that an assembly of Apollinarian bishops was to be
held at Constantinople, with a view of raising their teaching as to Christ into general notice,
and forcing it upon the Churches.</p>
<p>In such a crisis Gregory came most unwillingly to the Capital. At first he lodged in the
house of a relation of his own, part of which he arranged as a Chapel, and dedicated under
the title Anastasia, as the place where the Catholic faith was to rise again. There he began
at once to carry out the rule of the Church as to daily service, to which he added his own
splendid preaching.</p>
<p>His constant theme was the worship of the Trinity. After two Sermons in deprecation
of religious contentiousness, he preached those famous Five Orations which have won for
him the title of the Theologian. To analyse these belongs to another portion of this work;
it will be enough in this place to say, that after warning his audience against the frivolity
with which the Arians were dragging religious subjects of the most solemn kind into the
most unsuitable places and occasions, he proceeds in four magnificent discourses to set
forth the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, shewing carefully the difference between Sabellian
confusion of Persons and Tritheistic division of Substance. The Arians, however, persecuted
him bitterly; even, on one occasion at least, hiring an assassin to murder him; and their
persecution was all the more bitter because of the wonderful success which attended Gregory’s
preaching. S. Jerome, who came to Constantinople at this time, has left on record the
pleasure with which he listened to and conversed with the great Defender of the Faith.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Gregory now let himself be taken in by a plausible adventurer named
Maximus, who had come to Constantinople in the hope of obtaining the Bishopric for
himself. He attached himself to Gregory and won his confidence, the latter even going so
far as to deliver a panegyric upon him as a sufferer for the Faith. After a short time, however,
Maximus managed to procure his own consecration secretly from some Egyptian Bishops,
who during an illness of Gregory enthroned him at night in the Church. In the morning,

<pb n="417"/>
when the people discovered what had been done, they were very indignant, and Maximus
and his friends were driven out of the Church and forced to leave the City. Meanwhile the
rank and fashion of Constantinople began to dislike Gregory, who would not condescend
to the arts of the popular preacher, and whose simple retiring life and gentle demeanour
were made matter of reproach to him. Gregory was quite willing to retire, and was only
prevented from doing so by the earnest remonstrances of his friends, who solemnly assured
him that if he went away the Faith would depart with him; so he consented to remain till a
fitter man could be found. Late in 380 Theodosius came to Constantinople, where almost
his first act was to deprive the Arians of the Churches, and to put Gregory in possession of
the Cathedral of S. Sophia. The next year the great Council of Eastern Bishops, which ranks
as the Second Ecumenical Council, met at the Capital, under the presidency of Meletius of
Antioch. Its first care was to sanction the translation of Gregory from the See of Sasima to
that of the Metropolis of the Empire, and to enthrone him in S. Sophia, and thus he became
the recognised Archbishop of the Imperial City. Meletius shortly afterwards died, and
Gregory assumed the Presidency of the Council. He failed in his endeavours to heal the
schism which was troubling the Church of Antioch, and when the Egyptian Bishops on their
arrival shewed a disposition to take up the case of Maximus, and were determined at any
rate to oust Gregory from the Patriarchal Throne on the ground of a Nicene canon forbidding
translations, which had virtually been rescinded by the act of the Council, he made up his
mind to resign. He obtained a reluctant assent to this course from the Emperor, and then
took leave of the Synod in one of the most magnificent of all his Orations, in which he gives
a graphic account of his work in the Metropolis. Nectarius, Prefect of the City, who was
only a catechumen, was elected in his place, and Gregory went home to Nazianzus. He administered
the affairs of the Church there for a little while, and then, having procured the
election of Eulalius as Bishop, he retired to Arianzus, where he passed the few remaining
years of his life in seclusion, but still continued to take an active interest in the affairs of the
Church. His own city was greatly disturbed by Apollinarian teachers, whose efforts to establish
themselves within the Church were very persevering. Apollinarius, or as he is frequently
called in the West, Apollinaris, was a Bishop of Laodicea in the latter half of the
Fourth Century, and was at one time greatly respected for his learning and orthodoxy by S.
Athanasius and S. Basil. He was even an instructor of S. Jerome in 374, but he seceded from
the Church in the next year, owing to views which he had come to hold about the nature of
our Lord; these really prepared the way for various forms of the Monophysite heresy. He
fell into the error of a partial denial of our Lord’s true Humanity, attributing to Christ a
human body and a human soul, but not a reasoning spirit, whose place, according to him,
was supplied by the Divine Logos. This view had first appeared in 362, when it came before
a Council at Alexandria. Those who were accused of holding it denied it, and expressed
their sense of the absurdity of such a view, pointing out that our Lord could not be said to

<pb n="418"/>
be really incarnate if He had no human mind; but about 369 it assumed a definite form
(though even then it was not known to be the teaching of Apollinarius). Arguing from the
Divinity of Christ that He cannot have had a human mind, for if He had He would have
had sinful inclinations, and the one Christ would have been two persons, Apollinarius and
his followers went on to maintain that the Incarnation only meant a certain converse between
God and Man; and that Christ’s Body was not really born of Mary, but was a part of the
Godhead converted into flesh. S. Athanasius wrote two Books against these two propositions,
but did not name Apollinarius, most probably because he did not believe him to be committed
to them. The fundamental error of the system was the idea that the Incarnation was, not
the Union of the two Natures, but only a blending so close, that in the mind of these teachers
all the Divine Attributes were transferred to the human nature, and all the human ones to
the Divine, and the two were merged in one compound being.</p>
<p>In 377 a Roman Synod excommunicated Apollinarius and his adherents, and S. Damasus
wrote a letter containing twenty-five anathemas, which he sent to Paulinus of Antioch
and others. This condemnation is in almost the identical words used by S. Gregory in the
first of two letters on the question which he wrote to Cledonius, a Priest of Nazianzus, and
which were adopted as symbolic at the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon. Of these letters
Canon Bright says that they belong to that class of documents of the Fourth Century which
refuted by anticipation the heresies of the Fifth. Gregory affirmed True Godhead and True
Manhood to be combined in the One Person of the Crucified, Who was the adorable Son,
Whose Mother was the Mother of God, and Who assumed, in order to redeem it, the entire
nature that fell in Adam. In his seclusion, says Mr. Crake, his sole luxuries were a garden
and a fountain. He spent his last days in continual devotion. His knees were worn with
kneeling, and his whole thoughts and aspirations had gone before to the long home to which
he was hastening. After the manner of the Saints, he was very rigorous in his self-denial.
His bed was of straw with a covering of sackcloth, and a single tunic was all the outward
clothing of him who had been Bishop of Constantinople. Yet his glory was only in the Lord.
“As a fish cannot swim without water, and a bird cannot fly without air, he said, so a
Christian cannot advance a single step without Christ.” He died in 391, and in the same
year that he passed from the roll of the earthly episcopate Augustine was ordained Priest at
Hippo Regius in Africa.</p>
<p>Ullmann gives the following description of his character and personal appearance:</p>
<p>“Gregory was of middle height and somewhat pale; but his pallor became him. His hair
was thick and blanched by age, his short beard and conspicuous eyebrows were thicker.
On his right eye he had a scar. His manner was friendly and attractive; his conduct simple.
The keynote of his inner being was piety; his soul was full of fiery strength of faith, turned
to God and Christ; a lofty zeal for divine things led him all his life. This zeal manifested itself
above all in a steadfast adherence to and defence of certain dogmas which that age held to

<pb n="419"/>
be specially important; as well as in lively conflicts, not always free from partisanship, with
opposing convictions; but not less in a hearty and living apprehension of practical Christianity,
the establishment and enlargement of which in men’s minds was to him all important.
His asceticism was overdone; it injured his health; yet it did not degenerate into hypocrisy;
it was to him the means for elevating and liberating the mind, but not in and for its own
sake a higher virtue. An inborn and inbred love of solitude hindered him from turning all
his powers to a publicly useful activity. His seclusion did not allow him to become familiar
with the knowledge of men and of the world; lacking in knowledge of men, carelessly con-
fident, sometimes distrustful and bitter in his judgment of others, he demanded from others
much, but from himself most. Susceptible of great resolves, and full of fiery zeal for all good,
he was not always steadfast and persevering in carrying them out. In endurance and conflict
he was noble and high-minded; in victory moderate; in prosperity humble; never flattering
the great, but an ever ready helper to the oppressed and persecuted, and to the poor a loving
father. The most excellent qualities were in Gregory mingled with faults; he was not quite
free from vanity, he was very irritable and sensitive, but also readily forgave and cherished
no grudges. He was a man feeling after holiness, and striving after the highest good, but
not perfect, as no man upon earth is.”</p>
<p>Before leaving Constantinople he made his will, in which he bequeathed all his property
to the Deacon Gregory for life, with reversion to the poor of Nazianzus.</p>

<head>Division II.—The Writings.</head>
<p>I. The Orations.—These—forty-five in number—raise him to equality with the best
Orators of antiquity.</p>
<p>a. The Five Theological Orations.—These won him the title of The Theologian. They
were delivered in Constantinople, in defence of the Church’s faith in the Trinity, against
Eunomians and Macedonians. In the First and Second he treats of the existence, nature,
being, and attributes of God, so far as man’s finite intellect can comprehend them. In the
Third and Fourth the subject is the Godhead of the Son, which he establishes by exposition
of Scripture, and by refutation of the specious arguments brought forward by the heretics.
In the Fifth he similarly maintains the Deity, and Personality of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>b. The Two Invectives against Julian.—These were delivered at Nazianzus after the death
of the Emperor, and present us with a very dark picture of his character. The orator dwells
upon his attempt to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem, and its failure, and his overthrow in
the campaign against Persia. From these facts he demonstrates the power of God’s Justice,
and sets forth the Christian doctrine of the Divine Providence inculcating a lesson of trust
in God.</p>
<p>c. Moral Orations.—(1) The Apology for his flight. As was said above, it is most
probable that this discourse was never actually spoken; if it was, it certainly must have been
considerably enlarged afterwards. In it Gregory dwells on the motive of his flight and his
return after his forced ordination; he speaks of his love of retirement, but most of all lays
stress upon the difficulty of the Priestly Office, its heavy responsibilities and grave dangers,
and upon his own sense of unworthiness. His return, he says, was prompted by respect for
his hearers and by care for his aged parents; by the fear of losing his father’s blessing; and
by the recollection of what befel the Prophet Jonas on account of his resistance to the will
of God. The remainder of the Oration is practically a treatise on the Priesthood, and was
made use of by S. Chrysostom and S. Gregory the Great in their books on the subject.</p>
<p>(2) The Farewell Oration at Constantinople, containing an account of his work there.</p>
<p>(3) On Love of the Poor.</p>
<p>(4) On the Indissolubility of Marriage, the only Sermon of S. Gregory on a definite text
which has come down to us.</p>
<p>(5) Three Orations on Peace.</p>
<p>(6) One on Moderation in theological discussion.</p>
<p>d. The Festal Orations.—On Christmas, Epiphany (on the Baptism of Christ in the river
Jordan, followed up next day by a long one on Holy Baptism), two on Easter (one of these
his first sermon, the other almost if not quite his last). On Low Sunday, and on Pentecost.</p>

<pb n="421"/>
<p>e. Panegyrics on Saints.—The Maccabee Brothers and their Mother; S. Cyprian of
Carthage (in which there is evidence of the cultus of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the
practice of invocation of the Saints); and on S. Athanasius.</p>
<p>f. Funeral Orations on Eminent People.—On his Father, preached before his Mother
and S. Basil. On Cæsarius, in presence of his parents, consoling them by the picture of his
brother’s virtue, especially in having withstood Julian’s efforts to pervert him, and in
resigning his post at Court and leaving the Capital. On Gorgonia, whom he praises as a
model Christian Matron, and whose wonderful cure before the Altar he relates. On S. Basil.</p>
<p>g. Occasional Orations, of which we mention three: (1) On a plague of hail. (2) On
the consecration of Eulalius of Doara. (3) On his own consecration to Sasima.</p>
<p>II. The Letters, of which two hundred and forty-three are extant, are characterised by
a clear, concise, and pleasant style and spirit. Some of them treat of the theological questions
of the day, as for example the two to Cledonius, and one to Nectarius his Successor in the
See of Constantinople; these deal with the Apollinarian errors. Most of them however are
letters to private friends; sometimes of condolence or congratulation, sometimes of recommendation,
sometimes on mere general subjects of interest. To this section must be ascribed
his Will, which is probably genuine.</p>
<p>III. The Poems, five hundred and seven in number, are in various metres. While leaving
much to be desired, these verses shew much real poetic feeling, and at times rise to genuine
beauty. Thirty-eight are dogmatic, on the Trinity, on the works of God in Creation, on
Providence, on Angels and Men, on the Fall, on the Decalogue, on the Prophets Elias and
Elissæus, on the Incarnation, the Miracles and Parables of our Lord, and the canonical Books
of the Bible. Forty are Moral; two hundred and six Historical and Autobiographical; one
hundred and twenty-nine are Epitaphs, or rather funeral Epigrams; ninety-four are Epigrams.</p>
<p>There is also a long Tragedy, called Christus Patiens which is the first known attempt
at a Christian drama; the parts are sustained by Christ, The Blessed Virgin, S. Joseph, S.
Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Pontius Pilate, Theologus, Nuntius, and others. The Benedictine
Editors however doubt the genuineness of this Tragedy and Caillau, who published
the second volume of this Edition after the troubles of the French Revolution, thinks it is
to be ascribed to another Gregory, Bishop of Antioch in the Sixth Century, and relegates it
to an Appendix. None of The Theologian’s Odes or Hymns have, however, found a place
in the liturgical poetry of the Church.</p>

<head>Division III.—Literature.</head>
<p>There are perhaps more MSS. of the works of Gregory than of any other Father. The
great Benedictine Edition of his works contains long lists of MSS., and of Versions, and
previous Editions. The most famous of these is that of the Abbat Jacobus Billius in 1589,
which was accompanied by the Scholia of Nicetas, etc. In 1571 Leuvenklavius published an
edition at Basle containing the Scholia of Elias Cretensis and others. In 1778 appeared the
first volume of the great Edition of the Benedictine Fathers of the Abbey of S. Maur near
Paris, which had been in preparation ever since 1708. But the Monks were driven away by
the French Revolution, and the second volume did not appear till 1842. It has been reprinted
in Migne’s “Patrologia Græca,” vols. 35–38. Of modern works on the life and writings of
our Saint, the best are those of Dr. Ullmann, and that of the Abbé Benoît. A valuable comparison
of Gregory and Basil is to be found in Newman’s “Church of the Fathers,” and last,
but not least in value, may be mentioned the long biographical article by Professor Watkins
in Smith’s “Dictionary of Christian Biography,” and a useful short summary in Schaff’s
Church History (311–600, vol. ii.).</p>

<head>Oration I.</head>
<head>On Easter and His Reluctance.</head>
<p>I. It is the Day of the Resurrection, and my Beginning has good auspices. Let us then
keep the Festival with splendour,2529 and let us embrace one another. Let us say Brethren,
even to those who hate us; much more to those who have done or suffered aught out of love
for us. Let us forgive all offences for the Resurrection’s sake: let us give one another pardon,
I for the noble tyranny which I have suffered (for I can now call it noble); and you who exercised
it, if you had cause to blame my tardiness; for perhaps this tardiness may be more
precious in God’s sight than the haste of others. For it is a good thing even to hold back
from God for a little while, as did the great Moses of old,2530 and Jeremiah2531 later on; and
then to run readily to Him when He calls, as did Aaron2532 and Isaiah,2533 so only both be
done in a dutiful spirit;—the former because of his own want of strength; the latter because
of the Might of Him That calleth.</p>
<p>II. A Mystery2534 anointed me; I withdrew a little while at a Mystery, as much as was
needful to examine myself; now I come in with a Mystery, bringing with me the Day as a
good defender of my cowardice and weakness; that He Who to-day rose again from the
dead may renew me also by His Spirit; and, clothing me with the new Man, may give me to
His New Creation, to those who are begotten after God, as a good modeller and teacher for
Christ, willingly both dying with Him and rising again with Him.</p>
<p>III. Yesterday the Lamb was slain and the door-posts were anointed,2535 and Egypt
bewailed her Firstborn, and the Destroyer passed us over, and the Seal was dreadful and
reverend, and we were walled in with the Precious Blood. To-day we have clean escaped
from Egypt and from Pharaoh; and there is none to hinder us from keeping a Feast to the
Lord our God—the Feast of our Departure; or from celebrating that Feast, not in the old

leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,2536
carrying with us nothing of ungodly and Egyptian leaven.</p>
<p>IV. Yesterday I was crucified with Him; today I am glorified with Him; yesterday I died
with Him; to-day I am quickened with Him; yesterday I was buried with Him; to-day I rise
with Him. But let us offer to Him Who suffered and rose again for us—you will think perhaps
that I am going to say gold, or silver, or woven work or transparent and costly stones, the
mere passing material of earth, that remains here below, and is for the most part always
possessed by bad men, slaves of the world and of the Prince of the world. Let us offer
ourselves, the possession most precious to God, and most fitting; let us give back to the Image
what is made after the Image. Let us recognize our Dignity; let us honour our Archetype;
let us know the power of the Mystery, and for what Christ died.</p>
<p>V. Let us become like Christ, since Christ became like us. Let us become God’s for His
sake, since He for ours became Man. He assumed the worse that He might give us the better;
He became poor that we through His poverty might be rich;2537 He took upon Him the
form of a servant that we might receive back our liberty; He came down that we might be
exalted; He was tempted that we might conquer; He was dishonoured that He might glorify
us; He died that He might save us; He ascended that He might draw to Himself us, who
were lying low in the Fall of sin. Let us give all, offer all, to Him Who gave Himself a Ransom
and a Reconciliation for us. But one can give nothing like oneself, understanding the Mystery,
and becoming for His sake all that He became for ours.</p>
<p>VI. As you see, He offers you a Shepherd; for this is what your Good Shepherd,2538
who lays down his life for his sheep, is hoping and praying for, and he asks from you his
subjects; and he gives you himself double instead of single, and makes the staff of his old
age a staff for your spirit. And he adds to the inanimate temple a living one; to that exceedingly
beautiful and heavenly shrine, this poor and small one,2539 yet to him of great value,
and built too with much sweat and many labours. Would that I could say it is worthy of
his labours. And he places at your disposal all that belongs to him (O great generosity!—or
it would be truer to say, O fatherly love!) his hoar hairs, his youth, the temple, the high
priest, the testator, the heir, the discourses which you were longing for; and of these not
such as are vain and poured out into the air, and which reach no further than the outward

superficially graven, nor easily to be rubbed off, but marked very deep, not with ink, but

<p>VII. These are the gifts given you by this august Abraham, this honourable and reverend
Head, this Patriarch, this Restingplace of all good, this Standard of virtue, this Perfection
of the Priesthood, who to-day is bringing to the Lord his willing Sacrifice, his only Son,2540
him of the promise. Do you on your side offer to God and to us obedience to your Pastors,
dwelling in a place of herbage, and being fed by water of refreshment;2541 knowing your
Shepherd well, and being known by him;2542 and following when he calls you as a Shepherd
frankly through the door; but not following a stranger climbing up into the fold like a robber
and a traitor; nor listening to a strange voice when such would take you away by stealth and
scatter you from the truth on mountains,2543 and in deserts, and pitfalls, and places which
the Lord does not visit; and would lead you away from the sound Faith in the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, the One Power and Godhead, Whose Voice my sheep always
heard (and may they always hear it), but with deceitful and corrupt words would tear them
from their true Shepherd. From which may we all be kept, Shepherd and flock, as from a
poisoned and deadly pasture; guiding and being guided far away from it, that we may all be
one in Christ Jesus our Lord, now and unto the heavenly rest. To Whom be the glory and
the might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Introduction to Oration II.</head>
<p>It is generally agreed that this oration was not intended for oral delivery. Its object was
to explain and defend S. Gregory’s recent conduct, which had been severely criticised by
his friends at Nazianzus. He had been recalled by his father probably during the year a.d.
361 from Pontus, where he had spent several years in monastic seclusion with his friend S.
Basil. His father, not content with his son’s presence at home as a support for his declining
years, and feeling assured of his fitness for the sacred office, had proceeded, with the loudly
expressed approval of the congregation, in spite of Gregory’s reluctance, to ordain him to
the priesthood on Christmas Day a.d. 361. S. Gregory, even after the lapse of many years,
speaks of his ordination as an act of tyranny, and at the time, stung almost to madness, as
an ox by a gadfly, rushed away again to Pontus, to bury in its congenial solitude, consoled
by an intimate friend’s deep sympathy, his wounded feelings. Before long the sense of duty
reasserted itself, and he returned to his post at his father’s side before Easter a.d. 362. On
Easter day he delivered his first Oration before a congregation whose scantiness marked
the displeasure with which the people of Nazianzus had viewed his conduct. Accordingly
he set himself to supply them in this Oration with a full explanation of the motives which
had led to his retirement. At the same time, as the secondary title of the Oration shows, he
has supplied an exposition of the obligations and dignity of the Priestly Office which has
been drawn upon by all later writers on the subject. S. Chrysostom in his well-known
treatise, S. Gregory the Great in his Pastoral Care, and Bossuet in his panegyric on S. Paul,
have done little more than summarise the material or develop the considerations contained
in this eloquent and elaborate dissertation.</p>

<p>In Defence of His Flight to Pontus, and His Return, After His Ordination to the

<p>1. I have been defeated, and own my defeat. I subjected myself to the Lord, and prayed
unto Him.2544 Let the most blessed David supply my exordium, or rather let Him Who
spoke in David, and even now yet speaks through him. For indeed the very best order of
beginning every speech and action, is to begin from God,2545 and to end in God. As to the

cause, either of my original revolt and cowardice, in which I got me away far off, and remained2546
away from you for a time, which perhaps seemed long to those who missed me;
or of the present gentleness and change of mind, in which I have given myself up again to
you, men may think and speak in different ways, according to the hatred or love they bear
me, on the one side refusing to acquit me of the charges alleged, on the other giving me a
hearty welcome. For nothing is so pleasant to men as talking of other people’s business,
especially under the influence of affection or hatred, which often almost entirely blinds us
to the truth. I will, however, myself, unabashed, set forth the truth, and arbitrate with justice
between the two parties, which accuse or gallantly defend us, by, on the one side, accusing
myself, on the other, undertaking my own defence.</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, that my speech may proceed in due order, I apply myself to the question
which arose first, that of cowardice. For I cannot endure that any of those who watch with
interest the success, or the contrary, of my efforts, should be put to confusion on my account,
since it has pleased God that our affairs should be of some consequence to Christians, so I
will by my defence relieve, if there be any such, those who have already suffered; for it is
well, as far as possible, and as reason allows, to shrink from causing, through our sin or
suspicion, any offence or stumbling-block to the community: inasmuch as we know how
inevitably even those who offend one of the little ones2547 will incur the severest punishment
at the hands of Him who cannot lie.</p>
<p>3. For my present position is due, my good people, not to inexperience and ignorance,
nay indeed, that I may boast myself a little,2548 neither is it due to contempt for the divine
laws and ordinances. Now, just as in the body there is2549 one member2550 which rules
and, so to say, presides, while another is ruled over and subject; so too in the churches, God
has ordained, according either to a law of equality, which admits of an order of merit, or to
one of providence, by which He has knit all together, that those for whom such treatment
is beneficial, should be subject to pastoral care and rule, and be guided by word and deed
in the path of duty; while others should be pastors and teachers,2551 for the perfecting of
the church, those, I mean, who surpass the majority in virtue and nearness to God, perform-

ing the functions of the soul in the body, and of the intellect in the soul; in order that both
may be so united and compacted together, that, although one is lacking and another is preeminent,
they may, like the members of our bodies, be so combined and knit together by
the harmony of the Spirit, as to form one perfect body,2552 really worthy of Christ Himself,
our Head.2553</p>
<p>4. I am aware then that anarchy2554 and disorder cannot be more advantageous than
order and rule, either to other creatures or to men; nay, this is true of men in the highest
possible degree, because the interests at stake in their case are greater; since it is a great
thing2555 for them, even if they fail of their highest purpose—to be free from sin—to attain
at least to that which is second best, restoration from sin. Since this seems right and just,
it is, I take it, equally wrong and disorderly that all should wish to rule, and that no one
should accept2556 it. For if all men were to shirk this office, whether it must be called a
ministry or a leadership, the fair fulness2557 of the Church would be halting in the highest
degree, and in fact cease to be fair. And further, where, and by whom would God be worshipped
among us in those mystic and elevating rites which are our greatest and most precious
privilege, if there were neither king, nor governor, nor priesthood, nor sacrifice,2558
nor all those highest offices to the loss of which, for their great sins, men were of old condemned
in consequence of their disobedience?</p>
<p>5. Nor indeed is it strange or inconsistent for the majority of those who are devoted to
the study of divine things, to ascend to rule from being ruled, nor does it overstep the limits
laid down by philosophy,2559 or involve disgrace; any more than for an excellent sailor to
become a lookout-man, and for a lookout-man, who has successfully kept watch over the
winds, to be entrusted with the helm; or, if you will, for a brave soldier to be made a captain,

and a good captain to become a general, and have committed to him the conduct of the
whole campaign. Nor again, as perhaps some of those absurd and tiresome people may
suppose, who judge of others’ feelings by their own, was I ashamed of the rank of this grade
from my desire for a higher. I was not so ignorant either of its divine greatness or human
low estate, as to think it no great thing for a created nature, to approach in however slight
degree to God, Who alone is most glorious and illustrious, and surpasses in purity every
nature, material and immaterial alike.</p>
<p>6. What then were my feelings, and what was the reason of my disobedience? For to
most men I did not at the time seem consistent with myself, or to be such as they had known
me, but to have undergone some deterioration, and to exhibit greater resistance and selfwill
than was right. And the causes of this you have long been desirous to hear. First, and
most important, I was astounded at the unexpectedness of what had occurred, as people are
terrified by sudden noises; and, losing the control of my reasoning faculties, my self-respect,
which had hitherto controlled me, gave way. In the next place, there came over me an eager
longing2560 for the blessings of calm and retirement, of which I had from the first been enamoured
to a higher degree, I imagine, than any other student of letters, and which amidst
the greatest and most threatening dangers I had promised to God, and of which I had also
had so much experience, that I was then upon its threshold, my longing having in consequence
been greatly kindled, so that I could not submit to be thrust into the midst of a
life of turmoil by an arbitrary act of oppression, and to be torn away by force from the holy
sanctuary of such a life as this.</p>
<p>7. For nothing seemed to me so desirable as to close the doors of my senses, and, escaping
from the flesh and the world, collected within myself, having no further connection than
was absolutely necessary with human affairs, and speaking to myself and to God,2561 to live
superior to visible things, ever preserving in myself the divine impressions pure and unmixed
with the erring tokens of this lower world, and both being, and constantly growing more
and more to be, a real unspotted mirror of God and divine things, as light is added to light,
and what was still dark grew clearer, enjoying already by hope the blessings of the world to
come, roaming about with the angels, even now being above the earth by having forsaken
it, and stationed on high by the Spirit. If any of you has been possessed by this longing, he
knows what I mean and will sympathise with my feelings at that time. For, perhaps, I ought
not to expect to persuade most people by what I say, since they are unhappily disposed to
laugh at such things, either from their own thoughtlessness, or from the influence of men
unworthy of the promise, who have bestowed upon that which is good an evil name, calling
<note type="footnote">2560 Eager longing. Nearly all mss. read “pity”—which would have to be understood in the sense of “regretful
affection.”</note>

philosophy nonsense, aided by envy and the evil tendencies of the mob, who are ever inclined
to grow worse: so that they are constantly occupied with one of two sins, either the commission
of evil, or the discrediting of good.</p>
<p>8. I was influenced besides by another feeling, whether base or noble I do not know,
but I will speak out to you all my secrets. I was ashamed of all those others, who, without
being better than ordinary people, nay, it is a great thing if they be not worse, with unwashen
hands,2562 as the saying runs, and uninitiated souls, intrude into the most sacred offices;
and, before becoming worthy to approach the temples, they lay claim to the sanctuary,2563
and they push and thrust around the holy table, as if they thought this order to be a means
of livelihood, instead of a pattern of virtue, or an absolute authority, instead of a ministry
of which we must give account. In fact they are almost more in number than those whom
they govern; pitiable as regards piety,2564 and unfortunate in their dignity; so that, it seems
to me, they will not, as time and this evil alike progress, have any one left to rule, when all
are teachers, instead of, as the promise says, taught of God,2565 and all prophesy,2566 so that
even “Saul is among the prophets,”2567 according to the ancient history and proverb. For
at no time, either now or in former days, amid the rise and fall of various developments,
has there ever been such an abundance, as now exists among Christians, of disgrace and
abuses of this kind. And, if to stay this current is beyond our powers, at any rate it is not
the least important duty of religion to testify the hatred and shame we feel for it.</p>
<p>9. Lastly, there is a matter more serious than any which I have mentioned, for I am now
coming to the finale2568 of the question: and I will not deceive you; for that would not be
lawful in regard to topics of such moment. I did not, nor do I now, think myself qualified
to rule a flock or herd, or to have authority over the souls of men. For in their case it is
sufficient to render the herd or flock as stout and fat as possible; and with this object the
neatherd and shepherd will look for well watered and rich pastures, and will drive his charge
from pasture to pasture, and allow them to rest, or arouse, or recall them, sometimes with
his staff, most often with his pipe; and with the exception of occasional struggles with wolves,

or attention to the sickly, most of his time will be devoted to the oak and the shade and his
pipes, while he reclines on the beautiful grass, and beside the cool water, and shakes down
his couch in a breezy spot, and ever and anon sings a love ditty, with his cup by his side,
and talks to his bullocks or his flock, the fattest of which supply his banquets or his pay.
But no one ever has thought of the virtue of flocks or herds; for indeed of what virtue are
they capable? Or who has regarded their advantage as more important than his own pleasure?</p>
<p>10. But in the case of man, hard as it is for him to learn how to submit to rule, it seems
far harder to know how to rule over men, and hardest of all, with this rule of ours, which
leads them by the divine law, and to God, for its risk is, in the eyes of a thoughtful man,
proportionate to its height and dignity. For, first of all, he must, like silver or gold, though
in general circulation in all kinds of seasons and affairs, never ring false or alloyed, or give
token of any inferior matter, needing further refinement in the fire;2569 or else, the wider
his rule, the greater evil he will be. Since the injury which extends to many is greater than
that which is confined to a single individual.</p>
<p>11. For it is not so easy to dye deeply a piece of cloth, or to impregnate with odours,
foul or the reverse, whatever comes near to them; nor is it so easy for the fatal vapour, which
is rightly called a pestilence, to infect the air, and through the air to gain access to living
being, as it is for the vice of a superior to take most speedy possession of his subjects, and
that with far greater facility than virtue its opposite. For it is in this that wickedness especially
has the advantage over goodness, and most distressing it is to me to perceive it, that vice is
something attractive and ready at hand, and that nothing is so easy as to become evil, even
without any one to lead us on to it; while the attainment of virtue is rare and difficult, even
where there is much to attract and encourage us. And it is this, I think, which the most
blessed Haggai had before his eyes, in his wonderful and most true figure:2570—“Ask the
priests concerning the law, saying: If holy flesh borne in a garment touch meat or drink or
vessel, will it sanctify what is in contact with it? And when they said No; ask again if any of
these things touch what is unclean, does it not at once partake of the pollution? For they
will surely tell you that it does partake of it, and does not continue clean in spite of the
contact.”</p>
<p>12. What does he mean by this? As I take it, that goodness can with difficulty gain a
hold upon human nature, like fire upon green wood; while most men are ready and disposed
to join in evil, like stubble,2571 I mean, ready for a spark and a wind, which is easily kindled
and consumed from its dryness. For more quickly would any one take part in evil with
slight inducement to its full extent, than in good which is fully set before him to a slight

degree. For indeed a little wormwood most quickly imparts its bitterness to honey; while
not even double the quantity of honey can impart its sweetness to wormwood: and the
withdrawal of a small pebble would draw headlong a whole river, though it would be difficult
for the strongest dam to restrain or stay its course.</p>
<p>13. This then is the first point in what we have said, which it is right for us to guard
against, viz.: being found to be bad painters2572 of the charms of virtue, and still more, if
not, perhaps, models for poor painters, poor models for the people, or barely escaping the
proverb, that we undertake to heal others2573 while ourselves are full of sores.</p>
<p>14. In the second place, although a man has kept himself pure from sin, even in a very
high degree; I do not know that even this is sufficient for one who is to instruct others in
virtue. For he who has received this charge, not only needs to be free from evil, for evil is,
in the eyes of most of those under his care, most disgraceful, but also to be eminent in good,
according to the command, “Depart from evil and do good.”2574 And he must not only
wipe out the traces of vice from his soul, but also inscribe better ones, so as to outstrip men
further in virtue than he is superior to them in dignity. He should know no limits in goodness
or spiritual progress, and should dwell upon the loss of what is still beyond him, rather than
the gain of what he has attained, and consider that which is beneath his feet a step to that
which comes next: and not think it a great gain to excel ordinary people, but a loss to fall
short of what we ought to be: and to measure his success by the commandment and not by
his neighbours, whether they be evil, or to some extent proficient in virtue: and to weigh
virtue in no small scales, inasmuch as it is due to the Most High, “from Whom are all things,
and to Whom are all things.”2575</p>
<p>15. Nor must he suppose that the same things are suitable to all, just as all have not the
same stature, nor are the features of the face, nor the nature of animals, nor the qualities of
soil, nor the beauty and size of the stars, in all cases the same: but he must consider base
conduct a fault in a private individual, and deserving of chastisement under the hard rule
of the law; while in the case of a ruler or leader it is a fault not to attain to the highest possible
excellence, and always make progress in goodness, if indeed he is, by his high degree of
virtue, to draw his people to an ordinary degree, not by the force of authority, but by the
influence of persuasion. For what is involuntary apart from its being the result of oppression,
is neither meritorious nor durable. For what is forced, like a plant2576 violently drawn aside
by our hands, when set free, returns to what it was before, but that which is the result of

choice is both most legitimate and enduring, for it is preserved by the bond of good will.
And so our law and our lawgiver enjoin upon us most strictly that we should “tend the flock
not by constraint but willingly.”2577</p>
<p>16. But granted that a man is free from vice, and has reached the greatest heights of
virtue: I do not see what knowledge or power would justify him in venturing upon this office.
For the guiding of man, the most variable and manifold of creatures, seems to me in very
deed to be the art of arts2578 and science of sciences. Any one may recognize this, by comparing
the work of the physician of souls with the treatment of the body; and noticing that,
laborious as the latter is, ours is more laborious, and of more consequence, from the nature
of its subject matter, the power of its science, and the object of its exercise. The one labours
about bodies, and perishable failing matter, which absolutely must be dissolved and undergo
its fate,2579 even if upon this occasion by the aid of art it can surmount the disturbance
within itself, being dissolved by disease or time in submission to the law of nature, since it
cannot rise above its own limitations.</p>
<p>17. The other is concerned with the soul, which comes from God and is divine, and
partakes of the heavenly nobility, and presses on to it, even if it be bound to an inferior
nature. Perhaps indeed there are other reasons also for this, which only God, Who bound
them together, and those who are instructed by God in such mysteries, can know, but as far
as I, and men like myself can perceive, there are two: one, that it may inherit the glory above
by means of a struggle and wrestling2580 with things below, being tried as gold in the fire2581
by things here, and gain the objects of our hope as a prize of virtue, and not merely as the
gift of God. This, indeed, was the will of Supreme Goodness, to make the good even our
own, not only because sown in our nature, but because cultivated by our own choice, and
by the motions of our will,2582 free to act in either direction. The second reason is, that it
may draw to itself and raise to heaven the lower nature, by gradually freeing it from its
grossness, in order that the soul may be to the body what God is to the soul, itself leading
on the matter which ministers to it, and uniting it, as its fellow-servant, to God.</p>

desires of the sick may not be a hindrance to his art. Sometimes, and in certain cases, he
will make use of the cautery or the knife or the severer remedies; but none of these, laborious
and hard as they may seem, is so difficult as the diagnosis and cure of our habits, passions,
lives, wills, and whatever else is within us, by banishing from our compound nature
everything brutal and fierce, and introducing and establishing in their stead what is gentle
and dear to God, and arbitrating fairly between soul and body; not allowing the superior to
be overpowered by the inferior, which would be the greatest injustice; but subjecting to the
ruling and leading power that which naturally takes the second place: as indeed the divine
law enjoins, which is most excellently imposed on His whole creation, whether visible or
beyond our ken.</p>
<p>19. This further point does not escape me, that the nature of all these objects of the
watchfulness of the physician remains the same, and does not evolve out of itself any crafty
opposition, or contrivance hostile to the appliances of his art, nay, it is rather the treatment
which modifies its subject matter,2583 except where some slight insubordination occurs on
the part of the patient, which it is not difficult to prevent or restrain. But in our case, human
prudence and selfishness, and the want of training and inclination to yield ready submission
are a very great obstacle to advance in virtue, amounting almost to an armed resistance to
those who are wishful to help us. And the very eagerness with which we should lay bare
our sickness to our spiritual physicians, we employ in avoiding this treatment,2584 and shew
our bravery by struggling against what is for our own interest, our skill in shunning what
is for our health.</p>
<p>20. For we either hide away our sin, cloaking it over in the depth of our soul, like some
festering and malignant disease, as if by escaping the notice of men we could escape the
mighty eye of God and justice. Or else we allege excuses in our sins,2585 by devising pleas
in defence of our falls, or tightly closing our ears, like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ears,
we are obstinate in refusing to hear the voice of the charmer, and be treated with the medicines
of wisdom,2586 by which spiritual sickness is healed. Or, lastly, those of us who are
most daring and self-willed shamelessly brazen out our sin before those who would heal it,
marching with bared head, as the saying is, into all kinds of transgression. O what madness,
if there be no term more fitting for this state of mind! Those whom we ought to love as our
benefactors we keep off, as if they were our enemies, hating those who reprove in the gates,
and abhorring the righteous word;2587 and we think that we shall succeed in the war that

we are waging against those who are well disposed to us by doing ourselves all the harm we
can, like men who imagine they are consuming the flesh of others when they are really
fastening upon their own.</p>
<p>21. For these reasons I allege that our office as physicians far exceeds in toilsomeness,
and consequently in worth, that which is confined to the body; and further, because the
latter is mainly concerned with the surface, and only in a slight degree investigates the causes
which are deeply hidden. But the whole of our treatment and exertion is concerned with
the hidden man of the heart,2588 and our warfare is directed against that adversary and foe
within us, who uses ourselves as his weapons against ourselves, and, most fearful of all,
hands us over to the death of sin. In opposition then, to these foes we are in need of great
and perfect faith, and of still greater co-operation on the part of God, and, as I am persuaded,
of no slight countermanoeuvring on our own part, which must manifest itself both in word
and deed, if ourselves, the most precious possession we have, are to be duly tended and
cleansed and made as deserving as possible.</p>
<p>22. To turn however to the ends in view in each of these forms of healing, for this point
is still left to be considered, the one preserves, if it already exists, the health and good habit
of the flesh, or if absent, recalls it; though it is not yet clear whether or not these will be for
the advantage of those who possess them, since their opposites very often confer a greater
benefit on those who have them, just as poverty and wealth, renown or disgrace, a low or
brilliant position, and all other circumstances, which are naturally indifferent, and do not
incline in one direction more than in another, produce a good or bad effect according to
the will of, and the manner in which they are used by the persons who experience them.
But the scope of our art is to provide the soul with wings, to rescue it from the world and
give it to God, and to watch over that which is in His image,2589 if it abides, to take it by the
hand, if it is in danger, or restore it, if ruined, to make Christ to dwell in the heart2590 by
the Spirit: and, in short, to deify, and bestow heavenly bliss upon, one who belongs to the
heavenly host.</p>
<p>23. This is the wish of our schoolmaster2591 the law, of the prophets who intervened
between Christ and the law, of Christ who is the fulfiller and end2592 of the spiritual law; of
the emptied Godhead,2593 of the assumed flesh,2594 of the novel union between God and

man, one consisting2595 of two, and both in one. This is why God was united2596 to the
flesh by means of the soul,2597 and natures so separate were knit together by the affinity to
each of the element which mediated between them: so all became one for the sake of all,
and for the sake of one, our progenitor, the soul because of the soul which was disobedient,
the flesh because of the flesh which co-operated with it and shared in its condemnation,
Christ, Who was superior to, and beyond the reach of, sin, because of Adam, who became
subject to sin.</p>
<p>24. This is why the new was substituted for the old,2598 why He Who suffered was for
suffering recalled to life, why each property of His, Who was above us, was interchanged
with each of ours, why the new mystery took place of the dispensation, due to loving kindness
which deals with him who fell through disobedience. This is the reason for the generation
and the virgin, for the manger and Bethlehem; the generation on behalf of the creation,2599
the virgin on behalf of the woman,2600 Bethlehem2601 because of Eden, the manger because
of the garden, small and visible things on behalf of great and hidden things. This is why the
angels2602 glorified first the heavenly, then the earthly,2603 why the shepherds saw the glory
over the Lamb and the Shepherd, why the star led the Magi to worship and offer gifts,2604
in order that idolatry might be destroyed. This is why Jesus was baptized,2605 and received
testimony from above, and fasted,2606 and was tempted, and overcame him who had overcome.
This is why devils were cast out,2607 and diseases healed, and the mighty preaching
was entrusted to, and successfully proclaimed by men of low estate.</p>

is set over against tree,2610 hands against hand, the one stretched out in self indulgence,2611
the others in generosity; the one unrestrained, the others fixed by nails,2612 the one expelling
Adam, the other reconciling the ends of the earth. This is the reason of the lifting up to
atone for the fall, and of the gall for the tasting, and of the thorny crown for the dominion
of evil, and of death for death, and of darkness for the sake of light, and of burial for the return
to the ground, and of resurrection for the sake of resurrection.2613 All these are a training
from God for us, and a healing for our weakness, restoring the old Adam to the place whence
he fell, and conducting us to the tree of life,2614 from which the tree of knowledge estranged
us, when partaken of unseasonably, and improperly.</p>
<p>26. Of this healing we, who are set over others, are the ministers and fellow-labourers;2615
for whom it is a great thing to recognise and heal their own passions and sicknesses: or
rather, not really a great thing, only the viciousness of most of those who belong to this order
has made me say so: but a much greater thing is the power to heal and skilfully cleanse
those of others, to the advantage both of those who are in want of healing and of those whose
charge it is to heal.</p>
<p>27. Again, the healers of our bodies will have their labours and vigils and cares, of which
we are aware; and will reap a harvest of pain for themselves from the distresses of others,
as one of their wise men2616 said; and will provide for the use of those who need them, both
the results of their own labours and investigations, and what they have been able to borrow
from others: and they consider none, even of the minutest details, which they discover, or
which elude their search, as having other than an important influence upon health or danger.

if a man be sane and sensible, to seek to be set free?</p>
<p>28. But we, upon whose efforts is staked the salvation of a soul, a being blessed and
immortal, and destined for undying chastisement or praise, for its vice or virtue,—what a
struggle ought ours to be, and how great skill do we require to treat, or get men treated
properly, and to change their life, and give up the clay to the spirit. For men and women,
young and old, rich and poor, the sanguine and despondent, the sick and whole, rulers and
ruled, the wise and ignorant, the cowardly and courageous, the wrathful and meek, the
successful and failing, do not require the same instruction and encouragement.</p>
<p>29. And if you examine more closely, how great is the distinction between the married
and the unmarried, and among the latter between hermits and those who2617 live together
in community, between those who are proficient and advanced in contemplation and those
who barely hold on the straight course, between townsfolk again and rustics, between the
simple and the designing, between men of business and men of leisure, between those who
have met with reverses and those who are prosperous and ignorant of misfortune. For these
classes differ sometimes more widely from each other in their desires and passion than in
their physical characteristics; or, if you will, in the mixtures and blendings of the elements
of which we are composed, and, therefore, to regulate them is no easy task.</p>
<p>30. As then the same medicine and the same food are not in every case administered
to men’s bodies, but a difference is made according to their degree of health or infirmity;
so also are souls treated with varying instruction and guidance. To this treatment witness
is borne by those who have had experience of it. Some are led by doctrine, others trained
by example; some need the spur, others the curb; some are sluggish and hard to rouse to
the good, and must be stirred up by being smitten with the word; others are immoderately
fervent in spirit, with impulses difficult to restrain, like thoroughbred colts, who run wide
of the turning post, and to improve them the word must have a restraining and checking
influence.</p>

if out of season, or unreasonable, they are injurious; some are set right by encouragement,

and hearing not to hear them, according to the proverb, that we may not drive them to
despair, under the depressing influence of repeated reproofs, and at last to utter recklessness,
when they have lost the sense of self-respect, the source of persuasiveness.2618 In some
cases we must even be angry, without feeling angry, or treat them with a disdain we do not
feel, or manifest despair, though we do not really despair of them, according to the needs
of their nature. Others again we must treat with condescension2619 and lowliness, aiding
them readily to conceive a hope of better things. Some it is often more advantageous to
conquer—by others to be overcome, and to praise or deprecate, in one case wealth and
power, in another poverty and failure.</p>
<p>33. For our treatment does not correspond with virtue and vice, one of which is most
excellent and beneficial at all times and in all cases, and the other most evil and harmful;
and, instead of one and the same of our medicines invariably proving either most wholesome
or most dangerous in the same cases—be it severity or gentleness, or any of the others which
we have enumerated—in some cases it proves good and useful, in others again it has the
contrary effect, according, I suppose, as time and circumstance and the disposition of the
patient admit. Now to set before you the distinction between all these things, and give you
a perfectly exact view of them, so that you may in brief comprehend the medical art, is quite
impossible, even for one in the highest degree qualified by care and skill: but actual experience
and practice are requisite to form2620 a medical system and a medical man.</p>
<p>34. This, however, I take to be generally admitted—that just as it is not safe for those
who walk on a lofty tight rope to lean to either side, for even though the inclination seems
<note type="footnote">2618 The source of persuasiveness, lit., “the medicine of persuasion.”</note>

<pb n="440"/>
slight, it has no slight consequences, but their safety depends upon their perfect balance:
so in the case of one of us, if he leans to either side, whether from vice or ignorance, no slight
danger of a fall into sin is incurred, both for himself and those who are led by him. But we
must really walk in the King’s highway,2621 and take care not to turn aside from it either to
the right hand or to the left,2622 as the Proverbs say. For such is the case with our passions,
and such in this matter is the task of the good shepherd, if he is to know properly the souls
of his flock, and to guide them according to the methods of a pastoral care which is right
and just, and worthy of our true Shepherd.</p>
<p>35. In regard to the distribution of the word, to mention last the first of our duties, of
that divine and exalted word, which everyone now is ready to discourse upon; if anyone
else boldly undertakes it and supposes it within the power of every man’s intellect, I am
amazed at his intelligence, not to say his folly. To me indeed it seems no slight task, and
one requiring no little spiritual power, to give in due season2623 to each his portion of the
word, and to regulate with judgment the truth of our opinions, which are concerned with
such subjects as the world or worlds,2624 matter, soul, mind, intelligent natures, better or
worse, providence which holds together and guides the universe, and seems in our experience
of it to be governed according to some principle, but one which is at variance with those of
earth and of men.</p>
<p>36. Again, they are concerned with our original constitution, and final restoration, the
types of the truth, the covenants, the first and second coming of Christ, His incarnation,
sufferings and dissolution,2625 with the resurrection, the last day, the judgment and recompense,
whether sad or glorious; I, to crown all, with what we are to think of the original2626
and blessed Trinity. Now this involves a very great risk to those who are charged with the
illumination2627 of others, if they are to avoid contracting2628 their doctrine to a single
Person, from fear of polytheism, and so leave us empty terms, if we suppose the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit to be one and the same Person only: or, on the other hand,
severing It into three, either foreign and diverse, or disordered and unprincipled, and, so

like some distorted plant if bent far back in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>37. For, amid the three infirmities in regard to theology, atheism, Judaism, and polytheism,
one of which is patronised by Sabellius the Libyan, another by Arius of Alexandria,
and the third by some of the ultra-orthodox among us, what is my position, can I avoid
whatever in these three is noxious, and remain within the limits of piety; neither being led
astray by the new analysis and synthesis into the atheism2629 of Sabellius, to assert not so
much that all are one as that each is nothing, for things which are transferred and pass into
each other cease to be that which each one of them is, of that we have an unnaturally compound
deity, like those mythical creatures, the subject of a picturesque imagination: nor
again, by alleging a plurality of severed natures, according to the well named madness2630
of Arius, becoming involved in a Jewish poverty, and introducing envy into the divine
nature, by limiting the Godhead to the Unbegotten One alone, as if afraid that our God
would perish, if He were the Father of a real God of equal nature: nor again, by arraying
three principles in opposition to, or in alliance with, each other, introducing the Gentile
plurality of principles from which we have escaped?</p>
<p>38. It is necessary neither to be so devoted to the Father, as to rob Him of His Fatherhood,
for whose Father would He be, if the Son were separated and estranged from Him,
by being ranked with the creation, (for an alien being, or one which is combined and confounded
with his father, and, for the sense is the same, throws him into confusion, is not a
son); nor to be so devoted to Christ, as to neglect to preserve both His Sonship, (for whose
son would He be, if His origin were not referred to the Father?) and the rank of the Father
as origin, inasmuch as He is the Father and Generator; for He would be the origin of petty
and unworthy beings, or rather the term would be used in a petty and unworthy sense, if
He were not the origin of Godhead and goodness, which are contemplated in the Son and
the Spirit: the former being the Son and the Word, the latter the proceeding and indissoluble
Spirit. For both the Unity of the Godhead must be preserved, and the Trinity of Persons
confessed, each with His own property.</p>
<p>39. A suitable and worthy comprehension and exposition of this subject demands a
discussion of greater length than the present occasion, or even our life, as I suppose, allows,
and, what is more, both now and at all times, the aid of the Spirit, by Whom alone we are
able to perceive, to expound, or to embrace, the truth in regard to God. For the pure alone

can grasp Him Who is pure and of the same disposition as himself; and I have now briefly
dwelt upon the subject, to show how difficult it is to discuss such important questions, especially
before a large audience, composed of every age and condition, and needing like an
instrument of many strings, to be played upon in various ways; or to find any form of words
able to edify them all, and illuminate them with the light of knowledge. For it is not only
that there are three sources from which danger springs, understanding, speech, and hearing,
so that failure in one, if not in all, is infallibly certain; for either the mind is not illuminated,
or the language is feeble, or the hearing, not having been cleansed, fails to comprehend, and
accordingly, in one or all respects, the truth must be maimed: but further, what makes the
instruction of those who profess to teach any other subject so easy and acceptable—viz. the
piety2631 of the audience—on this subject involves difficulty and danger.</p>
<p>40. For having undertaken to contend on behalf of God, the Supreme Being, and of
salvation, and of the primary hope2632 of us all, the more fervent they are in the faith, the
more hostile are they to what is said, supposing that a submissive spirit indicates, not piety,
but treason to the truth, and therefore they would sacrifice anything rather than their private
convictions, and the accustomed doctrines in which they have been educated. I am now
referring to those who are moderate and not utterly depraved in disposition, who, if they
have erred in regard to the truth, have erred from piety, who have zeal, though not according
to knowledge,2633 who will possibly be of the number of those not excessively condemned,
and not beaten with many stripes,2634 because it is not through vice or depravity that they
have failed to do the will of their Lord; and these perchance would be persuaded and forsake
the pious opinion which is the cause of their hostility, if some reason either from their own
minds, or from others, were to take hold of them, and at a critical moment, like iron from
flint, strike fire from a mind which is pregnant and worthy of the light, for thus a little spark
would quickly kindle the torch of truth within it.</p>
<note type="footnote">2631 Piety, εὐλάβεια. i.e. The pious readily and attentively receive instruction in morality or generally received

<p>41. But what is to be said of those who, from vain glory or arrogance, speak unrighteousness
against the most High,2635 arming themselves with the insolence of Jannes and
Jambres,2636 not against Moses, but against the truth, and rising in opposition to sound
doctrine? Or of the third class, who through ignorance and, its consequence, temerity, rush
headlong against every form of doctrine in swinish fashion, and trample under foot the fair
pearls2637 of the truth?</p>
<p>42. What again of those who come with no private idea, or form of words, better or
worse, in regard to God, but listen to all kinds of doctrines and teachers, with the intention
of selecting from all what is best and safest, in reliance upon no better judges of the truth
than themselves? They are, in consequence, borne and turned about hither and thither by
one plausible idea after another, and, after being deluged and trodden down by all kinds of
doctrine,2638 and having rung the changes on a long succession of teachers and formulæ,
which they throw to the winds as readily as dust, their ears and minds at last are wearied
out, and, O what folly! they become equally disgusted with all forms of doctrine, and assume
the wretched character of deriding and despising our faith as unstable and unsound; passing
in their ignorance from the teachers to the doctrine: as if anyone whose eyes were diseased,
or whose ears had been injured, were to complain of the sun for being dim and not shining,
or of sounds for being inharmonious and feeble.</p>
<p>43. Accordingly, to impress the truth upon a soul when it is still fresh, like wax not yet
subjected to the seal, is an easier task than inscribing pious doctrine on the top of inscriptions—
I mean wrong doctrines and dogmas2639—with the result that the former are confused
and thrown into disorder by the latter. It is better indeed to tread a road which is smooth
and well trodden than one which is untrodden and rough, or to plough land which has often
been cleft and broken up by the plough: but a soul to be written upon should be free from
the inscription of harmful doctrines, or the deeply cut marks of vice: otherwise the pious
inscriber would have a twofold task, the erasure of the former impressions and the substitution
of others which are more excellent, and more worthy to abide. So numerous are they
whose wickedness is shown, not only by yielding to their passions, but even by their utterances,
and so numerous the forms and characters of wickedness, and so considerable the
task of one who has been intrusted with this office of educating and taking charge of souls.
Indeed I have omitted the majority of the details, lest my speech should be unnecessarily
burdensome.</p>

<p>44. If anyone were to undertake to tame and train an animal of many forms and shapes,
compounded of many animals of various sizes and degrees of tameness and wildness, his
principal task, involving a considerable struggle, would be the government of so extraordinary
and heterogeneous a nature, since each of the animals of which it is compounded would,
according to its nature or habit, be differently affected with joy, pleasure or dislike, by the
same words, or food, or stroking with the hand, or whistling, or other modes of treatment.
And what must the master of such an animal do, but show himself manifold and various in
his knowledge, and apply to each a treatment suitable for it, so as successfully to lead and
preserve the beast? And since the common body of the church is composed of many different
characters and minds, like a single animal compounded of discordant parts, it is absolutely
necessary that its ruler should be at once simple in his uprightness in all respects, and as far
as possible manifold and varied in his treatment of individuals, and in dealing with all in
an appropriate and suitable manner.</p>
<p>45. For some need to be fed with the milk2640 of the most simple and elementary doctrines,
viz., those who are in habit babes and, so to say, new-made, and unable to bear the
manly food of the word: nay, if it were presented to them beyond their strength, they would
probably be overwhelmed and oppressed, owing to the inability of their mind, as is the case
with our material bodies,2641 to digest and appropriate what is offered to it, and so would
lose even their original power. Others require the wisdom which is spoken among the perfect,
2642 and the higher and more solid food, since their senses have been sufficiently exercised
to discern2643 truth and falsehood, and if they were made to drink milk, and fed on
the vegetable diet of invalids,2644 they would be annoyed. And with good reason, for they
would not be strengthened2645 according to Christ, nor make that laudable increase, which
the Word produces in one who is rightly fed, by making him a perfect man, and bringing
him to the measure of spiritual stature.2646</p>

with water, mix, that is, our doctrine with what is common and cheap, and debased, and
stale, and tasteless, in order to turn the adulteration to our profit, and accommodate ourselves
to those who meet us, and curry favor with everyone, becoming ventriloquists2650 and
chatterers, who serve their own pleasures by words uttered from the earth, and sinking into
the earth, and, to gain the special good will of the multitude, injuring in the highest degree,
nay, ruining ourselves, and shedding the innocent blood of simpler souls, which will be required
at our hands.2651</p>
<p>47. Besides, we are aware that it is better to offer our own reins to others more skilful
than ourselves, than, while inexperienced, to guide the course of others, and rather to give
a kindly hearing than stir an untrained tongue; and after a discussion of these points with
advisers who are, I fancy, of no mean worth, and, at any rate, wish us well, we preferred to
learn those canons of speech and action which we did not know, rather than undertake to
teach them in our ignorance. For it is delightful to have the reasoning2652 of the aged come
to one even until the depth of old age, able, as it is, to aid a soul new to piety. Accordingly,
to undertake the training of others before being sufficiently trained oneself, and to learn, as
men say, the potter’s art on a wine-jar, that is, to practise ourselves in piety at the expense
of others’ souls seems to me to be excessive folly or excessive rashness—folly, if we are not
even aware of our own ignorance; rashness, if in spite of this knowledge we venture on the
task.</p>

most excellent and praiseworthy law,2653 that every age was not entrusted with the whole
of Scripture, inasmuch as this would not be the more profitable course, since the whole of
it is not at once intelligible to everyone, and its more recondite parts would, by their apparent
meaning, do a very great injury to most people. Some portions therefore, whose exterior2654
is unexceptionable, are from the first permitted and common to all; while others are only
entrusted to those who have attained their twenty-fifth year, viz., such as hide their mystical
beauty under a mean-looking cloak, to be the reward of diligence and an illustrious life;
flashing forth and presenting itself only to those whose mind has been purified, on the
ground that this age alone2655 can be superior to the body, and properly rise from the letter

like the stones of old between the tribes within and beyond the Jordan: nor is a certain
part entrusted to some, another to others; nor any rule for degrees2656 of experience; but
the matter has been so disturbed and thrown into confusion, that most of us, not to say all,
almost before we have lost our childish curls and lisp, before we have entered the house of
God, before we know even the names of the Sacred Books, before we have learnt the character
and authors of the Old and New Testaments: (for my present point is not our want of
cleansing from the mire and marks of spiritual shame which our viciousness has contracted)
if, I say, we have furnished ourselves with two or three expressions of pious authors, and
that by hearsay, not by study; if we have had a brief experience of David, or clad ourselves
properly in a cloaklet, or are wearing at least a philosopher’s girdle, or have girt about us
some form and appearance of piety—phew! how we take the chair and show our spirit!
Samuel was holy even in his swaddling-clothes:2657 we are at once wise teachers, of high
estimation in Divine things, the first of scribes and lawyers; we ordain ourselves men of
heaven and seek to be called Rabbi by men;2658 the letter is nowhere, everything is to be
understood spiritually, and our dreams are utter drivel, and we should be annoyed if we
were not lauded to excess. This is the case with the better and more simple of us: what of
those who are more spiritual and noble?2659 After frequently condemning us, as men of
no account, they have forsaken us, and abhor fellowship with impious people such as we
are.</p>
<p>50. Now, if we were to speak gently to one of them, advancing, as follows, step by step
in argument: “Tell me, my good sir, do you call dancing anything, and flute-playing?”
“Certainly,” they would say. “What then of wisdom and being wise, which we venture to
define as a knowledge of things divine and human?” This also they will admit. “Are then
these accomplishments better than and superior to wisdom, or wisdom by far better than
these?” “Better even than all things,” I know well that they will say. Up to this point they
are judicious. “Well, dancing and flute-playing require to be taught and learnt, a process
which takes time, and much toil in the sweat of the brow, and sometimes the payment of
fees, and entreaties for initiation, and long absence from home, and all else which must be
done and borne for the acquisition of experience: but as for wisdom, which is chief of all
things, and holds in her embrace everything which is good, so that even God himself prefers
this title to all the names which He is called; are we to suppose that it is a matter of such

slight consequence, and so accessible, that we need but wish, and we would be wise?” “It
would be utter folly to do so.” If we, or any learned and prudent man, were to say this to
them, and try by degrees to cleanse them from their error, it would be sowing upon rocks,2660
and speaking to ears of men who will not hear:2661 so far are they from being even wise
enough to perceive their own ignorance. And we may rightly, in my opinion, apply to them
the saying of Solomon: There is an evil which I have seen under the sun,2662 a man wise in
his own conceit;2663 and a still greater evil is to charge with the instruction of others a man
who is not even aware of his own ignorance.</p>
<p>51. This is a state of mind which demands, in special degree, our tears and groans, and
has often stirred my pity, from the conviction that imagination robs us in great measure of
reality, and that vain glory is a great hindrance to men’s attainment of virtue. To heal and
stay this disease needs a Peter or Paul, those great disciples of Christ, who in addition to
guidance in word and deed, received their grace,2664 and became all things to all men, that
they might gain all.2665 But for other men like ourselves, it is a great thing to be rightly
guided and led by those who have been charged with the correction and setting right of
things such as these.</p>
<p>52. Since, however, I have mentioned Paul, and men like him, I will, with your permission,
pass by all others who have been foremost as lawgivers, prophets, or leaders, or in any
similar office—for instance, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Elijah, Elisha, the Judges, Samuel, David,
the company of Prophets, John, the Twelve Apostles, and their successors, who with many
toils and labors exercised their authority, each in his own time; all these I pass by, to set
forth Paul as the witness to my assertions, and for us to consider by his example how important
a matter is the care of souls, and whether it requires slight attention and little judgment.
But that we may recognize and perceive this, let us hear what Paul himself says of Paul.</p>
<p>53. I say nothing of his labours, his watchings, his sufferings in hunger and thirst, in
cold and nakedness, his assailants from without, his adversaries within.2666 I pass over the

2686 at one time he condescends, at another he raises to his own level; at one time he
threatens a rod,2687 at another he offers the spirit of meekness; at one time he is haughty
toward the lofty, at another lowly toward the lowly. Now he is least of the apostles,2688 now
he offers a proof of Christ speaking in him;2689 now he longs for departure and is being
poured forth as a libation,2690 now he thinks it more necessary for their sakes to abide in
the flesh. For he seeks not his own interests, but those of his children,2691 whom he has
begotten in Christ by the gospel.2692 This is the aim of all his spiritual authority, in everything
to neglect his own in comparison with the advantage of others.</p>
<p>55. He glories in his infirmities and distresses. He takes pleasure in the dying of Jesus,
2693 as if it were a kind of ornament. He is lofty in carnal things,2694 he rejoices in things
spiritual; he is not rude in knowledge,2695 and claims to see in a mirror, darkly.2696 He is
bold in spirit, and buffets his body,2697 throwing it as an antagonist. What is the lesson and
instruction he would thus impress upon us? Not to be proud of earthly things, or puffed
up by knowledge, or excite the flesh against the spirit. He fights for all, prays for all, is jealous
for all, is kindled on behalf of all, whether without law, or under the law; a preacher of the
Gentiles,2698 a patron of the Jews. He even was exceedingly bold on behalf of his brethren
according to the flesh,2699 if I may myself be bold enough to say so, in his loving prayer that
they might in his stead be brought to Christ. What magnanimity! what fervor of spirit! He

sicknesses;2701 or, to use more measured terms, he is ready, next to Christ, to suffer anything,
even as one of the ungodly, for them, if only they be saved.</p>
<p>56. Why should I enter into detail? He lived not to himself, but to Christ and his
preaching. He crucified the world to himself,2702 and being crucified to the world and the
things which are seen, he thought all things little,2703 and too small to be desired; even
though from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum2704 he had fully preached the
Gospel, even though he had been prematurely caught up to the third heaven, and had a
vision of Paradise, and had heard unspeakable words.2705 Such was Paul, and everyone of
like spirit with him. But we fear that, in comparison with them, we may be foolish princes
of Zoan,2706 or extortioners, who exact the fruits of the ground, or falsely bless the
people:2707 and further make themselves happy, and confuse the way of your feet,2708 or
mockers ruling over you, or children in authority,2709 immature in mind, not even having
bread and clothing enough to be rulers over any;2710 or prophets teaching lies,2711 or rebellious
princes,2712 deserving to share the reproach of their elders for the straitness of the
famine,2713 or priests very far from speaking comfortably2714 to Jerusalem, according to
the reproaches and protests urged by Isaiah, who was purged by the Seraphim with a live
coal.2715</p>
<p>57. Is the undertaking then so serious and laborious to a sensitive and sad heart—a very
rottenness to the bones2716 of a sensible man: while the danger is slight, and a fall not worth
consideration? Nay the blessed Hosea inspires me with serious alarm, where he says that

men’s souls, and he threatens to cut off the wicked prophets,2718 and devour their judges
with fire, and to cease for a while from anointing a king and princes,2719 because they ruled
for themselves, and not by Him.2720</p>
<p>58. Hence again the divine Micah, unable to brook the building of Zion with blood,
however you interpret the phrase, and of Jerusalem with iniquity, while the heads thereof
judge for reward, and the priests teach for hire, and the prophets divine for money—what
does he say will be the result of this? Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem be as a
lodge in a garden, and the mountain of the house be reckoned as a glade in a thicket.2721
He bewails also the scarcity of the upright, there being scarcely a stalk or a gleaning grape
left, since both the prince asketh, and the judge curries favour,2722 so that his language is
almost the same as the mighty David’s: Save me, O Lord, for the godly man ceaseth:2723
and says that therefore their blessings shall fail them, as if wasted by the moth.</p>
<p>59. Joel again summons us to wailing, and will have the ministers of the altar lament
under the presence of famine: so far is he from allowing us to revel in the misfortunes of
others: and, after sanctifying a fast, calling a solemn assembly, and gathering the old men,
the children, and those of tender age,2724 we ourselves must further haunt the temple in
sackcloth and ashes,2725 prostrated right humbly on the ground, because the field is wasted,
and the meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the Lord, till we
draw down mercy by our humiliation.</p>
<p>60. What of Habakkuk? He utters more heated words, and is impatient with God
Himself, and cries down, as it were our good Lord, because of the injustice of the judges.
O Lord, how long shall I cry and Thou wilt not hear? Shall I cry out unto Thee of violence,
and Thou wilt not save? Why dost Thou show me toil and labour, causing me to look upon
perverseness and impiety? Judgment has been given against me, and the judge is a spoiler.
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth. Then comes the denunciation,
and what follows upon it. Behold, ye despisers, and regard, and wonder marvellously,
and vanish away, for I work a work.2726 But why need I quote the whole of the denunciation?

A little further on, however, for I think it best to add this to what has been said, after upbraiding
and lamenting many of those who are in some respect unjust or depraved, he upbraids
the leaders and teachers of wickedness, stigmatising vice as a foul disorder, and an
intoxication and aberration of mind; charging them with giving their neighbours drink in
order to look upon the darkness of their soul,2727 and the dens of creeping things and wild
beasts, viz.: the dwelling places of wicked thoughts. Such indeed they are, and such teachings
do they discuss with us.</p>
<p>61. How can it be right to pass by Malachi, who at one time brings bitter charges against
the priests, and reproaches them with despising the name of the Lord,2728 and explains
wherein they did this, by offering polluted bread upon the altar, and meat which is not
firstfruits, which they would not have offered to one of their governors, or, if they had offered
it, they would have been dishonoured; yet offering these in fulfilment of a vow to the King
of the universe, to wit, the lame and the sick, and the deformed, which are utterly profane
and loathsome.2729 Again he reminds them of the covenant of God, a covenant of life and
peace, with the sons of Levi, and that they should serve Him in fear, and stand in awe of the
manifestation of His Name. The law of truth, he says, was in his mouth, and unrighteousness
was not found in his lips; he walked with me uprightly in peace, and turned away many
from iniquity: for the priest’s lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his
mouth. And how honourable and at the same time how fearful is the cause! for he is the
messenger of the Lord Almighty.2730 Although I pass over the following imprecations, as
strongly worded,2731 yet I am afraid of their truth. This however may be cited without offence,
to our profit. Is it right, he says, to regard your sacrifice, and receive it with good will
at your hands,2732 as if he were most highly incensed, and rejecting their ministrations
owing to their wickedness.</p>
<p>62. Whenever I remember Zechariah, I shudder at the reaping-hook,2733 and likewise
at his testimony against the priests, his hints in reference to the celebrated Joshua, the high
priest, whom he represents as stripped of filthy and unbecoming garments and then clothed
in rich priestly apparel.2734 As for the words and charges to Joshua which he puts into the
angel’s mouth, let them be treated with silent respect, as referring perhaps to a greater2735

and higher object than those who are many priests:2736 but even at his right hand stood
the devil, to resist him. A fact, in my eyes, of no slight significance, and demanding no slight
fear and watchfulness.</p>
<p>63. Who is so bold and adamantine of soul as not to tremble and be abashed at the
charges and reproaches deliberately urged against the rest of the shepherds. A voice, he
says, of the howling of the shepherds, for their glory is spoiled. A voice of the roaring of
lions,2737 for this hath befallen them. Does he not all but hear the wailing as if close at hand,
and himself wail with the afflicted. A little further is a more striking and impassioned strain.
Feed, he says, the flock of slaughter, whose possessors slay them without repentance, and
they that sell them say, “Blessed be the Lord, for we are rich:” and their own shepherds are
without feeling for them. Therefore, I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith
the Lord Almighty.2738 And again: Awake, O sword, against the shepherds, and smite the
shepherds, and scatter the sheep, and I will turn My Hand upon the shepherds;2739 and,
Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit the lambs:2740 adding to the
threat those who rule over the people. So industriously does he apply himself to his task
that he cannot easily free himself from denunciations, and I am afraid that, did I refer to
the whole series, I should exhaust your patience. This must then suffice for Zechariah.</p>
<p>64. Passing by the elders in the book of Daniel;2741 for it is better to pass them by, together
with the Lord’s righteous sentence and declaration concerning them, that wickedness
came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people; how are we affected
by Ezekiel, the beholder and expositor of the mighty mysteries and visions? By his
injunction to the watchmen2742 not to keep silence concerning vice and the sword impending
over it, a course which would profit neither themselves nor the sinners; but rather to keep
watch and forewarn, and thus benefit, at any rate those who gave warning, if not both those
who spoke and those who heard?</p>
<p>65. What of his further invective against the shepherds, Woe shall come upon woe, and
rumour upon rumour, then shall they seek a vision of the prophet, but the law shall perish
from the priest, and counsel from the ancients,2743 and again, in these terms, Son of man,

of indignation: whose princes in the midst of her are like roaring lions, ravening the prey,
devouring souls in their might.2744 And a little further on: Her priests have violated My
laws and profaned My holy things, they have put no difference between the holy and profane,
but all things were alike to them, and they hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I was profaned
among them.2745 He threatens that He will consume both the wall and them that
daubed it,2746 that is, those who sin and those who throw a cloak over them; as the evil
rulers and priests have done, who caused the house of Israel to err according to their own
hearts which are estranged in their lusts.2747</p>
<p>66. I also refrain from entering into his discussion of those who feed themselves, devour
the milk, clothe themselves with the wool, kill them that are fat, but feed not the flock,
strengthen not the diseased, nor bind up that which is broken, nor bring again that which
is driven away, nor seek that which is lost, nor keep watch over that which is strong, but
oppress them with rigour, and destroy them with their pressure;2748 so that, because there
was no shepherd, the sheep were scattered over every plain and mountain, and became meat
for all the fowls and beasts,2749 because there was no one to seek for them and bring them
back. What is the consequence? As I live, saith the Lord, because these things are so, and
My flock became a prey,2750 behold I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock
at their hands, and will gather them and make them My own: but the shepherds shall suffer
such and such things, as bad shepherds ought.</p>
<p>67. However, to avoid unreasonably prolonging my discourse, by an enumeration of
all the prophets, and of the words of them all, I will mention but one more, who was known
before he was formed, and sanctified from the womb,2751 Jeremiah: and will pass over the
rest. He longs for water over his head, and a fountain of tears for his eyes, that he may adequately
weep for Israel;2752 and no less does he bewail the depravity of its rulers.</p>
<p>68. God speaks to him in reproof of the priests: The priests said not, Where is the Lord,
and they that handled the law knew Me not; the pastors also transgressed against Me.2753
Again He says to him: The pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord, and

therefore all their flock did not understand, and was scattered.2754 Again, Many pastors
have destroyed My vineyard, and have polluted My pleasant portion, till it was reduced to
a trackless wilderness.2755 He further inveighs against the pastors again: Woe be to the
pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture! Therefore thus saith the Lord
against them that feed My people: Ye have scattered My flock, and driven them away, and
have not visited them: behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings.2756 Moreover
he bids the shepherds to howl, and the rams of the flock to lament, because the days of their
slaughter are accomplished.2757</p>
<p>69. Why need I speak of the things of ancient days? Who can test himself by the rules
and standards which Paul laid down for bishops and presbyters, that they are to be temperate,
soberminded, not given to wine, no strikers, apt to teach, blameless in all things, and beyond
the reach of the wicked,2758 without finding considerable deflection from the straight line
of the rules? What of the regulations of Jesus for his disciples, when He sends them to
preach?2759 The main object of these is—not to enter into particulars—that they should be
of such virtue, so simple and modest, and in a word, so heavenly, that the gospel should
make its way, no less by their character than by their preaching.</p>
<p>70. I am alarmed by the reproaches of the Pharisees, the conviction of the Scribes. For
it is disgraceful for us, who ought greatly surpass them, as we are bidden, if we desire the
kingdom of heaven, to be found more deeply sunk in vice: so that we deserve to be called
serpents, a generation of vipers, and blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel,
or sepulchres foul within, in spite of our external comeliness, or platters outwardly clean,
and everything else, which they are, or which is laid to their charge.2760</p>
<p>71. With these thoughts I am occupied night and day: they waste my marrow, and feed
upon my flesh, and will not allow me to be confident or to look up. They depress my soul,
and abase my mind, and fetter my tongue, and make me consider, not the position of a
prelate, or the guidance and direction of others, which is far beyond my powers; but how I
myself am to escape the wrath to come, and to scrape off from myself somewhat of the rust
of vice. A man must himself be cleansed, before cleansing others: himself become wise,
that he may make others wise; become light, and then give light: draw near to God, and so

the hand, of wisdom to give advice.</p>
<p>72. When will this be, say they who are swift but not sure in every thing, readily building
up, readily throwing down. When will the lamp be upon its stand,2761 and where is the
talent?2762 For so they call the grace.2763 Those who speak thus are more fervent in
friendship than in reverence. You ask me, you men of exceeding courage, when these things
shall be, and what account I give of them? Not even extreme old age would be too long a
limit to assign. For hoary hairs combined with prudence are better than inexperienced
youth, well-reasoned hesitation than inconsiderate haste, and a brief reign than a long
tyranny: just as a small portion honourably won is better than considerable possessions
which are dishonourable and uncertain, a little gold than a great weight of lead, a little light
than much darkness.</p>
<p>73. But this speed, in its untrustworthiness and excessive haste, is in danger of being
like the seeds which fell upon the rock,2764 and, because they had no depth of earth,2765
sprang up at once, but could not bear even the first heat of the sun; or like the foundation
laid upon the sand,2766 which could not even make a slight resistance to the rain and the
winds. Woe to thee, O city, whose king is a child,2767 says Solomon. Be not hasty of
speech,2768 says Solomon again, asserting that hastiness of speech is less serious than heated
action. And who, in spite of all this, demands haste rather than security and utility? Who
can mould, as clay-figures are modelled in a single day, the defender of the truth, who is to
take his stand with Angels, and give glory with Archangels, and cause the sacrifice to ascend
to the altar on high, and share the priesthood of Christ, and renew the creature, and set
forth the image, and create inhabitants for the world above, aye and, greatest of all, be God,
and make others to be God?</p>

grossness of the flesh can purely gaze with his whole mind upon that whole mind, and amid
unstable and visible things hold intercourse with the stable and invisible? For hardly may
one of those who have been most specially purged, behold here even an image of the Good,
as men see the sun in the water. Who hath measured the water with his hand, and the
heaven with a span, and the whole earth in a measure? Who hath weighed the mountains
in scales, and the hills in a balance?2771 What is the place of his rest?2772 and to whom shall

and gathered into one things scattered abroad, and mingled dust with spirit, and compounded
an animal visible and invisible, temporal and immortal, earthly and heavenly, able to attain
to God but not to comprehend Him, drawing near and yet afar off. I said, I will be wise,
says Solomon, but she (i.e. Wisdom) was far from me beyond what is:2775 and, Verily, he
that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.2776 For the joy of what we have discovered
is no greater than the pain of what escapes us; a pain, I imagine, like that felt by those who
are dragged, while yet thirsty, from the water, or are unable to retain what they think they
hold, or are suddenly left in the dark by a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>76. This depressed and kept me humble, and persuaded me that it was better to hear
the voice of praise2777 than to be an expounder of truths beyond my power; the majesty,
and the height, and the dignity, and the pure natures scarce able to contain the brightness
of God, Whom the deep covers, Whose secret place is darkness,2778 since He is the purest
light,2779 which most men cannot approach unto; Who is in all this universe, and again is
beyond the universe; Who is all goodness,2780 and beyond all goodness; Who enlightens
the mind, and escapes the quickness and height of the mind, ever retiring as much as He is

having rashly intruded among those who there sit at meat. And yet I had been invited from
my youth, if I may speak of what most men know not, and had been cast upon Him from
the womb,2782 and presented by the promise of my mother, afterwards confirmed in the
hour of danger: and my longing grew up with it, and my reason agreed to it, and I gave as
an offering my all to Him Who had won me and saved me, my property, my fame, my health,
my very words, from which I only gained the advantage of being able to despise them, and
of having something in comparison of which I preferred Christ. And the words of God
were made sweet as honeycombs2783 to me, and I cried after knowledge and lifted up my
voice for wisdom.2784 There was moreover the moderation of anger, the curbing of the
tongue, the restraint of the eyes, the discipline of the belly, and the trampling under foot of
the glory which clings to the earth. I speak foolishly,2785 but it shall be said, in these pursuits
I was perhaps not inferior to many.</p>
<p>78. One branch of philosophy is, however, too high for me, the commission to guide
and govern souls—and before I have rightly learned to submit to a shepherd, or have had
my soul duly cleansed, the charge of caring for a flock: especially in times like these, when
a man, seeing everyone else rushing hither and thither in confusion, is content to flee from
the melee and escape, in sheltered retirement, from the storm and gloom of the wicked one:
when the members are at war with one another, and the slight remains of love, which once
existed, have departed, and priest is a mere empty name, since, as it is said, contempt2786
has been poured upon princes.2787</p>
<p>79. Would that it were merely empty! And now may their blasphemy fall upon the
head of the ungodly! All fear has been banished from souls, shamelessness has taken its
place, and knowledge2788 and the deep things of the Spirit2789 are at the disposal of anyone
who will; and we all become pious by simply condemning the impiety of others; and we
claim the services of ungodly judges,2790 and fling that which is holy to the dogs, and cast

pearls before swine,2791 by publishing divine things in the hearing of profane souls, and,
wretches that we are, carefully fulfil the prayers of our enemies, and are not ashamed to go
a whoring with our own inventions.2792 Moabites and Ammonites, who were not permitted
even to enter the Church of the Lord,2793 frequent our most holy rites. We have opened to
all not the gates of righteousness,2794 but, doors of railing and partizan arrogance; and the
first place among us is given, not to one who in the fear of God refrains from even an idle
word, but to him who can revile his neighbour most fluently, whether explicitly, or by covert
allusion; who rolls beneath his tongue mischief and iniquity, or to speak more accurately,
the poison of asps.2795</p>
<p>80. We observe each other’s sins, not to bewail them, but to make them subjects of reproach,
not to heal them, but to aggravate them, and excuse our own evil deeds by the
wounds of our neighbours. Bad and good men are distinguished not according to personal
character, but by their disagreement or friendship with ourselves. We praise one day what
we revile the next, denunciation at the hands of others is a passport to our admiration; so
magnanimous are we in our viciousness, that everything is frankly forgiven to impiety.</p>
<p>81. Everything has reverted to the original state of things2796 before the world, with its
present fair order and form, came into being. The general confusion and irregularity cry
for some organising hand and power. Or, if you will, it is like a battle at night by the faint
light of the moon, when none can discern the faces of friends or foes; or like a sea fight on
the surge, with the driving winds, and boiling foam, and dashing waves, and crashing vessels,
with the thrusts of poles, the pipes of boatswains, the groans of the fallen, while we make
our voices heard above the din, and not knowing what to do, and having, alas! no opportunity
for showing our valour, assail one another, and fall by one another’s hands.</p>
<p>82. Nor indeed is there any distinction between the state of the people and that of the
priesthood: but it seems to me to be a simple fulfilment of the ancient curse, “As with the
people so with the priest.”2797 Nor again are the great and eminent men affected otherwise
than the majority; nay, they are openly at war with the priests, and their piety is an aid to
their powers of persuasion. And indeed, provided that it be on behalf of the faith, and of
the highest and most important questions, let them be thus disposed, and I blame them not;
nay, to say the truth, I go so far as to praise and congratulate them. Yea! would that I were

one of those who contend and incur hatred for the truth’s sake: or rather, I can boast of
being one of them. For better is a laudable war than a peace which severs a man from God:
and therefore it is that the Spirit arms the gentle warrior, as one who is able to wage war in
a good cause.</p>
<p>83. But at the present time there are some who go to war even about small matters and
to no purpose, and, with great ignorance and audacity, accept, as an associate in their illdoing,
anyone whoever he may be. Then everyone makes the faith his pretext, and this
venerable name is dragged into their private quarrels. Consequently, as was probable, we
are hated, even among the Gentiles, and, what is harder still, we cannot say that this is
without just cause. Nay, even the best of our own people are scandalized, while this result
is not surprising in the case of the multitude, who are ill-disposed to accept anything that
is good.</p>
<p>84. Sinners are planning upon our backs;2798 and what we devise against each other,
they turn against us all: and we have become a new spectacle, not to angels and men,2799
as says Paul, that bravest of athletes, in his contest with principalities and powers,2800 but
to almost all wicked men, and at every time and place, in the public squares, at carousals,
at festivities, and times of sorrow. Nay, we have already—I can scarcely speak of it without
tears—been represented on the stage, amid the laughter of the most licentious, and the most
popular of all dialogues and scenes is the caricature of a Christian.</p>
<p>85. These are the results of our intestine warfare, and our extreme readiness to strive
about goodness and gentleness, and our inexpedient excess of love for God. Wrestling, or
any other athletic contest, is only permitted according to fixed laws, and the man will be
shouted down and disgraced, and lose the victory, who breaks the laws of wrestling, or acts
unfairly in any other contest, contrary to the rules laid down for the contest, however able
and skilful he may be; and shall anyone contend for Christ in an unchristlike manner, and
yet be pleasing to peace for having fought unlawfully in her name.</p>
<p>86. Yea, even now, when Christ is invoked, the devils tremble,2801 and not even by our
ill-doing has the power of this Name been extinguished, while we are not ashamed to insult
a cause and name so venerable; shouting it, and having it shouted in return, almost in public,
and every day; for My Name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.2802</p>

and discover fresh tortures of greater severity. I have one remedy for them all, one road to
victory; I will glory in Christ2803 namely, death for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p>88. For my own warfare, however, I am at a loss what course to pursue, what alliance,
what word of wisdom, what grace to devise, with what panoply to arm myself, against the
wiles of the wicked one.2804 What Moses is to conquer him by stretching out his hands
upon the mount,2805 in order that the cross, thus typified and prefigured, may prevail?
What Joshua, as his successor, arrayed alongside the Captain of the Lord’s hosts?2806 What
David, either by harping, or fighting with his sling,2807 and girded by God with strength
unto the battle,2808 and with his fingers trained to war?2809 What Samuel, praying2810 and
sacrificing for the people, and anointing as king one who can gain the victory? What
Jeremiah, by writing lamentations for Israel, is fitly to lament these things?</p>
<p>89. Who will cry aloud, Spare Thy People, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach,
that the nations should rule over them?2811 What Noah, and Job,2812 and Daniel,
who are reckoned together as men of prayer, will pray for us, that we may have a slight respite
from warfare, and recover ourselves, and recognize one another for a while, and no longer,
instead of united Israel, be Judah2813 and Israel, Rehoboam and Jeroboam, Jerusalem and
Samaria, in turn delivered up because of our sins, and in turn lamented.</p>
<p>90. For I own that I am too weak for this warfare, and therefore turned my back, hiding
my face in the rout, and sat solitary,2814 because I was filled with bitterness2815 and sought
to be silent, understanding that it is an evil time,2816 that the beloved had kicked,2817 that

we were become backsliding children,2818 who are the luxuriant vine,2819 the true vine, all
fruitful, all beautiful,2820 springing up splendidly with showers from on high.2821 For the
diadem of beauty,2822 the signet of glory,2823 the crown of magnificence2824 has been
changed for me into shame; and if anyone, in face of these things, is daring and courageous,
he has my blessing on his daring and courage.</p>
<p>91. I have said nothing yet of the internal warfare within ourselves, and in our passions,
in which we are engaged night and day against the body of our humiliation,2825 either
secretly or openly, and against the tide which tosses and whirls us hither and thither, by the
aid of our senses and other sources of the pleasures of this life; and against the miry clay2826
in which we have been fixed; and against the law of sin,2827 which wars against the law of
the spirit, and strives to destroy the royal image in us, and all the divine emanation which
has been bestowed upon us; so that it is difficult for anyone, either by a long course of
philosophic training, and gradual separation of the noble and enlightened part of the soul
from that which is debased and yoked with darkness, or by the mercy of God, or by both
together, and by a constant practice of looking upward, to overcome the depressing power
of matter. And before a man has, as far as possible, gained this superiority, and sufficiently
purified his mind, and far surpassed his fellows in nearness to God, I do not think it safe
for him to be entrusted with the rule over souls, or the office of mediator (for such, I take
it, a priest is) between God and man.</p>
<p>92. What is it that has induced this fear in me, that, instead of supposing me to be
needlessly afraid, you may highly commend my foresight? I hear from Moses himself, when
God spake to him, that, although many were bidden to come to the mount, one of whom
was even Aaron, with his two sons who were priests, and seventy elders of the senate, the
rest were ordered to worship afar off, and Moses alone to draw near, and the people were
not to go up with him.2828 For it is not everyone who may draw near to God, but only one
who, like Moses, can bear the glory of God. Moreover, before this, when the law was first

given, the trumpet-blasts, and lightnings, and thunders, and darkness, and the smoke of the
whole mountain,2829 and the terrible threats that if even a beast touched the mountain it
should be stoned,2830 and other like alarms, kept back the rest of the people, for whom it
was a great privilege, after careful purification, merely to hear the voice of God. But Moses
actually went up and entered into the cloud,2831 and was charged with the law, and received
the tables, which belong, for the multitude, to the letter, but, for those who are above the
multitude, to the spirit.2832</p>
<p>93. I hear again that Nadab and Abihu, for having merely offered incense with strange
fire, were with strange fire destroyed,2833 the instrument of their impiety being used for
their punishment, and their destruction following at the very time and place of their sacrilege;
and not even their father Aaron, who was next to Moses in the favor of God, could save
them. I know also of Eli the priest, and a little later of Uzzah, the former made to pay the
penalty for his sons’ transgression, in daring to violate the sacrifices by an untimely exaction
of the first fruits of the cauldrons, although he did not condone their impiety, but frequently
rebuked them;2834 the other, because he only touched the ark, which was being thrown off
the cart by the ox,2835 and though he saved it, was himself destroyed, in God’s jealousy for
the reverence due to the ark.</p>
<p>94. I know also that not even bodily blemishes in either priests2836 or victims2837 passed
without notice, but that it was required by the law that perfect sacrifices must be offered by
perfect men—a symbol, I take it, of integrity of soul. It was not lawful for everyone to touch
the priestly vesture, or any of the holy vessels; nor might the sacrifices themselves be consumed
except by the proper persons, and at the proper time and place;2838 nor might the
anointing oil nor the compounded incense2839 be imitated; nor might anyone enter the
temple who was not in the most minute particular pure in both soul and body; so far was
the Holy of holies removed from presumptuous access, that it might be entered by one man

<p>95. Since then I knew these things, and that no one is worthy of the mightiness of God,
and the sacrifice, and priesthood, who has not first presented himself to God, a living, holy
sacrifice, and set forth the reasonable, well-pleasing service,2841 and sacrificed to God the
sacrifice of praise and the contrite spirit,2842 which is the only sacrifice required of us by
the Giver of all; how could I dare to offer to Him the external sacrifice, the antitype of the
great mysteries,2843 or clothe myself with the garb and name of priest, before my hands had
been consecrated by holy works; before my eyes had been accustomed to gaze safely upon
created things, with wonder only for the Creator, and without injury to the creature; before
my ear had been sufficiently opened to the instruction of the Lord, and He had opened mine
ear to hear2844 without heaviness, and had set a golden earring with precious sardius, that
is, a wise man’s word in an obedient ear;2845 before my mouth had been opened to draw in

doctrines;2848 and my lips bound,2849 to use the words of wisdom, by divine knowledge,

contend with winds and waves, to gain great wealth, if so it should chance, and run
great risks in their eagerness for sailing and merchandise; but, for my part, I greatly prefer
to stay ashore and plough a short but pleasant furrow, saluting at a respectful distance the
sea and its gains, to live as best I can upon a poor and scanty store of barley-bread, and drag
my life along in safety and calm, rather than expose myself to so long and great a risk for
the sake of great gains.</p>

still more widely, and contents himself with slight results, incurs punishment, as having
spent a great light upon the illumination of a little house, or girt round the limbs of a boy
the full armor of a man. On the contrary, a man of low estate may with safety assume a
light burden, and escape the risk of the ridicule and increased danger which would attend
him if he attempted a task beyond his powers. For, as we have heard, it is not seemly for a

else, led to my return, for nothing inclines us so strongly to love as mutual affection.</p>
<p>103. In the next place there was my care, my duty, the hoar hairs and weakness of my
holy parents, who were more greatly distressed on my account than by their advanced

angels, and of Sarah, who travailed in my spiritual birth by instructing me in the truth.
Now, I had specially pledged myself to become the stay of their old age and the support of
their weakness, a pledge which, to the best of my power, I have fulfilled, even at the expense
of philosophy itself, the most precious of possessions and titles to me; or, to speak more
truly, although I made it the first object of my philosophy to appear to be no philosopher,
I could not bear that my labor in consequence of a single purpose should be wasted, nor yet
that blessing should be lost, which one of the saints of old is said to have stolen from his
father, whom he deceived by the food which he offered to him, and the hairy appearance
he assumed, thus attaining a good object by disgraceful trickery.2874 These are the two
causes of my submission and tractability. Nor is it, perchance, unreasonable that my arguments
should yield and submit to them both, for there is a time to be conquered, as I also
think there is for every purpose,2875 and it is better to be honorably overcome than to win
a dangerous and lawless victory.</p>
<p>104. There is a third reason of the highest importance which I will further mention,
and then dismiss the rest. I remembered the days of old,2876 and, recurring to one of the
ancient histories, drew counsel for myself therefrom as to my present conduct; for let us
not suppose these events to have been recorded without a purpose, nor that they are a mere
assemblage of words and deeds gathered together for the pastime of those who listen to
them, as a kind of bait for the ears, for the sole purpose of giving pleasure. Let us leave such
jesting to the legends and the Greeks, who think but little of the truth, and enchant ear and
mind by the charm of their fictions and the daintiness of their style.</p>
<p>105. We however, who extend the accuracy of the Spirit to the merest stroke and
tittle,2877 will never admit the impious assertion that even the smallest matters were dealt
with haphazard by those who have recorded them, and have thus been borne in mind down
to the present day: on the contrary, their purpose has been to supply memorials and instructions
for our consideration under similar circumstances, should such befall us, and that the
examples of the past might serve as rules and models, for our warning and imitation.</p>
<p>106. What then is the story, and wherein lies its application? For, perhaps, it would
not be amiss to relate it, for the general security. Jonah also was fleeing from the face of
God,2878 or rather, thought that he was fleeing: but he was overtaken by the sea, and the
storm, and the lot, and the whale’s belly, and the three days’ entombment, the type of a
greater mystery. He fled from having to announce the dread and awful message to the

Ninevites, and from being subsequently, if the city was saved by repentance, convicted of
falsehood: not that he was displeased at the salvation of the wicked, but he was ashamed of
being made an instrument of falsehood, and exceedingly zealous for the credit of prophecy,
which was in danger of being destroyed in his person, since most men are unable to penetrate
the depth of the Divine dispensation in such cases.</p>
<p>107. But, as I have learned from a man2879 skilled in these subjects, and able to grasp
the depth of the prophet, by means of a reasonable explanation of what seems unreasonable
in the history, it was not this which caused Jonah to flee, and carried him to Joppa and again
from Joppa to Tarshish, when he entrusted his stolen self to the sea:2880 for it was not likely
that such a prophet should be ignorant of the design of God, viz., to bring about, by means
of the threat, the escape of the Ninevites from the threatened doom, according to His great
wisdom, and unsearchable judgments, and according to His ways which are beyond our
tracing and finding out;2881 nor that, if he knew this he would refuse to co-operate with
God in the use of the means which He designed for their salvation. Besides, to imagine that
Jonah hoped to hide himself at sea, and escape by his flight the great eye of God, is surely
utterly absurd and stupid, and unworthy of credit, not only in the case of a prophet, but
even in the case of any sensible man, who has only a slight perception of God, Whose power
is over all.</p>
<p>108. On the contrary, as my instructor said, and as I am myself convinced, Jonah knew
better than any one the purpose of his message to the Ninevites, and that, in planning his
flight, although he changed his place, he did not escape from God. Nor is this possible for
any one else, either by concealing himself in the bosom of the earth, or in the depths of the
sea, or by soaring on wings, if there be any means of doing so, and rising into the air, or by
abiding in the lowest depths of hell,2882 or by enveloping himself in a thick cloud, or by any
other of the many devices for ensuring escape. For God alone of all things cannot be escaped
from or contended with; if He wills to seize and bring them under His hand, He outstrips
<note type="footnote">2879 A man. A Greek scholiast says that this was Origen (ob. a.d. 235), who gives this interpretation in his
commentary on the prophecy of Jonah. Elias says that he had read it in the commentary of Methodius (fl. a.d.
300), who usually combats Origen’s interpretations. We know that Origen did comment on the book of Job,
and that Methodius wrote on one at least of the Minor Prophets: but both these works have been lost, so that
we cannot absolutely decide the question, though the assurance with which both the notes are written makes
us hesitate to consider either of them merely a happy guess. Combefis thinks that S. Greg. alludes to one of his
own instructors: the gen. with ἀκόυω (cf. Plato, Gorg., 503, c.) favours this view, but the interpretation may
well have been derived from one of the earlier writers.</note>

the swift, He outwits the wise, He overthrows the strong, He abases the lofty, He subdues
rashness, He represses power.</p>
<p>109. Jonah then was not ignorant of the mighty hand of God, with which he threatened
other men, nor did he imagine that he could utterly escape the Divine power; this we are
not to believe: but when he saw the falling away of Israel, and perceived the passing over
of the grace of prophecy to the Gentiles—this was the cause of his retirement from preaching
and of his delay in fulfilling the command; accordingly he left the watchtower of joy, for
this is the meaning of Joppa in Hebrew, I mean his former dignity and reputation, and flung
himself into the deep of sorrow: and hence he is tempest-tossed, and falls asleep, and is
wrecked, and aroused from sleep, and taken by lot, and confesses his flight, and is cast into
sea, and swallowed, but not destroyed, by the whale; but there he calls upon God, and,
marvellous as it is, on the third day he, like Christ, is delivered: but my treatment of this
topic must stand over, and shall shortly, if God permit, be more deliberately worked out.2883</p>
<p>110. Now however, to return to my original point, the thought and question occurred
to me, that although he might possibly meet with some indulgence, if reluctant to prophesy,
for the cause which I mentioned—yet, in my own case, what could be said, what defence
could be made, if I longer remained restive, and rejected the yoke of ministry, which, though
I know not whether to call it light or heavy, had at any rate been laid upon me.</p>
<p>111. For if it be granted, and this alone can be strongly asserted in such matters, that
we are far too low to perform the priest’s office before God, and that we can only be worthy
of the sanctuary after we have become worthy of the Church,2884 and worthy of the post of
president, after being worthy of the sanctuary, yet some one else may perhaps refuse to acquit
us on the charge of disobedience. Now terrible are the threatenings against disobedience,
and terrible are the penalties which ensue upon it; as indeed are those on the other side, if,
instead of being reluctant, and shrinking back, and concealing ourselves as Saul did among
his father’s stuff2885—although called to rule but for a short time—if, I say, we come forward
readily, as though to a slight and most easy task, whereas it is not safe even to resign it, nor
to amend by second thoughts our first.</p>
<note type="footnote">2883 Shall be worked out. This promise, as Elias tells us, was fulfilled by S. Gregory in his History of Ezekiel
the Prophet, a work no longer extant.</note>
<note type="footnote">2884 Of the Church. S. Gregory seems to describe a series of three steps, (1) the Church, of which all should
be worthy members, (2) the Sanctuary, reserved for the Priests, (3) the Throne of the Bishop. Clémencet refers
both 1 and 2 to the ministry. If we suppose S. Gregory’s own position to be referred to, the third would be applicable
to his office under his father, which is held by Thomassin to have been that of Vicar-General (Disc.
Eccles., I., ii., 7 §§ 2, 3). A similar post was offered to him by S. Basil (Orat., xliii., 39).</note>

<p>112. On this account I had much toilsome consideration to discover my duty, being
set in the midst betwixt two fears, of which the one held me back, the other urged me on.
For a long while I was at a loss between them, and after wavering from side to side, and, like
a current driven by inconstant winds, inclining first in this direction, then in that, I at last
yielded to the stronger, and the fear of disobedience overcame me, and has carried me off.
Pray, mark how accurately and justly I hold the balance between the fears, neither desiring
an office not given to me, nor rejecting it when given. The one course marks the rash, the
other the disobedient, both the undisciplined. My position lies between those who are too
bold, or too timid; more timid than those who rush at every position, more bold than those
who avoid them all. This is my judgment on the matter.</p>
<p>113. Moreover, to distinguish still more clearly between them, we have, against the fear
of office, a possible help in the law of obedience, inasmuch as God in His goodness rewards
our faith, and makes a perfect ruler of the man who has confidence in Him, and places all
his hopes in Him; but against the danger of disobedience I know of nothing which can help
us, and of no ground to encourage our confidence. For it is to be feared that we shall have
to hear these words concerning those who have been entrusted to us: I will require their
souls at your hands;2886 and, Because ye have rejected me, and not been leaders and rulers
of my people, I also will reject you, that I should not be king over you;2887 and, As ye refused
to hearken to My voice, and turned a stubborn back, and were disobedient, so shall it be
when ye call upon Me, and I will not regard nor give ear to your prayer.2888 God forbid
that these words should come to us from the just Judge, for when we sing of His mercy we
must also by all means sing of His judgment.2889</p>
<p>114. I resort once again to history, and on considering the men of best repute in ancient
days, who were ever preferred by grace to the office of ruler or prophet, I discover that some
readily complied with the call, others deprecated the gift, and that neither those who drew
back were blamed for timidity, nor those who came forward for eagerness. The former
stood in awe of the greatness of the ministry, the latter trustfully obeyed Him Who called
them. Aaron was eager, but Moses resisted,2890 Isaiah readily submitted, but Jeremiah was
afraid of his youth,2891 and did not venture to prophesy until he had received from God a
promise and power beyond his years.2892</p>

<p>115. By these arguments I charmed myself, and by degrees my soul relaxed and became
ductile, like iron, and time came to the aid of my arguments, and the testimonies of God,
to which I had entrusted my whole life, were my counsellors.2893 Therefore I was not rebellious,
neither turned away back,2894 saith my Lord, when, instead of being called to rule,
He was led, as a sheep to the slaughter;2895 but I fell down and humbled myself under the
mighty hand of God,2896 and asked pardon for my former idleness and disobedience, if this
is at all laid to my charge. I held my peace,2897 but I will not hold my peace for ever: I
withdrew for a little while,2898 till I had considered myself and consoled my grief: but now
I am commissioned to exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the
seat of the elders.2899 If my former conduct deserved blame, my present action merits pardon.</p>
<p>116. What further need is there of words. Here am I, my pastors and fellow-pastors,
here am I, thou holy flock, worthy of Christ, the Chief Shepherd,2900 here am I, my father,
utterly vanquished, and your subject according to the laws of Christ rather than according
to those of the land:2901 here is my obedience, reward it with your blessing. Lead me with
your prayers, guide me with your words, establish me with your spirit. The blessing of the
father establisheth the houses of children,2902 and would that both I and this spiritual house
may be established, the house which I have longed for, which I pray may be my rest for
ever,2903 when I have been passed on from the church here to the church yonder, the general
assembly of the firstborn, who are written in heaven.2904</p>
<p>117. Such is my defence: its reasonableness I have set forth: and may the God of
peace,2905 Who made both one,2906 and has restored us to each other, Who setteth kings
upon thrones, and raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the

<head>Oration III.</head>
<p>To Those Who Had Invited Him, and Not Come to Receive Him.</p>
<p>(About Easter a.d. 362.)</p>
<p>I. How slow you are, my friends and brethren, to come to listen to my words, though
you were so swift in tyrannizing over me, and tearing me from my Citadel Solitude, which
I had embraced in preference to everything else, and as coadjutress and mother of the divine
ascent, and as deifying man,2920 I had especially admired, and had set before me as the guide
of my whole life.2921 How is it that, now you have got it, you thus despise what you so
greatly desired to obtain, and seem to be better able to desire the absent than to enjoy the
present; as though you preferred to possess my teaching rather than to profit by it? Yes, I
may even say this to you: “I became a surfeit unto you before you tasted of me, or gave me
a trial”2922—which is most strange.</p>
<p>II. And neither did you entertain me as a guest, nor, if I may make a remark of a more
compassionate kind, did you allow yourselves to be entertained by me, reverencing this
command if nothing else; nor did you take me by the hand, as beginning a new task; nor
encourage me in my timidity, nor console me for the violence I had suffered; but—I shrink
from saying it, though say it I must—you made my festival no festival, and received me with
no happy introduction; and you mingled the solemn festival with sorrow, because it lacked
that which most of all would have contributed to its happiness, the presence of you my
conquerors, for it would not be true to call you people who love me. So easily is anything
despised which is easily conquered, and the proud receives attention, while he who is humble
before God is slighted.</p>
<p>III. What will ye? Shall I be judged by you, or shall I be your judge? Shall I pass a verdict,
or receive one, for I hope to be acquitted if I be judged, and if I give sentence, to give it
against you justly? The charge against you is that you do not answer my love with equal
measure, nor do you repay my obedience with honour, nor do you pledge the future to me
by your present alacrity—though even if you had, I could hardly have believed it. But each
of you has something which he prefers to both the old and the new Pastor, neither reverencing
the grey hairs of the one, nor calling out the youthful spirit of the other.</p>
<note type="footnote">2920 S. Gregory very frequently uses this very strong expression to bring out the reality and intimacy of the
Christian’s Union with Christ as the result of the sanctifying grace by which all the Baptized are made “partakers
of the Divine Nature” (2 Pet. i. 4).</note>
<note type="footnote">2921 The passage might also be rendered “had preferred to every other kind of life.”</note>

<pb n="474"/>
<p>IV. There is a Banquet in the Gospels,2923 and a hospitable Host and friends; and the
Banquet is most pleasant, for it is the marriage of His Son. He calleth them, but they come
not: He is angry, and—I pass over the interval for fear of bad omen—but, to speak gently,
He filleth the Banquet with others. God forbid that this should be your case; but yet you
have treated me (how shall I put it gently?) with as much haughtiness or boldness as they
who after being called to a feast rise up against it, and insult their host; for you, though you
are not of the number of those who are without, or are invited to the marriage, but are
yourselves those who invited me, and bound me to the Holy Table, and shewed me the glory
of the Bridal Chamber, then deserted me (this is the most splendid thing about you)—one
to his field, another to his newly bought yoke of oxen, another to his just-married wife, another
to some other trifling matter; you were all scattered and dispersed, caring little for the
Bridechamber and the Bridegroom.2924</p>
<p>V. On this account I was filled with despondency and perplexity—for I will not keep
silence about what I have suffered—and I was very near withholding the discourse which I
was minded to bestow as a Marriage-gift, the most beautiful and precious of all I had; and
I very nearly let it loose upon you, whom, now that the violence had once been done to me,
I greatly longed for: for I thought I could get from this a splendid theme, and because my
love sharpened my tongue—love which is very hot and ready for accusation when it is stirred
to jealousy by grief which it conceives from some unexpected neglect. If any of you has
been pierced with love’s sting, and has felt himself neglected, he knows the feeling, and will
pardon one who so suffers, because he himself has been near the same frenzy.</p>
<p>VI. But it is not permitted to me at the present time to say to you anything upbraiding;
and God forbid I ever should. And even now perhaps I have reproached you more than in
due measure, the Sacred Flock, the praise-worthy nurselings of Christ, the Divine inheritance;
by which, O God, Thou art rich, even wert Thou poor in all other respects. To Thee, I think,
are fitting those words, “The lot is fallen unto Thee in a fair ground: yea Thou hast the
goodliest heritage.”2925 Nor will I allow that the most populous cities or the broadest flocks
have any advantage over us, the little ones of the smallest of all the tribes of Israel, of the
least of the thousands of Judah,2926 of the little Bethlehem among cities,2927 where Christ

was born and is from the beginning well-known and worshipped; amongst those whom the
Father is exalted, and the Son is held to be equal to Him, and the Holy Ghost is glorified
with Them: we who are of one soul, who mind the same thing, who in nothing injure the
Trinity, neither by preferring One Person above another, nor by cutting off any: as those
bad umpires and measurers of the Godhead do, who by magnifying One Person more than
is fit, diminish and insult the whole.</p>
<p>VII. But do ye also, if you bear me any good will—ye who are my husbandry, my vineyard,
my own bowels, or rather His Who is our common Father, for in Christ he hath begotten
you through the Gospels2928—shew to us also some respect. It is only fair, since we
have honoured you above all else: ye are my witnesses, ye, and they who have placed in our
hands this—shall I say Authority, or Service? And if to him that loveth most is due, how
shall I measure the love, for which I have made you my debtors by my own love? Rather,
shew respect for yourselves, and the Image committed to your care,2929 and Him Who
committed it, and the Sufferings of Christ, and your hopes therefrom, holding fast the faith
which ye have received, and in which ye were brought up, by which also ye are being saved,
and trust to save others (for not many, be well assured, can boast of what you can), and
reckoning piety to consist, not in often speaking about God, but in silence for the most part,
for the tongue is a dangerous thing to men, if it be not governed by reason. Believe that
listening is always less dangerous than talking, just as learning about God is more pleasant
than teaching. Leave the more accurate search into these questions to those who are the
Stewards of the Word; and for yourselves, worship a little in words, but more by your actions,
and rather by keeping the Law than by admiring the Lawgiver; shew your love for Him by
fleeing from wickedness, pursuing after virtue, living in the Spirit, walking in the Spirit,
drawing your knowledge from Him, building upon the foundation of the faith, not wood
or hay or stubble,2930 weak materials and easily spent when the fire shall try our works or
destroy them; but gold, silver, precious stones, which remain and stand.</p>
<p>VIII. So may ye act, and so may ye honour us, whether present or absent, whether
taking your part in our sermons, or preferring to do something else: and may ye be the
children of God, pure and unblamable, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation:2931
and may ye never be entangled in the snares of the wicked that go round about, or bound
with the chain of your sins. May the Word in you never be smothered with cares of this life
and so ye become unfruitful: but may ye walk in the King’s Highway, turning aside neither
to the right hand nor to the left,2932 but led by the Spirit through the strait gate. Then all

<head>Oration VII.</head>
<p>Panegyric on His Brother S. Cæsarius.</p>
<p>The date of this Oration is probably the spring of a.d. 369. It is placed by S. Jerome first
among S. Gregory’s Orations. Cæsarius, the Saint’s younger brother, was born probably about
a.d. 330. Educated in his early years at home, he studied later in the schools of Alexandria,
where he attained great proficiency in mathematics, astronomy, and, especially, in medicine.
On his return from Alexandria, he was offered by the Emperor Constantius, in response to a
public petition, an honourable and lucrative post at Byzantium, but was prevailed upon by
Gregory to return with him to Nazianzus. After a while he went back to Byzantium, and, on
the accession of Julian, was pressed to retain his appointment at court, and did so, in spite of
Gregory’s reproaches, until Julian, who had long been trying to win him from Christianity, at
last invited him to a public discussion. Cæsarius, in spite of the specious arguments of the
Emperor, gained the day, but, having now distinctly declared himself a Christian, could no
longer remain at court. On the death of Julian, he was esteemed and promoted by successive
Emperors, until he received from Valens the office of treasurer of Bithynia. The exact character
of this office and its rank are still undecided by historical writers, some of whom attribute to
him other offices not mentioned by S. Gregory, which most probably were filled by a namesake.
On the 11th of October a.d. 368 the city of Nicæa was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake
and Cæsarius miraculously escaped with his life. Impressed by his escape, he received
Holy Baptism, and formed plans for retiring from office and (as it seems) devoting himself to
a life of ascetic discipline, which were dissipated by his early and sudden death.</p>
<p>1. It may be, my friends, my brethren, my fathers (ye who are dear to me in reality as
well as in name) that you think that I, who am about to pay the sad tribute of lamentation
to him who has departed, am eager to undertake the task, and shall, as most men delight to
do, speak at great length and in eloquent style. And so some of you, who have had like
sorrows to bear, are prepared to join in my mourning and lamentation, in order to bewail
your own griefs in mine, and learn to feel pain at the afflictions of a friend, while others are
looking to feast their ears in the enjoyment of my words. For they suppose that I must needs
make my misfortune an occasion for display—as was once my wont, when possessed of a
superabundance of earthly things, and ambitious, above all, of oratorical renown—before
I looked up to Him Who is the true and highest Word, and gave all up to God, from Whom
all things come, and took God for all in all. Now pray do not think this of me, if you wish
to think of me aright. For I am neither going to lament for him who is gone more than is
good—as I should not approve of such conduct even in others—nor am I going to praise
him beyond due measure. Albeit that language is a dear and especially proper tribute to
one gifted with it, and eulogy to one who was exceedingly fond of my words—aye, not only

<pb n="478"/>
a tribute, but a debt, the most just of all debts. But even in my tears and admiration I must
respect the law which regards such matters: nor is this alien to our philosophy; for he says
The memory of the just is accompanied with eulogies,2933 and also, Let tears fall down over
the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself:2934 removing
us equally from insensibility and immoderation. I shall proceed then, not only to exhibit
the weakness of human nature, but also to put you in mind of the dignity of the soul, and,
giving such consolation as is due to those who are in sorrow, transfer our grief, from that
which concerns the flesh and temporal things, to those things which are spiritual and
eternal.</p>
<p>2. The parents of Cæsarius, to take first the point which best becomes me, are known
to you all. Their excellence you are eager to notice, and hear of with admiration, and share
in the task of setting it forth to any, if there be such, who know it not: for no single man is
able to do so entirely, and the task is one beyond the powers of a single tongue, however
laborious, however zealous. Among the many and great points for which they are to be
celebrated (I trust I may not seem extravagant in praising my own family) the greatest of
all, which more than any other stamps their character, is piety. By their hoar hairs they lay
claim to reverence, but they are no less venerable for their virtue than for their age; for while
their bodies are bent beneath the burden of their years, their souls renew their youth in God.</p>
<p>3. His father2935 was well grafted out of the wild olive tree into the good one, and so
far partook of its fatness as to be entrusted with the engrafting of others, and charged with
the culture of souls, presiding in a manner becoming his high office over this people, like a
second Aaron or Moses, bidden himself to draw near to God,2936 and to convey the Divine
Voice to the others who stand afar off;2937 gentle, meek, calm in mien,2938 fervent in spirit,
a fine man in external appearance, but richer still in that which is out of sight. But why
should I describe him whom you know? For I could not even by speaking at great length
say as much as he deserves, or as much as each of you knows and expects to be said of him.
It is then better to leave your own fancy to picture him, than mutilate by my words the object
of your admiration.</p>
<p>4. His mother2939 was consecrated to God by virtue of her descent from a saintly family,
and was possessed of piety as a necessary inheritance, not only for herself, but also for her

children—being indeed a holy lump from a holy firstfruits.2940 And this she so far increased
and amplified that some, (bold though the statement be, I will utter it,) have both believed
and said that even her husband’s perfection has been the work of none other than herself;
and, oh how wonderful! she herself, as the reward of her piety, has received a greater and
more perfect piety. Lovers of their children and of Christ as they both were, what is most
extraordinary, they were far greater lovers of Christ than of their children: yea, even their
one enjoyment of their children was that they should be acknowledged and named by Christ,
and their one measure of their blessedness in their children was their virtue and close association
with the Chief Good.2941 Compassionate, sympathetic, snatching many a treasure
from moths and robbers,2942 and from the prince of this world,2943 to transfer it from their
sojourn here to the [true] habitation, laying up in store2944 for their children the heavenly
splendour as their greatest inheritance. Thus have they reached a fair old age, equally reverend
both for virtue and for years, and full of days, alike of those which abide and those
which pass away; each one failing to secure the first prize here below only so far as equalled
by the other; yea, they have fulfilled the measure of every happiness with the exception of
this last trial, or discipline, whichever anyone may think we ought to call it; I mean their
having to send before them the child who was, owing to his age, in greater danger of falling,
and so to close their life in safety, and be translated with all their family to the realms above.</p>
<p>5. I have entered into these details, not from a desire to eulogize them, for this, I know
well, it would be difficult worthily to do, if I made their praise the subject of my whole oration,
but to set forth the excellence inherited from his parents by Cæsarius, and so prevent you
from being surprised or incredulous, that one sprung from such progenitors, should have
deserved such praises himself; nay, strange indeed would it have been, had he looked to
others and disregarded the examples of his kinsfolk at home. His early life was such as becomes
those really well born and destined for a good life. I say little of his qualities evident
to all, his beauty, his stature, his manifold gracefulness, and harmonious disposition, as
shown in the tones of his voice—for it is not my office to laud qualities of this kind, however
important they may seem to others—and proceed with what I have to say of the points
which, even if I wished, I could with difficulty pass by.</p>
<p>6. Bred and reared under such influences, we were fully trained in the education afforded
here,2945 in which none could say how far he excelled most of us from the quickness and

extent of his abilities—and how can I recall those days without my tears showing that, contrary
to my promises, my feelings have overcome my philosophic restraint? The time came
when it was decided that we should leave home, and then for the first time we were separated,
for I studied rhetoric in the then flourishing schools of Palestine; he went to Alexandria,
esteemed both then and now the home of every branch of learning. Which of his qualities
shall I place first and foremost, or which can I omit with least injury to my description?
Who was more faithful to his teacher than he? Who more kindly to his classmates? Who
more carefully avoided the society and companionship of the depraved? Who attached
himself more closely to that of the most excellent, and among others, of the most esteemed
and illustrious of his countrymen? For he knew that we are strongly influenced to virtue
or vice by our companions. And in consequence of all this, who was more honoured by the
authorities than he, and whom did the whole city (though2946 all individuals are concealed
in it, because of its size), esteem more highly for his discretion, or deem more illustrious for
his intelligence?</p>
<p>7. What branch of learning did he not master, or rather, in what branch of study did
he not surpass those who had made it their sole study? Whom did he allow even to approach
him, not only of his own time and age, but even of his elders, who had devoted many more
years to study? All subjects he studied as one, and each as thoroughly as if he knew no
other. The brilliant in intellect, he surpassed in industry, the devoted students in quickness
of perception; nay, rather he outstripped in rapidity those who were rapid, in application
those who were laborious, and in both respects those who were distinguished in both. From
geometry and astronomy, that science so dangerous2947 to anyone else, he gathered all that
was helpful (I mean that he was led by the harmony and order of the heavenly bodies to
reverence their Maker), and avoided what is injurious; not attributing all things that are or
happen to the influence of the stars, like those who raise their own fellow-servant, the creation,
in rebellion against the Creator, but referring, as is reasonable, the motion of these
bodies, and all other things besides, to God. In arithmetic and mathematics, and in the
wonderful art of medicine, in so far as it treats of physiology and temperament, and the
causes of disease, in order to remove the roots and so destroy their offspring with them,
who is there so ignorant or contentious as to think him inferior to himself, and not to be
glad to be reckoned next to him, and carry off the second prize? This indeed is no unsup-

ported assertion, but East and West2948 alike, and every place which he afterward visited,
are as pillars inscribed with the record of his learning.</p>
<p>8. But when, after gathering into his single soul every kind of excellence and knowledge,
as a mighty merchantman gathers every sort of ware, he was voyaging to his own city, in
order to communicate to others the fair cargo of his culture, there befell a wondrous thing,
which I must, as its mention is most cheering to me and may delight you, briefly set forth.
Our mother,2949 in her motherly love for her children, had offered up a prayer that, as she
had sent us forth together, she might see us together return home. For we seemed, to our
mother at least, if not to others, to form a pair worthy of her prayers and glances, if seen
together, though now, alas, our connection has been severed. And God, Who hears a
righteous prayer, and honours the love of parents for well-disposed children, so ordered
that, without any design or agreement on our part, the one from Alexandria, the other from
Greece, the one by sea, the other by land, we arrived at the same city at the same time. This
city was Byzantium, which now presides over Europe, in which Cæsarius, after the lapse of
a short time, gained such a repute, that public honours, an alliance with an illustrious family,
and a seat in the council of state were offered him; and a mission was despatched to the
Emperor by public decision, to beg that the first of cities be adorned and honoured by the
first of scholars (if he cared at all for its being indeed the first, and worthy of its name); and
that to all its other titles to distinction this further one be added, that it was embellished by
having Cæsarius as its physician and its inhabitant, although its brilliancy was already assured
by its throngs of great men both in philosophy and other branches of learning. But enough
of this. At this time there happened what seemed to others a chance without reason or
cause, such as frequently occurs of its own accord in our day, but was more than sufficiently
manifest to devout minds as the result of the prayers to god-fearing parents, which were
answered by the united arrival of their sons by land and sea.</p>
<p>9. Well, among the noble traits of Cæsarius’ character, we must not fail to note one,
which perhaps is in others’ eyes slight and unworthy of mention, but seemed to me, both
at the time and since, of the highest import, if indeed brotherly love be a praiseworthy
quality; nor shall I ever cease to place it in the first rank, in relating the story of his life. Although
the metropolis strove to retain him by the honours I have mentioned, and declared
that it would under no circumstances let him go, my influence, which he valued most highly
on all occasions, prevailed upon him to listen to the prayer of his parents, to supply his
country’s need, and to grant me my own desire. And when he thus returned home in my
company, he preferred me not only to cities and peoples, not only to honours and revenues,

which had in part already flowed to him in abundance from many sources and in part were
within his reach, but even to the Emperor himself and his imperial commands. From this
time, then, having shaken off all ambition, as a hard master and a painful disorder, I resolved
to practise philosophy and adapt myself to the higher life: or rather the desire was earlier
born, the life came later. But my brother, who had dedicated to his country the firstfruits
of his learning, and gained an admiration worthy of his efforts, was afterwards led by the
desire of fame, and, as he persuaded me, of being the guardian of the city, to betake himself
to court, not indeed according to my own wishes or judgment; for I will confess to you that
I think it a better and grander thing to be in the lowest rank with God than to win the first
place with an earthly king. Nevertheless I cannot blame him, for inasmuch as philosophy
is the greatest, so is it the most difficult, of professions, which can be taken in hand by but
few, and only by those who have been called forth by the Divine magnanimity, which gives
its hand to those who are honoured by its preference. Yet it is no small thing if one, who
has chosen the lower form of life, follows after goodness, and sets greater store on God and
his own salvation than on earthly lustre; using it as a stage, or a manifold ephemeral mask
while playing in the drama of this world, but himself living unto God with that image which
he knows that he has received from Him, and must render to Him Who gave it. That this
was certainly the purpose of Cæsarius, we know full well.</p>
<p>10. Among physicians he gained the foremost place with no great trouble, by merely
exhibiting his capacity, or rather some slight specimen of his capacity, and was forthwith
numbered among the friends of the Emperor, and enjoyed the highest honours. But he
placed the humane functions of his art at the disposal of the authorities free of cost, knowing
that nothing leads to further advancement than virtue and renown for honourable deeds;
so that he far surpassed in fame those to whom he was inferior in rank. By his modesty he
so won the love of all that they entrusted their precious charges to his care, without requiring
him to be sworn by Hippocrates, since the simplicity of Crates was nothing to his own:
winning in general a respect beyond his rank; for besides the present repute he was ever
thought to have justly won, a still greater one was anticipated for him, both by the Emperors2950
themselves and by all who occupied the nearest positions to them. But, most important,
neither by his fame, nor by the luxury which surrounded him, was his nobility of soul
corrupted; for amidst his many claims to honour, he himself cared most for being, and being
known to be, a Christian, and, compared with this, all other things were to him but trifling
toys. For they belong to the part we play before others on a stage which is very quickly set
up and taken down again—perhaps indeed more quickly destroyed than put together, as

<pb n="483"/>
we may see from the manifold changes of life, and fluctuations of prosperity; while the only
real and securely abiding good thing is godliness.</p>
<p>11. Such was the philosophy of Cæsarius, even at court: these were the ideas amidst
which he lived and died, discovering and presenting to God, in the hidden man, a still
deeper godliness than was publicly visible. And if I must pass by all else, his protection of
his kinsmen in distress, his contempt for arrogance, his freedom from assumption towards
friends, his boldness towards men in power, the numerous contests and arguments in which
he engaged with many on behalf of the truth, not merely for the sake of argument, but with
deep piety and fervour, I must speak of one point at least as especially worthy of note. The
Emperor2951 of unhappy memory was raging against us, whose madness in rejecting Christ,
after making himself its first victim, had now rendered him intolerable to others; though
he did not, like other fighters against Christ, grandly enlist himself on the side of impiety,
but veiled his persecution under the form of equity; and, ruled by the crooked serpent which
possessed his soul, dragged down into his own pit his wretched victims by manifold devices.
His first artifice and contrivance was, to deprive us of the honour of our conflicts (for, noble
man as he was, he grudged this to Christians), by causing us, who suffered for being Christians,
to be punished as evil doers: the second was, to call this process persuasion, and not
tyranny, so that the disgrace of those who chose to side with impiety might be greater than
their danger. Some he won over by money, some by dignities, some by promises, some by
various honours, which he bestowed, not royally but in right servile style, in the sight of all,
while everyone was influenced by the witchery of his words, and his own example. At last
he assailed Cæsarius. How utter was the derangement and folly which could hope to take
for his prey a man like Cæsarius, my brother, the son of parents like ours!</p>
<p>12. However, that I may dwell awhile upon this point, and luxuriate in my story as men
do who are eyewitnesses in some marvellous event,2952 that noble man, fortified with the
sign of Christ, and defending himself with His Mighty Word, entered the lists against an
adversary experienced in arms and strong in his skill in argument. In no wise abashed at
the sight, nor shrinking at all from his high purpose through flattery, he was an athlete ready,
both in word and deed, to meet a rival of equal power. Such then was the arena, and so
equipped the champion of godliness. The judge on one side was Christ, arming the athlete
with His own sufferings: and on the other a dreadful tyrant,2953 persuasive by his skill in
argument, and overawing him by the weight of his authority; and as spectators, on either
hand, both those who were still left on the side of godliness and those who had been snatched

away by him, watching whether victory inclined to their own side or to the other, and more
anxious as to which would gain the day than the combatants themselves.</p>
<p>13. Didst thou not fear for Cæsarius, lest aught unworthy of his zeal should befall him?
Nay, be ye of good courage. For the victory is with Christ, Who overcame the world.2954
Now for my part, be well assured, I should be highly interested in setting forth the details
of the arguments and allegations used on that occasion, for indeed the discussion contains
certain feats and elegances, which I dwell on with no slight pleasure; but this would be quite
foreign to an occasion and discourse like the present. And when, after having torn to shreds
all his opponent’s sophistries, and thrust aside as mere child’s play every assault, veiled or
open, Cæsarius in a loud clear voice declared that he was and remained a Christian—not
even thus was he finally dismissed. For indeed, the Emperor was possessed by an eager desire
to enjoy and be distinguished by his culture, and then uttered in the hearing of all his famous
saying—O happy father, O unhappy sons! thus deigning to honour me, whose culture and
godliness2955 he had known at Athens, with a share in the dishonour of Cæsarius, who was
remanded for a further trial2956 (since Justice was fitly arming the Emperor against the
Persians),2957 and welcomed by us after his happy escape and bloodless victory, as more illustrious
for his dishonour than for his celebrity.</p>
<p>14. This victory I esteem far more sublime and honourable than the Emperor’s mighty
power and splendid purple and costly diadem. I am more elated in describing it than if he
had won from him the half of his Empire. During the evil days he lived in retirement,
obedient herein to our Christian law,2958 which bids us, when occasion offers, to make
ventures on behalf of the truth, and not be traitors to our religion from cowardice; yet refrain,
as long as may be, from rushing into danger, either in fear for our own souls, or to spare
those who bring the danger upon us. But when the gloom had been dispersed, and the
righteous sentence had been pronounced in a foreign land, and the glittering sword had
struck down the ungodly, and power had returned to the hands of Christians, what boots
it to say with what glory and honour, with how many and great testimonies, as if bestowing
rather than receiving a favour, he was welcomed again at the Court; his new honour succeeding
to that of former days; while time changed its Emperors, the repute and commanding
influence of Cæsarius with them was undisturbed, nay, they vied with each other in striving

to attach him most closely to themselves, and be known as his special friends and acquaintances.
Such was the godliness of Cæsarius, such its results. Let all men, young and old, give
ear, and press on through the same virtue to the same distinction, for glorious is the fruit
of good labours,2959 if they suppose this to be worth striving after, and a part of true happiness.</p>
<p>15. Again another wonder concerning him is a strong argument for his parents’ piety
and his own. He was living in Bithynia, holding an office of no small importance from the
Emperor, viz., the stewardship of his revenue, and care of the exchequer: for this had been
assigned to him by the Emperor as a prelude to the highest offices. And when, a short time
ago, the earthquake2960 in Nicæa occurred, which is said to have been the most serious
within the memory of man, overwhelming in a common destruction almost all the inhabitants
and the beauty of the city, he alone, or with very few of the men of rank, survived the danger,
being shielded by the very falling ruins in his incredible escape, and bearing slight traces of
the peril; yet he allowed fear to lead him to a more important salvation, for he dedicated
himself entirely to the Supreme Providence; he renounced the service of transitory things,
and attached himself to another court. This he both purposed himself, and made the object
of the united earnest prayers to which he invited me by letter, when I seized this opportunity
to give him warning,2961 as I never ceased to do when pained that his great nature should
be occupied in affairs beneath it, and that a soul so fitted for philosophy should, like the sun
behind a cloud, be obscured amid the whirl of public life. Unscathed though he had been
by the earthquake, he was not proof against disease, since he was but human. His escape
was peculiar to himself; his death common to all mankind; the one the token of his piety,
the other the result of his nature. The former, for our consolation, preceded his fate, so that,
though shaken by his death, we might exult in the extraordinary character of his preservation.
And now our illustrious Cæsarius has been restored to us, when his honoured dust and
celebrated corse, after being escorted home amidst a succession of hymns and public orations,
has been honoured by the holy hands of his parents; while his mother, substituting the
festal garments of religion for the trappings of woe, has overcome her tears by her philosophy,
and lulled to sleep lamentations by psalmody, as her son enjoys honours worthy of his newly
regenerate soul, which has been, through water, transformed by the Spirit.</p>
<p>16. This, Cæsarius, is my funeral offering to thee, this the firstfruits of my words, which
thou hast often blamed me for withholding, yet wouldst have stripped off, had they been
bestowed on thee; with this ornament I adorn thee, an ornament, I know well, far dearer to
thee than all others, though it be not of the soft flowing tissues of silk, in which while living,

with virtue for thy sole adorning, thou didst not, like the many, rejoice; nor texture of
transparent linen, nor outpouring of costly unguents, which thou hadst long resigned to
the boudoirs of the fair, with their sweet savours lasting but a single day; nor any other small
thing valued by small minds, which would have all been hidden to-day with thy fair form
by this bitter stone. Far hence be games and stories of the Greeks, the honours of ill-fated
youths, with their petty prizes for petty contests; and all the libations and firstfruits or garlands
and newly plucked flowers, wherewith men honour the departed, in obedience to
ancient custom and unreasoning grief, rather than reason. My gift is an oration, which
perhaps succeeding time will receive at my hand and ever keep in motion, that it may not
suffer him who has left us to be utterly lost to earth, but may ever keep him whom we honour
in men’s ears and minds, as it sets before them, more clearly than a portrait, the image of
him for whom we mourn.</p>
<p>17. Such is my offering; if it be slight and inferior to his merit, God loveth that which
is according to our power.2962 Part of our gift is now complete, the remainder we will now
pay by offering (those of us who still survive) every year our honours and memorials. And
now for thee, sacred and holy soul, we pray for an entrance into heaven; mayest thou enjoy
such repose as the bosom of Abraham affords, mayest thou behold the choir of Angels, and
the glories and splendours of sainted men; aye, mayest thou be united to that choir and
share in their joy, looking down from on high on all things here, on what men call wealth,
and despicable dignities, and deceitful honours, and the errors of our senses, and the tangle
of this life, and its confusion and ignorance, as if we were fighting in the dark; whilst thou
art in attendance upon the Great King and filled with the light which streams forth from
Him: and may it be ours hereafter, receiving therefrom no such slender rivulet, as is the
object of our fancy in this day of mirrors and enigmas, to attain to the fount of good itself,
gazing with pure mind upon the truth in its purity, and finding a reward for our eager toil
here below on behalf of the good, in our more perfect possession and vision of the good on
high: the end to which our sacred books and teachers foretell that our course of divine
mysteries shall lead us.</p>
<p>18. What now remains? To bring the healing of the Word to those in sorrow. And a
powerful remedy for mourners is sympathy, for sufferers are best consoled by those who
have to bear a like suffering. To such, then, I specially address myself, of whom I should be
ashamed, if, with all other virtues, they do not show the elements of patience. For even if
they surpass all others in love of their children, let them equally surpass them in love of
wisdom and love of Christ, and in the special practice of meditation on our departure hence,
impressing it likewise on their children, making even their whole life a preparation for
death. But if your misfortune still clouds your reason and, like the moisture which dims

our eyes, hides from you the clear view of your duty, come, ye elders, receive the consolation
of a young man, ye fathers, that of a child, who ought to be admonished by men as old as
you, who have admonished many and gathered experience from your many years. Yet
wonder not, if in my youth I admonish the aged; and if in aught I can see better than the
hoary, I offer it to you. How much longer have we to live, ye men of honoured eld, so near
to God? How long are we to suffer here? Not even man’s whole life is long, compared with
the Eternity of the Divine Nature, still less the remains of life, and what I may call the parting
of our human breath, the close of our frail existence. How much has Cæsarius outstripped
us? How long shall we be left to mourn his departure? Are we not hastening to the same
abode? Shall we not soon be covered by the same stone? Shall we not shortly be reduced
to the same dust? And what in these short days will be our gain, save that after it has been
ours to see, or suffer, or perchance even to do, more ill, we must discharge the common and
inexorable tribute to the law of nature, by following some, preceding others, to the tomb,
mourning these, being lamented by those, and receiving from some that meed of tears which
we ourselves had paid to others?</p>
<p>19. Such, my brethren, is our existence, who live this transient life, such our pastime
upon earth: we come into existence out of non-existence, and after existing are dissolved.
We are unsubstantial dreams, impalpable visions,2963 like the flight of a passing bird, like
a ship leaving no track upon the sea,2964 a speck of dust, a vapour, an early dew, a flower
that quickly blooms, and quickly fades. As for man his days are as grass, as a flower of the
field, so he flourisheth.2965 Well hath inspired David discoursed of our frailty, and again
in these words, “Let me know the shortness of my days;” and he defines the days of man as
“of a span long.”2966 And what wouldst thou say to Jeremiah, who complains of his mother
in sorrow for his birth,2967 and that on account of others’ faults? I have seen all things,2968
says the preacher, I have reviewed in thought all human things, wealth, pleasure, power,
unstable glory, wisdom which evades us rather than is won; then pleasure again, wisdom
again, often revolving the same objects, the pleasures of appetite, orchards, numbers of
slaves, store of wealth, serving men and serving maids, singing men and singing women,
arms, spearmen, subject nations, collected tributes, the pride of kings, all the necessaries
and superfluities of life, in which I surpassed all the kings that were before me. And what
does he say after all these things? Vanity of vanities,2969 all is vanity and vexation of spirit,

to this from the original fall: but hear, he says, the conclusion of the whole matter, Fear
God.2970 This is his stay in his perplexity, and this is thy only gain from life here below, to
be guided through the disorder of the things which are seen2971 and shaken, to the things
which stand firm and are not moved.2972</p>
<p>20. Let us not then mourn Cæsarius but ourselves, knowing what evils he has escaped
to which we are left behind, and what treasure we shall lay up, unless, earnestly cleaving
unto God and outstripping transitory things, we press towards the life above, deserting the
earth while we are still upon the earth, and earnestly following the spirit which bears us
upward. Painful as this is to the faint-hearted, it is as nothing to men of brave mind. And
let us consider it thus. Cæsarius will not reign, but rather will he be reigned over by others.
He will strike terror into no one, but he will be free from fear of any harsh master, often
himself unworthy even of a subject’s position. He will not amass wealth, but neither will
he be liable to envy, or be pained at lack of success, or be ever seeking to add to his gains as
much again. For such is the disease of wealth, which knows no limit to its desire of more,
and continues to make drinking the medicine for thirst. He will make no display of his
power of speaking, yet for his speaking will he be admired. He will not discourse upon the
dicta of Hippocrates and Galen, and their adversaries, but neither will he be troubled by
diseases, and suffer pain at the misfortunes of others. He will not set forth the principles of
Eucleides, Ptolemæus, and Heron, but neither will he be pained by the tumid vaunts of uncultured
men. He will make no display of the doctrines of Plato, and Aristotle, and Pyrrho,
and the names of any Democritus, and Heracleitus, Anaxagoras, Cleanthes and Epicurus,
and all the members of the venerable Porch and Academy: but neither will he trouble
himself with the solution of their cunning syllogisms. What need of further details? Yet
here are some which all men honour or desire. Nor wife nor child will he have beside him,
but he will escape mourning for, or being mourned by them, or leaving them to others, or
being left behind himself as a memorial of misfortune. He will inherit no property: but he
will have such heirs2973 as are of the greatest service, such as he himself wished, so that he
departed hence a rich man, bearing with him all that was his. What an ambition! What a
new consolation! What magnanimity in his executors! A proclamation has been heard,
worthy of the ears of all, and a mother’s grief has been made void by a fair and holy promise,

to give entirely to her son his wealth as a funeral offering on his behalf, leaving nothing to
those who expected it.</p>
<p>21. Is this inadequate for our consolation? I will add a more potent remedy. I believe
the words of the wise, that every fair and God-beloved soul, when, set free from the bonds
of the body, it departs hence, at once enjoys a sense and perception of the blessings which
await it, inasmuch as that which darkened it has been purged away, or laid aside—I know
not how else to term it—and feels a wondrous pleasure and exultation, and goes rejoicing
to meet its Lord, having escaped as it were from the grievous poison of life here, and shaken
off the fetters which bound it and held down the wings of the mind, and so enters on the
enjoyment of the bliss laid up for it, of which it has even now some conception. Then, a
little later, it receives its kindred flesh, which once shared in its pursuits of things above,
from the earth which both gave and had been entrusted with it, and in some way known to
God, who knit them together and dissolved them, enters with it upon the inheritance of the
glory there. And, as it shared, through their close union, in its hardships, so also it bestows
upon it a portion of its joys, gathering it up entirely into itself, and becoming with it one in
spirit and in mind and in God, the mortal and mutable being swallowed up of life. Hear at
least how the inspired Ezekiel discourses of the knitting together of bones and sinews,2974
how after him Saint Paul speaks of the earthly tabernacle, and the house not made with
hands, the one to be dissolved, the other laid up in heaven, alleging absence from the body
to be presence with the Lord,2975 and bewailing his life in it as an exile, and therefore longing
for and hastening to his release. Why am I faint-hearted in my hopes? Why behave like a
mere creature of a day? I await the voice of the Archangel,2976 the last trumpet,2977 the
transformation of the heavens, the transfiguration of the earth, the liberation of the elements,
the renovation of the universe.2978 Then shall I see Cæsarius himself, no longer in exile,
no longer laid upon a bier, no longer the object of mourning and pity, but brilliant, glorious,
heavenly, such as in my dreams I have often beheld thee, dearest and most loving of brothers,
pictured thus by my desire, if not by the very truth.</p>
<p>22. But now, laying aside lamentation, I will look at myself, and examine my feelings,
that I may not unconsciously have in myself anything to be lamented. O ye sons of men,
for the words apply to you, how long will ye be hard-hearted and gross in mind? Why do
ye love vanity and seek after leasing,2979 supposing life here to be a great thing and these

were really grievous and awful? Are we not to know ourselves? Are we not to cast away
visible things? Are we not to look to the things unseen? Are we not, even if we are somewhat
grieved, to be on the contrary distressed at our lengthened sojourn,2980 like holy David,
who calls things here the tents of darkness, and the place of affliction, and the deep mire,2981
and the shadow of death;2982 because we linger in the tombs we bear about with us, because,
though we are gods, we die like men2983 the death of sin? This is my fear, this day and night
accompanies me, and will not let me breathe, on one side the glory, on the other the place
of correction: the former I long for till I can say, “My soul fainteth for Thy salvation;”2984
from the latter I shrink back shuddering; yet I am not afraid that this body of mine should
utterly perish in dissolution and corruption; but that the glorious creature of God (for
glorious it is if upright, just as it is dishonourable if sinful) in which is reason, morality, and
hope, should be condemned to the same dishonour as the brutes, and be no better after
death; a fate to be desired for the wicked, who are worthy of the fire yonder.</p>
<p>23. Would that I might mortify my members that are upon the earth,2985 would that I
might spend my all upon the spirit, walking in the way that is narrow and trodden by few,
not that which is broad and easy.2986 For glorious and great are its consequences, and our
hope is greater than our desert. What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?2987 What is

God; one with the flesh, the other with the spirit. I must be buried with Christ, arise with
Christ, be joint heir with Christ, become the son of God, yea, God Himself. See whither
our argument has carried us in its progress. I almost own myself indebted to the disaster
which has inspired me with such thoughts, and made me more enamoured of my departure
hence. This is the purpose of the great mystery for us. This is the purpose for us of God,

female, barbarian, Scythian, bond or free2994 (which are badges of the flesh), but might bear

so far received our form and model from Him, that we are recognized by it alone.</p>
<p>24. Yea, would that what we hope for might be, according to the great kindness of our

future, upon those who truly love Him;2996 bearing all things, enduring all things2997 for

<head>Oration VIII.</head>
<p>On his Sister Gorgonia.</p>
<p>The exact date of this Oration is uncertain. It is certainly (§23) later than the death of
Cæsarius, a.d. 369, and previous to the death of their father, a.d. 374. So much we gather
from the Oration itself, and the references made by some authors to a poem of S. Gregory do
not add anything certain to our knowledge (Poem. Hist. I. 1. v.v. 108, 227). The place in which
it was delivered is, almost without doubt, the city in which her married life had been spent.
The public details of that life are familiar to the audience. Gorgonia’s parents, and the
speaker himself, although known to them, are not spoken of in terms implying intimacy such
as we find in Orations known to have been delivered at Nazianzus. The spiritual father and
confidant of Gorgonia is present, certainly in a position of authority, probably seated in the
Episcopal throne. The husband of Gorgonia (Epitaph. 24) was named Alypius. His home, as
Clémencet and Benoît agree, on the authority of Elias, was at Iconium, of which city, at the
time, Faustinus was bishop. The names of Gorgonia’s two sons are unknown. Elias states
that they both became bishops. S. Gregory mentions her three daughters, Alypiana, Eugenia,
and Nonna, in his will. The oration is marked by an eloquence, piety, and tender feeling which
make it a worthy companion of that on Cæsarius.</p>
<p>Funeral Oration on his Sister Gorgonia.</p>
<p>1. In praising my sister, I shall pay honour to one of my own family; yet my praise will
not be false, because it is given to a relation, but, because it is true, will be worthy of commendation,
and its truth is based not only upon its justice, but upon well-known facts. For,
even if I wished, I should not be permitted to be partial; since everyone who hears me stands,
like a skilful critic, between my oration and the truth, to discountenance exaggeration, yet,
if he be a man of justice, demanding what is really due. So that my fear is not of outrunning
the truth, but, on the contrary, of falling short of it, and lessening her just repute by the extreme
inadequacy of my panegyric; for it is a hard task to match her excellences with suitable
action and words. Let us not then be so unjust as to praise every characteristic of other folk,
and disparage really valuable qualities because they are our own, so as to make some men
gain by their absence of kindred with us, while others suffer for their relationship. For
justice would be violated alike by the praise of the one and the neglect of the other, whereas
if we make the truth our standard and rule, and look to her alone, disregarding all the objects
of the vulgar and the mean, we shall praise or pass over everything according to its merits.</p>
<p>2. Yet it would be most unreasonable of all, if, while we refuse to regard it as a righteous
thing to defraud, insult, accuse, or treat unjustly in any way, great or small, those who are
our kindred, and consider wrong done to those nearest to us the worst of all; we were yet

<pb n="494"/>
to imagine that it would be an act of justice to deprive them of such an oration as is due
most of all to the good, and spend more words upon those who are evil, and beg for indulgent
treatment, than on those who are excellent and merely claim their due. For if we are not
prevented, as would be far more just, from praising men who have lived outside our own
circle, because we do not know and cannot personally testify to their merits, shall we be
prevented from praising those whom we do know, because of our friendship, or the envy
of the multitude, and especially those who have departed hence, whom it is too late to ingratiate
ourselves with, since they have escaped, amongst all other things, from the reach of
praise or blame.</p>
<p>3. Having now made a sufficient defence on these points, and shown how necessary it
is for me to be the speaker, come, let me proceed with my eulogy, rejecting all daintiness
and elegance of style (for she whom we are praising was unadorned and the absence of ornament
was to her, beauty), and yet performing, as a most indispensable debt, all those funeral
rites which are her due, and further instructing everyone in a zealous imitation of the
same virtue, since it is my object in every word and action to promote the perfection of
those committed to my charge. The task of praising the country and family of our departed
one I leave to another, more scrupulous in adhering to the rules of eulogy; nor will he lack
many fair topics, if he wish to deck her with external ornaments, as men deck a splendid
and beautiful form with gold and precious stones, and the artistic devices of the craftsman;
which, while they accentuate ugliness by their contrast, can add no attractiveness to the
beauty which surpasses them. For my part, I will only conform to such rules so far as to
allude to our common parents, for it would not be reverent to pass unnoticed the great
blessing of having such parents and teachers, and then speedily direct my attention to herself,
without further taxing the patience of those who are eager to learn what manner of woman
she was.</p>
<p>4. Who is there who knows not the Abraham and Sarah of these our latter days, Gregory
and Nonna his wife? For it is not well to omit the incitement to virtue of mentioning their
names. He has been justified by faith, she has dwelt with him who is faithful; he beyond all
hope has been the father of many nations,3004 she has spiritually travailed in their birth; he
escaped from the bondage of his father’s gods,3005 she is the daughter as well as the mother
<note type="footnote">3004 Rom. iv. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">3005 His father’s gods. These words, together with the reference to idols and idolators in § 5 and the lines
(Poem, Hist. I. i. 123–4, tome 2. p. 636) ὑπ᾽ εἰδώλοις πάρος ἦεν ζώων have led some writers (esp. Ullmann and
Clericus) to attribute the worship of idols to the Hypsistarii, and Clémencet points out that ζώων is only the
Ep. and Ion. partic. of ζάω, and does not mean “of animals.” The weakness of a reliance on a poetical expression
is shown in Dict. Christ. Biog. Here the words are the mystical application of the actual experience of Abraham,
and ἐίδωλον does not necessarily connote material idols. It is applied by S. Greg. Nyssen, Orat. funebr. de Placilla,
p. 965. B (ed. 1615) to the worship of Jesus Christ by the Arians. Cf. Introd. to Orat. xviii.</note>

of the free; he went out from kindred and home for the sake of the land of promise,3006 she
was the occasion of his exile; for on this head alone I venture to claim for her an honour
higher than that of Sarah; he set forth on so noble a pilgrimage, she readily shared with him
in its toils; he gave himself to the Lord, she both called her husband lord and regarded him
as such, and in part was thereby justified; whose was the promise, from whom, as far as in
them lay, was born Isaac, and whose was the gift.</p>
<p>5. This good shepherd was the result of his wife’s prayers and guidance, and it was from
her that he learned his ideal of a good shepherd’s life. He generously fled from his idols,
and afterwards even put demons to flight; he never consented to eat salt with idolators:
united together with a bond of one honour, of one mind, of one soul, concerned as much
with virtue and fellowship with God as with the flesh; equal in length of life and hoary hairs,
equal in prudence and brilliancy, rivals of each other, soaring beyond all the rest, possessed
in few respects by the flesh, and translated in spirit, even before dissolution: possessing not
the world, and yet possessing it, by at once despising and rightly valuing it: forsaking riches
and yet being rich through their noble pursuits; rejecting things here, and purchasing instead
the things yonder: possessed of a scanty remnant of this life, left over from their piety, but
of an abundant and long life for which they have laboured. I will say but one word more
about them: they have been rightly and fairly assigned, each to either sex; he is the ornament
of men, she of women, and not only the ornament but the pattern of virtue.</p>
<p>6. From them Gorgonia derived both her existence and her reputation; they sowed in
her the seeds of piety, they were the source of her fair life, and of her happy departure with
better hopes. Fair privileges these, and such as are not easily attained by many of those who
plume themselves highly upon their noble birth, and are proud of their ancestry. But, if I
must treat of her case in a more philosophic and lofty strain, Gorgonia’s native land was
Jerusalem above,3007 the object, not of sight but of contemplation, wherein is our common-
wealth, and whereto we are pressing on: whose citizen Christ is, and whose fellow-citizens
are the assembly and church of the first born who are written in heaven, and feast around
its great Founder in contemplation of His glory, and take part in the endless festival; her
nobility consisted in the preservation of the Image, and the perfect likeness to the Archetype,
which is produced by reason and virtue and pure desire, ever more and more conforming,
in things pertaining to God, to those truly initiated into the heavenly mysteries; and in
knowing whence, and of what character, and for what end we came into being.</p>
<p>7. This is what I know upon these points: and therefore it is that I both am aware and
assert that her soul was more noble than those of the East,3008 according to a better than

<pb n="496"/>
the ordinary rule of noble or ignoble birth, whose distinctions depend not on blood but on
character; nor does it classify those whom it praises or blames according to their families,
but as individuals. But speaking as I do of her excellences among those who know her, let
each one join in contributing some particular and aid me in my speech: for it is impossible
for one man to take in every point, however gifted with observation and intelligence.</p>
<p>8. In modesty she so greatly excelled, and so far surpassed, those of her own day, to say
nothing of those of old time who have been illustrious for modesty, that, in regard to the
two divisions of the life of all, that is, the married and the unmarried state, the latter being
higher and more divine, though more difficult and dangerous, while the former is more
humble and more safe, she was able to avoid the disadvantages of each, and to select and
combine all that is best in both, namely, the elevation of the one and the security of the
other, thus becoming modest without pride, blending the excellence of the married with
that of the unmarried state, and proving that neither of them absolutely binds us to, or
separates us from, God or the world (so that the one from its own nature must be utterly
avoided, and the other altogether praised): but that it is mind which nobly presides over
wedlock and maidenhood, and arranges and works upon them as the raw material of virtue
under the master-hand of reason. For though she had entered upon a carnal union, she was
not therefore separated from the spirit, nor, because her husband was her head, did she ignore
her first Head: but, performing those few ministrations due to the world and nature, according
to the will of the law of the flesh, or rather of Him who gave to the flesh these laws, she
consecrated herself entirely to God. But what is most excellent and honourable, she also
won over her husband to her side, and made of him a good fellow-servant, instead of an
unreasonable master. And not only so, but she further made the fruit of her body, her
children and her children’s children, to be the fruit of her spirit, dedicating to God not her
single soul, but the whole family and household, and making wedlock illustrious through
her own acceptability in wedlock, and the fair harvest she had reaped thereby; presenting
herself, as long as she lived, as an example to her offspring of all that was good, and when
summoned hence, leaving her will behind her, as a silent exhortation to her house.</p>
<p>9. The divine Solomon, in his instructive wisdom, I mean his Proverbs, praises the
woman3009 who looks to her household and loves her husband, contrasting her with one
who roams abroad, and is uncontrolled and dishonourable, and hunts for precious souls
with wanton words and ways, while she manages well at home and bravely sets about her
woman’s duties, as her hands hold the distaff, and she prepares two coats for her husband,
buying a field in due season, and makes good provision for the food of her servants, and
welcomes her friends at a liberal table; with all the other details in which he sings the praises
of the modest and industrious woman. Now, to praise my sister in these points would be
<note type="footnote">3009 Prov. xxxi. 10.</note>

<pb n="497"/>
to praise a statue for its shadow, or a lion for its claws, without allusion to its greatest perfections.
Who was more deserving of renown, and yet who avoided it so much and made
herself inaccessible to the eyes of man? Who knew better the due proportions of sobriety
and cheerfulness, so that her sobriety should not seem inhuman, nor her tenderness immodest,
but prudent in one, gentle in the other, her discretion was marked by a combination of
sympathy and dignity? Listen, ye women addicted to ease and display, who despise the veil
of shamefastness. Who ever so kept her eyes under control? Who so derided laughter, that
the ripple of a smile seemed a great thing to her? Who more steadfastly closed her ears?
And who opened them more to the Divine words, or rather, who installed the mind as ruler
of the tongue in uttering the judgments of God? Who, as she, regulated her lips?</p>
<p>10. Here, if you will, is another point of her excellence: one of which neither she nor
any truly modest and decorous woman thinks anything: but which we have been made to
think much of, by those who are too fond of ornament and display, and refuse to listen to
instruction on such matters. She was never adorned with gold wrought into artistic forms
of surpassing beauty, nor flaxen tresses, fully or partially displayed, nor spiral curls, nor
dishonouring designs of men who construct erections on the honourable head, nor costly
folds of flowing and transparent robes, nor graces of brilliant stones, which color the
neighbouring air, and cast a glow upon the form; nor the arts and witcheries of the painter,
nor that cheap beauty of the infernal creator who works against the Divine, hiding with his
treacherous pigments the creation of God, and putting it to shame with his honour, and
setting before eager eyes the imitation of an harlot instead of the form of God, so that this
bastard beauty may steal away that image which should be kept for God and for the world
to come. But though she was aware of the many and various external ornaments of women,
yet none of them was more precious to her than her own character, and the brilliancy stored
up within. One red tint was dear to her, the blush of modesty; one white one, the sign of
temperance: but pigments and pencillings, and living pictures, and flowing lines of beauty,
she left to women of the stage and of the streets, and to all who think it a shame and a reproach
to be ashamed.</p>
<p>11. Enough of such topics. Of her prudence and piety no adequate account can be
given, nor many examples found besides those of her natural and spiritual parents, who
were her only models, and of whose virtue she in no wise fell short, with this single exception
most readily admitted, that they, as she both knew and acknowledged, were the source of
her goodness, and the root of her own illumination. What could be keener than the intellect
of her who was recognized as a common adviser not only by those of her family, those of
the same people and of the one fold, but even by all men round about, who treated her
counsels and advice as a law not to be broken? What more sagacious than her words? What
more prudent than her silence? Having mentioned silence, I will proceed to that which was
most characteristic of her, most becoming to women, and most serviceable to these times.

<pb n="498"/>
Who had a fuller knowledge of the things of God, both from the Divine oracles, and from
her own understanding? But who was less ready to speak, confining herself within the due
limits of women? Moreover, as was the bounden duty of a woman who has learned true
piety, and that which is the only honourable object of insatiate desire, who, as she, adorned
temples with offerings, both others and this one, which will hardly, now she is gone, be so
adorned again? Or rather, who so presented herself to God as a living temple? Who again
paid such honor to Priests, especially to him who was her fellow soldier and teacher of piety,
whose are the good seeds, and the pair of children consecrated to God.</p>
<p>12. Who opened her house to those who live according to God with a more graceful
and bountiful welcome? And, which is greater than this, who bade them welcome with such
modesty and godly greetings? Further, who showed a mind more unmoved in sufferings?
Whose soul was more sympathetic to those in trouble? Whose hand more liberal to those
in want? I should not hesitate to honour her with the words of Job: Her door was opened
to all comers; the stranger did not lodge in the street. She was eyes to the blind, feet to the
lame, a mother to the orphan.3010 Why should I say more of her compassion to widows,
than that its fruit which she obtained was, never to be called a widow herself? Her house
was a common abode to all the needy of her family; and her goods no less common to all
in need than their own belonged to each. She hath dispersed abroad and given to the
poor,3011 and according to the infallible truth of the Gospel, she laid up much store in the
wine-presses above, and oftentimes entertained Christ in the person of those whose benefactress
she was. And, best of all, there was in her no unreal profession, but in secret she
cultivated piety before Him who seeth secret things. Everything she rescued from the ruler
of this world, everything she transferred to the safe garners. Nothing did she leave behind
to earth, save her body. She bartered everything for the hopes above: the sole wealth she
left to her children was the imitation of her example, and emulation of her merits.</p>
<p>13. But amid these tokens of incredible magnanimity, she did not surrender her body
to luxury, and unrestrained pleasures of the appetite, that raging and tearing dog, as though
presuming upon her acts of benevolence, as most men do, who redeem their luxury by
compassion to the poor, and instead of healing evil with good, receive evil as a recompense
for their good deeds. Nor did she, while subduing her dust3012 by fasting, leave to another
the medicine of hard lying; nor, while she found this of spiritual service, was she less restrained
in sleep than anyone else; nor, while regulating her life on this point as if freed from
the body, did she lie upon the ground, when others were passing the night erect, as the most
mortified men struggle to do. Nay in this respect she was seen to surpass not only women,
<note type="footnote">3010 Job xxix. 15; xxxi. 32.</note>

<note type="footnote">3012 Her dust, i.e. her body.</note>

<pb n="499"/>
but the most devoted of men, by her intelligent chanting of the psalter, her converse with,
and unfolding and apposite recollection of, the Divine oracles, her bending of her knees
which had grown hard and almost taken root in the ground, her tears to cleanse her stains
with contrite heart and spirit of lowliness, her prayer rising heavenward, her mind freed
from wandering in rapture; in all these, or in any one of them, is there man or woman who
can boast of having surpassed her? Besides, it is a great thing to say, but it is true, that while
she was zealous in her endeavour after some points of excellence, of others she was the
paragon: of some she was the discoverer, in others she excelled. And if in some single
particular she was rivalled, her superiority consists in her complete grasp of all. Such was
her success in all points, as none else attained even in a moderate degree in one: to such
perfection did she attain in each particular, that any one might of itself have supplied the
place of all.</p>
<p>14. O untended body, and squalid garments, whose only flower is virtue! O soul,
clinging to the body, when reduced almost to an immaterial state through lack of food; or
rather, when the body had been mortified by force, even before dissolution, that the soul
might attain to freedom, and escape the entanglements of the senses! O nights of vigil, and
psalmody, and standing which lasts from one day to another! O David, whose strains never
seem tedious to faithful souls! O tender limbs, flung upon the earth and, contrary to nature,
growing hard! O fountains of tears, sowing in affliction that they might reap in joy.3013 O
cry in the night, piercing the clouds and reaching unto Him that dwelleth in the heavens!
O fervour of spirit, waxing bold in prayerful longings against the dogs of night, and frosts
and rain, and thunders, and hail, and darkness! O nature of woman overcoming that of
man in the common struggle for salvation, and demonstrating that the distinction between
male and female is one of body not of soul! O Baptismal purity, O soul, in the pure chamber
of thy body, the bride of Christ! O bitter eating! O Eve mother of our race and of our sin!
O subtle serpent, and death, overcome by her self-discipline! O self-emptying of Christ,
and form of a servant, and sufferings, honoured by her mortification!</p>
<p>15. Oh! how am I to count up all her traits, or pass over most of them without injury
to those who know them not? Here however it is right to subjoin the rewards of her piety,
for indeed I take it that you, who knew her life well, have long been eager and desirous to
find in my speech not only things present, or her joys yonder, beyond the conception and
hearing and sight of man, but also those which the righteous Rewarder bestowed upon her
here: a matter which often tends to the edification of unbelievers, who from small things
attain to faith in those which are great, and from things which are seen to those which are
not seen. I will mention then some facts which are generally notorious, others which have
been from most men kept secret; and that because her Christian principle made a point of
<note type="footnote">3013 Ps. cxxvi. 5.</note>

<pb n="500"/>
not making a display of her [Divine] favours. You know how her maddened mules ran
away with her carriage, and unfortunately overturned it, how horribly she was dragged
along, and seriously injured, to the scandal of unbelievers at the permission of such accidents
to the righteous, and how quickly their unbelief was corrected: for, all crushed and bruised
as she was, in bones and limbs, alike in those exposed and in those out of sight, she would
have none of any physician, except Him Who had permitted it; both because she shrunk
from the inspection and the hands of men, preserving, even in suffering, her modesty, and
also awaiting her justification from Him Who allowed this to happen, so that she owed her
preservation to none other than to Him: with the result that men were no less struck by her
unhoped-for recovery than by her misfortune, and concluded that the tragedy had happened
for her glorification through sufferings, the suffering being human, the recovery superhuman,
and giving a lesson to those who come after, exhibiting in a high degree faith in the midst
of suffering, and patience under calamity, but in a still higher degree the kindness of God
to them that are such as she. For to the beautiful promise to the righteous “though he fall,
he shall not be utterly broken,”3014 has been added one more recent, “though he be utterly
broken, he shall speedily be raised up and glorified.”3015 For if her misfortune was unreasonable,
her recovery was extraordinary, so that health soon stole away the injury, and the
cure became more celebrated than the blow.</p>
<p>16. O remarkable and wonderful disaster! O injury more noble than security! O
prophecy, “He hath smitten, and He will bind us up, and revive us, and after three days He
will raise us up,”3016 portending indeed, as it did, a greater and more sublime event, yet no
less applicable to Gorgonia’s sufferings! This then, notorious to all, even to those afar off,
for the wonder spread to all, and the lesson was stored up in the tongues and ears of all, with
the other wonderful works and powers of God. But the following incident, hitherto unknown
and concealed from most men by the Christian principle I spoke of, and her pious shrinking
from vanity and display, dost thou bid me tell, O best3017 and most perfect of shepherds,
pastor of this holy sheep, and dost thou further give thy assent to it, since to us alone has
this secret been entrusted, and we were mutual witnesses of the marvel, or are we still to
keep our faith to her who is gone? Yet I do think, that as that was the time to be silent, this
is the time to manifest it, not only for the glory of God, but also for the consolation of those
in affliction.</p>

<p>17. She was sick in body, and dangerously ill of an extraordinary and malignant disease,
her whole frame was incessantly fevered, her blood at one time agitated and boiling, then
curdling with coma, incredible pallor, and paralysis of mind and limbs: and this not at long
intervals, but sometimes very frequently. Its virulence seemed beyond human aid; the skill
of physicians, who carefully examined the case, both singly and in consultation, was of no
avail; nor the tears of her parents, which often have great power, nor public supplications
and intercessions, in which all the people joined as earnestly as if for their own preservation:
for her safety was the safety of all, as, on the contrary, her suffering and sickness was a
common misfortune.</p>
<p>18. What then did this great soul, worthy offspring of the greatest, and what was the
medicine for her disorder, for we have now come to the great secret? Despairing of all
other aid, she betook herself to the Physician of all, and awaiting the silent hours of night,
during a slight intermission of the disease, she approached the altar with faith, and, calling
upon Him Who is honoured thereon, with a mighty cry, and every kind of invocation,
calling to mind all His former works of power, and well she knew those both of ancient and
of later days, at last she ventured on an act of pious and splendid effrontery: she imitated
the woman whose fountain of blood was dried up by the hem of Christ’s garment.3018 What
did she do? Resting her head with another cry upon the altar, and with a wealth of tears, as
she who once bedewed the feet of Christ,3019 and declaring that she would not loose her
hold until she was made whole, she then applied her medicine to her whole body, viz., such
a portion of the antitypes3020 of the Precious Body and Blood as she treasured in her hand,
mingling therewith her tears, and, O the wonder, she went away feeling at once that she was
saved, and with the lightness of health in body, soul, and mind, having received, as the reward
of her hope, that which she hoped for, and having gained bodily by means of spiritual
strength. Great though these things be, they are not untrue. Believe them all of you,
whether sick or sound, that ye may either keep or regain your health. And that my story is
no mere boastfulness is plain from the silence in which she kept, while alive, what I have
revealed. Nor should I now have published it, be well assured, had I not feared that so great
a marvel would have been utterly hidden from the faithful and unbelieving of these and
later days.</p>
<p>19. Such was her life. Most of its details I have left untold, lest my speech should grow
to undue proportions, and lest I should seem to be too greedy for her fair fame: but perhaps
we should be wronging her holy and illustrious death, did we not mention some of its excellences;
especially as she so longed for and desired it. I will do so therefore, as concisely as
<note type="footnote">3018 S. Matt. ix. 20.</note>

I can. She longed for her dissolution, for indeed she had great boldness towards Him who
called her, and preferred to be with Christ, beyond all things on earth.3021 And there is
none of the most amorous and unrestrained, who has such love for his body, as she had to
fling away these fetters, and escape from the mire in which we spend our lives, and to associate
in purity with Him Who is Fair, and entirely to hold her Beloved, Who is I will even
say it, her Lover, by Whose rays, feeble though they now are, we are enlightened, and Whom,
though separated from Him, we are able to know. Nor did she fail even of this desire, divine
and sublime though it was, and, what is still greater, she had a foretaste of His Beauty through
her forecast and constant watching. Her only sleep transferred her to exceeding joys, and
her one vision embraced her departure at the foreappointed time, having been made aware
of this day, so that according to the decision of God she might be prepared and yet not disturbed.</p>
<p>20. She had recently obtained the blessing of cleansing and perfection, which we have
all received from God as a common gift and foundation of our new3022 life. Or rather all
her life was a cleansing and perfecting: and while she received regeneration from the Holy
Spirit, its security was hers by virtue of her former life. And in her case almost alone, I will
venture to say, the mystery was a seal rather than a gift of grace. And when her husband’s
perfection was her one remaining desire (and if you wish me briefly to describe the man, I
do not know what more to say of him than that he was her husband) in order that she might
be consecrated to God in her whole body, and not depart half-perfected, or leave behind
her imperfect anything that was hers; she did not even fail of this petition, from Him Who
fulfils the desire of them that fear Him,3023 and accomplishes their requests.</p>
<p>21. And now when she had all things to her mind, and nothing was lacking of her desires,
and the appointed time drew nigh, being thus prepared for death and departure, she fulfilled
the law which prevails in such matters, and took to her bed. After many injunctions to her
husband, her children, and her friends, as was to be expected from one who was full of
conjugal, maternal, and brotherly love, and after making her last day a day of solemn festival
with brilliant discourse upon the things above, she fell asleep, full not of the days of man,
for which she had no desire, knowing them to be evil for her, and mainly occupied with our
dust and wanderings, but more exceedingly full of the days of God, than I imagine any one
even of those who have departed in a wealth of hoary hairs, and have numbered many terms
of years. Thus she was set free, or, it is better to say, taken to God, or flew away, or changed
her abode, or anticipated by a little the departure of her body.</p>

<p>22. Yet what was I on the point of omitting? But perhaps thou, who art her spiritual
father, wouldst not have allowed me, and hast carefully concealed the wonder, and made it
known to me. It is a great point for her distinction, and in our memory of her virtue, and
regret for her departure. But trembling and tears have seized upon me, at the recollection
of the wonder. She was just passing away, and at her last breath, surrounded by a group of
relatives and friends performing the last offices of kindness, while her aged mother bent
over her, with her soul convulsed with envy of her departure, anguish and affection being
blended in the minds of all. Some longed to hear some burning word to be branded in their
recollection; others were eager to speak, yet no one dared; for tears were mute and the pangs
of grief unconsoled, since it seemed sacrilegious, to think that mourning could be an honour
to one who was thus passing away. So there was solemn silence, as if her death had been a
religious ceremony. There she lay, to all appearance, breathless, motionless, speechless; the
stillness of her body seemed paralysis, as though the organs of speech were dead, after that
which could move them was gone. But as her pastor, who in this wonderful scene, was
carefully watching her, perceived that her lips were gently moving, and placed his ear to
them, which his disposition and sympathy emboldened him to do,—but do you expound
the meaning of this mysterious calm, for no one can disbelieve it on your word! Under her
breath she was repeating a psalm—the last words of a psalm—to say the truth, a testimony
to the boldness with which she was departing, and blessed is he who can fall asleep with
these words, “I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest.”3024 Thus wert thou singing,
fairest of women, and thus it fell out unto thee; and the song became a reality, and attended
on thy departure as a memorial of thee, who hast entered upon sweet peace after suffering,
and received (over and above the rest which comes to all), that sleep which is due to the
beloved,3025 as befitted one who lived and died amid the words of piety.</p>
<p>23. Better, I know well, and far more precious than eye can see, is thy present lot, the
song of them that keep holy-day,3026 the throng of angels, the heavenly host, the vision of
glory, and that splendour, pure and perfect beyond all other, of the Trinity Most High, no
longer beyond the ken of the captive mind, dissipated by the senses, but entirely contemplated
and possessed by the undivided mind, and flashing upon our souls with the whole light of
Godhead: Mayest thou enjoy to the full all those things whose crumbs thou didst, while
still upon earth, possess through the reality of thine inclination towards them. And if thou
takest any account of our affairs, and holy souls receive from God this privilege, do thou
accept these words of mine, in place of, and in preference to many panegyrics, which I have
bestowed upon Cæsarius before thee, and upon thee after him—since I have been preserved

<head>Oration XII.</head>
<p>His Father, When He Had Entrusted to Him the Care of the Church of
Nazianzus.</p>
<p>ThisOration was delivered a.d. 372. Two years earlier Valens had divided Cappadocia
into two provinces. Anthimus, Bishop of Tyana, asserting that the ecclesiastical provinces
were regulated by those of the empire, claimed metropolitical rights over the churches of
Cappadocia Secunda, in opposition to S. Basil, who had hitherto been metropolitan of the
undivided province. S. Basil, with the intention of vindicating the permanence of his former
rights, created a new see at Sasima, on the borders of the two provinces, and with great difficulty
prevailed upon S. Gregory to receive consecration as its first Bishop. S. Gregory, who had
“bent his neck, but not his will,”3027 was for a long time reluctant to enter upon his Episcopal
duties, and at last was prevailed upon by S. Gregory of Nyssa, S. Basil’s brother, to make an
attempt to do so. When, however, he found that Anthimus was prepared to bar his entrance
by force of arms, he returned home, definitely resigned his see, and once more betook himself
to the life of solitude which he so dearly loved. Recalled hence, he consented,3028 at his father’s
earnest entreaty, to undertake provisionally the duties of Bishop-coadjutor of Nazianzus: and
pronounced this short discourse on the occasion of his installation.</p>
<p>1. I opened my mouth, and drew in the Spirit,3029 and I give myself and my all to the
Spirit, my action and speech, my inaction and silence, only let Him hold me and guide me,
and move both hand and mind and tongue whither it is right, and He wills: and restrain
them as it is right and expedient. I am an instrument of God, a rational instrument, an instrument
tuned and struck by that skilful artist, the Spirit. Yesterday His work in me was
silence. I mused on abstinence from speech. Does He strike upon my mind today? My
speech shall be heard, and I will muse on utterance. I am neither so talkative, as to desire
to speak, when He is bent on silence; nor so reserved and ignorant as to set a watch before
my lips3030 when it is the time to speak: but I open and close my door at the will of that
Mind and Word and Spirit, Who is One kindred Deity.</p>
<p>2. I will speak then, since I am so bidden. And I will speak both to the good shepherd
here, and to you, his holy flock, as I think is best both for me to speak, and for you to hear
to-day. Why is it that you have begged for one to share your shepherd’s toil? For my speech
shall begin with you, O dear and honoured head, worthy of that of Aaron, down which runs

that spiritual and priestly ointment upon his beard and clothing.3031 Why is it that, while
yet able to stablish and guide many, and actually guiding them in the power of the Spirit,
you support yourself with a staff and prop in your spiritual works? Is it because you have
heard and know that even with the illustrious Aaron were anointed Eleazar and Ithamar,
the sons of Aaron?3032 For I pass over Nadab and Abihu,3033 lest the allusion be ill-omened:
and Moses during his lifetime appoints Joshua in his stead, as lawgiver and general over
those who were pressing on to the land of promise? The office of Aaron and Hur, supporting
the hands of Moses on the mount where Amalek was warred down3034 by the Cross,3035
prefigured and typified long before, I feel willing to pass by, as not very suitable or applicable
to us: for Moses did not choose them to share his work as lawgiver, but as helpers in his
prayer and supports for the weariness of his hands.</p>
<p>3. What is it then that ails you? What is your weakness? Is it physical? I am ready to
sustain you, yea I have sustained, and been sustained, like Jacob of old, by your fatherly
blessings.3036 Is it spiritual? Who is stronger, and more fervent, especially now, when the
powers of the flesh are ebbing and fading, like so many barriers which interfere with, and
dim the brilliancy of a light? For these powers are wont, for the most part, to wage war upon
and oppose one another, while the body’s health is purchased by the sickness of the soul,
and the soul flourishes and looks upward when pleasures are stilled and fade away along
with the body. But, wonderful as your simplicity and nobility have seemed to me before,
how is it that you have no fear, especially in times like these, that your spirit will be considered
a pretext, and that most men will suppose, in spite of our spiritual professions, that we are
undertaking this from carnal motives. For most men have made3037 the office to be looked
upon as great and princely, and accompanied with considerable enjoyment, even though a
man have the charge and rule over a more slender flock than this, and one which affords
more troubles than pleasures. Thus far of your simplicity, or parental preference, if it be
so, which makes you neither admit yourself, nor readily suspect in others anything disgraceful;
for a mind hardly roused to evil, is slow to suspect evil. My second duty is briefly to
address this people of yours, or now even of mine.</p>

use moderate terms, the kindliness of my friend. So, help me, each of you who can, and
stretch out a hand to me who am pressed down and torn asunder by regret and enthusiasm.
The one suggests flights, mountains and deserts, and calm of soul and body, and that the
mind should retire into itself, and recall its powers from sensible things, in order to hold
pure communion with God, and be clearly illumined by the flashing rays of the Spirit, with
no admixture or disturbance of the divine light by anything earthly or clouded, until we
come to the source of the effulgence which we enjoy here, and regret and desire are alike
stayed, when our mirrors3038 pass away in the light of truth. The other wills that I should
come forward, and bear fruit for the common good, and be helped by helping others; and
publish the Divine light, and bring to God a people for His own possession, a holy nation,
a royal priesthood,3039 and His image cleansed in many souls. And this, because, as a park
is better than and preferable to a tree, the whole heaven with its ornaments to a single star,
and the body to a limb, so also, in the sight of God, is the reformation of a whole church
preferable to the progress of a single soul: and therefore, I ought not to look only on my
own interest, but also on that of others.3040 For Christ also likewise, when it was possible
for him to abide in His own honour and deity, not only so far emptied Himself as to take
the form of a slave,3041 but also endured the cross, despising the shame,3042 that he might
by His own sufferings destroy sin, and by death slay death.3043 The former are the imaginings
of desire, the latter the teachings of the Spirit. And I, standing midway between the desire
and the Spirit, and not knowing to which of the two I should rather yield, will impart to you
what seems to me the best and safest course, that you may test it with me and take part in
my design.</p>
<p>5. It seemed to me to be best and least dangerous to take a middle course between desire
and fear, and to yield in part to desire, in part to the Spirit: and that this would be the case,
if I neither altogether evaded the office, and so refused the grace, which would be dangerous,
nor yet assumed a burden beyond my powers, for it is a heavy one. The former indeed is
suited to the person of another, the latter to another’s power, or rather to undertake both
would be madness. But piety and safety would alike advise me to proportion the office to
my power, and as is the case with food, to accept that which is within my power and refuse

what is beyond it, for health is gained for the body, and tranquillity for the soul, by such a
course of moderation. Therefore I now consent to share in the cares of my excellent father,
like an eaglet, not quite vainly flying close to a mighty and high soaring eagle. But hereafter
I will offer my wing to the Spirit to be borne whither, and as, He wills: no one shall force
or drag me in any direction, contrary to His counsel. For sweet it is to inherit a father’s
toils, and this flock is more familiar than a strange and foreign one; I would even add, more
precious in the sight of God, unless the spell of affection deceives me, and the force of habit
robs me of perception: nor is there any more useful or safer course than that willing rulers
should rule willing subjects: since it is our practice not to lead by force, or by compulsion,
but by good will. For this would not hold together even another form of government, since
that which is held in by force is wont, when opportunity offers, to strike for freedom: but
freedom of will more than anything else it is, which holds together our—I will not call it
rule, but—tutorship. For the mystery of godliness3044 belongs to those who are willing, not
to those who are overpowered.</p>
<p>6. This is my speech to you, my good men, uttered in simplicity and with all good will,
and this is the secret of my mind. And may the victory rest with that which will be for the
profit of both you and me, under the Spirit’s guidance of our affairs, (for our discourse
comes back again to the same point,)3045 to Whom we have given ourselves, and the head
anointed with the oil of perfection, in the Almighty Father, and the Only-begotten Son, and
the Holy Spirit, Who is God. For how long shall we hide3046 the lamp under the bushel,3047
and withhold from others the full knowledge of the Godhead, when it ought to be now put
upon the lampstand and give light to all churches and souls and to the whole fulness of the
world, no longer by means of metaphors, or intellectual sketches, but by distinct declaration?
And this indeed is a most perfect setting forth of Theology to those Who have been deemed
worthy of this grace in Christ Jesus Himself, our Lord, to Whom be glory, honour, and
power for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XVI.</head>
<p>head>On His Father’s Silence, Because of the Plague of Hail.</p>
<p>ThisOration belongs to the year a.d. 373. A series of disasters had befallen the people of
Nazianzus. A deadly cattle plague, which had devastated their herds, had been followed by
a prolonged drought, and now their just ripened crops had been ruined by a storm of rain and
hail. The people flocked to the church, and finding S. Gregory the elder so overwhelmed by
his sense of these terrible misfortunes that he was unable to address them, implored his coadjutor
to enter the pulpit. The occasion gave no time for preparation, so S. Gregory poured out
his feelings in a discourse which was in the fullest sense of the words ex tempore. Its present
form, however, as Benoît suggests, may be due to a later polishing of notes taken down at the
time of delivery.</p>
<p>1. Why do you infringe upon the approved order of things? Why would you do violence
to a tongue which is under obligation to the law? Why do you challenge a speech which is
in subjection to the Spirit? Why, when you have excused the head, have you hastened to
the feet? Why do you pass by Aaron3048 and urge forward Eleazar? I cannot allow the
fountain to be dammed up, while the rivulet runs its course; the sun to be hidden, while the
star shines forth; hoar hairs to be in retirement, while youth lays down the law; wisdom to
be silent, while inexperience speaks with assurance. A heavy rain is not always more useful
than a gentle shower. Nay, indeed, if it be too violent, it sweeps away the earth, and increases
the proportion of the farmer’s loss: while a gentle fall, which sinks deep, enriches the soil,
benefits the tiller and makes the corn grow to a fine crop. So the fluent speech is not more
profitable than the wise. For the one, though it perhaps gave a slight pleasure, passes away,
and is dispersed as soon, and with as little effect, as the air on which it struck, though it
charms with its eloquence the greedy ear. But the other sinks into the mind, and opening
wide its mouth, fills it3049 with the Spirit, and, showing itself nobler than its origin, produces
a rich harvest by a few syllables.</p>
<p>2. I have not yet alluded to the true and first wisdom, for which our wonderful husbandman
and shepherd is conspicuous. The first wisdom is a life worthy of praise, and kept pure
for God, or being purified for Him Who is all-pure and all-luminous, Who demands of us,
us His only sacrifice, purification—that is, a contrite heart and the sacrifice of praise,3050
and a new creation in Christ,3051 and the new man,3052 and the like, as the Scripture loves

to call it. The first wisdom is to despise that wisdom which consists of language and figures
of speech, and spurious and unnecessary embellishments. Be it mine to speak five words
with my understanding in the church, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue,3053 and
with the unmeaning voice of a trumpet,3054 which does not rouse my soldier to the spiritual
combat. This is the wisdom which I praise, which I welcome. By this the ignoble have won
renown, and the despised have attained the highest honours. By this a crew of fishermen
have taken the whole world in the meshes of the Gospel-net, and overcome by a word finished
and cut short3055 the wisdom that comes to naught.3056 I count not wise the man who is
clever in words, nor him who is of a ready tongue, but unstable and undisciplined in soul,
like the tombs which, fair and beautiful as they are outwardly, are fetid with corpses within,
3057 and full of manifold ill-savours; but him who speaks but little of virtue, yet gives
many examples of it in his practice, and proves the trustworthiness of his language by his
life.</p>
<p>3. Fairer in my eyes, is the beauty which we can gaze upon than that which is painted
in words: of more value the wealth which our hands can hold, than that which is imagined
in our dreams; and more real the wisdom of which we are convinced by deeds, than that
which is set forth in splendid language. For “a good understanding,” he saith, “have all they
that do thereafter,”3058 not they who proclaim it. Time is the best touchstone of this wisdom,
and “the hoary head is a crown of glory.”3059 For if, as it seems to me as well as to Solomon,
we must “judge none blessed before his death,”3060 and it is uncertain “what a day may
bring forth,”3061 since our life here below has many turnings, and the body of our humiliation3062
is ever rising, falling and changing; surely he, who without fault has almost drained
the cup of life, and nearly reached the haven of the common sea of existence is more secure,
and therefore more enviable, than one who has yet a long voyage before him.</p>
<p>4. Do not thou, therefore, restrain a tongue whose noble utterances and fruits have
been many, which has begotten many children of righteousness—yea, lift up thine eyes
round about and see,3063 how many are its sons, and what are its treasures; even this whole

people, whom thou hast begotten in Christ through the Gospel.3064 Grudge not to us those
words which are excellent rather than many, and do not yet give us a foretaste of our impending
loss.3065 Speak in words which, if few, are dear and most sweet to me, which, if
scarcely audible, are perceived from their spiritual cry, as God heard the silence of Moses,
and said to him when interceding mentally, “Why criest thou unto Me?”3066 Comfort this
people, I pray thee, I, who was thy nursling, and have since been made Pastor, and now even
Chief Pastor. Give a lesson, to me in the Pastor’s art, to this people of obedience. Discourse
awhile on our present heavy blow, about the just judgments of God, whether we grasp their
meaning, or are ignorant of their great deep.3067 How again “mercy is put in the balance,”3068
as holy Isaiah declares, for goodness is not without discernment, as the first labourers in
the vineyard3069 fancied, because they could not perceive any distinction between those
who were paid alike: and how anger, which is called “the cup in the hand of the Lord,”3070
and “the cup of falling which is drained,”3071 is in proportion to transgressions, even though
He abates to all somewhat of what is their due, and dilutes with compassion the unmixed
draught of His wrath. For He inclines from severity to indulgence towards those who accept
chastisement with fear, and who after a slight affliction conceive and are in pain with conversion,
and bring forth3072 the perfect spirit of salvation; but nevertheless he reserves the
dregs,3073 the last drop of His anger, that He may pour it out entire upon those who, instead
of being healed by His kindness, grow obdurate, like the hard-hearted Pharaoh,3074 that
bitter taskmaster, who is set forth as an example of the power3075 of God over the ungodly.</p>
<p>5. Tell us whence come such blows and scourges, and what account we can give of
them. Is it some disordered and irregular motion or some unguided current, some unreason
of the universe, as though there were no Ruler of the world, which is therefore borne along
by chance, as is the doctrine of the foolishly wise, who are themselves borne along at random
by the disorderly spirit of darkness? Or are the disturbances and changes of the universe,

(which was originally constituted, blended, bound together, and set in motion in a harmony
known only to Him Who gave it motion,) directed by reason and order under the guidance
of the reins of Providence? Whence come famines and tornadoes and hailstorms, our present
warning blow? Whence pestilences, diseases, earthquakes, tidal waves, and fearful things
in the heavens? And how is the creation, once ordered for the enjoyment of men, their
common and equal delight, changed for the punishment of the ungodly, in order that we
may be chastised through that for which, when honoured with it, we did not give thanks,
and recognise in our sufferings that power which we did not recognise in our benefits? How
is it that some receive at the Lord’s hand double for their sins,3076 and the measure of their
wickedness is doubly filled up, as in the correction of Israel, while the sins of others are done
away by a sevenfold recompense into their bosom?3077 What is the measure of the Amorites
that is not yet full?3078 And how is the sinner either let go, or chastised again, let go perhaps,
because reserved for the other world, chastised, because healed thereby in this? Under what
circumstances again is the righteous, when unfortunate, possibly being put to the test, or,
when prosperous, being observed, to see if he be poor in mind or not very far superior to
visible things, as indeed conscience, our interior and unerring tribunal, tells us. What is
our calamity, and what its cause? Is it a test of virtue, or a touchstone of wickedness? And
is it better to bow beneath it as a chastisement, even though it be not so, and humble ourselves
under the mighty hand of God,3079 or, considering it as a trial, to rise superior to it? On
these points give us instruction and warning, lest we be too much discouraged by our present
calamity, or fall into the gulf of evil and despise it; for some such feeling is very general; but
rather that we may bear our admonition quietly, and not provoke one more severe by our
insensibility to this.</p>
<p>6. Terrible is an unfruitful season, and the loss of the crops. It could not be otherwise,
when men are already rejoicing in their hopes, and counting on their all but harvested stores.
Terrible again is an unseasonable harvest, when the farmers labour with heavy hearts, sitting
as it were beside the grave of their crops, which the gentle rain nourished, but the wild storm
has rooted up, whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom,3080 nor have they obtained the blessing which passers-by bestow upon the
farmers. Wretched indeed is the sight of the ground devastated, cleared, and shorn of its
ornaments, over which the blessed Joel wails in his most tragic picture of the desolation of

with its former beauty its final disorder, and thus discourses on the anger of the Lord when
He smites the land: before him is the garden of Eden, behind Him a desolate wilderness.3083
Terrible indeed these things are, and more than terrible, when we are grieved only at what
is present, and are not yet distressed by the feeling of a severer blow: since, as in sickness,
the suffering which pains us from time to time is more distressing than that which is not
present. But more terrible still are those which the treasures3084 of God’s wrath contain, of
which God forbid that you should make trial; nor will you, if you fly for refuge to the mercies
of God, and win over by your tears Him Who will have mercy,3085 and avert by your conversion
what remains of His wrath. As yet, this is gentleness and loving-kindness and gentle
reproof, and the first elements of a scourge to train our tender years: as yet, the smoke3086
of His anger, the prelude of His torments; not yet has fallen the flaming fire,3087 the climax
of His being moved; not yet the kindled coals,3088 the final scourge, part of which He
threatened, when He lifted up the other over us, part He held back by force, when He brought
the other upon us; using the threat and the blow alike for our instruction, and making a way
for His indignation, in the excess of His goodness; beginning with what is slight, so that the
more severe may not be needed; but ready to instruct us by what is greater, if He be forced
so to do.</p>

to bring to naught, to make childless, and to spare neither flesh, nor marrow, nor bones. I

a leopard in the way of the Assyrians,3090 not only those of that day, but if anyone now is
an Assyrian in wickedness: nor is it possible to escape the might and speed of His wrath
when He watches over our impieties, and His jealousy,3091 which knoweth to devour His

the making waste, the melting of the heart, and knocking of the knees together,3093 such
are the punishments of the ungodly. I do not dwell on the judgments to come, to which
indulgence in this world delivers us, as it is better to be punished and cleansed now than to
be transmitted to the torment to come, when it is the time of chastisement, not of cleansing.
For as he who remembers God here is conqueror of death (as David3094 has most excellently
sung) so the departed have not in the grave confession and restoration; for God has confined
life and action to this world, and to the future the scrutiny of what has been done.</p>
<p>8. What shall we do in the day of visitation,3095 with which one of the Prophets terrifies
me, whether that of the righteous sentence of God against us, or that upon the mountains
and hills, of which we have heard, or whatever and whenever it may be, when He will reason
with us, and oppose us, and set before us3096 those bitter accusers, our sins, comparing our
wrongdoings with our benefits, and striking thought with thought, and scrutinising action
with action, and calling us to account for the image3097 which has been blurred and spoilt
by wickedness, till at last He leads us away self-convicted and self-condemned, no longer
able to say that we are being unjustly treated—a thought which is able even here sometimes
to console in their condemnation those who are suffering.</p>
<p>9. But then what advocate shall we have? What pretext? What false excuse? What
plausible artifice? What device contrary to the truth will impose upon the court, and rob
it of its right judgment, which places in the balance for us all, our entire life, action, word,
and thought, and weighs against the evil that which is better, until that which preponderates
wins the day, and the decision is given in favour of the main tendency; after which there is
no appeal, no higher court, no defence on the ground of subsequent conduct, no oil obtained
from the wise virgins, or from them that sell, for the lamps going out,3098 no repentance of
the rich man wasting away in the flame,3099 and begging for repentance for his friends, no

fearful; or rather more fearful because it is also just; when the thrones are set and the Ancient

down by all!3121 This is what I feel I must say as to my fears, thus have I been pained by
this blow, and this, I will further tell you, is my prayer. We have sinned, we have done amiss,
and have dealt wickedly,3122 for we have forgotten Thy commandments and walked after
our own evil thought,3123 for we have behaved ourselves unworthily of the calling and gospel
of Thy Christ, and of His holy sufferings and humiliation for us; we have become a reproach
to Thy beloved, priest and people, we have erred together, we have all gone out of the way,
we have together become unprofitable, there is none that doeth judgment and justice, no
not one.3124 We have cut short Thy mercies and kindness and the bowels and compassion
of our God, by our wickedness and the perversity of our doings, in which we have turned
away. Thou art good, but we have done amiss; Thou art long-suffering, but we are worthy
of stripes; we acknowledge Thy goodness, though we are without understanding, we have
been scourged for but few of our faults; Thou art terrible, and who will resist Thee?3125 the
mountains will tremble before Thee; and who will strive against the might of Thine arm?
If Thou shut the heaven, who will open it? And if Thou let loose Thy torrents, who will restrain
them? It is a light thing in Thine eyes to make poor and to make rich, to make alive
and to kill, to strike and to heal, and Thy will is perfect action. Thou art angry, and we have
sinned,3126 says one of old, making confession; and it is now time for me to say the opposite,
“We have sinned, and Thou art angry:” therefore have we become a reproach to our
neighbours.3127 Thou didst turn Thy face from us, and we were filled with dishonour. But
stay, Lord, cease, Lord, forgive, Lord, deliver us not up for ever because of our iniquities,
and let not our chastisements be a warning for others, when we might learn wisdom from
the trials of others. Of whom? Of the nations which know Thee not, and kingdoms which
have not been subject to Thy power. But we are Thy people,3128 O Lord, the rod of Thine
inheritance; therefore correct us, but in goodness and not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring
us to nothingness3129 and contempt among all that dwell on the earth.</p>
<p>13. With these words I invoke mercy: and if it were possible to propitiate His wrath
with whole burnt offerings or sacrifices, I would not even have spared these. Do you also
yourselves imitate your trembling priest, you, my beloved children, sharers with me alike

of the Divine correction and loving-kindness. Possess your souls in tears, and stay His wrath
by amending your way of life. Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,3130 as blessed Joel
with us charges you: gather the elders, and the babes that suck the breasts, whose tender
age wins our pity, and is specially worthy of the loving-kindness of God. I know also what
he enjoins both upon me, the minister of God, and upon you, who have been thought worthy
of the same honour, that we should enter His house in sackcloth and lament night and day
between the porch and the altar, in piteous array, and with more piteous voices, crying aloud
without ceasing on behalf of ourselves and the people, sparing nothing, either toil or word,
which may propitiate God: saying “Spare, O Lord, Thy people, and give not Thine heritage
to reproach,”3131 and the rest of the prayer; surpassing the people in our sense of the affliction
as much as in our rank, instructing them in our own persons in compunction and correction
of wickedness, and in the consequent long-suffering of God, and cessation of the scourge.</p>
<p>14. Come then, all of you, my brethren, let us worship and fall down, and weep before
the Lord our Maker;3132 let us appoint a public mourning, in our various ages and families,
let us raise the voice of supplication; and let this, instead of the cry which He hates, enter
into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Let us anticipate His anger by confession;3133 let us
desire to see Him appeased, after He was wroth. Who knoweth, he says, if He will turn and
repent, and leave a blessing behind Him?3134 This I know certainly, I the sponsor of the
loving-kindness of God. And when He has laid aside that which is unnatural to Him, His
anger, He will betake Himself to that which is natural, His mercy. To the one He is forced
by us, to the other He is inclined. And if He is forced to strike, surely He will refrain, according
to His Nature. Only let us have mercy on ourselves, and open a road for our Father’s
righteous affections. Let us sow in tears, that we may reap in joy,3135 let us show ourselves
men of Nineveh, not of Sodom.3136 Let us amend our wickedness, lest we be consumed
with it; let us listen to the preaching of Jonah, lest we be overwhelmed by fire and brimstone,
and if we have departed from Sodom let us escape to the mountain, let us flee to Zoar, let
us enter it as the sun rises; let us not stay in all the plain, let us not look around us, lest we
be frozen into a pillar of salt, a really immortal pillar, to accuse the soul which returns to
wickedness.</p>

<p>15. Let us be assured that to do no wrong3137 is really superhuman, and belongs to God
alone. I say nothing about the Angels, that we may give no room for wrong feelings, nor
opportunity for harmful altercations. Our unhealed condition arises from our evil and unsubdued
nature, and from the exercise of its powers. Our repentance when we sin, is a human
action, but an action which bespeaks a good man, belonging to that portion which is in the
way of salvation. For if even our dust contracts somewhat of wickedness, and the earthly
tabernacle presseth down the upward flight of the soul,3138 which at least was created to fly
upward, yet let the image be cleansed from filth, and raise aloft the flesh, its yoke-fellow,
lifting it on the wings of reason; and, what is better, let us neither need this cleansing, nor
have to be cleansed, by preserving our original dignity, to which we are hastening through
our training here, and let us not by the bitter taste of sin be banished from the tree of life:
though it is better to turn again when we err, than to be free from correction when we
stumble. For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,3139 and a rebuke is a fatherly action;
while every soul which is unchastised, is unhealed. Is not then freedom from chastisement
a hard thing? But to fail to be corrected by the chastisement is still harder. One of the
prophets, speaking of Israel, whose heart was hard and uncircumcised, says, Lord, Thou
hast stricken them, but they have not grieved, Thou hast consumed them but they have refused
to receive correction;3140 and again, The people turned not to Him that smiteth
them;3141 and Why is my people slidden back by a perpetual backsliding,3142 because of
which it will be utterly crushed and destroyed?</p>
<p>16. It is a fearful thing, my brethren, to fall into the hands of a living God,3143 and
fearful is the face of the Lord against them that do evil,3144 and abolishing wickedness with
utter destruction. Fearful is the ear of God, listening even to the voice of Abel speaking
through his silent blood. Fearful His feet, which overtake evildoing. Fearful also His filling
of the universe, so that it is impossible anywhere to escape the action of God,3145 not even
by flying up to heaven, or entering Hades, or by escaping to the far East, or concealing
ourselves in the depths and ends of the sea.3146 Nahum the Elkoshite was afraid before me,

when he proclaimed the burden of Nineveh, God is jealous, and the Lord takes vengeance
in wrath upon His adversaries,3147 and uses such abundance of severity that no room is left
for further vengeance upon the wicked. For whenever I hear Isaiah threaten the people of
Sodom and rulers of Gomorrah,3148 and say Why will ye be smitten any more, adding sin
to sin?3149 I am almost filled with horror, and melted to tears. It is impossible, he says, to
find any blow to add to those which are past, because of your newly added sins; so completely
have you run through the whole, and exhausted every form of chastisement, ever calling
upon yourselves some new one by your wickedness. There is not a wound, nor bruise, nor
putrefying sore;3150 the plague affects the whole body and is incurable: for it is impossible
to apply a plaster, or ointment or bandages. I pass over the rest of the threatenings, that I
may not press upon you more heavily than your present plague.</p>
<p>17. Only let us recognise the purpose of the evil. Why have the crops withered, our
storehouses been emptied, the pastures of our flocks failed, the fruits of the earth been
withheld, and the plains been filled with shame instead of with fatness: why have valleys
lamented and not abounded in corn, the mountains not dropped sweetness, as they shall
do hereafter to the righteous, but been stript and dishonoured, and received on the contrary
the curse of Gilboa?3151 The whole earth has become as it was in the beginning, before it
was adorned with its beauties. Thou visitedst the earth, and madest it to drink3152—but
the visitation has been for evil, and the draught destructive. Alas! what a spectacle! Our
prolific crops reduced to stubble, the seed we sowed is recognised by scanty remains, and
our harvest, the approach of which we reckon from the number of the months, instead of
from the ripening corn, scarcely bears the firstfruits for the Lord. Such is the wealth of the
ungodly, such the harvest of the careless sower; as the ancient curse runs, to look for much,
and bring in little,3153 to sow and not reap, to plant and not press,3154 ten acres of vineyard
to yield one bath:3155 and to hear of fertile harvests in other lands, and be ourselves pressed
by famine. Why is this, and what is the cause of the breach? Let us not wait to be convicted
by others, let us be our own examiners. An important medicine for evil is confession, and
care to avoid stumbling. I will be first to do so, as I have made my report to my people from

<p>18. One of us has oppressed the poor, and wrested from him his portion of land, and
wrongly encroached upon his landmark by fraud or violence, and joined house to house,
and field to field, to rob his neighbour of something, and been eager to have no neighbour,
so as to dwell alone on the earth.3158 Another has defiled the land with usury and interest,
both gathering where he had not sowed and reaping where he had not strawed,3159 farming,
not the land, but the necessity of the needy. Another has robbed God,3160 the giver of all,
of the firstfruits of the barnfloor and winepress, showing himself at once thankless and
senseless, in neither giving thanks for what he has had, nor prudently providing, at least,
for the future. Another has had no pity on the widow and orphan, and not imparted his
bread and meagre nourishment to the needy, or rather to Christ, Who is nourished in the
persons of those who are nourished even in a slight degree; a man perhaps of much property
unexpectedly gained, for this is the most unjust of all, who finds his many barns too narrow
for him, filling some and emptying others, to build greater3161 ones for future crops, not
knowing that he is being snatched away with hopes unrealised, to give an account of his
riches and fancies, and proved to have been a bad steward of another’s goods. Another has
turned aside the way of the meek,3162 and turned aside the just among the unjust; another
has hated him that reproveth in the gates,3163 and abhorred him that speaketh uprightly;3164
another has sacrificed to his net which catches much,3165 and keeping the spoil of the poor
in his house,3166 has either remembered not God, or remembered Him ill—by saying “Blessed
be the Lord, for we are rich,”3167 and wickedly supposed that he received these things from
Him by Whom he will be punished. For because of these things cometh the wrath of God

watch the hardships of the seasons, in order to grow prosperous, and luxuriate in the misfor
tunes of others, and acquire, not, like Joseph, the property of the Egyptians,3169 as a part of
a wide policy, (for he could both collect and supply corn duly, as he also could foresee the
famine, and provide against it afar off,) but the property of their fellow countrymen in an
illegal manner, for they say, “When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell, and the
sabbaths, that we may open our stores?”3170 And they corrupt justice with divers measures
and balances,3171 and draw upon themselves the ephah of lead.3172 What shall we say to
these things who know no limit to our getting, who worship gold and silver, as those of old
worshipped Baal, and Astarte and the abomination Chemosh?3173 Who give heed to the
brilliance of costly stones, and soft flowing garments, the prey of moths, and the plunder of
robbers and tyrants and thieves; who are proud of their multitude of slaves and animals,
and spread themselves over plains and mountains, with their possessions and gains and
schemes, like Solomon’s horseleach3174 which cannot be satisfied, any more than the grave,
and the earth, and fire, and water; who seek for another world for their possession, and find
fault with the bounds of God, as too small for their insatiable cupidity? What of those who
sit on lofty thrones and raise the stage of government, with a brow loftier than that of the
theatre, taking no account of the God over all, and the height of the true kingdom that none
can approach unto, so as to rule their subjects as fellow-servants, as needing themselves no
less loving-kindness? Look also, I pray you, at those who stretch themselves upon beds of
ivory, whom the divine Amos fitly upbraids, who anoint themselves with the chief ointments,
and chant to the sound of instruments of music, and attach themselves to transitory things
as though they were stable, but have not grieved nor had compassion for the affliction of
Joseph;3175 though they ought to have been kind to those who had met with disaster before
them, and by mercy have obtained mercy; as the fir-tree should howl, because the cedar had
fallen,3176 and be instructed by their neighbours’ chastisement, and be led by others’ ills to

the store of experience, that source of wisdom, which thou hast gathered in thy long life.
Herewith instruct thy people. Teach them to break their bread to the hungry, to gather together
the poor that have no shelter, to cover their nakedness and not neglect those of the
same blood,3177 and now especially that we may gain a benefit from our need instead of
from abundance, a result which pleases God more than plentiful offerings and large gifts.

thy mediation: avert any succeeding blows of the scourge. He knoweth to respect the hoar
hairs of a father interceding for his children. Intreat for our past wickedness: be our surety
for the future. Present a people purified by suffering and fear. Beg for bodily sustenance,
but beg rather for the angels’ food that cometh down from heaven. So doing, thou wilt make
God to be our God, wilt conciliate heaven, wilt restore the former and latter rain:3182 the

<head>Oration XVIII.</head>
<p>On the Death of his Father.</p>
<p>ThisOration was delivered a.d. 374. S. Gregory the elder died early in that year, according
to the Greek Menæa on the 1st of January, though Clémencet and some others place his death
a few months later. His wife, S. Nonna, survived him, and was present to hear the Oration,
as was also S. Basil, who desired to honour one who had consecrated him to the Episcopate.
The aged Saint, who died in his hundredth year, had originally belonged to a sect called
Hypsistarii. Our knowledge of the existence and tenets of this sect is due to this Oration3185
and to a few sentences in that of S. Greg. Nyssen. (c. Eunom. I. ed. 1615, p. 12), by whom they
are called Hypsistians. He was converted by the prayers, influence and example of his wife,
S. Nonna, and, soon after his baptism, consecrated Bishop of Nazianzus. He was eminent as
an able administrator, a devout Christian, an orthodox teacher, a steadfast Confessor of the
faith, a sympathetic Pastor, an affectionate father. In his life and work he was seconded by
his wife, and followed by his three children, Gregory, Gorgonia, and Cæsarius, whose names
are all to be found upon the roll of the Saints.</p>

<p>2. Tell me, however, whence do you come, what is your business, and what favour do
you bring us? Since I know that you are entirely moved with and by God, and for the benefit
of those who receive you. Are you come to inspect us, or to seek for the pastor, or to take
the oversight of the flock? You find us no longer in existence, but for the most part having
passed away with him, unable to bear with the place of our affliction, especially now that
we have lost our skilful steersman, our light of life, to whom we looked to direct our course
as the blazing beacon of salvation above us: he has departed with all his excellence, and all
the power of pastoral organization, which he had gathered in a long time, full of days and
wisdom, and crowned, to use the words of Solomon, with the hoary head of glory.3195 His
flock is desolate and downcast, filled, as you see, with despondency and dejection, no longer
reposing in the green pasture,3196 and reared up by the water of comfort, but seeking precipices,
deserts and pits, in which it will be scattered and perish;3197 in despair of ever obtaining
another wise pastor, absolutely persuaded that it cannot find such an one as he,
content if it be one who will not be far inferior.</p>
<p>3. There are, as I said, three causes to necessitate your presence, all of equal weight,
ourselves, the pastor, and the flock: come then, and according to the spirit of ministry which
is in you, assign to each its due, and guide your words in judgment, so that we may more
than ever marvel at your wisdom. And how will you guide them? First by bestowing seemly
praise upon his virtue, not only as a pure sepulchral tribute of speech to him who was pure,
but also to set forth to others his conduct and example as a mark of true piety. Then bestow
upon us some brief counsels concerning life and death, and the union and severance of body
and soul, and the two worlds, the one present but transitory, the other spiritually perceived
and abiding; and persuade us to despise that which is deceitful and disordered and uneven,
carrying us and being carried, like the waves, now up, now down; but to cling to that which
is firm and stable and divine and constant, free from all disturbance and confusion. For
this would lessen our pain because of friends departed before us, nay we should rejoice if
your words should carry us hence and set us on high, and hide distress of the present in the
future, and persuade us that we also are pressing on to a good Master, and that our home
is better than our pilgrimage; and that translation and removal thither is to us who are
tempest-tost here like a calm haven to men at sea; or as ease and relief from toil come to
men who, at the close of a long journey, escape the troubles of the wayfarer, so to those who
attain to the hostel yonder comes a better and more tolerable existence than that of those
who still tread the crooked and precipitous path of this life.</p>

<p>4. Thus might you console us; but what of the flock? Would you first promise the
oversight and leadership of yourself, a man under whose wings we all would gladly repose,
and for whose words we thirst more eagerly than men suffering from thirst for the purest
fountain? Secondly, persuade us that the good shepherd who laid down his life for the
sheep3198 has not even now left us; but is present, and tends and guides, and knows his own,
and is known of his own, and, though bodily invisible, is spiritually recognized, and defends
his flock against the wolves, and allows no one to climb over into the fold as a robber and
traitor; to pervert and steal away, by the voice of strangers, souls under the fair guidance of
the truth. Aye, I am well assured that his intercession is of more avail now than was his instruction
in former days, since he is closer to God, now that he has shaken off his bodily
fetters, and freed his mind from the clay which obscured it, and holds intercourse naked
with the nakedness of the prime and purest Mind; being promoted, if it be not rash to say
so, to the rank and confidence of an angel. This, with your power of speech and spirit, you
will set forth and discuss better than I can sketch it. But in order that, through ignorance
of his excellences, your language may not fall very far short of his deserts, I will, from my
own knowledge of the departed, briefly draw an outline, and preliminary plan of an eulogy
to be handed to you, the illustrious artist of such subjects, for the details of the beauty of his
virtue to be filled in and transmitted to the ears and minds of all.</p>
<p>5. Leaving to the laws of panegyric the description of his country, his family, his nobility
of figure, his external magnificence, and the other subjects of human pride, I begin with
what is of most consequence and comes closest to ourselves. He sprang from a stock unrenowned,
and not well suited for piety, for I am not ashamed of his origin, in my confidence
in the close of his life, one that was not planted in the house of God,3199 but far removed
and estranged, the combined product of two of the greatest opposites—Greek error and
legal imposture, some parts of each of which it escaped, of others it was compounded. For,
on the one side, they reject idols and sacrifices, but reverence fire and lights; on the other,
they observe the Sabbath and petty regulations as to certain meats, but despise circumcision.
These lowly men call themselves Hypsistarii, and the Almighty is, so they say, the only object
of their worship. What was the result of this double tendency to impiety? I know not
whether to praise more highly the grace which called him, or his own purpose. However,
he so purged the eye of his mind from the humours3200 which obscured it, and ran towards
the truth with such speed that he endured the loss of his mother and his property for a while,
for the sake of his heavenly Father and the true inheritance: and submitted more readily to
this dishonour, than others to the greatest honours, and, most wonderful as this is, I wonder

at it but little. Why? Because this glory is common to him with many others, and all must
come into the great net of God, and be caught by the words of the fishers, although some
are earlier, some later, enclosed by the Gospel. But what does especially in his life move my
wonder, it is needful for me to mention.</p>
<p>6. Even before he was of our fold, he was ours. His character made him one of us. For,
as many of our own are not with us, whose life alienates them from the common body, so,
many of those without are on our side, whose character anticipates their faith, and need
only the name of that which indeed they possess. My father was one of these, an alien shoot,
but inclined by his life towards us. He was so far advanced in self control, that he became
at once most beloved and most modest, two qualities difficult to combine. What greater
and more splendid testimony can there be to his justice than his exercise of a position second
to none in the state, without enriching himself by a single farthing, although he saw everyone
else casting the hands of Briareus upon the public funds, and swollen with ill-gotten gain?
For thus do I term unrighteous wealth. Of his prudence this also is no slight proof, but in
the course of my speech further details will be given. It was as a reward3201 for such conduct,
I think, that he attained to the faith. How this came about, a matter too important to be
passed over, I would now set forth.</p>
<p>7. I have heard the Scripture say: Who can find a valiant woman?3202 and declare that
she is a divine gift, and that a good marriage is brought about by the Lord. Even those
without are of the same mind; if they say that a man can win no fairer prize than a good
wife, nor a worse one than her opposite.3203 But we can mention none who has been in
this respect more fortunate than he. For I think that, had anyone from the ends of the earth
and from every race of men attempted to bring about the best of marriages, he could not
have found a better or more harmonious one than this. For the most excellent of men and
of women were so united that their marriage was a union of virtue rather than of bodies:
since, while they excelled all others, they could not excel each other, because in virtue they
were quite equally matched.</p>
<p>8. She indeed who was given to Adam as a help meet for him, because it was not good
for man to be alone,3204 instead of an assistant became an enemy, and instead of a yokefellow,
an opponent, and beguiling the man by means of pleasure, estranged him through
the tree of knowledge from the tree of life. But she who was given by God to my father became
not only, as is less wonderful, his assistant, but even his leader, drawing him on by
her influence in deed and word to the highest excellence; judging it best in all other respects

<pb n="528"/>
to be overruled by her husband according to the law of marriage, but not being ashamed,
in regard of piety, even to offer herself as his teacher. Admirable indeed as was this conduct
of hers, it was still more admirable that he should readily acquiesce in it. She is a woman
who while others have been honoured and extolled for natural and artificial beauty, has acknowledged
but one kind of beauty, that of the soul, and the preservation, or the restoration
as far as possible, of the Divine image. Pigments and devices for adornment she has rejected
as worthy of women on the stage. The only genuine form of noble birth she recognized is
piety, and the knowledge of whence we are sprung and whither we are tending. The only
safe and inviolable form of wealth is, she considered, to strip oneself of wealth for God and
the poor, and especially for those of our own kin who are unfortunate; and such help only
as is necessary, she held to be rather a reminder, than a relief of their distress, while a more
liberal beneficence brings stable honour and most perfect consolation. Some women have
excelled in thrifty management, others in piety, while she, difficult as it is to unite the two
virtues, has surpassed all in both of them, both by her eminence in each, and by the fact that
she alone has combined them together. To as great a degree has she, by her care and skill,
secured the prosperity of her household, according to the injunctions and laws of Solomon
as to the valiant woman, as if she had had no knowledge of piety; and she applied herself to
God and Divine things as closely as if absolutely released from household cares, allowing
neither branch of her duty to interfere with the other, but rather making each of them support
the other.</p>
<p>9. What time or place for prayer ever escaped her? To this she was drawn before all
other things in the day; or rather, who had such hope of receiving an immediate answer to
her requests? Who paid such reverence to the hand and countenance of the priests? Or
honoured all kinds of philosophy? Who reduced the flesh by more constant fast and vigil?
Or stood like a pillar at the night long and daily psalmody? Who had a greater love for virginity,
though patient of the marriage bond herself? Who was a better patron of the orphan
and the widow? Who aided as much in the alleviation of the misfortunes of the mourner?
These things, small as they are, and perhaps contemptible in the eyes of some, because not
easily attainable by most people (for that which is unattainable comes, through envy, to be
thought not even credible), are in my eyes most honourable, since they were the discoveries
of her faith and the undertakings of her spiritual fervour. So also in the holy assemblies, or
places, her voice was never to be heard except3205 in the necessary responses of the service.</p>
<p>10. And if it was a great thing for the altar never to have had an iron tool lifted upon
it,3206 and that no chisel should be seen or heard, with greater reason, since everything
dedicated to God ought to be natural and free from artificiality, it was also surely a great

thing that she reverenced the sanctuary by her silence; that she never turned her back to the
venerable table, nor spat upon the divine pavement; that she never grasped the hand or
kissed the lips of any heathen woman, however honourable in other respects, or closely related
she might be; nor would she ever share the salt, I say not willingly but even under compulsion,
of those who came from the profane and unholy table; nor could she bear, against the law
of conscience, to pass by or look upon a polluted house; nor to have her ears or tongue,
which had received and uttered divine things, defiled by Grecian tales or theatrical songs,
on the ground that what is unholy is unbecoming to holy things; and what is still more
wonderful, she never so far yielded to the external signs of grief, although greatly moved
even by the misfortunes of strangers, as to allow a sound of woe to burst forth before the
Eucharist, or a tear to fall from the eye mystically sealed, or any trace of mourning to be left
on the occasion of a festival, however frequent her own sorrows might be; inasmuch as the
God-loving soul should subject every human experience to the things of God.</p>
<p>11. I pass by in silence what is still more ineffable, of which God is witness, and those
of the faithful handmaidens to whom she has confided such things. That which concerns
myself is perhaps undeserving of mention, since I have proved unworthy of the hope cherished
in regard to me: yet it was on her part a great undertaking to promise me to God before
my birth, with no fear of the future, and to dedicate me immediately after I was born.
Through God’s goodness has it been that she has not utterly failed in her prayer, and that
the auspicious sacrifice was not rejected. Some of these things were already in existence,
others were in the future, growing up by means of gradual additions. And as the sun which
most pleasantly casts its morning rays, becomes at midday hotter and more brilliant, so also
did she, who from the first gave no slight evidence of piety, shine forth at last with fuller
light. Then indeed he, who had established her in his house, had at home no slight spur to
piety, possessed, by her origin and descent, of the love of God and Christ, and having received
virtue as her patrimony; not, as he had been, cut out of the wild olive and grafted into the
good olive, yet unable to bear, in the excess of her faith, to be unequally yoked; for, though
surpassing all others in endurance and fortitude, she could not brook this, the being but
half united to God, because of the estrangement of him who was a part of herself, and the
failure to add to the bodily union, a close connexion in the spirit: on this account, she fell
before God night and day, entreating for the salvation of her head with many fastings and
tears, and assiduously devoting herself to her husband, and influencing him in many ways,
by means of reproaches, admonitions, attentions, estrangements, and above all by her own
character with its fervour for piety, by which the soul is specially prevailed upon and softened,
and willingly submits to virtuous pressure. The drop3207 of water constantly striking the
rock was destined to hollow it, and at length attain its longing, as the sequel shows.</p>
<note type="footnote">3207 The drop. A familiar proverb. Choerilus, 9.</note>

<pb n="530"/>
<p>12. These were the objects of her prayers and hopes, in the fervour of faith rather than
of youth. Indeed, none was as confident of things present as she of things hoped for, from
her experience of the generosity of God. For the salvation of my father there was a concurrence
of the gradual conviction3208 of his reason, and the vision of dreams which God often
bestows upon a soul worthy of salvation. What was the vision? This is to me the most
pleasing part of the story. He thought that he was singing, as he had never done before,
though his wife was frequent in her supplications and prayers, this verse from the psalms
of holy David: I was glad when they said unto me, we will go into the house of the Lord.3209
The psalm was a strange one to him, and along with its words the desire came to him. As
soon as she heard it, having thus obtained her prayer, she seized the opportunity, replying
that the vision would bring the greatest pleasure, if accompanied by its fulfilment, and,
manifesting by her joy the greatness of the benefit, she urged forward his salvation, before
anything could intervene to hinder the call, and dissipate the object of her longing. At that
very time it happened that a number of Bishops were hastening to Nicæa, to oppose the
madness of Arius, since the wickedness of dividing the Godhead had just arisen; so my
father yielded himself to God and to the heralds of the truth, and confessed his desire, and
requested from them the common salvation, one of them being the celebrated Leontius, at
that time our own metropolitan. It would be a great wrong to grace, were I to pass by in
silence the wonder which then was bestowed upon him by grace. The witnesses of the
wonder3210 are not few. The teachers of accuracy were spiritually at fault, and the grace
was a forecast of the future, and the formula of the priesthood was mingled with the admission
of the catechumen. O involuntary initiation! bending his knee, he received the form
of admission to the state of a catechumen in such wise, that many, not only of the highest,
but even of the lowest, intellect, prophesied the future, being assured by no indistinct signs
of what was to be.</p>
<p>13. After a short interval, wonder succeeded wonder. I will commend the account of
it to the ears of the faithful, for to profane minds nothing that is good is trustworthy. He
was approaching that regeneration by water and the Spirit, by which we confess to God the
formation and completion of the Christlike man, and the transformation and reformation
from the earthy to the Spirit. He was approaching the laver with warm desire and bright
hope, after all the purgation possible, and a far greater purification of soul and body than
that of the men who were to receive the tables from Moses. Their purification extended

<note type="footnote">3210 The wonder. S. Gregory the elder ought, according to the rite of admission to the ranks of the Catechumens,

only to their dress, and a slight restriction of the belly, and a temporary continence.3211
The whole of his past life had been a preparation for the enlightenment, and a preliminary
purification making sure the gift, in order that perfection might be entrusted to purity, and
that the blessing might incur no risk in a soul which was confident in its possession of the
grace. And as he was ascending out of the water, there flashed around him a light and a
glory worthy of the disposition with which he approached the gift of faith;3212 this was
manifest even to some others, who for the time concealed the wonder, from fear of speaking
of a sight which each one thought had been only his own, but shortly afterwards communicated
it to one another. To the baptiser3213 and initiator, however, it was so clear and visible,
that he could not even hold back the mystery, but publicly cried out that he was anointing
with the Spirit his own successor.</p>
<p>14. Nor indeed would anyone disbelieve this who has heard and knows that Moses,
when little in the eyes of men, and not yet of any account, was called from the bush which
burned but was not consumed, or rather by Him who appeared in the bush,3214 and was
encouraged by that first wonder: Moses, I say, for whom the sea was divided,3215 and manna
rained down,3216 and the rock poured out a fountain,3217 and the pillar of fire and cloud
led the way in turn, and the stretching out of his hands gained a victory, and the representation
of the cross overcame tens of thousands. Isaiah, again, who beheld the glory of the
Seraphim,3218 and after him Jeremiah, who was entrusted with great power against nations
and kings;3219 the one heard the divine voice and was cleansed by a live coal for his prophetic
office, and the other was known before his formation and sanctified before his birth.
Paul, also, while yet a persecutor, who became the great herald of the truth and teacher of
the Gentiles in faith,3220 was surrounded by a light3221 and acknowledged Him whom he

was persecuting, and was entrusted with his great ministry, and filled every ear and mind
with the gospel.</p>
<p>15. Why need I count up all those who have been called to Himself by God and associated
with such wonders as confirmed him in his piety? Nor was it the case that after such
and so incredible and startling beginnings, any of the former things was put to shame by
his subsequent conduct, as happens with those who very soon acquire a distaste for what is
good, and so neglect all further progress, if they do not utterly relapse into vice. This cannot
be said of him, for he was most consistent with himself and his early days, and kept in harmony
his life before the priesthood with its excellence, and his life after it with what had
gone before, since it would have been unbecoming to begin in one way and end in another,
or to advance to a different end from that which he had in view at first. He was next entrusted
with the priesthood, not with the facility and disorder of the present day, but after a brief
interval, in order to add to his own cleansing the skill and power to cleanse others; for this
is the law of spiritual sequence. And when he had been entrusted with it, the grace was the
more glorified, being really the grace of God, and not of men, and not, as the preacher3222
says, an independent impulse and purpose3223 of spirit.</p>
<p>16. He received a woodland and rustic church, the pastoral care and oversight of which
had not been bestowed from a distance, but it had been cared for by one of his predecessors
of admirable and angelic disposition, and a more simple man than our present rulers of the
people; but, after he had been speedily taken to God, it had, in consequence of the loss of
its leader, for the most part grown careless and run wild; accordingly, he at first strove
without harshness to soften the habits of the people, both by words of pastoral knowledge,
and by setting himself before them as an example, like a spiritual statue, polished into the
beauty of all excellent conduct. He next, by constant meditation on the divine words, though
a late student of such matters, gathered together so much wisdom within a short time that
he was in no wise excelled by those who had spent the greatest toil upon them, and received
this special grace from God, that he became the father and teacher of orthodoxy—not, like
our modern wise men, yielding to the spirit of the age, nor defending our faith by indefinite
and sophistical language, as if they had no fixity of faith, or were adulterating the truth; but,
he was more pious than those who possessed rhetorical power, more skilled in rhetoric than
those who were upright in mind; or rather, while he took the second place as an orator, he
surpassed all in piety. He acknowledged One God worshipped in Trinity, and Three, Who

are united in One Godhead; neither Sabellianising3224 as to the One, nor Arianising as to
the Three; either by contracting and so atheistically annihilating the Godhead, or by tearing
It asunder by distinctions of unequal greatness or nature. For, seeing that Its every quality
is incomprehensible and beyond the power of our intellect, how can we either perceive or
express by definition on such a subject, that which is beyond our ken? How can the immeasurable
be measured, and the Godhead be reduced to the condition of finite things, and
measured by degrees3225 of greater or less?</p>
<p>17. What else must we say of this great man of God, the true Divine, under the influence,
in regard to these subjects, of the Holy Ghost, but that through his perception of these points,
he, like the great Noah, the father of this second world, made this church to be called the
new Jerusalem, and a second ark borne up upon the waters; since it both surmounted the
deluge of souls, and the insults of the heretics, and excelled all others in reputation no less
than it fell behind them in numbers; and has had the same fortune as the sacred Bethlehem,
which can without contradiction be at once said to be a little city and the metropolis of the
world, since it is the nurse and mother of Christ, Who both made and overcame the world.</p>
<p>18. To give a proof of what I say. When a tumult of the over-zealous part of the Church
was raised against us, and we had been decoyed by a document3226 and artful terms into
association with evil, he alone was believed to have an unwounded mind, and a soul unstained
by ink, even when he had been imposed upon in his simplicity, and failed from his guilelessness
of soul to be on his guard against guile. He it was alone, or rather first of all, who by
his zeal for piety reconciled to himself and the rest of the church the faction opposed to us,
which was the last to leave us, the first to return, owing to both their reverence for the man
and the purity of his doctrine, so that the serious storm in the churches was allayed, and the
hurricane reduced to a breeze under the influence of his prayers and admonitions; while, if
I may make a boastful remark, I was his partner3227 in piety and activity, aiding him in every
effort on behalf of what is good, accompanying and running beside him, and being permitted
on this occasion to contribute a very great share of the toil. Here my account of these matters,
which is a little premature, must come to an end.</p>

<p>19. Who could enumerate the full tale of his excellences, or, if he wished to pass by
most of them, discover without difficulty what can be omitted? For each trait, as it occurs
to the mind, seems superior to what has gone before; it takes possession of me, and I feel
more at a loss to know what I ought to pass by, than other panegyrists are as to what they
ought to say. So that the abundance of material is to some extent a hindrance to me, and
my mind is itself put to the test in its efforts to test his qualities, and its inability, where all
are equal, to find one which surpasses the rest. So that, just as when we see a pebble falling
into still water, it becomes the centre and starting-point of circle after circle, each by its
continuous agitation breaking up that which lies outside of it; this is exactly the case with
myself. For as soon as one thing enters my mind, another follows and displaces it; and I am
wearied out in making a choice, as what I have already grasped is ever retiring in favour of
that which follows in its train.</p>
<p>20. Who was more anxious than he for the common weal? Who more wise in domestic
affairs, since God, who orders all things in due variation, assigned to him a house and suitable
fortune? Who was more sympathetic in mind, more bounteous in hand, towards the poor,
that most dishonoured portion of the nature to which equal honour is due? For he actually
treated his own property as if it were another’s, of which he was but the steward, relieving
poverty as far as he could, and expending not only his superfluities but his necessities—a
manifest proof of love for the poor, giving a portion, not only to seven, according to the
injunction of Solomon,3228 but if an eighth came forward, not even in his case being niggardly,
but more pleased to dispose of his wealth than we know others are to acquire it;
taking away the yoke and election (which means, as I think, all meanness in testing as to
whether the recipient is worthy or not) and word of murmuring3229 in benevolence. This
is what most men do: they give indeed, but without that readiness, which is a greater and
more perfect thing than the mere offering. For he thought it much better3230 to be generous
even to the undeserving for the sake of the deserving, than from fear of the undeserving to
deprive those who were deserving. And this seems to be the duty of casting our bread upon
the waters,3231 since it will not be swept away or perish in the eyes of the just Investigator,
but will arrive yonder where all that is ours is laid up, and will meet with us in due time,
even though we think it not.</p>
<p>21. But what is best and greatest of all, his magnanimity was accompanied by freedom
from ambition. Its extent and character I will proceed to show. In considering their wealth
to be common to all, and in liberality in bestowing it, he and his consort rivalled each other

in their struggles after excellence; but he intrusted the greater part of this bounty to her
hand, as being a most excellent and trusty steward of such matters. What a woman she is?
Not even the Atlantic Ocean, or if there be a greater one, could meet her drafts upon it. So
great and so boundless is her love of liberality. In the contrary sense she has rivalled the
horse-leech3232 of Solomon, by her insatiable longing for progress, overcoming the tendency
to backsliding, and unable to satisfy her zeal for benevolence. She not only considered all
the property which they originally possessed, and what accrued to them later, as unable to
suffice her own longing, but she would, as I have often heard her say, have gladly sold herself
and her children into slavery, had there been any means of doing so, to expend the proceeds
upon the poor. Thus entirely did she give the rein to her generosity. This is, I imagine, far
more convincing than any instance of it could be. Magnanimity in regard to money may
be found without difficulty in the case of others, whether it be dissipated in the public
rivalries of the state, or lent to God through the poor, the only mode of treasuring it up for
those who spend it: but it is not easy to discover a man who has renounced the consequent
reputation. For it is desire for reputation which supplies to most men their readiness to
spend. And where the bounty must be secret, there the disposition to it is less keen.</p>
<p>22. So bounteous was his hand—further details I leave to those who knew him, so that
if anything of the kind is borne witness to in regard to myself, it proceeds from that fountain,
and is a portion of that stream. Who was more under the Divine guidance in admitting
men to the sanctuary,3233 or in resenting dishonour done to it, or in cleansing the holy table
with awe from the unholy? Who with such unbiassed judgment, and with the scales of
justice, either decided a suit, or hated vice, or honoured virtue, or promoted the most excellent?
Who was so compassionate for the sinner, or sympathetic towards those who were
running well? Who better knew the right time for using the rod and the staff,3234 yet relied
most upon the staff? Whose eyes were more upon the faithful in the land,3235 especially
upon those who, in the monastic and unwedded life, have despised the earth and the things
of earth?</p>
<p>23. Who did more to rebuke pride and foster lowliness? And that in no assumed or
external way, as most of those who now make profession of virtue, and are in appearance
as elegant as the most mindless women, who, for lack of beauty of their own, take refuge in
pigments, and are, if I may say so, splendidly made up, uncomely in their comeliness, and
more ugly than they originally were. For his lowliness was no matter of dress, but of spiritual
disposition: nor was it expressed by a bent neck, or lowered voice, or downcast look,

belly, he, if anyone, held in check, but without ostentation; so that he might be kept down
without being puffed up, from having encouraged a new vice by his pursuit of reputation.
For he held that doing and saying everything by which fame among externs might be won,
is the characteristic of the politician, whose chief happiness is found in the present life: but
that the spiritual and Christian man should look to one object alone, his salvation, and think
much of what may contribute to this, but detest as of no value what does not; and accordingly
despise what is visible, but be occupied with interior perfection alone, and estimate most
highly whatever promotes his own improvement, and attracts others through himself to
that which is supremely good.</p>
<p>24. But what was most excellent and most characteristic, though least generally recognized,
was his simplicity, and freedom from guile and resentment. For among men of ancient
and modern days, each is supposed to have had some special success, as each chanced to
have received from God some particular virtue: Job unconquered patience in misfortune,3236
Moses3237 and David3238 meekness, Samuel prophecy, seeing into the future,3239 Phineas
zeal,3240 for which he has a name, Peter and Paul eagerness in preaching,3241 the sons of
Zebedee magniloquence, whence also they were entitled Sons of thunder.3242 But why
should I enumerate them all, speaking as I do among those who know this? Now the specially
distinguishing mark of Stephen and of my father was the absence of malice. For not even
when in peril did Stephen hate his assailants, but was stoned while praying for those who
were stoning him3243 as a disciple of Christ, on Whose behalf he was allowed to suffer, and
so, in his long-suffering, bearing for God a nobler fruit than his death: my father, in allowing
no interval between assault and forgiveness, so that he was almost robbed of pain itself by
the speed of pardon.</p>

<p>25. We both believe in and hear of the dregs3244 of the anger of God, the residuum of
His dealings with those who deserve it: For the Lord is a God of vengeance.3245 For although
He is disposed by His kindness to gentleness rather than severity, yet He does not absolutely
pardon sinners, lest they should be made worse by His goodness. Yet my father kept no
grudge against those who provoked him, indeed he was absolutely uninfluenced by anger,
although in spiritual things exceedingly overcome by zeal: except when he had been prepared
and armed and set in hostile array against that which was advancing to injure him. So that
this sweet disposition of his would not, as the saying goes, have been stirred by tens of
thousands. For the wrath which he had was not like that of the serpent,3246 smouldering
within, ready to defend itself, eager to burst forth, and longing to strike back at once on
being disturbed; but like the sting of the bee, which does not bring death with its stroke;
while his kindness was superhuman. The wheel and scourge were often threatened, and
those who could apply them stood near; and the danger ended in being pinched on the ear,
patted on the face, or buffeted on the temple: thus he mitigated the threat. His dress and
sandals were dragged off, and the scoundrel was felled to the ground: then his anger was
directed not against his assailant, but against his eager succourer, as a minister of evil. How
could anyone be more conclusively proved to be good, and worthy to offer the gifts to God?
For often, instead of being himself roused, he made excuses for the man who assailed him,
blushing for his faults as if they had been his own.</p>
<p>26. The dew would more easily resist the morning rays of the sun, than any remains of
anger continue in him; but as soon as he had spoken, his indignation departed with his
words, leaving behind only his love for what is good, and never outlasting the sun; nor did
he cherish anger which destroys even the prudent, or show any bodily trace of vice within,
nay, even when roused, he preserved calmness. The result of this was most unusual, not
that he was the only one to give rebuke, but the only one to be both loved and admired by
those whom he reproved, from the victory which his goodness gained over warmth of feeling;
and it was felt to be more serviceable to be punished by a just man than besmeared by a bad
one, for in one case the severity becomes pleasant for its utility, in the other the kindliness
is suspected because of the evil of the man’s character. But though his soul and character
were so simple and divine, his piety nevertheless inspired the insolent with awe: or rather,
the cause of their respect was the simplicity which they despised. For it was impossible to
him to utter either prayer or curse without the immediate bestowal of permanent blessing
or transient pain. The one proceeded from his inmost soul, the other merely rested upon
his lips as a paternal reproof. Many indeed of those who had injured him incurred neither

<pb n="538"/>
lingering requital nor, as the poet3247 says, “vengeance which dogs men’s steps;” but at the
very moment of their passion they were struck and converted, came forward, knelt before
him, and were pardoned, going away gloriously vanquished, and amended both by the
chastisement and the forgiveness. Indeed, a forgiving spirit often has great saving power,
checking the wrongdoer by the sense of shame, and bringing him back from fear to love, a
far more secure state of mind. In chastisement some were tossed by oxen oppressed by the
yoke, which suddenly attacked them, though they had never done anything of the kind before;
others were thrown and trampled upon by most obedient and quiet horses; others seized
by intolerable fevers, and apparitions of their daring deeds; others being punished in different
ways, and learning obedience from the things which they suffered.</p>
<p>27. Such and so remarkable being his gentleness, did he yield the palm to others in industry
and practical virtue? By no means. Gentle as he was, he possessed, if any one did,
an energy corresponding to his gentleness. For although, for the most part, the two virtues
of benevolence and severity are at variance and opposed to each other, the one being gentle
but without practical qualities, the other practical but unsympathetic, in his case there was
a wonderful combination of the two, his action being as energetic as that of a severe man,
but combined with gentleness; while his readiness to yield seemed unpractical but was accompanied
with energy, in his patronage, his freedom of speech, and every kind of official
duty. He united the wisdom of the serpent, in regard to evil, with the harmlessness of the
dove, in regard to good, neither allowing the wisdom to degenerate into knavery, nor the
simplicity into silliness, but as far as in him lay, he combined the two in one perfect form
of virtue. Such being his birth, such his exercise of the priestly office, such the reputation
which he won at the hands of all, what wonder if he was thought worthy of the miracles by
which God establishes true religion?</p>
<p>28. One of the wonders which concern him was that he suffered from sickness and
bodily pain. But what wonder is it for even holy men to be distressed, either for the
cleansing of their clay, slight though it may be, or a touchstone of virtue and test of philosophy,
or for the education of the weaker, who learn from their example to be patient instead
of giving way under their misfortunes? Well, he was sick, the time was the holy and illustrious
Easter, the queen of days, the brilliant night which dissipates the darkness of sin, upon which
with abundant light we keep the feast of our salvation, putting ourselves to death along with
the Light once put to death for us, and rising again with Him who rose. This was the time
of his sufferings. Of what kind they were, I will briefly explain. His whole frame was on
fire with an excessive, burning fever, his strength had failed, he was unable to take food, his
sleep had departed from him, he was in the greatest distress, and agitated by palpitations.
Within his mouth, the palate and the whole of the upper surface was so completely and
<note type="footnote">3247 The poet. Pindar.</note>

<pb n="539"/>
painfully ulcerated, that it was difficult and dangerous to swallow even water. The skill of
physicians, the prayers, most earnest though they were, of his friends, and every possible
attention were alike of no avail. He himself in this desperate condition, while his breath
came short and fast, had no perception of present things, but was entirely absent, immersed
in the objects he had long desired, now made ready for him. We were in the temple, mingling
supplications with the sacred rites, for, in despair of all others, we had betaken ourselves to
the Great Physician, to the power of that night, and to the last succour, with the intention,
shall I say, of keeping a feast, or of mourning; of holding festival, or paying funeral honours
to one no longer here? O those tears! which were shed at that time by all the people. O
voices, and cries, and hymns blended with the psalmody! From the temple they sought the
priest, from the sacred rite the celebrant, from God their worthy ruler, with my Miriam3248
to lead them and strike the timbrel3249 not of triumph, but of supplication; learning then
for the first time to be put to shame by misfortune, and calling at once upon the people and
upon God; upon the former to sympathize with her distress, and to be lavish of their tears,
upon the latter, to listen to her petitions, as, with the inventive genius of suffering, she rehearsed
before Him all His wonders of old time.</p>
<p>29. What then was the response of Him who was the God of that night and of the sick
man? A shudder comes over me as I proceed with my story. And though you, my hearers,
may shudder, do not disbelieve: for that would be impious, when I am the speaker, and in
reference to him. The time of the mystery was come, and the reverend station and order,
when silence is kept for the solemn rites; and then he was raised up by Him who quickeneth
the dead, and by the holy night. At first he moved slightly, then more decidedly; then in a
feeble and indistinct voice he called by name one of the servants who was in attendance
upon him, and bade him come, and bring his clothes, and support him with his hand. He
came in alarm, and gladly waited upon him, while he, leaning upon his hand as upon a staff,
imitates Moses upon the mount, arranges his feeble hands in prayer, and in union with, or
on behalf of,3250 his people eagerly celebrates the mysteries, in such few words as his strength
allowed, but, as it seems to me, with a most perfect intention. What a miracle! In the
sanctuary without a sanctuary, sacrificing without an altar, a priest far from the sacred rites:
yet all these were present to him in the power of the spirit, recognised by him, though unseen

by those who were there. Then, after adding the customary words of thanksgiving, and after
blessing the people, he retired again to his bed, and after taking a little food, and enjoying
a sleep, he recalled his spirit, and, his health being gradually recovered, on the new day3251
of the feast, as we call the first Sunday after the festival of the Resurrection, he entered the
temple and inaugurated his life which had been preserved, with the full complement of
clergy, and offered the sacrifice of thanksgiving. To me this seems no less remarkable than
the miracle in the case of Hezekiah,3252 who was glorified by God in his sickness and prayers
with an extension of life, and this was signified by the return of the shadow of the degrees,3253
according to the request of the king who was restored, whom God honoured at once by the
favour and the sign, assuring him of the extension of his days by the extension of the day.</p>
<p>30. The same miracle occurred in the case of my mother not long afterwards. I do not
think it would be proper to pass by this either: for we shall both pay the meed of honour
which is due to her, if to anyone at all, and gratify him, by her being associated with him in
our recital. She, who had always been strong and vigorous and free from disease all her life,
was herself attacked by sickness. In consequence of much distress, not to prolong my story,
caused above all by inability to eat, her life was for many days in danger, and no remedy for
the disease could be found. How did God sustain her? Not by raining down manna, as for
Israel of old3254 or opening the rock, in order to give drink to His thirsting people,3255 or
feasting her by means of ravens, as Elijah,3256 or feeding her by a prophet carried through
the air, as He did to Daniel when a-hungered in the den.3257 But how? She thought she
saw me, who was her favourite, for not even in her dreams did she prefer any other of us,
coming up to her suddenly at night, with a basket of pure white loaves, which I blessed and
crossed as I was wont to do, and then fed and strengthened her, and she became stronger.
The nocturnal vision was a real action. For, in consequence, she became more herself and
of better hope, as is manifest by a clear and evident token. Next morning, when I paid her
an early visit, I saw at once that she was brighter, and when I asked, as usual, what kind of
a night she had passed, and if she wished for anything, she replied, “My child, you most
readily and kindly fed me, and then you ask how I am. I am very well and at ease.” Her
maids too made signs to me to offer no resistance, and to accept her answer at once, lest she

should be thrown back into despondency, if the truth were laid bare. I will add one more
instance common to them both.</p>
<p>31. I was on a voyage from Alexandria to Greece over the Parthenian Sea. The voyage
was quite unseasonable, undertaken in an Æginetan vessel, under the impulse of eager desire;
for what specially induced me was that I had fallen in with a crew who were well known to
me. After making some way on the voyage, a terrible storm came upon us, and such an one
as my shipmates said they had but seldom seen before. While we were all in fear of a common
death, spiritual death was what I was most afraid of; for I was in danger of departing in
misery, being unbaptised, and I longed for the spiritual water among the waters of death.
On this account I cried and begged and besought a slight respite. My shipmates, even in
their common danger, joined in my cries, as not even my own relatives would have done,
kindly souls as they were, having learned sympathy from their dangers. In this my condition,
my parents felt for me, my danger having been communicated to them by a nightly vision,
and they aided me from the land, soothing the waves by prayer, as I afterwards learned by
calculating the time, after I had landed. This was also shown me in a wholesome sleep, of
which I had experience during a slight lull of the tempest. I seemed to be holding a Fury,
of fearful aspect, boding danger; for the night presented her clearly to my eyes. Another of
my shipmates, a boy most kindly disposed and dear to me, and exceedingly anxious on my
behalf, in my then present condition, thought he saw my mother walk upon the sea, and
seize and drag the ship to land with no great exertion. We had confidence in the vision, for
the sea began to grow calm, and we soon reached Rhodes after the intervention of no great
discomfort. We ourselves became an offering in consequence of that peril; for we promised
ourselves if we were saved, to God, and, when we had been saved, gave ourselves to Him.</p>
<p>32. Such were their common experiences. But I imagine that some of those who have
had an accurate knowledge of his life must have been for a long while wondering why we
have dwelt upon these points, as if we thought them his only title to renown, and postponed
the mention of the difficulties of his times, against which he conspicuously arrayed himself,
as though we were either ignorant of them, or thought them to be of no great consequence.
Come, then, we will proceed to speak upon this topic. The first, and I think the last, evil of
our day, was the Emperor who apostatised from God and from reason, and thought it a
small matter to conquer the Persians, but a great one to subject to himself the Christians;
and so, together with the demons who led and prevailed upon him, he failed in no form of
impiety, but by means of persuasions, threats, and sophistries, strove to draw men to him,
and even added to his various artifices the use of force. His design, however, was exposed,
whether he strove to conceal persecution under sophistical devices, or manifestly made use
of his authority—namely by one means or the other—either by cozening or by violence, to
get us into his power. Who can be found who more utterly despised or defeated him? One
sign, among many others, of his contempt, is the mission to our sacred buildings of the

<pb n="542"/>
police and their commissary, with the intention of taking either voluntary or forcible possession
of them: he had attacked many others, and came hither with like intent, demanding
the surrender of the temple according to the Imperial decree, but was so far from succeeding
in any of his wishes that, had he not speedily given way before my father, either from his
own good sense or according to some advice given to him, he would have had to retire with
his feet mangled, with such wrath and zeal did the priest boil against him in defence of his
shrine. And who had a manifestly greater share in bringing about his end, both in public,
by the prayers and united supplications which he directed against the accursed one, without
regard to the [dangers of] the time; and in private, arraying against him his nightly armoury,
of sleeping on the ground, by which he wore away his aged and tender frame, and of tears,
with whose fountains he watered the ground for almost a whole year, directing these practices
to the Searcher of hearts alone, while he tried to escape our notice, in his retiring piety of
which I have spoken. And he would have been utterly unobserved, had I not once suddenly
rushed into his room, and noticing the tokens of his lying upon the ground, inquired of his
attendants what they meant, and so learned the mystery of the night.</p>
<p>33. A further story of the same period and the same courage. The city of Cæsarea was
in an uproar about the election of a bishop; for one3258 had just departed, and another must
be found, amidst heated partisanship not easily to be soothed. For the city was naturally
exposed to party spirit, owing to the fervour of its faith, and the rivalry was increased by the
illustrious position of the see. Such was the state of affairs; several Bishops had arrived to
consecrate the Bishop; the populace was divided into several parties, each with its own
candidate, as is usual in such cases, owing to the influences of private friendship or devotion
to God; but at last the whole people came to an agreement, and, with the aid of a band of
soldiers at that time quartered there, seized one of3259 their leading citizens, a man of excellent
life, but not yet sealed with the divine baptism, brought him against his will to the
sanctuary, and setting him before the Bishops, begged, with entreaties mingled with violence,
that he might be consecrated and proclaimed, not in the best of order, but with all sincerity
and ardour. Nor is it possible to say whom time pointed out as more illustrious and religious
than he was. What then took place, as the result of the uproar? Their3260 resistance was
overcome, they purified him, they proclaimed him, they enthroned him, by external action,
rather than by spiritual judgment and disposition, as the sequel shows. They were glad to
retire and regain freedom of judgment, and agreed upon a plan—I do not know that it was
inspired by the Spirit—to hold nothing which had been done to be valid, and the institution
to have been void, pleading violence on the part of him who had had no less violence done
<note type="footnote">3258 One, i.e. Dianius.</note>

<note type="footnote">3260 Their, i.e., of the Bishops.</note>

<pb n="543"/>
to himself, and laying hold of certain words which had been uttered on the occasion with
greater vigour than wisdom. But the great high-priest and just examiner of actions was not
carried away by this plan of theirs, and did not approve of their judgment, but remained as
uninfluenced and unmoved as if no pressure at all had been put upon him. For he saw that,
the violence having been common, if they brought any charge against him, they were
themselves liable to a counter-charge, or, if they acquitted him, they themselves might be
acquitted, or rather with still more justice, they were unable to secure their own acquittal,
even by acquitting him: for if they were deserving of excuse, so assuredly was he, and if he
was not, much less were they: for it would have been far better to have at the time run the
risk of resistance to the last extremity, than afterwards to enter into designs against him,
especially at such a juncture, when it was better to put an end to existing enmities than to
devise new ones. For the state of affairs was as follows.</p>
<p>34. The Emperor3261 had come, raging against the Christians; he was angry at the
election and threatened the elect, and the city stood in imminent peril3262 as to whether,
after that day it should cease to exist, or escape and be treated with some degree of mercy.
The innovation in regard to the election was a new ground of exasperation, in addition to
the destruction of the temple of Fortune in a time of prosperity, and was looked upon as an
invasion of his rights. The governor of the province also was eager to turn the opportunity
to his own account, and was ill disposed to the new bishop, with whom he had never had
friendly relations, in consequence of their different political views. Accordingly he sent
letters to summon the consecrators to invalidate the election, and in no gentle terms, for
they were threatened as if by command of the Emperor. Hereupon, when the letter reached
him, without fear or delay, he replied—consider the courage and spirit of his answer—“Most
excellent governor, we have one Censor of all our actions, and one Emperor, against whom
his enemies are in arms. He will review the present consecration, which we have legitimately
performed according to His will. In regard to any other matter, you may, if you will, use
violence with the greatest ease against us. But no one can prevent us from vindicating the
legitimacy and justice of our action in this case; unless you should make a law on this point,
you, who have no right to interfere in our affairs.” This letter excited the admiration of its
recipient, although he was for a while annoyed at it, as we have been told by many who
know the facts well. It also stayed the action of the Emperor, and delivered the city from
peril, and ourselves, it is not amiss to add, from disgrace. This was the work of the occupant
of an unimportant and suffragan see. Is not a presidency of this kind far preferable to a title
derived from a superior see, and a power which is based upon action rather than upon a
name.</p>

<pb n="544"/>
<p>35. Who is so distant from this world of ours, as to be ignorant of what is last in order,
but the first and greatest proof of his power? The same city was again in an uproar for the
same reason, in consequence of the sudden removal of the Bishop chosen with such honourable
violence, who had now departed to God, on Whose behalf he had nobly and bravely
contended in the persecutions. The heat of the disturbance was in proportion to its unreasonableness.
The man of eminence was not unknown, but was more conspicuous than the
sun amidst the stars, in the eyes not only of all others, but especially of that select and most
pure portion of the people, whose business is in the sanctuary, and the Nazarites3263 amongst
us, to whom such appointments should, if not entirely, as much as possible belong, and so
the church would be free from harm, instead of to the most opulent and powerful, or the
violent and unreasonable portion of the people, and especially the most corrupt of them.
Indeed, I am almost inclined to believe that the civil government is more orderly than ours,
to which divine grace is attributed, and that such matters are better regulated by fear than
by reason. For what man in his senses could ever have approached another, to the neglect
of your divine3264 and sacred person, who have been beautified by the hands of the Lord,
the unwedded, the destitute of property and almost of flesh and blood, who in your words
come next to the Word Himself, who are wise among philosophers, superior to the world
among worldlings, my companion and workfellow, and to speak more daringly, the sharer
with me of a common soul, the partaker of my life and education. Would that I could speak
at liberty and describe you before others without being obliged by your presence, in dwelling
upon such topics, to pass over the greater part of them, lest I should incur the suspicion of
flattery. But, as I began by saying, the Spirit must needs have known him as His own; yet
he was the mark of envy, at the hands of those whom I am ashamed to mention, and would
that it were not possible to hear their names from others who studiously ridicule our affairs.
Let us pass this by like a rock in the midstream of a river, and treat with respectful silence
a subject which ought to be forgotten, as we pass on to the remainder of our subject.</p>
<p>36. The things of the Spirit were exactly known to the man of the Spirit, and he felt that
he must take up no submissive position, nor side with factions and prejudices which depend
upon favour rather than upon God, but must make the advantage of the Church and the
common salvation his sole object. Accordingly he wrote, gave advice, strove to unite the
people and the clergy, whether ministering in the sanctuary or not, gave his testimony, his
decision and his vote, even in his absence, and assumed, in virtue of his gray hairs, the exercise
of authority among strangers no less than among his own flock. At last, since it was necessary
that the consecration should be canonical, and there was3265 lacking one of the proper
<note type="footnote">3263 Nazarites, i.e., “the monks.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3264 Your divine, etc., addressed to S. Basil.</note>
<note type="footnote">3265 There was lacking. The Council of Nicæa ordered that a Bishop should be consecrated by at least three

<pb n="545"/>
number of Bishops for the proclamation, he tore himself from his couch, exhausted as he
was by age and disease, and manfully went to the city, or rather was borne, with his body
dead though just breathing, persuaded that, if anything were to happen to him, this devotion
would be a noble winding-sheet. Hereupon once more there was a prodigy, not unworthy
of credit. He received strength from his toil, new life from his zeal, presided at the function,
took his place in the conflict, enthroned the Bishop, and was conducted home, no longer
borne upon a bier, but in a divine ark. His long-suffering, over whose praises I have already
lingered, was in this case further exhibited. For his colleagues were annoyed at the shame
of being overcome, and at the public influence of the old man, and allowed their annoyance
to show itself in abuse of him; but such was the strength of his endurance that he was superior
even to this, finding in modesty a most powerful ally, and refusing to bandy abuse with
them. For he felt that it would be a terrible thing, after really gaining the victory, to be
vanquished by the tongue. In consequence, he so won upon them by his long-suffering,
that, when time had lent its aid to his judgment, they exchanged their annoyance for admiration,
and knelt before him to ask his pardon, in shame for their previous conduct, and
flinging away their hatred, submitted to him as their patriarch, lawgiver, and judge.</p>
<p>37. From the same zeal proceeded his opposition to the heretics, when, with the aid of
the Emperor’s impiety, they made their expedition, in the hope of overpowering us also,
and adding us to the number of the others whom they had, in almost all cases, succeeded
in enslaving. For in this he afforded us no slight assistance, both in himself, and by
hounding us on like well-bred dogs against these most savage beasts, through his training
in piety. On one point I blame you both, and pray do not take amiss my plainspeaking, if
I should annoy you by expressing the cause of my pain. When I was disgusted at the evils
of life, and longing, if anyone of our day has longed, for solitude, and eager, as speedily as
possible, to escape to some haven of safety, from the surge and dust of public life, it was you
who, somehow or other seized and gave me up by the noble title of the priesthood to this
base and treacherous mart of souls. In consequence, evils have already befallen me, and
others are yet to be anticipated. For past experience renders a man somewhat distrustful
of the future, in spite of the better suggestions of reason to the contrary.</p>
<p>38. Another of his excellences I must not leave unnoticed. In general, he was a man of
great endurance, and superior to his robe of flesh: but during the pain of his last sickness,
a serious addition to the risks and burdens of old age, his weakness was common to him
and all other men; but this fitting sequel to the other marvels, so far from being common,
was peculiarly his own. He was at no time free from the anguish of pain, but often in the
day, sometimes in the hour, his only relief was the liturgy, to which the pain yielded, as if
to an edict of banishment. At last, after a life of almost a hundred years, exceeding David’s
limit of our age,3266 forty-five of these, the average life of man, having been spent in the
<note type="footnote">3266 Ps. xc. 10.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
priesthood, he brought it to a close in a good old age. And in what manner? With the words
and forms of prayer, leaving behind no trace of vice, and many recollections of virtue. The
reverence felt for him was thus greater than falls to the lot of man, both on the lips and in
the hearts of all. Nor is it easy to find anyone who recollects him, and does not, as the
Scripture says, lay his hand upon his mouth3267 and salute his memory. Such was his life,
and such its completion and perfection.</p>
<p>39. And since some living memorial of his munificence ought to be left behind, what
other is required than this temple, which he reared for God and for us, with very little contribution
from the people in addition to the expenditure of his private fortune? An exploit
which should not be buried in silence, since in size it is superior to most others, in beauty
absolutely to all. It surrounds itself with eight regular equilaterals, and is raised aloft by the
beauty of two stories of pillars and porticos, while the statues placed upon them are true to
the life; its vault flashes down upon us from above, and it dazzles our eyes with abundant
sources of light on every side, being indeed the dwelling-place of light. It is surrounded by
excrescent equiangular ambulatories of most splendid material, with a wide area in the
midst, while its doors and vestibules shed around it the lustre of their gracefulness, and offer
from a distance their welcome to those who are drawing nigh. I have not yet mentioned
the external ornament, the beauty and size of the squared and dove-tailed stonework,
whether it be of marble in the bases and capitals, which divide the angles, or from our own
quarries, which are in no wise inferior to those abroad; nor of the belts of many shapes and
colours, projecting or inlaid from the foundation to the roof-tree, which robs the spectator
by limiting his view. How could anyone with due brevity describe a work which cost so
much time and toil and skill: or will it suffice to say that amid all the works, private and
public, which adorn other cities, this has of itself been able to secure us celebrity among the
majority of mankind? When for such a temple a priest was needed, he also at his own expense
provided one, whether worthy of the temple or no, it is not for me to say. And when sacrifices
were required, he supplied them also, in the misfortunes of his son, and his patience under
trials, that God might receive at his hands a reasonable whole burnt offering and spiritual
priesthood, to be honourably consumed, instead of the sacrifice of the Law.</p>
<p>40. What sayest thou, my father? Is this sufficient, and dost thou find an ample recompense
for all thy toils, which thou didst undergo for my learning, in this eulogy of farewell
or of entombment? And dost thou, as of old, impose silence on my tongue, and bid me stop
in due time, and so avoid excess? Or dost thou require some addition? I know thou bidst
me cease, for I have said enough. Yet suffer me to add this. Make known to us where thou
art in glory, and the light which encircles thee, and receive into the same abode thy partner
soon to follow thee, and the children whom thou hadst laid to rest before thee, and me also,
<note type="footnote">3267 Job xl. 4.</note>

<pb n="547"/>
after no further, or but a slight addition to the ills of this life: and before reaching that abode
receive me in this sweet stone,3268 which thou didst erect for both of us, to the honour even
here of thy consecrated namesake, and excuse me from the care both of the people which I
have already resigned,3269 and of that which for thy sake I have since accepted: and mayest
thou guide and free from peril, as I earnestly entreat, the whole flock and all the clergy,
whose father thou art said to be, but especially him who was overpowered by thy paternal
and spiritual coercion, so that he may not entirely consider that act of tyranny obnoxious
to blame.</p>
<p>41. And what do you think of us, O judge of my words and motions? If we have spoken
adequately, and to the satisfaction of your desire, confirm it by your decision, and we accept
it: for your decision is entirely the decision of God. But if it falls far short of his glory and
of your hope, my ally is not far to seek. Let fall thy voice, which is awaited by his merits like
a seasonable shower. And indeed he has upon you the highest claims, those of a pastor
upon a pastor and of a father upon his son in grace. What wonder if he, who has3270 through
your voice thundered throughout the world, should himself have some enjoyment of it?
What more is needed? Only to unite with our spiritual Sarah, the consort and fellow-traveller
through life of our great father Abraham, in the last Christian offices.</p>
<p>42. The nature of God, my mother, is not the same as that of men; indeed, to speak
generally, the nature of divine things is not the same as that of earthly things. They possess
unchangeableness and immortality, and absolute being with its consequences, for sure are
the properties of things sure. But how is it with what is ours? It is in a state of flux and
corruption, constantly undergoing some fresh change. Life and death, as they are called,
apparently so different, are in a sense resolved into, and successive to, each other. For the
one takes its rise from the corruption which is our mother, runs its course through the
corruption which is the displacement of all that is present, and comes to an end in the corruption
which is the dissolution of this life; while the other, which is able to set us free from
the ills of this life, and oftentimes translates us to the life above, is not in my opinion accurately
called death, and is more dreadful in name than in reality; so that we are in danger of
irrationally being afraid of what is not fearful, and courting as preferable what we really
ought to fear. There is one life, to look to life. There is one death, sin, for it is the destruction
of the soul. But all else, of which some are proud, is a dream-vision, making sport of realities,
and a series of phantasms which lead the soul astray. If this be our condition, mother, we
shall neither be proud of life, nor greatly hurt, by death. What grievance can we find in

being transferred hence to the true life? In being freed from the vicissitudes, the agitation,
the disgust, and all the vile tribute we must pay to this life, to find ourselves, amid stable
things, which know no flux, while as lesser lights, we circle round the great light?3271</p>
<p>43. Does the sense of separation cause you pain? Let hope cheer you. Is widowhood
grievous to you? Yet it is not so to him. And what is the good of love, if it gives itself easy
things, and assigns the more difficult to its neighbour? And why should it be grievous at
all, to one who is soon to pass away? The appointed day is at hand, the pain will not last
long. Let us not, by ignoble reasonings, make a burden of things which are really light. We
have endured a great loss—because the privilege we enjoyed was great. Loss is common to
all, such a privilege to few. Let us rise superior to the one thought by the consolation of the
other. For it is more reasonable, that that which is better should win the day. You have
borne, in a most brave, Christian spirit, the loss of children, who were still in their prime
and qualified for life; bear also the laying aside of his aged body by one who was weary of
life, although his vigor of mind preserved for him his senses unimpaired. Do you want some
one to care for you? Where is your Isaac, whom he left behind for you, to take his place in
all respects? Ask of him small things, the support of his hand and service, and requite him
with greater things, a mother’s blessing and prayers, and the consequent freedom. Are you
vexed at being admonished? I praise you for it. For you have admonished many whom
your long life has brought under your notice. What I have said can have no application to
you, who are so truly wise; but let it be a general medicine of consolation for mourners, so
that they may know that they are mortals following mortals to the grave.</p>

<head>Oration XXI.</head>
<p>On the Great Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The reference in §22 to “the Council which sat first at Seleucia…and afterwards at this
mighty city,” leaves no room for doubting that the Oration was delivered at Constantinople.
Further local colour is found in the allusions of §5. We are assured by the panegyric on S.
Cyprian (Orat. xxiv. 1) that it was already the custom of the Church of Constantinople to
observe annual festivals in honour of the Saints: and at present two days are kept by the
Eastern Church, viz., Jan. 18th, as the day of the actual death of S. Athanasius, and May 2d,
in memory of the translation of his remains to the church of S. Sophia at Constantinople.
Probably, therefore, this Oration was delivered on the former day, on which Assemani holds
that S. Athanasius died. Papebroke and (with some hesitation) Dr. Bright pronounce in favour
of May 2d. Tillemont supposes that a.d. 379 is the year of its delivery; in which case it must
have been very shortly after S. Gregory’s arrival in the city. Since, however, no allusion is
made to this, it seems, on the whole, more likely that it should be assigned to a.d. 380. The
sermon takes high rank, even among S. Gregory’s discourses, as the model of an ecclesiastical
panegyric. It lacks, however, the charm of personal affection and intimate acquaintance with
the inner life, which is characteristic of the orations concerned with his own relatives and
friends.</p>
<p>1. In praising Athanasius, I shall be praising virtue. To speak of him and to praise virtue
are identical, because he had, or, to speak more truly, has embraced virtue in its entirety.
For all who have lived according to God still live unto God, though they have departed
hence. For this reason, God is called the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, since He is the
God, not of the dead, but of the living.3272 Again, in praising virtue, I shall be praising God,
who gives virtue to men and lifts them up, or lifts them up again, to Himself by the enlightenment
which is akin to Himself.3273 For many and great as are our blessings—none can
say how many and how great—which we have and shall have from God, this is the greatest
and kindliest of all, our inclination and relationship to Him. For God is to intelligible things
what the sun is to the things of sense. The one lightens the visible, the other the invisible,
world. The one makes our bodily eyes to see the sun, the other makes our intellectual natures
to see God. And, as that, which bestows on the things which see and are seen the power of
seeing and being seen, is itself the most beautiful of visible things; so God, who creates, for
those who think, and that which is thought of, the power of thinking and being thought of,
is Himself the highest of the objects of thought, in Whom every desire finds its bourne,
<note type="footnote">3272 S. Matt. xxii. 32.</note>
<note type="footnote">3273 1 John i. 5.</note>

<pb n="550"/>
beyond Whom it can no further go. For not even the most philosophic, the most piercing,
the most curious intellect has, or can ever have, a more exalted object. For this is the utmost
of things desirable, and they who arrive at it find an entire rest from speculation.</p>
<p>2. Whoever has been permitted to escape by reason and contemplation from matter
and this fleshly cloud or veil (whichever it should be called) and to hold communion with
God, and be associated, as far as man’s nature can attain, with the purest Light, blessed is
he, both from his ascent from hence, and for his deification there, which is conferred by
true philosophy, and by rising superior to the dualism of matter, through the unity which
is perceived in the Trinity. And whosoever has been depraved by being knit to the flesh,
and so far oppressed by the clay that he cannot look at the rays of truth, nor rise above things
below, though he is born from above, and called to things above, I hold him to be miserable
in his blindness, even though he may abound in things of this world; and all the more, because
he is the sport of his abundance, and is persuaded by it that something else is beautiful instead
of that which is really beautiful, reaping, as the poor fruit of his poor opinion, the sentence
of darkness, or the seeing Him to be fire, Whom he did not recognize as light.</p>
<p>3. Such has been the philosophy of few, both nowadays and of old—for few are the men
of God, though all are His handiwork,—among lawgivers, generals, priests, Prophets,
Evangelists, Apostles, shepherds, teachers, and all the spiritual host and band—and, among
them all, of him whom now we praise. And whom do I mean by these? Men like Enoch,
Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the twelve Patriarchs, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, the Judges,
Samuel, David, to some extent Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, the Prophets before the captivity,
those after the captivity, and, though last in order, first in truth, those who were concerned
with Christ’s Incarnation or taking of our nature, the lamp3274 before the Light, the voice
before the Word, the mediator before the Mediator, the mediator between the old covenant
and the new, the famous John, the disciples of Christ, those after Christ, who were set over
the people, or illustrious in word, or conspicuous for miracles, or made perfect through
their blood.</p>
<p>4. With some of these Athanasius vied, by some he was slightly excelled, and others, if
it is not bold to say so, he surpassed: some he made his models in mental power, others in
activity, others in meekness, others in zeal, others in dangers, others in most respects, others
in all, gathering from one and another various forms of beauty (like men who paint figures
of ideal excellence), and combining them in his single soul, he made one perfect form of
virtue out of all, excelling in action men of intellectual capacity, in intellect men of action;
or, if you will, surpassing in intellect men renowned for intellect, in action those of the
greatest active power; outstripping those who had moderate reputation in both respects, by
his eminence in either, and those who stood highest in one or other, by his powers in both;
<note type="footnote">3274 S. John i. 23; v. 35.</note>

<pb n="551"/>
and, if it is a great thing for those who have received an example, so to use it as to attach
themselves to virtue, he has no inferior title to fame, who for our advantage has set an example
to those who come after him.</p>
<p>5. To speak of and admire him fully, would perhaps be too long a task for the present
purpose of my discourse, and would take the form of a history rather than of a panegyric:
a history which it has been the object of my desires to commit to writing for the pleasure
and instruction of posterity, as he himself wrote the life of the divine Antony,3275 and set
forth, in the form of a narrative, the laws of the monastic life. Accordingly, after entering
into a few of the many details of his history, such as memory suggests at the moment as
most noteworthy, in order both to satisfy my own longing and fulfil the duty which befits
the festival, we will leave the many others to those who know them. For indeed, it is neither
pious nor safe, while the lives of the ungodly are honoured by recollection, to pass by in silence
those who have lived piously, especially in a city which could hardly be saved by many
examples of virtue, making sport, as it does, of Divine things, no less than of the horse-race
and the theatre.</p>
<p>6. He was brought up, from the first, in religious habits and practices, after a brief study
of literature and philosophy, so that he might not be utterly unskilled in such subjects, or
ignorant of matters which he had determined to despise. For his generous and eager soul
could not brook being occupied in vanities, like unskilled athletes, who beat the air instead
of their antagonists and lose the prize. From meditating on every book of the Old and New
Testament, with a depth such as none else has applied even to one of them, he grew rich in
contemplation, rich in splendour of life, combining them in wondrous sort by that golden
bond which few can weave; using life as the guide of contemplation, contemplation as the
seal of life. For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and, so to say, its first
swathing band; but, when wisdom has burst the bonds of fear and risen up to love, it makes
us friends of God, and sons instead of bondsmen.</p>
<p>7. Thus brought up and trained, as even now those should be who are to preside over
the people, and take the direction of the mighty body of Christ,3276 according to the will
and foreknowledge of God, which lays long before the foundations of great deeds, he was
invested with this important ministry, and made one of those who draw near to the God
Who draws near to us, and deemed worthy of the holy office and rank, and, after passing
through the entire series of orders, he was (to make my story short) entrusted with the chief
rule over the people, in other words, the charge of the whole world: nor can I say whether
<note type="footnote">3275 Antony, “the founder of asceticism,” the most celebrated of the monks and hermits of the Thebaid desert.
His life by S. Athanasius is certainly genuine, and even if, as some suspect, interpolations have been inserted,
its substantial integrity is undoubted. (Newman, Ch. of the Fathers, p. 176.)</note>
<note type="footnote">3276 Body of Christ, i.e., the Church, His mystical body.</note>

<pb n="552"/>
he received the priesthood as the reward of virtue, or to be the fountain and life of the
Church. For she, like Ishmael,3277 fainting from her thirst for the truth, needed to be given
to drink, or, like Elijah,3278 to be refreshed from the brook, when the land was parched by
drought; and, when but faintly breathing, to be restored to life and left as a seed to Israel,3279
that we might not become like Sodom and Gomorrah,3280 whose destruction by the rain of
fire and brimstone is only more notorious than their wickedness. Therefore, when we were
cast down, a horn of salvation was raised up for us,3281 and a chief corner stone,3282 knitting
us to itself and to one another, was laid in due season, or a fire3283 to purify our base and
evil matter,3284 or a farmer’s fan3285 to winnow the light from the weighty in doctrine, or
a sword to cut out the roots of wickedness; and so the Word finds him as his own ally, and
the Spirit takes possession of one who will breathe on His behalf.</p>
<p>8. Thus, and for these reasons, by the vote of the whole people, not in the evil fashion
which has since prevailed, nor by means of bloodshed and oppression, but in an apostolic
and spiritual manner, he is led up to the throne3286 of Saint Mark, to succeed him in piety,
no less than in office; in the latter indeed at a great distance from him, in the former, which
is the genuine right of succession, following him closely. For unity in doctrine deserves
unity in office; and a rival teacher sets up a rival throne; the one is a successor in reality, the
other but in name. For it is not the intruder, but he whose rights are intruded upon, who
is the successor, not the lawbreaker, but the lawfully appointed, not the man of contrary
opinions, but the man of the same faith; if this is not what we mean by successor, he succeeds
in the same sense as disease to health, darkness to light, storm to calm, and frenzy to sound
sense.</p>
<p>9. The duties of his office he discharged in the same spirit as that in which he had been
preferred to it. For he did not at once, after taking possession of his throne, like men who
have unexpectedly seized upon some sovereignty or inheritance, grow insolent from intoxication.
This is the conduct of illegitimate and intrusive priests, who are unworthy of their
vocation; whose preparation for the priesthood has cost them nothing, who have endured

no inconvenience for the sake of virtue, who only begin to study religion when appointed
to teach it, and undertake the cleansing of others before being cleansed themselves; yesterday
sacrilegious, to-day sacerdotal; yesterday excluded from the sanctuary,3287 to-day its officiants;
proficient in vice, novices in piety; the product of the favour of man, not of the grace
of the Spirit; who, having run through the whole gamut of violence, at last tyrannize over
even piety; who, instead of gaining credit for their office by their character, need for their
character the credit of their office, thus subverting the due relation between them; who
ought to offer more sacrifices3288 for themselves than for the ignorances of the people;3289
who inevitably fall into one of two errors, either, from their own need of indulgence, being
excessively indulgent, and so even teaching, instead of checking, vice, or cloaking their own
sins under the harshness of their rule. Both these extremes he avoided; he was sublime in
action, lowly in mind; inaccessible in virtue, most accessible in intercourse; gentle, free from
anger, sympathetic, sweet in words, sweeter in disposition; angelic in appearance, more
angelic in mind; calm in rebuke, persuasive in praise, without spoiling the good effect of
either by excess, but rebuking with the tenderness of a father, praising with the dignity of a
ruler, his tenderness was not dissipated, nor his severity sour; for the one was reasonable,
the other prudent, and both truly wise; his disposition sufficed for the training of his spiritual
children, with very little need of words; his words with very little need of the rod,3290
and his moderate use of the rod with still less for the knife.</p>
<p>10. But why should I paint for you the portrait of the man? St. Paul3291 has sketched
him by anticipation. This he does, when he sings the praises of the great High-priest, who
hath passed through the heavens3292 (for I will venture to say even this, since Scripture3293
can call those who live according to Christ by the name of Christs):3294 and again when by
the rules in his letter to Timothy,3295 he gives a model for future Bishops: for if you will
apply the law as a test to him who deserves these praises, you will clearly perceive his perfect
exactness. Come then to aid me in my panegyric; for I am labouring heavily in my speech,

and though I desire to pass by point after point, they seize upon me one after another, and
I can find no surpassing excellence in a form which is in all respects well proportioned and
beautiful; for each as it occurs to me seems fairer than the rest and so takes by storm my
speech. Come then I pray, you who have been his admirers and witnesses, divide among
yourselves his excellences, contend bravely with one another, men and women alike, young
men and maidens, old men and children, priests and people, solitaries and cenobites,3296
men of simple or of exact life, contemplatives or practically minded. Let one praise him in
his fastings and prayers as if he had been disembodied and immaterial, another his unweariedness
and zeal for vigils and psalmody, another his patronage of the needy, another his
dauntlessness towards the powerful, or his condescension to the lowly. Let the virgins celebrate
the friend of the Bridegroom;3297 those under the yoke3298 their restrainer, hermits
him who lent wings to their course, cenobites their lawgiver, simple folk their guide, contemplatives
the divine, the joyous their bridle, the unfortunate their consolation, the hoaryheaded
their staff, youths their instructor, the poor their resource, the wealthy their steward.
Even the widows will, methinks, praise their protector, even the orphans their father, even
the poor their benefactor, strangers their entertainer, brethren the man of brotherly love,
the sick their physician, in whatever sickness or treatment you will, the healthy the guard
of health, yea all men him who made himself all things to all men that he might gain almost,
if not quite, all.</p>
<p>11. On these grounds, as I have said, I leave others, who have leisure to admire the
minor details of his character, to admire and extol him. I call them minor details only in
comparing him and his character with his own standard, for that which hath been made
glorious hath not been made glorious, even though it be exceeding splendid by reason of
the glory that surpasseth,3299 as we are told; for indeed the minor points of his excellence
would suffice to win celebrity for others. But since it would be intolerable for me to leave
the word and serve3300 less important details, I must turn to that which is his chief characteristic;
and God alone, on Whose behalf I am speaking, can enable me to say anything
worthy of a soul so noble and so mighty in the word.</p>

with speaking or hearing of God in a way unusual or frivolous. But since the Sextuses3301
and Pyrrhos, and the antithetic style, like a dire and malignant disease, have infected our
churches, and babbling is reputed culture, and, as the book of the Acts3302 says of the
Athenians, we spend our time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
O what Jeremiah3303 will bewail our confusion and blind madness; he alone could utter
lamentations befitting our misfortunes.</p>
<p>13. The beginning of this madness was Arius (whose name is derived from frenzy3304),
who paid the penalty of his unbridled tongue by his death in a profane spot,3305 brought
about by prayer not by disease, when he like Judas3306 burst asunder3307 for his similar
treachery to the Word. Then others, catching the infection, organized an art of impiety,
and, confining Deity to the Unbegotten, expelled from Deity not only the Begotten, but also
the Proceeding one, and honoured the Trinity with communion in name3308 alone, or even
refused to retain this for it. Not so that blessed one, Who was indeed a man of God and a
mighty trumpet of truth: but being aware that to contract3309 the Three Persons to a numerical
Unity is heretical, and the innovation of Sabellius, who first devised a contraction
of Deity; and that to sever the Three Persons by a distinction of nature, is an unnatural
mutilation of Deity; he both happily preserved the Unity, which belongs to the Godhead,
and religiously taught the Trinity, which refers3310 to Personality, neither confounding the
Three Persons in the Unity, nor dividing the Substance among the Three Persons, but
abiding within the bounds of piety, by avoiding excessive inclination or opposition to either

the disease. Though not yet ranked among the Bishops, he held the first rank among the
members of the Council, for preference was given to virtue just as much as to office. Afterwards,
when the flame had been fanned by the blasts of the evil one, and had spread very
widely (hence came the tragedies of which almost the whole earth and sea are full), the fight
raged fiercely around him who was the noble champion of the Word. For the assault is
hottest upon the point of resistance, while various dangers surround it on every side: for
impiety is skilful in designing evils, and excessively daring in taking them in hand: and how
would they spare men, who had not spared the Godhead? Yet one of the assaults was the
most dangerous of all: and I myself contribute somewhat to this scene; yea, let me plead
for the innocence of my dear fatherland, for the wickedness was not due to the land that
bore them, but to the men who undertook it. For holy indeed is that land, and everywhere
noted for its piety, but these men are unworthy of the Church which bore them, and ye have
heard of a briar growing in a vine;3312 and the traitor3313 was Judas, one of the disciples.</p>
<p>15. There are some who do not excuse even my namesake3314 from blame; who, living
at Alexandria at the time for the sake of culture, although he had been most kindly treated
by him, as if the dearest of his children, and received his special confidence, yet joined in
the revolutionary plot against his father and patron: for, though others took the active part
in it, the hand of Absalom3315 was with them, as the saying goes. If any of you had heard
of the hand which was produced by fraud against the Saint, and the corpse3316 of the living
man, and the unjust banishment, he knows what I mean. But this I will gladly forget. For
on doubtful points, I am disposed to think we ought to incline to the charitable side, and
acquit rather than condemn the accused. For a bad man would speedily condemn even a
good man, while a good man would not be ready to condemn even a bad one. For one who
is not ready to do ill, is not inclined even to suspect it. I come now to what is matter of fact,
not of report, what is vouched for as truth instead of unverified suspicion.</p>

had learnt to say and do everything with an eye to his stomach, and, at last, after sneaking
into public life, and filling its lowest offices, such as that of contractor for swine’s flesh, the
soldiers’ rations, and then having proved himself a scoundrel for the sake of greed in this
public trust, and been stripped to the skin, contrived to escape, and after passing, as exiles
do, from country to country and city to city, last of all, in an evil hour for the Christian
community, like one of the plagues of Egypt, he reached Alexandria. There, his wanderings
being stayed, he began his villany. Good for nothing in all other respects, without culture,
without fluency in conversation, without even the form and pretence of reverence, his skill
in working villany and confusion was unequalled.</p>
<p>17. His acts of insolence towards the saint you all know in full detail. Often were the
righteous given into the hands of the wicked,3318 not that the latter might be honoured, but
that the former might be tested: and though the wicked come, as it is written, to an awful
death,3319 nevertheless for the present the godly are a laughing stock, while the goodness
of God and the great treasuries of what is in store for each of them hereafter are concealed.
Then indeed word and deed and thought will be weighed in the just balances of God, as He
arises to judge the earth,3320 gathering together counsel and works, and revealing what He
had kept sealed up.3321 Of this let the words and sufferings of Job convince thee, who was
a truthful, blameless, just, godfearing man, with all those other qualities which are testified
of him, and yet was smitten with such a succession of remarkable visitations, at the hands
of him who begged for power over him, that, although many have often suffered in the
whole course of time, and some even have, as is probable, been grievously afflicted, yet none
can be compared with him in misfortunes. For he not only suffered, without being allowed
space to mourn for his losses in their rapid succession, the loss of his money, his possessions,
his large and fair family, blessings for which all men care; but was at last smitten with an
incurable disease horrible to look upon, and, to crown his misfortunes, had a wife whose
only comfort was evil counsel. For his surpassing troubles were those of his soul added to
those of the body.3322 He had also among his friends truly miserable comforters,3323 as he
calls them, who could not help him. For when they saw his suffering, in ignorance of its
hidden meaning, they supposed his disaster to be the punishment of vice and not the
touchstone of virtue. And they not only thought this, but were not even ashamed to reproach

him with his lot,3324 at a time when, even if he had been suffering for vice, they ought to
have treated his grief with words of consolation.</p>
<p>18. Such was the lot of Job: such at first sight his history. In reality it was a contest
between virtue and envy:3325 the one straining every nerve to overcome the good, the other
enduring everything, that it might abide unsubdued; the one striving to smooth the way for
vice, by means of the chastisement of the upright, the other to retain its hold upon the good,
even if they do exceed others in misfortunes. What then of Him who answered Job out of
the whirlwind and cloud,3326 Who is slow to chastise and swift to help, Who suffers not
utterly the rod of the wicked to come into the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous should
learn iniquity?3327 At the end of the contests He declares the victory of the athlete in a
splendid proclamation and lays bare the secret of his calamities, saying: “Thinkest thou that
I have dealt with thee for any other purpose than the manifestation of thy righteousness?”3328
This is the balm for his wounds, this is the crown of the contest, this the reward for his patience.
For perhaps his subsequent prosperity was small, great as it may seem to some, and
ordained for the sake of small minds, even though he received again twice as much as he
had lost.</p>
<p>19. In this case then it is not wonderful, if George had the advantage of Athanasius; nay
it would be more wonderful, if the righteous were not tried in the fire of contumely; nor is
this very wonderful, as it would have been had the flames availed for more than this. Then
he was in retirement, and arranged his exile most excellently, for he betook himself to the
holy and divine homes3329 of contemplation in Egypt, where, secluding themselves from
the world, and welcoming the desert, men live to God more than all who exist in the body.
Some struggle on in an utterly monastic and solitary life, speaking to themselves alone and
to God,3330 and all the world they know is what meets their eyes in the desert. Others,
cherishing the law of love in community, are at once Solitaries and Coenobites, dead to all
other men and to the eddies of public affairs which whirl us and are whirled about themselves
and make sport of us in their sudden changes, being the world to one another and whetting
the edge of their love in emulation. During his intercourse with them, the great Athanasius,
who was always the mediator and reconciler of all other men, like Him Who made peace

through His blood3331 between things which were at variance, reconciled the solitary with
the community life: by showing that the Priesthood is capable of contemplation, and that
contemplation is in need of a spiritual guide.</p>
<p>20. Thus he combined the two, and so united the partisans of both calm action and of
active calm, as to convince them that the monastic life is characterised by steadfastness of
disposition rather than by bodily retirement. Accordingly the great David was a man of at
once the most active and most solitary life, if any one thinks the verse, I am in solitude, till
I pass away,3332 of value and authority in the exposition of this subject. Therefore, though
they surpass all others in virtue, they fell further short of his mind than others fell short of
their own, and while contributing little to the perfection of his priesthood, they gained in
return greater assistance in contemplation. Whatever he thought, was a law for them,
whatever on the contrary he disapproved, they abjured: his decisions were to them the
tables of Moses,3333 and they paid him more reverence than is due from men to the Saints.
Aye, and when men came to hunt the Saint like a wild beast, and, after searching for him
everywhere, failed to find him, they vouchsafed these emissaries not a single word, and
offered their necks to the sword, as risking their lives for Christ’s sake, and considering the
most cruel sufferings on behalf of Athanasius to be an important step to contemplation,
and far more divine and sublime than the long fasts and hard lying and mortifications in
which they constantly revel.</p>
<p>21. Such were his surroundings when he approved the wise counsel of Solomon that
there is a time to every purpose:3334 so he hid himself for a while, escaping during the time
of war, to show himself when the time of peace came, as it did soon afterwards. Meanwhile
George, there being absolutely no one to resist him, overran Egypt, and desolated Syria, in
the might of ungodliness. He seized upon the East also as far as he could, ever attracting
the weak, as torrents roll down objects in their course, and assailing the unstable or fainthearted.
He won over also the simplicity of the Emperor, for thus I must term his instability,
though I respect his pious motives. For, to say the truth, he had zeal, but not according to
knowledge.3335 He purchased those in authority who were lovers of money rather than
lovers of Christ—for he was well supplied with the funds for the poor, which he embezzled—
especially the effeminate and unmanly men,3336 of doubtful sex, but of manifest
impiety; to whom, I know not how or why, Emperors of the Romans entrusted authority

over men, though their proper function was the charge of women. In this lay the power of
that servant3337 of the wicked one, that sower of tares, that forerunner of Antichrist; foremost
in speech of the orators of his time among the Bishops; if any one likes to call him an orator
who was not so much an impious, as he was a hostile and contentious reasoner,—his name
I will gladly pass by: he was the hand of his party, perverting the truth by the gold subscribed
for pious uses, which the wicked made an instrument of their impiety.</p>
<p>22. The crowning feat of this faction was the council which sat first at Seleucia, the city
of the holy and illustrious virgin Thekla, and afterwards at this mighty city, thus connecting
their names, no longer with noble associations, but with these of deepest disgrace; whether
we must call that council, which subverted and disturbed everything, a tower of Chalane,3338
which deservedly confounded the tongues—would that theirs had been confounded for
their harmony in evil!—or a Sanhedrim of Caiaphas3339 where Christ was condemned, or
some other like name. The ancient and pious doctrine which defended the Trinity was abolished,
by setting up a3340 palisade and battering down the Consubstantial: opening the
door to impiety by means of what is written, using as their pretext, their reverence for
Scripture and for the use of approved terms, but really introducing unscriptural Arianism.
For the phrase “like, according to the Scriptures,” was a bait to the simple, concealing the
hook of impiety, a figure seeming to look in the direction of all who passed by, a boot fitting
either foot, a winnowing with every wind,3341 gaining authority from the newly written
villany and device against the truth. For they were wise to do evil, but to do good they had
no knowledge.3342</p>
<p>23. Hence came their pretended condemnation3343 of the heretics, whom they renounced
in words, in order to gain plausibility for their efforts, but in reality furthered; charging
them not with unbounded impiety, but with exaggerated language. Hence came the profane
judges of the Saints, and the new combination, and public view and discussion of mysterious
questions, and the illegal enquiry into the actions of life, and the hired informers, and the

council of Constantinople, a.d. 360, and professed great devotion to the use of Scriptural terms.</note>

purchased sentences. Some were unjustly deposed3344 from their sees, others intruded, and
among other necessary qualifications, made to sign the bonds of iniquity: the ink was ready,
the informer at hand. This the majority even of us, who were not overcome, had to endure,
not falling in mind, though prevailed upon to sign,3345 and so uniting with men who were
in both respects wicked, and involving ourselves in the smoke,3346 if not in the flame. Over
this I have often wept, when contemplating the confusion of impiety at that time, and the
persecution of the orthodox teaching which now arose at the hands of the patrons of the
Word.</p>
<p>24. For in reality, as the Scripture says, the shepherds became brutish,3347 and many
shepherds destroyed My vineyard, and defiled my pleasant portion,3348 I mean the Church
of God, which has been gathered together by the sweat and blood of many toilers and victims
both before and after Christ, aye, even the great sufferings of God for us. For with very few
exceptions, and these either men who from their insignificance were disregarded, or from
their virtue manfully resisted, being left unto Israel,3349 as was ordained, for a seed and
root,3350 to blossom and come to life again amid the streams of the Spirit, everyone3351
yielded to the influences of the time, distinguished only by the fact that some did so earlier,
some later, that some became the champions and leaders of impiety, while such others were
assigned a lower rank, as had been shaken by fear, enslaved by need, fascinated by flattery,
or beguiled in ignorance; the last being the least guilty, if indeed we can allow even this to
be a valid excuse for men entrusted with the leadership of the people. For just as the force
of lions and other animals, or of men and of women, or of old and of young men is not the
same, but there is a considerable difference due to age or species—so it is also with rulers
and their subjects. For while we might pardon laymen in such a case, and often they escape,
because not put to the test, yet how can we excuse a teacher, whose duty it is, unless he is
falsely so-called, to correct the ignorance of others. For is it not absurd, while no one,
however great his boorishness and want of education, is allowed to be ignorant of the Roman
law, and while there is no law in favour of sins of ignorance, that the teachers of the mysteries
of salvation should be ignorant of the first principles of salvation, however simple and

shallow their minds may be in regard to other subjects. But, even granting indulgence to
them who erred in ignorance, what can be said for the rest, who lay claim to subtlety of intellect,
and yet yielded to the court-party for the reasons I have mentioned, and after playing
the part of piety for a long while, failed in the hour of trial.</p>
<p>25. “Yet once more,”3352 I hear the Scripture say that the heaven and the earth shall be
shaken, inasmuch as this has befallen them before, signifying, as I suppose, a manifest
renovation of all things. And we must believe S. Paul when he says3353 that this last shaking
is none other than the second coming of Christ, and the transformation and changing of
the universe to a condition of stability which cannot be shaken. And I imagine that this
present shaking, in which3354 the contemplatives and lovers of God, who before the time
exercise their heavenly citizenship, are shaken from us, is of no less consequence than any
of former days. For, however peaceful and moderate in other respects these men are, yet
they cannot bear to carry their reasonableness so far as to be traitors to the cause of God for
quietness’ sake: nay on this point they are excessively warlike and sturdy in fight; such is
the heat of their zeal, that they would sooner proceed to excess in disturbance, than fail to
notice anything that is amiss. And no small portion of the people is breaking away with
them, flying away, as a flock of birds does, with those who lead the flight, and even now
does not cease to fly with them.</p>
<p>26. Such was Athanasius to us, when present, the pillar of the Church; and such, even
when he retired before the insults of the wicked. For those who have plotted the capture of
some strong fort, when they see no other easy means of approaching or taking it, betake
themselves to arts, and then, after seducing the commander by money or guile, without any
effort possess themselves of the stronghold, or, if you will, as those who plotted against
Samson first cut off his hair,3355 in which his strength lay, and then seized upon the judge,
and made sport of him at will, to requite him for his former power: so did our foreign foes,
after getting rid of our source of strength, and shearing off the glory of the Church, revel in
like manner in utterances and deeds of impiety. Then the supporter3356 and patron of the
hostile shepherd3357 died, crowning3358 his reign, which had not been evil, with an evil
close, and unprofitably repenting, as they say, with his last breath, when each man, in view

of the higher judgement seat, is a prudent judge of his own conduct. For of these three evils,
which were unworthy of his reign, he said that he was conscious, the murder of his kinsmen,
the proclamation of the Apostate, and the innovation upon the faith; and with these words
he is said to have departed. Thus there was once more authority to teach the word of truth,
and those who had suffered violence had now undisturbed freedom of speech, while jealousy
was whetting the weapons of its wrath. Thus it was with the people of Alexandria, who,
with their usual impatience of the insolent, could not brook the excesses of the man, and
therefore marked his wickedness by an unusual death, and his death by an unusual ignominy.
For you know that camel,3359 and its strange burden, and the new form of elevation, and
the first and, I think, the only procession, with which to this day the insolent are threatened.</p>
<p>27. But when from this hurricane of unrighteousness, this corrupter of godliness, this
precursor of the wicked one, such satisfaction had been exacted, in a way I cannot praise,
for we must consider not what he ought to have suffered, but what we ought3360 to do: exacted
however it was, as the result of the public anger and excitement: and thereupon, our
champion was restored from his illustrious banishment, for so I term his exile on behalf of,
and under the blessing of, the Trinity, amid such delight of the people of the city and of almost
all Egypt, that they ran together from every side, from the furthest limits of the country,
simply to hear the voice of Athanasius, or feast their eyes upon the sight of him, nay even,
as we are told of the Apostles, that they might be hallowed by the shadow3361 and unsubstantial
image of his body: so that, many as are the honours, and welcomes bestowed on
frequent occasions in the course of time upon various individuals, not only upon public
rulers and bishops, but also upon the most illustrious of private citizens, not one has been
recorded more numerously attended or more brilliant than this. And only one honour can
be compared with it by Athanasius himself, which had been conferred upon him on his
former entrance into the city, when returning from the same exile for the same reasons.</p>
<p>28. With reference to this honour there was also current some such report as the following;
for I will take leave to mention it, even though it be superfluous, as a kind of flavouring
to my speech, or a flower scattered in honour of his entry. After that entry, a certain officer,
who had been twice Consul, was riding into the city; he was one of us, among the most
noted of Cappadocians. I am sure that you know that I mean Philagrius, who won upon
our affections far beyond any one else, and was honoured as much as he was loved, if I may
thus briefly set forth all his distinctions: who had been for a second time entrusted with the
<note type="footnote">3359 Camel. On the death of Constantius, the pagans of Alexandria murdered George, and carried his mangled
body through the streets on the back of a camel.</note>

government of the city, at the request of the citizens, by the decision of the Emperor. Then
one of the common people present, thinking the crowd enormous, like an ocean whose
bound no eye can see, is reported to have said to one of his comrades and friends—as often
happens in such a case—“Tell me, my good fellow, have you ever before seen the people
pour out in such numbers and so enthusiastically to do honour to any one man?” “No!”
said the young man, “and I fancy that not even Constantius himself would be so treated;”
indicating, by the mention of the Emperor, the climax of possible honour. “Do you speak
of that,” said the other with a sweet and merry laugh, “as something wonderfully great? I
can scarcely believe that even the great Athanasius would be welcomed like this,” adding at
the same time one of our native oaths in confirmation of his words. Now the point of what
he said, as I suppose you also plainly see, is this, that he set the subject of our eulogy before
the Emperor himself.</p>
<p>29. So great was the reverence of all for the man, and so amazing even now seems the
reception which I have described. For if divided according to birth, age and profession,
(and the city is most usually arranged in this way, when a public honour is bestowed on
anyone) how can I set forth in words that mighty spectacle? They formed one river, and it
were indeed a poet’s task to describe that Nile, of really golden stream and rich in crops,
flowing back again from the city to the Chæreum, a day’s journey, I take it, and more. Permit
me to revel a while longer in my description: for I am going there, and it is not easy to bring
back even my words from that ceremony. He rode upon a colt, almost, blame me not for
folly, as my Jesus did upon that other colt,3362 whether it were the people of the Gentiles,
whom He mounts in kindness, by setting it free from the bonds of ignorance, or something
else, which the Scripture sets forth. He was welcomed with branches of trees, and garments
with many flowers and of varied hue were torn off and strewn before him and under his
feet: there alone was all that was glorious and costly and peerless treated with dishonour.
Like, once more, to the entry of Christ were those that went before with shouts and followed
with dances; only the crowd which sung his praises was not of children only, but every
tongue was harmonious, as men contended only to outdo one another. I pass by the universal
cheers, and the pouring forth of unguents, and the nightlong festivities, and the whole city
gleaming with light, and the feasting in public and at home, and all the means of testifying
to a city’s joy, which were then in lavish and incredible profusion bestowed upon him. Thus
did this marvellous man, with such a concourse, regain his own city.</p>
<p>30. He lived then as becomes the rulers of such a people, but did he fail to teach as he
lived? Were his contests out of harmony with his teaching? Were his dangers less than
those of men who have contended for any truth? Were his honours inferior to the objects
for which he contended? Did he after his reception in any way disgrace that reception? By
<note type="footnote">3362 S. Luke xix. 35.</note>

<pb n="565"/>
no means. Everything was harmonious, as an air upon a single lyre, and in the same key;
his life, his teaching, his struggles, his dangers, his return, and his conduct after his return.
For immediately on his restoration to his Church, he was not like those who are blinded by
unrestrained passion, who, under the dominion of their anger, thrust away or strike at once
whatever comes in their way, even though it might well be spared. But, thinking this to be
a special time for him to consult his reputation, since one who is ill-treated is usually restrained,
and one who has the power to requite a wrong is ungoverned, he treated so mildly
and gently those who had injured him, that even they themselves, if I may say so, did not
find his restoration distasteful.</p>
<p>31. He cleansed the temple of those who made merchandise of God, and trafficked in
the things of Christ, imitating Christ3363 in this also; only it was with persuasive words, not
with a twisted scourge that this was wrought. He reconciled also those who were at variance,
both with one another and with him, without the aid of any coadjutor. Those who had been
wronged he set free from oppression, making no distinction as to whether they were of his
own or of the opposite party. He restored too the teaching which had been overthrown:
the Trinity was once more boldly spoken of, and set upon the lampstand, flashing with the
brilliant light of the One Godhead into the souls of all. He legislated again for the whole
world, and brought all minds under his influence, by letters to some, by invitations to others,
instructing some, who visited him uninvited, and proposing as the single law to all—Good
will.3364 For this alone was able to conduct them to the true issue. In brief, he exemplified
the virtues of two celebrated stones—for to those who assailed him he was adamant, and to
those at variance a magnet, which by some secret natural power draws iron to itself, and
influences the hardest of substances.</p>
<p>32. But yet it was not likely that envy could brook all this, or see the Church restored
again to the same glory and health as in former days, by the speedy healing over, as in the
body, of the wounds of separation. Therefore it was, that he raised up against Athanasius
the Emperor, a rebel like himself,3365 and his peer in villany, inferior to him only from lack
of time, the first of Christian Emperors to rage against Christ, bringing forth all at once the
basilisk of impiety with which he had long been in labour, when he obtained an opportunity,
and shewing himself, at the time when he was proclaimed Emperor, to be a traitor to the
Emperor who had entrusted him with the empire, and a traitor double dyed to the God who
had saved him. He devised the most inhuman of all the persecutions by blending speciousness
with cruelty, in his envy of the honour won by the martyrs in their struggles; and so

<pb n="566"/>
he called in question their repute for courage, by making verbal twists and quibbles a part
of his character, or to speak the real truth, devoting himself to them with an eagerness born
of his natural disposition, and imitating in varied craft the Evil one who dwelt within him.
The subjugation of the whole race of Christians he thought a simple task; but found it a
great one to overcome Athanasius and the power of his teaching over us. For he saw that
no success could be gained in the plot against us, because of this man’s resistance and opposition;
the places of the Christians cut down being at once filled up, surprising though it
seems, by the accession of Gentiles and the prudence of Athanasius. In full view therefore
of this, the crafty perverter and persecutor, clinging no longer to his cloak of illiberal sophistry,
laid bare his wickedness and openly banished the Bishop from the city. For the illustrious
warrior must needs conquer in three struggles3366 and thus make good his perfect
title to fame.</p>
<p>33. Brief was the interval before Justice pronounced sentence, and handed over the offender3367
to the Persians: sending him forth an ambitious monarch—and bringing him
back a corpse for which no one even felt pity; which, as I have heard, was not allowed to
rest in the grave, but was shaken out and thrown up by the earth which he had shaken: a
prelude—I take it—to his future chastisement. Then another king3368 arose,3369 not
shameless in countenance like the former, nor an oppressor of Israel with cruel tasks and
taskmasters, but most pious and gentle. In order to lay the best of foundations for his empire,
and begin, as is right, by an act of justice, he recalled from exile all the Bishops, but in the
first place him who stood first in virtue and had conspicuously championed the cause of
piety. Further, he inquired into the truth of our faith which had been torn asunder, confused,
and parcelled out into various opinions and portions by many; with the intention, if it were
possible, of reducing the whole world to harmony and union by the co-operation of the
Spirit: and, should he fail in this, of attaching himself to the best party, so as to aid and be
aided by it, thus giving token of the exceeding loftiness and magnificence of his ideas on
questions of the greatest moment. Here too was shown in a very high degree the simplemindedness
of Athanasius, and the steadfastness of his faith in Christ. For, when all the
rest who sympathised with us were divided into three parties, and many were faltering in
their conception of the Son, and still more in that of the Holy Ghost, (a point on which to
be only slightly in error was to be orthodox) and few indeed were sound upon both points,
he was the first and only one, or with the concurrence of but a few, to venture to confess in

writing, with entire clearness and distinctness, the Unity of Godhead and Essence of the
Three Persons, and thus to attain in later days, under the influence of inspiration, to the
same faith in regard to the Holy Ghost, as had been bestowed at an earlier time on most of
the Fathers in regard to the Son. This confession, a truly royal and magnificent gift, he
presented to the Emperor, opposing to the unwritten innovation, a written account3370 the
orthodox faith, so that an emperor might be overcome by an emperor, reason by reason,
treatise by treatise.</p>
<p>34. This confession was, it seems, greeted with respect by all, both in West and East,
who were capable of life; some cherishing piety within their own bosoms, if we may credit
what they say, but advancing no further, like a still-born child which dies within its mother’s
womb; others kindling to some extent, as it were, sparks, so far as to escape the difficulties
of the time, arising either from the more fervent of the orthodox, or the devotion of the
people; while others spoke the truth with boldness, on whose side I would be, for I dare
make no further boast; no longer consulting my own fearfulness—in other words, the views
of men more unsound than myself (for this we have done enough and to spare, without
either gaining anything from others, or guarding from injury that which was our own, just
as bad stewards do) but bringing forth to light my offspring, nourishing it with eagerness,
and exposing it, in its constant growth, to the eyes of all.</p>
<p>35. This, however, is less admirable than his conduct. What wonder that he, who had
already made actual ventures on behalf of the truth, should confess it in writing? Yet this
point I will add to what has been said, as it seems to me especially wonderful and cannot
with impunity be passed over in a time so fertile in disagreements as this. For his action, if
we take note of him, will afford instruction even to the men of this day. For as, in the case
of one and the same quantity of water, there is separated from it, not only the residue which
is left behind by the hand when drawing it, but also those drops, once contained in the hand,
which trickle out through the fingers; so also there is a separation between us and, not only
those who hold aloof in their impiety, but also those who are most pious, and that both in
regard to such doctrines as are of small consequence (a matter of less moment) and also in
regard to expressions intended to bear the same meaning. We use in an orthodox sense the
terms one Essence and three Hypostases, the one to denote the nature of the Godhead, the
other the properties3371 of the Three; the Italians3372 mean the same, but, owing to the
scantiness of their vocabulary, and its poverty of terms, they are unable to distinguish between

<pb n="568"/>
Essence and Hypostases, and therefore introduce the term Persons, to avoid being understood
to assert three Essences. The result, were it not piteous, would be laughable. This slight
difference of sound was taken to indicate a difference of faith. Then, Sabellianism was suspected
in the doctrine of Three Persons, Arianism in that of Three Hypostases, both being
the offspring of a contentious spirit. And then, from the gradual but constant growth of
irritation (the unfailing result of contentiousness) there was a danger of the whole world
being torn asunder in the strife about syllables. Seeing and hearing this, our blessed one,
true man of God and great steward of souls as he was, felt it inconsistent with his duty to
overlook so absurd and unreasonable a rending of the word, and applied his medicine to
the disease. In what manner? He conferred in his gentle and sympathetic way with both
parties, and after he had carefully weighed the meaning of their expressions, and found that
they had the same sense, and were in nowise different in doctrine, by permitting each party
to use its own terms, he bound them3373 together in unity of action.</p>
<p>36. This in itself was more profitable than the long course of labours and teaching on
which all writers enlarge, for in it somewhat of ambition mingled, and consequently, perhaps,
somewhat of novelty in expressions. This again was of more value than his many vigils and
acts of discipline,3374 the advantage of which is limited to those who perform them. This
was worthy of our hero’s famous banishments and flights; for the object, in view of which
he chose to endure such sufferings, he still pursued when the sufferings were past. Nor did
he cease to cherish the same ardour in others, praising some, gently rebuking others; rousing
the sluggishness of these, restraining the passion of those; in some cases eager to prevent a
fall, in others devising means of recovery after a fall; simple in disposition, manifold in the
arts of government; clever in argument, more clever still in mind; condescending to the
more lowly, outsoaring the more lofty; hospitable,3375 protector of suppliants, averted of
evils, really combining in himself alone the whole of the attributes parcelled out by the sons
of Greece among their deities. Further he was the patron of the wedded and virgin state
alike, both peaceable and a peacemaker, and attendant upon those who are passing from
hence. Oh, how many a title does his virtue afford me, if I would detail its many-sided excellence.</p>
<p>37. After such a course, as taught and teacher, that his life and habits form the ideal of
an Episcopate, and his teaching the law of orthodoxy, what reward does he win for his piety?
It is not indeed right to pass this by. In a good old age he closed his life,3376 and was gathered
to his fathers, the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Apostles, and Martyrs, who contended for

his return from exile; the object of many tears, his glory, stored up in the minds of all, outshines

fair renown, so especially illustrate the due proportions of speech and of silence, do thou

be peaceful, possess and aid me in my pastoral charge, or if it pass through struggles, uphold
me, or take me to thee, and set me with thyself and those like thee (though I have asked a

<head>Introduction to the “Theological” Orations.</head>
<p>“It has been said with truth,” says the writer of the Article on Gregory of Nazianzus in
the Dictionary of Christian Biography, “that these discourses would lose their chief charm
in a translation.<gap reason="omitted"/>Critics have rivalled each other in the praises they have heaped upon
them, but no praise is so high as that of the many Theologians who have found in them
their own best thoughts. A Critic who cannot be accused of partiality towards Gregory has
given in a few words perhaps the truest estimate of them: ‘A solidity of thought, the concentration
of all that is spread through the writings of Hilary, Basil, and Athanasius, a flow of
softened eloquence which does not halt or lose itself for a moment, an argument nervous
without dryness on the one hand, and without useless ornament on the other, give these
five Discourses a place to themselves among the monuments of this fine Genius, who was
not always in the same degree free from grandiloquence and affectation. In a few pages,
and in a few hours, Gregory has summed up and closed the controversy of a whole Century.’”
3377 They were preached in the Church called Anastasia,3378 at Constantinople,
between 379 and 381, and have gained for their author the title of The Theologian, which
he shares with S. John the Evangelist alone. It should perhaps, however, be noted that the
word is not here used in the wide and general sense in which we employ it, but in a narrower
and more specific way, denoting emphatically the Defender of the Deity of the Logos. His
principal opponents were the followers of Eunomius and Macedonius, and it is almost entirely
against them that these Orations on Theology, or the Godhead of the Word and the Holy
Ghost, are directed. The chief object of the Preacher in these and most other of his public
utterances, is to maintain the Nicene Faith of the Trinity or Trinity of God; that is, the
Doctrine that while there is but One Substance or Essence3379 in the Godhead, and by
<note type="footnote">3377 De Broglie, “L’Eglise et l’Empire,” v. 385.—“Ce sont autant de modèles dans l’art délicat d’imprimer la

en aucun moment; une argumentation nerveuse sans sècheresse, mais sans vaine parure d’ornements, font à
ces cinq discours une place à part parmi les monuments de ce beau génie, auquel l’emphase et l’affectation ne
furent pas toujours aussi étrangers. En quelques pages, et en quelques heures, Grégoire avait résumé et clos la

They are in one another, inseparable, and cannot be conceived without each other. In this point the Nicene
doctrine is thoroughly monotheistic, or monarchian, in distinction from tritheism, which is but a new form of
the polytheism of the pagans. “The terms Essence (οὐσία) and Nature (φύσις), in the philosophical sense, denote
not an individual, a personality, but the Genus or Species; not Unum in Numero, but Ens Unum in Multis. All
men are of the same substance, partake of the same human nature; though as persons and individuals they are</note>

consequence God is in the most absolute sense One, yet God is not Unipersonal, but within
this Undivided Unity there are three Self-determining Subjects or Persons, distinguished
from one another by special characteristics (ἰδιότητες) or personal properties—Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost. With this object he entered into conflict with the heretics named above,
who denied either the Consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, or the perfect Godhead
and Personality of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Eunomius, whom Ullmann calls one of the most interesting heretics of the Fourth
Century, was by birth a Cappadocian, and slightly older than Gregory. As a young man he
was a pupil and amanuensis of Aëtius, by whom the Arian heresy was developed to its extreme
results. The disciple never shrank from drawing the furthest logical conclusions from his
master’s premises, or from stating them with a frankness, which to those who regarded the
premises themselves from which he reasoned as horrible blasphemies, seemed nothing less
than diabolical in its impiety. So precisely did he complete and formulate his teacher’s
heretical tenets, that the Anomoean Arians were ever afterwards called Eunomians, rather
than Aëtians. They asserted the absolute Unlikeness of the Being of the Father and of the
Son. Starting with the conception of God as Absolute Being, of Whom no Generation can
be predicated, Unbegotten and incapable of Begetting, they went on to say that an Eternal
Generation is inconceivable, and that the Generation of the Son of God must have had a
beginning. Of course, therefore, the Arian conclusion followed, namely, that there was a
time when the Son did not exist (ἦν ποτὲ ὅτε οῦκ ἦν), and His Essence is altogether unlike
<note type="footnote">very different. The term Homo-ousion, in its strict grammatical sense, differs from Mono-ousion or Toutoousion,
as well as from Hetero-ousion, and signifies not numerical identity, but equality of essence or community
of nature among several beings. It is clearly thus used in the Chalcedonian Symbol, where it is said that Christ
is ‘consubstantial (Homo-ousios) with the Father as touching the Godhead, and consubstantial with us (and yet
individually distinct from us) as touching the Manhood.’ But in the Divine Trinity consubstantiality denotes
not only sameness of kind, but at the same time Numerical unity; not merely the Unum in Specie, but also the
Unum in Numero. The three Persons are related to the Divine Substance not as three individuals to their species,
as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or Peter, John, and Paul, to human nature; they are only one God. The divine
Substance is absolutely indivisible by reason of its simplicity, and absolutely inextensible and untransferable by
reason of its infinity; whereas a corporeal substance can be divided, and the human nature can be multiplied by
generation. Three Divine substances would limit and exclude each other, and therefore could not be infinite
or absolute. The whole fulness of the one undivided Essence of God, with all its attributes, is in all the Persons
of the Trinity, though in each in His own way; in the Father as Original Principle, in the Son by eternal Generation,
in the Spirit by eternal Procession. The Church teaches not One Divine Essence and Three Persons, but One
Essence In Three Persons. Father, Son, and Spirit cannot be conceived as Three separate individuals, but are
in one another, and form a solidaric Unity.” (Schaff, History of the Church, Nic. U+0026 Post-Nic. Period, Div. ii. p.
672.)</note>

<pb n="572"/>
that of the Unbegotten Father. Equality of essence and Similarity of essence, are alike untenable,
from the mere fact that the one Essence is Unbegotten, and the other is Begotten.
The Son, they said, is the First Creation of the Divine Energy, and is the Instrument by
whom God created the world, and in this sense, as the Organ of creative power, may be said
to be the Express Image and Likeness of the Energy of the Father.3380</p>
<p>As they viewed the Holy Ghost as sharing the Divine Nature in an even remoter degree,
as being only the noblest production of the Only-begotten Son, Eunomius was the first
person heretically to discontinue the practice of threefold immersion in Holy Baptism. He
also corrupted the Form of that Sacrament, by setting aside the use of the Name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and baptizing people “in the name of the Creator, and into
the death of Christ.” Therefore the Council of Constantinople ordered that converts from
Eunomianism should be baptized, although those from other forms of Arianism were admitted
into the Catholic Church by simple imposition of hands. Through the influence of
the followers of Aëtius, Eunomius became, in 360, Bishop of Cyzicus in Mysia, but he does
not appear to have occupied the See very long. At any rate when Gregory came, in 379, to
Constantinople, he was living in retirement near Chalcedon. All parties concur in representing
him as a consummate Dialectician, but the Orthodox declared that he had turned
Theology into a mere Technology. Readiness of Dialectic was the great characteristic of his
Sect, and it was they who introduced into the Capital that bad spirit of theological disputatiousness
which Gregory deplores in the first of these famous Orations. He also differed
entirely from Gregory, not merely in the conclusions at which he arrived, but in the method
by which he reached them; following the system of Aristotle, rather than of Plato, and using
an exclusively intellectual method, while Gregory treated Religion as belonging to the entire
man. The point at issue between them, besides this of the Interior relations of the Three
Blessed Persons within the Godhead, was mainly the question as to the complete comprehensibility
of the Divine Nature, which the Eunomians maintained, and Gregory denied.
The latter argued that, while we have a sure conviction that God is, we have not a full understanding
of What He is. He would not, however, exclude us from all knowledge of God’s
Nature, only he limits our capacity to so much as God has been pleased to reveal to us of
Himself. “In my opinion,” he says (Or. xxiv. 4), “it is impossible to express God, and yet
more impossible to conceive Him—seeing that the thick covering of the flesh is an obstacle
to the understanding of the truth.” Similarly in the Fourth of these Orations (Or. xxx. 17)
he says, “The Deity cannot be expressed in words. And this is proved to us, not only by arguments,
but by the wisest and most ancient of the Hebrews, so far as they have given us
<note type="footnote">3380 Two terms borrowed from Holy Scripture (Heb. i. 3). But observe, borrowed with a difference—not
“the Image of His Substance,” which they would not admit, but of His “Energy,” which is a very different conception.</note>

<pb n="573"/>
reason for conjecture. For they appropriated certain characters to the honour of the Deity,
and would not even allow the name of anything inferior to God to be written with the same
letters as that of God, because to their mind it was improper that the Deity should even to
that extent admit any of His creatures to a share with Himself. How then could they have
admitted that the indivisible and separate Nature can be explained by divisible words?”</p>
<p>In the mind of Gregory, the Orthodox doctrine of the Blessed Trinity is the fundamental
dogma of Christianity, in contrast with all other religions, and with all heretical systems.
“Remember your confession,” he says to his hearers in an Oration against the Arians; “Into
what were you baptized? The Father? Good, but still Jewish. The Son? Good; no longer
Jewish, but not yet perfect. The Holy Ghost? Very good; this is perfect. Was it then simply
into these, or was there some one common Name of these? Yes, there was, and it is God.”
And in the same oration he calls Arianism a new Judaism, because it ascribes full Deity only
to the Father; and he speaks of One Nature in Three Individualities, intelligent, perfect, selfexistent,
distinct numerically, but one in Godhead. “In created things,” says Ullmann, “the
several individuals are embraced in a common conception, though in themselves only
connected together in thought, while in fact they are not one. Manhood is only an intellectual
conception; in fact there exist only Men. But in the Godhead the Three Persons are
not only in conception, but in fact, One; and this Unity is not only a relative but an absolute
Unity, because the Divine Being is perfect in all Three Persons, and in all in a perfect
equality. In this sense therefore Gregory and all orthodox Trinitarians maintain the Unity
of God. But within this Unity there is a true Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, a Trinity
of Persons in a Unity of Nature.” We worship, he says (Or. xxxiii. 16), the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, One Nature in Three Individualities. So that, as he says elsewhere (Or. in laud.
Athanasii, xxi. 10), the Trinity is a true Trinity; not a numbering of unlike things, but a
binding together of equals. Each of the Persons is God in the fullest sense. The Son and
the Holy Ghost have their Source of Being in the Father, but in such sense that They are
fully consubstantial with Him, and that neither of Them differs from Him in any particular
of Essence. The points of difference lie in the Personal Attributes; the Father Unoriginate,
and Source of Deity; the Son deriving His Being eternally from the Father, and Himself the
Source of all created existence; the Holy Ghost proceeding eternally from God, and sent
into the world.</p>
<p>In the first of these five discourses the Preacher sets himself to clear the ground for the
fitting presentation of his great theme. He endeavours to lay down the principles on which
Theologians should proceed in such discussions, and very earnestly deprecates the habit of
promiscuous argument in all sorts of places, upon all sorts of occasions, and before all sorts
of hearers, of the deepest and most sacred truths and mysteries of the Faith. They only
should be allowed to engage in such conversation who are fitted for it by the practice of

<pb n="574"/>
Christian virtue. For others there are many other subjects upon which they can exercise
their dialectical attainments, without doing or incurring any injury.</p>
<p>In the second oration Gregory lays down the position referred to above, that it is impossible
for even the most exalted human reason fully to grasp the Nature of God, though
His Existence is patent to all. We can only, he says, predicate negatives concerning Him.
He gives three reasons for this incapacity. First to enhance our estimation of this knowledge,
when attained hereafter; secondly to save us from the danger of falling through pride, like
Lucifer, if we attained it prematurely; and thirdly, to support and sustain us in the trials and
conflicts of this life, by the certainty that its attainment hereafter will be the reward of
faithful service in them. The cause of our present inability is the body with which our soul
is united, the grossness of whose present condition hinders us from rising to the complete
apprehension of the invisible and immaterial. God, out of compassion for our weakness,
has been pleased to designate Himself in Holy Scripture by various names taken from material
objects, or from moral virtues; but these are only stepping-stones to the truth, and
have indeed been sometimes perverted, and made a basis for polytheism. It is, however,
only natural that the Divine Essence should be shrouded in Mystery, for the same is the case
with the created essences also.</p>
<p>In the Third and Fourth he deals with the question of the Son. His position may be
summed up as follows: The Son is absolutely of One Substance with the Father, and shares
with Him all the Attributes of Godhead. Yet He is a distinct Person, marked off by the fact
that He is begotten of the Father. But we must be careful not to allow this term “Begotten”
to suggest to us any analogy with created things. It is wholly independent of time and space
and sense.</p>
<p>This position he had to defend against many assailants, and especially against the Eunomians.
These heretics maintained that the use of this term necessarily implied a beginning
of the Essence of the Son, and they asked the orthodox to tell them when that beginning
took place. Gregory replies that the Generation of God the Son is beyond all time; pointing
out that Paternity is an Essential attribute of God the Father, and therefore is as eternal as
His Essence, so that there never was a time when He was not the Father, and consequently
never a time when the Generation of the Son began. He admits that there is a sense in which
it is possible to say that the Son and the Spirit are not unoriginate, but then you must be
careful not to use the word Origin in the sense of Beginning, but in that of Cause. They
derive Their Being eternally from the Father, and all Three Persons are coeternal together.
In respect of cause They are not unoriginate, but the cause is not necessarily prior in time
to its effect, just as the Sun is not prior to its own light. In respect of time, then, They may
be said to be unoriginate, for the Sources of time cannot be subject to time. “If the Father
has not ceased to beget, His Generation is an imperfect one; and if He has ceased, He must
have begun, for an end implies a beginning.” “Not so,” says Gregory, “unless you are prepared

<pb n="575"/>
to admit that what has no end has necessarily no beginning; and in that case what will you
say about the Angels, or the human soul? These will have no end; had either of them
therefore no beginning?” By a similar process of Reductio ad absurdum he dissipates all the
quibbles of Eunomian sophistry, and lays down the orthodox Faith of the Church. Then
in the remainder of the Third and Fourth Orations he goes on to examine the Scriptural
testimony adduced by his opponents, and to shew by a similar catena on the other side that
the overwhelming preponderance of the authority of the Bible is clearly against them. In
connection with this point he lays down the canon that in the interpretation of Scripture in
regard to our Lord, all expressions savouring of humility or weakness are to be referred to
that pure Humanity which He assumed for our sake; while all that speaks of Majesty and
Power belongs to His Godhead.</p>
<p>In the Fifth he deals with the doctrine of the Holy Ghost. The heresy of Arius was at
first directly concerned only with the Person of our Lord, though not without a side-glance
at that also of the Holy Ghost. The Council of Nicæa had confined itself to the first question,
and its Creed ended with, “We believe in the Holy Ghost.” This, it was afterwards argued,
was enough to proclaim His Divinity, and so Gregory argues in this Oration, “If He be only
a creature, how do we believe on Him, how are we made perfect in Him, for the first of these
belongs to Deity, the second may be said of anything” (c. vi.). The reason, however, that
the Great Synod made no express definition on the point seems to have been that the controversy
had not yet been carried so far in direct terms (cf. S. Basil, Epp. lxxviii. ccclxxxvii.).
But fifty years later the growth of the heresy rendered a definition of the Church’s faith on
this point needful; and in 363, on his return from his fourth period of exile, S. Athanasius
held a provincial Synod at Alexandria, in whose Synodical Letter to the Emperor Jovian the
Godhead of the Holy Ghost is maintained in terms which, as Canon Bright says, partly anticipate
the language of the Creed of Constantinople (Dict. Biog. Art. Athanasius). The new
development of the heresy had begun to appear at Constantinople as well as in Thrace and
Asia Minor. Macedonius, a Semi-Arian, had been elected Bishop of Constantinople in 341,
and in spite of violent opposition, which he met by still more violent measures, had maintained
his position till 360, when he was deposed and driven out by the Anomoean Arians.
He then in his retirement became the leader of the Semi-Arian party. Accepting the statement
that the Son was Like in Essence to the Father, he would not concede even this to the Holy
Ghost, but declared Him to be a mere creature (Thdt. Hist. Eccl. ii. 6), and the servant or
minister of the Son; applying to Him terms which without error could only be used of the
Angels (Sozomen. H. E. iv. 27). His followers were known as Macedonians, or sometimes
Marathonians, from a certain Marathonius, formerly a Paymaster of the Prætorian Guards,
who had become a Deacon of Constantinople, and, having done much in the way of
founding and maintaining Monastic Houses and Houses of Charity in the City, was consecrated
by Macedonius as Bishop of Nicomedia. They were also known as Pneumatomachi,

<pb n="576"/>
from the nature of their Heresy. A controversy had now begun to arise as to the precise
position which the true faith was to assign to the Holy Spirit. There were those who left it
doubtful whether He had indeed a separate Personality, or whether He were not rather a
mere Influence or Activity of the Father and the Son. Gregory tells us how, when he came
to the Metropolis, he found the wildest confusion prevalent. Some, he says, conceived of
the Holy Ghost as a mere Energy of God, others thought Him a Creature, others believed
Him to be God; while many out of an alleged reverence for Holy Scripture, hesitated to give
Him the Name of God. To this last class belonged, according to Socrates (H. E. ii. 45), Eustathius,
who had been ejected from the Bishopric of Sebasteia in Pontus. He refused to
admit that the Holy Spirit is God, while yet He did not dare to affirm that He is a mere
creature. When Gregory proceeded to preach the Deity of the Spirit, he was accused of introducing
a strange and unscriptural god, because, as he acknowledges, the letter of the
Bible is not so clear on the doctrine of the Spirit as it is on that of the Son. But he points
out that it is possible to be superstitious in one’s reverence for the letter of the Bible, and
that such superstition leads directly to heresy. He explains the reticence of the New Testament
on this point by shewing (in this Oration, cc. 26, 27) how God’s Self-Revelation to
man has always been a gradual one; how the Old Testament revealed the Father clearly, with
obscure hints about the Son; and the New Testament manifested the Son, but only hinted
at the Godhead of the Spirit; but now, he says, the Spirit dwells among us, and allows us to
recognize Him more clearly. For it would not have been advisable, as long as the Godhead
of the Father was not acknowledged, to proclaim that of the Son; and while the Deity of the
Son was not yet accepted, to add another burden in that of the Holy Spirit. Recognizing
thus a Divine economy in the Self-Revelations of God, he was not averse to using a similar
caution in his own dealings with weak or ill-instructed minds.3381 But yet when real necessity
arose, he could speak out with perfect plainness on this subject; and he even incurred danger
to life and limb from the violence of the opposing party. He met their opposition by the
clearest statements of the Catholic Dogma. “Is the Spirit God?” he asks. “Yes.” “But is He
consubstantial?” “Yes, if He is God.” (Orat. xxxi. 10.) He appeals both to the Bible, and to
the experience of the Christian life. If the Spirit is not to be adored, how can He deify me
in Baptism? From the Spirit comes our new Birth; from the new Birth our new Life; and
from the new Life our knowledge of the Dignity of Him from Whom it is derived (Ibid. C.
29). He is, however, milder in his treatment of these heretics than of the strict Arians, both,
as he says, because they approached more nearly to the Orthodox belief on the subject of
the Son, and because their conspicuous piety of life shewed that their error was not altogether
wilful. In this Oration he shows that though the Name of God may not actually be given in
<note type="footnote">3381 In his Fifty-third Epistle, addressed to S. Basil, there is an amusing instance of his defence of this tolerant
disposition, which S. Basil also displayed in dealing with minds of this class.</note>

<pb n="577"/>
the New Testament to the Holy Ghost, yet all the attributes of God are ascribed to Him, and
that therefore the use of the Name is a matter of legitimate inference. He carries on the argument
in the Oration on Pentecost (No. XLI. See the Introduction to that Oration in the
present Volume).</p>
<p>With regard to the doctrine of the Procession, Gregory gives us no clear information.
He is silent as to the Procession from the Son. It is enough for him that the Spirit is not
Begotten but Proceeding (in SS. Lumina, c. 12), and that Procession is His distinctive
Property, which involves at once His Personality and His Essential Deity.</p>
<p>At length in 381 the work of local Synods and episcopal conferences was completed and
clinched by the Ruling of a Second Ecumenical Council. It is true that the Council which
Theodosius summoned to meet at Constantinople could scarcely have regarded itself as
possessing Ecumenical authority; whilst in the West it certainly was not regarded in this
light before the Sixth Century. Nevertheless the honours of Ecumenicity were ultimately
awarded to it by the whole Church, because it completes the series of Great Councils by
which the Doctrine of the Deity of the Holy Spirit was affirmed; and in fact it expressed the
final judgment of the Catholic Church upon the Macedonian controversy. Its first Canon
anathematises the Semiarians or Pneumatomachi by name as well as the Eunomians or
Anomoean Arians (cf. Dict. Biog. Art. Gregory of Nazianzus, by Dr. H. B. Swete).</p>

<head>Oration XXVII.</head>
<p>The First Theological Oration.</p>
<p>A Preliminary Discourse Against the Eunomians.</p>
<p>I. I am to speak against persons who pride themselves on their eloquence; so, to begin
with a text of Scripture, “Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one,”3382 not only in thy
system of teaching, but also in thy hearing, and in thy tone of mind. For there are certain
persons who have not only their ears3383 and their tongues, but even, as I now perceive,
their hands too, itching for our words; who delight in profane babblings, and oppositions
of science falsely so called,3384 and strifes about words, which tend to no profit; for so Paul,
the Preacher and Establisher of the “Word cut short,”3385 the disciple and teacher of the
Fishermen,3386 calls all that is excessive or superfluous in discourse. But as to those to whom
we refer, would that they, whose tongue is so voluble and clever in applying itself to noble
and approved language, would likewise pay some attention to actions. For then perhaps in
a little while they would become less sophistical, and less absurd and strange acrobats of
words, if I may use a ridiculous expression about a ridiculous subject.</p>
<p>II. But since they neglect every path of righteousness, and look only to this one point,
namely, which of the propositions submitted to them they shall bind or loose, (like those
persons who in the theatres perform wrestling matches in public, but not that kind of
wrestling in which the victory is won according to the rules of the sport, but a kind to deceive
the eyes of those who are ignorant in such matters, and to catch applause), and every marketplace
must buzz with their talking; and every dinner party be worried to death with silly
talk and boredom; and every festival be made unfestive and full of dejection, and every occasion
of mourning be consoled by a greater calamity3387—their questions—and all the
women’s apartments accustomed to simplicity be thrown into confusion and be robbed of
its flower of modesty by the torrent of their words…since, I say this is so, the evil is intolerable
and not to be borne, and our Great Mystery is in danger of being made a thing of little mo-

he was never a literal disciple of any of them); and their teacher as having taught such Successors of the Apostles

ment. Well then, let these spies3388 bear with us, moved as we are with fatherly compassion,
and as holy Jeremiah says, torn in our hearts;3389 let them bear with us so far as not to give
a savage reception to our discourse upon this subject; and let them, if indeed they can, restrain
their tongues for a short while and lend us their ears. However that may be, you shall at
any rate suffer no loss. For either we shall have spoken in the ears of them that will hear,3390
and our words will bear some fruit, namely an advantage to you (since the Sower soweth
the Word3391 upon every kind of mind; and the good and fertile bears fruit), or else you
will depart despising this discourse of ours as you have despised others, and having drawn
from it further material for gainsaying and railing at us, upon which to feast yourselves yet
more.</p>
<p>And you must not be astonished if I speak a language which is strange to you and contrary
to your custom, who profess to know everything and to teach everything in a too impetuous
and generous manner…not to pain you by saying ignorant and rash.</p>
<p>III. Not to every one, my friends, does it belong to philosophize about God; not to every
one; the Subject is not so cheap and low; and I will add, not before every audience, nor at
all times, nor on all points; but on certain occasions, and before certain persons, and within
certain limits.</p>
<p>Not to all men, because it is permitted only to those who have been examined, and are
passed masters in meditation, and who have been previously purified in soul and body, or
at the very least are being purified. For the impure to touch the pure is, we may safely say,
not safe, just as it is unsafe to fix weak eyes upon the sun’s rays. And what is the permitted
occasion? It is when we are free from all external defilement or disturbance, and when that
which rules within us is not confused with vexatious or erring images; like persons mixing
up good writing with bad, or filth with the sweet odours of unguents. For it is necessary to
be truly at leisure to know God; and when we can get a convenient season, to discern the
straight road of the things divine. And who are the permitted persons? They to whom the
subject is of real concern, and not they who make it a matter of pleasant gossip, like any
other thing, after the races, or the theatre, or a concert, or a dinner, or still lower employments.
To such men as these, idle jests and pretty contradictions about these subjects are
a part of their amusement.</p>
<p>IV. Next, on what subjects and to what extent may we philosophize? On matters
within our reach, and to such an extent as the mental power and grasp of our audience may

extend. No further, lest, as excessively loud sounds injure the hearing, or excess of food the
body, or, if you will, as excessive burdens beyond the strength injure those who bear them,
or excessive rains the earth; so these too, being pressed down and overweighted by the
stiffness, if I may use the expression, of the arguments should suffer loss even in respect of
the strength they originally possessed.3392</p>
<p>V. Now, I am not saying that it is not needful to remember God at all times;…I must
not be misunderstood, or I shall be having these nimble and quick people down upon me
again. For we ought to think of God even more often than we draw our breath; and if the
expression is permissible, we ought to do nothing else. Yea, I am one of those who entirely
approve that Word which bids us meditate day and night,3393 and tell at eventide and
morning and noon day,3394 and praise the Lord at every time;3395 or, to use Moses’ words,
whether a man lie down, or rise up, or walk by the way, or whatever else he be doing3396—and
by this recollection we are to be moulded to purity. So that it is not the continual remembrance
of God that I would hinder, but only the talking about God; nor even that as in itself
wrong, but only when unseasonable; nor all teaching, but only want of moderation. As of
even honey repletion and satiety, though it be of honey, produce vomiting;3397 and, as Solomon
says and I think, there is a time for every thing,3398 and that which is good ceases to
be good if it be not done in a good way; just as a flower is quite out of season in winter, and
just as a man’s dress does not become a woman, nor a woman’s a man; and as geometry is
out of place in mourning, or tears at a carousal; shall we in this instance alone disregard the
proper time, in a matter in which most of all due season should be respected? Surely not,
my friends and brethren (for I will still call you Brethren, though you do not behave like
brothers). Let us not think so nor yet, like hot tempered and hard mouthed horses, throwing
off our rider Reason, and casting away Reverence, that keeps us within due limits, run far
away from the turning point,3399 but let us philosophize within our proper bounds, and not

be carried away into Egypt, nor be swept down into Assyria3400, nor sing the Lord’s song
in a strange land, by which I mean before any kind of audience, strangers or kindred, hostile
or friendly, kindly or the reverse, who watch what we do with over great care, and would
like the spark of what is wrong in us to become a flame, and secretly kindle and fan it and
raise it to heaven with their breath and make it higher than the Babylonian flame which
burnt up every thing around it. For since their strength lies not in their own dogmas, they
hunt for it in our weak points. And therefore they apply themselves to our—shall I say
“misfortunes” or “failings”?—like flies to wounds. But let us at least be no longer ignorant
of ourselves, or pay too little attention to the due order in these matters. And if it be impossible
to put an end to the existing hostility, let us at least agree upon this, that we will
utter Mysteries under our breath, and holy things in a holy manner, and we will not cast to
ears profane that which may not be uttered, nor give evidence that we possess less gravity
than those who worship demons, and serve shameful fables and deeds; for they would
sooner give their blood to the uninitiated than certain words. But let us recognize that as
in dress and diet and laughter and demeanour there is a certain decorum, so there is also
in speech and silence; since among so many titles and powers of God, we pay the highest
honour to The Word. Let even our disputings then be kept within bounds.</p>
<p>VI. Why should a man who is a hostile listener to such words be allowed to hear about
the Generation of God, or his creation, or how God was made out of things which had no
existence, or of section and analysis and division?3401 Why do we make our accusers judges?
Why do we put swords into the hands of our enemies? How, thinkest thou, or with what
temper, will the arguments about such subjects be received by one who approves of adulteries,
and corruption of children, and who worships the passions and cannot conceive of aught
higher than the body<gap reason="omitted"/>who till very lately set up gods for himself, and gods too who were
noted for the vilest deeds? Will it not first be from a material standpoint, shamefully and
ignorantly, and in the sense to which he has been accustomed? Will he not make thy
Theology a defence for his own gods and passions? For if we ourselves wantonly misuse
these words,3402 it will be a long time before we shall persuade them to accept our philosophy.
And if they are in their own persons inventors of evil things, how should they refrain
from grasping at such things when offered to them? Such results come to us from mutual

contest. Such results follow to those who fight for the Word beyond what the Word approves;
they are behaving like mad people, who set their own house on fire, or tear their own children,
or disavow their own parents, taking them for strangers.</p>
<p>VII. But when we have put away from the conversation those who are strangers to it,
and sent the great legion3403 on its way to the abyss into the herd of swine, the next thing
is to look to ourselves, and polish our theological self to beauty like a statue. The first point
to be considered is—What is this great rivalry of speech and endless talking? What is this
new disease of insatiability? Why have we tied our hands and armed our tongues? We do
not praise either hospitality, or brotherly love, or conjugal affection, or virginity; nor do we
admire liberality to the poor, or the chanting of Psalms, or nightlong vigils,3404 or tears.
We do not keep under the body by fasting, or go forth to God by prayer; nor do we subject
the worse to the better—I mean the dust to the spirit—as they would do who form a just
judgment of our composite nature; we do not make our life a preparation for death; nor do
we make ourselves masters of our passions, mindful of our heavenly nobility; nor tame our
anger when it swells and rages, nor our pride that bringeth to a fall, nor unreasonable grief,
nor unchastened pleasure, nor meretricious laughter, nor undisciplined eyes, nor insatiable
ears, nor excessive talk, nor absurd thoughts, nor aught of the occasions which the Evil One
gets against us from sources within ourselves; bringing upon us the death that comes through
the windows,3405 as Holy Scripture saith; that is, through the senses. Nay we do the very
opposite, and have given liberty to the passions of others, as kings give releases from service
in honour of a victory, only on condition that they incline to our side, and make their assault
upon God more boldly, or more impiously. And we give them an evil reward for a thing
which is not good, license of tongue for their impiety.</p>
<p>VIII. And yet, O talkative Dialectician, I will ask thee one small question,3406 and answer
thou me, as He saith to Job, Who through whirlwind and cloud giveth Divine admonitions.
3407 Are there many mansions in God’s House, as thou hast heard, or only one? Of
course you will admit that there are many, and not only one. Now, are they all to be filled,
or only some, and others not; so that some will be left empty, and will have been prepared
to no purpose? Of course all will be filled, for nothing can be in vain which has been done
by God. And can you tell me what you will consider this Mansion to be? Is it the rest and
glory which is in store There for the Blessed, or something else?—No, not anything else.

<pb n="583"/>
Since then we are agreed upon this point, let us further examine another also. Is there any
thing that procures these Mansions, as I think there is; or is there nothing?—Certainly there
is—What is it? Is it not that there are various modes of conduct, and various purposes, one
leading one way, another another way, according to the proportion of faith, and these we
call Ways? Must we, then, travel all, or some of these Ways<gap reason=" omitted"/>the same individual along
them all, if that be possible; or, if not, along as many as may be; or else along some of them?
And even if this may not be, it would still be a great thing, at least as it appears to me, to
travel excellently along even one.—“You are right in your conception.”—What then when
you hear there is but One way, and that a narrow one,3408 does the word seem to you to
shew? That there is but one on account of its excellence. For it is but one, even though it
be split into many parts. And narrow because of its difficulties, and because it is trodden
by few in comparison with the multitude of the adversaries, and of those who travel along
the road of wickedness. “So I think too.” Well, then, my good friend, since this is so, why
do you, as though condemning our doctrine for a certain poverty, rush headlong down that
one which leads through what you call arguments and speculations, but I frivolities and
quackeries? Let Paul reprove you with those bitter reproaches, in which, after his list of the
Gifts of Grace, he says, Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? etc.3409</p>
<p>IX. But, be it so. Lofty thou art, even beyond the lofty, even above the clouds, if thou
wilt, a spectator of things invisible, a hearer of things unspeakable; one who hast ascended
after Elias, and who after Moses hast been deemed worthy of the Vision of God, and after
Paul hast been taken up into heaven; why dost thou mould the rest of thy fellows in one day
into Saints, and ordain them Theologians, and as it were breathe into them instruction, and
make them many councils of ignorant oracles? Why dost thou entangle those who are
weaker in thy spider’s web, if it were something great and wise? Why dost thou stir up
wasps’ nests against the Faith? Why dost thou suddenly spring a flood of dialectics upon
us, as the fables of old did the Giants? Why hast thou collected all that is frivolous and unmanly
among men, like a rabble, into one torrent, and having made them more effeminate
by flattery, fashioned a new workshop, cleverly making a harvest for thyself out of their want
of understanding? Dost thou deny that this is so, and are the other matters of no account
to thee? Must thy tongue rule at any cost, and canst thou not restrain the birthpang of thy
speech? Thou mayest find many other honourable subjects for discussion. To these turn
this disease of thine with some advantage. Attack the silence of Pythagoras,3410 and the

about reward, or the Sufferings of Christ. For in these subjects to hit the mark is not useless,

<head>Oration XXVIII.</head>
<p>The Second Theological Oration.</p>
<p>I. In the former Discourse we laid down clearly with respect to the Theologian, both
what sort of character he ought to bear, and on what kind of subject he may philosophize,
and when, and to what extent. We saw that he ought to be, as far as may be, pure, in order
that light may be apprehended by light; and that he ought to consort with serious men, in
order that his word be not fruitless through falling on an unfruitful soil; and that the suitable
season is when we have a calm within from the whirl of outward things; so as not like
madmen3415 to lose our breath; and that the extent to which we may go is that to which we
have ourselves advanced, or to which we are advancing. Since then these things are so, and
we have broken up for ourselves the fallows of Divinity3416, so as not to sow upon thorns,3417
and have made plain the face of the ground,3418 being moulded and moulding others by
Holy Scripture…let us now enter upon Theological questions, setting at the head thereof
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, of Whom we are to treat; that the Father may be
well pleased, and the Son may help us, and the Holy Ghost may inspire us; or rather that
one illumination may come upon us from the One God, One in diversity, diverse in Unity,
wherein is a marvel.</p>
<p>II. Now when I go up eagerly into the Mount3419—or, to use a truer expression, when
I both eagerly long, and at the same time am afraid (the one through my hope and the other
through my weakness) to enter within the Cloud, and hold converse with God, for so God
commands; if any be an Aaron, let him go up with me, and let him stand near, being ready,
if it must be so, to remain outside the Cloud. But if any be a Nadad or an Abihu, or of the
Order of the Elders, let him go up indeed, but let him stand afar off, according to the value
of his purification. But if any be of the multitude, who are unworthy of this height of contemplation,
if he be altogether impure let him not approach at all,3420 for it would be dangerous
to him; but if he be at least temporarily purified, let him remain below and listen to
the Voice alone, and the trumpet,3421 the bare words of piety, and let him see the Mountain
smoking and lightening, a terror at once and a marvel to those who cannot get up. But if
any is an evil and savage beast, and altogether incapable of taking in the subject matter of

Contemplation and Theology, let him not hurtfully and malignantly lurk in his den among
the woods, to catch hold of some dogma or saying by a sudden spring, and to tear sound
doctrine to pieces by his misrepresentations, but let him stand yet afar off and withdraw
from the Mount, or he shall be stoned and crushed, and shall perish miserably in his
wickedness. For to those who are like wild beasts true and sound discourses are stones. If
he be a leopard let him die with his spots.3422 If a ravening and roaring lion, seeking what
he may devour3423 of our souls or of our words; or a wild boar, trampling under foot the
precious and translucent pearls of the Truth;3424 or an Arabian3425 and alien wolf, or one
keener even than these in tricks of argument; or a fox, that is a treacherous and faithless
soul, changing its shape according to circumstances or necessities, feeding on dead or putrid
bodies, or on little vineyards3426 when the large ones have escaped them; or any other carnivorous
beast, rejected by the Law as unclean for food or enjoyment; our discourse must
withdraw from such and be engraved on solid tables of stone, and that on both sides because
the Law is partly visible, and partly hidden; the one part belonging to the mass who remain
below, the other to the few who press upward into the Mount.</p>
<p>III. What is this that has happened to me, O friends, and initiates, and fellow-lovers of
the truth? I was running to lay hold on God, and thus I went up into the Mount, and drew
aside the curtain of the Cloud, and entered away from matter and material things, and as
far as I could I withdrew within myself. And then when I looked up, I scarce saw the back
parts of God;3427 although I was sheltered by the Rock, the Word that was made flesh for
us. And when I looked a little closer, I saw, not the First and unmingled Nature, known to
Itself—to the Trinity, I mean; not That which abideth within the first3428 veil, and is hidden
by the Cherubim; but only that Nature, which at last even reaches to us. And that is, as far
as I can learn, the Majesty, or as holy David calls it, the Glory3429 which is manifested among
the creatures, which It has produced and governs. For these are the Back Parts of God,
which He leaves behind Him, as tokens of Himself3430 like the shadows and reflection of

the sun in the water, which shew the sun to our weak eyes, because we cannot look at the
sun himself, for by his unmixed light he is too strong for our power of perception. In this
way then shalt thou discourse of God; even wert thou a Moses and a god to Pharaoh;3431
even wert thou caught up like Paul to the Third Heaven,3432 and hadst heard unspeakable
words; even wert thou raised above them both, and exalted to Angelic or Archangelic place
and dignity. For though a thing be all heavenly, or above heaven, and far higher in nature
and nearer to God than we, yet it is farther distant from God, and from the complete comprehension
of His Nature, than it is lifted above our complex and lowly and earthward
sinking composition.</p>
<p>IV. Therefore we must begin again thus. It is difficult to conceive God but to define
Him in words is an impossibility, as one of the Greek teachers of Divinity3433 taught, not
unskilfully, as it appears to me; with the intention that he might be thought to have apprehended
Him; in that he says it is a hard thing to do; and yet may escape being convicted of
ignorance because of the impossibility of giving expression to the apprehension. But in my
opinion it is impossible to express Him, and yet more impossible to conceive Him. For that
which may be conceived may perhaps be made clear by language, if not fairly well, at any
rate imperfectly, to any one who is not quite deprived of his hearing, or slothful of understanding.
But to comprehend the whole of so great a Subject as this is quite impossible and
impracticable, not merely to the utterly careless and ignorant, but even to those who are
highly exalted, and who love God, and in like manner to every created nature; seeing that
the darkness of this world and the thick covering of the flesh is an obstacle to the full understanding
of the truth. I do not know whether it is the same with the higher natures and
purer Intelligences3434 which because of their nearness to God, and because they are illumined
with all His Light, may possibly see, if not the whole, at any rate more perfectly
and distinctly than we do; some perhaps more, some less than others, in proportion to their
rank.</p>
<p>V. But enough has been said on this point. As to what concerns us, it is not only the
Peace of God3435 which passeth all understanding and knowledge, nor only the things which

Essence not by nature but by grace: but yet (Ib. qu. lvi. 3) that they have by nature a certain cognition of Him,
as represented and as it were mirrored in their own essence; though not the actual vision of His Essence. The
Angel, he says again (Ib. qu. lxiv. 1) has a higher cognition of God than man has, on account of the perfection
of his intellect; and this cognition remains even in the fallen Angels.</note>

God hath stored up in promise for the righteous, which “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
nor mind conceived”3436 except in a very small degree, nor the accurate knowledge of the
Creation. For even of this I would have you know that you have only a shadow when you
hear the words, “I will consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the
stars,”3437 and the settled order therein; not as if he were considering them now, but as
destined to do so hereafter. But far before them is That nature Which is above them, and
out of which they spring, the Incomprehensible and Illimitable—not, I mean, as to the fact
of His being, but as to Its nature. For our preaching is not empty, nor our Faith vain,3438
nor is this the doctrine we proclaim; for we would not have you take our candid statement
as a starting point for a quibbling denial of God, or of arrogance on account of our confession
of ignorance. For it is one thing to be persuaded of the existence of a thing, and quite another
to know what it is.</p>
<p>VI. Now our very eyes and the Law of Nature teach us that God exists and that He is
the Efficient and Maintaining Cause of all things: our eyes, because they fall on visible objects,
and see them in beautiful stability and progress, immovably moving and revolving if I may
so say; natural Law, because through these visible things and their order, it reasons back to
their Author. For how could this Universe have come into being or been put together, unless
God had called it into existence, and held it together? For every one who sees a beautifully
made lute, and considers the skill with which it has been fitted together and arranged, or
who hears its melody, would think of none but the lutemaker, or the luteplayer, and would
recur to him in mind, though he might not know him by sight. And thus to us also is
manifested That which made and moves and preserves all created things, even though He
be not comprehended by the mind. And very wanting in sense is he who will not willingly
go thus far in following natural proofs; but not even this which we have fancied or formed,
or which reason has sketched for us, proves the existence of a God. But if any one has got
even to some extent a comprehension of this, how is God’s Being to be demonstrated? Who
ever reached this extremity of wisdom? Who was ever deemed worthy of so great a gift?
Who has opened the mouth of his mind and drawn in the Spirit,3439 so as by Him that
searcheth all things, yea the deep thing of God,3440 to take in God, and no longer to need
progress, since he already possesses the Extreme Object of desire, and That to which all the
social life and all the intelligence of the best men press forward?</p>

<p>VII. For what will you conceive the Deity to be, if you rely upon all the approximations
of reason? Or to what will reason carry you, O most philosophic of men and best of Theologians,
who boast of your familiarity with the Unlimited? Is He a body? How then is He
the Infinite and Limitless, and formless, and intangible, and invisible? or are these attributes
of a body? What arrogance for such is not the nature of a body! Or will you say that He
has a body, but not these attributes? O stupidity, that a Deity should possess nothing more
than we do. For how is He an object of worship if He be circumscribed? Or how shall He
escape being made of elements, and therefore subject to be resolved into them again, or
even altogether dissolved? For every compound is a starting point of strife, and strife of
separation, and separation of dissolution. But dissolution is altogether foreign to God and
to the First Nature. Therefore there can be no separation, that there may be no dissolution,
and no strife that there may be no separation, and no composition that there may be no
strife. Thus also there must be no body, that there may be no composition, and so the argument
is established by going back from last to first.</p>
<p>VIII. And how shall we preserve the truth that God pervades all things and fills all, as
it is written “Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord,”3441 and “The Spirit of the Lord
filleth the world,”3442 if God partly contains and partly is contained? For either He will
occupy an empty Universe, and so all things will have vanished for us, with this result, that
we shall have insulted God by making Him a body, and by robbing Him of all things which
He has made; or else He will be a body contained in other bodies, which is impossible; or
He will be enfolded in them, or contrasted with them, as liquids are mixed, and one divides
and is divided by another;—a view which is more absurd and anile than even the atoms of
Epicurus3443 and so this argument concerning the body will fall through, and have no body
and no solid basis at all. But if we are to assert that He is immaterial (as for example that
Fifth Element which some3444 have imagined), and that He is carried round in the circular
movement<gap reason="omitted"/>let us assume that He is immaterial, and that He is the Fifth Element; and, if
they please, let Him be also bodiless in accordance with the independent drift and arrangement
of their argument; for I will not at present differ with them on this point; in what respect
then will He be one of those things which are in movement and agitation, to say nothing of
the insult involved in making the Creator subject to the same movement as the creatures,
and Him That carries all (if they will allow even this) one with those whom He carries.

<note type="footnote">3442 Wisd. i. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">3443 Epicurus taught that Matter is eternal, and consists of an indefinite number of Atoms or indivisible
units, floating about in space, and mutually attracting and repelling each other; and that all that exists is due to
some chance meeting and coalition of these atoms.</note>
<note type="footnote">3444 This is a speculation of Aristotle, who imagined a Fifth Element, consisting of formless matter.</note>

<pb n="590"/>
Again, what is the force that moves your Fifth Element, and what is it that moves all things,
and what moves that, and what is the force that moves that? And so on ad infinitum. And
how can He help being altogether contained in space if He be subject to motion? But if they
assert that He is something other than this Fifth Element; suppose it is an angelic nature
that they attribute to Him, how will they shew that Angels are corporeal, or what sort of
bodies they have? And how far in that case could God, to Whom the Angels minister, be
superior to the Angels? And if He is above them, there is again brought in an irrational
swarm of bodies, and a depth of nonsense, that has no possible basis to stand upon.</p>
<p>IX. And thus we see that God is not a body. For no inspired teacher has yet asserted
or admitted such a notion, nor has the sentence of our own Court allowed it. Nothing then
remains but to conceive of Him as incorporeal. But this term Incorporeal, though granted,
does not yet set before us—or contain within itself His Essence, any more than Unbegotten,
or Unoriginate, or Unchanging, or Incorruptible, or any other predicate which is used
concerning God or in reference to Him. For what effect is produced upon His Being or
Substance3445 by His having no beginning, and being incapable of change or limitation?
Nay, the whole question of His Being is still left for the further consideration and exposition
of him who truly has the mind of God and is advanced in contemplation. For just as to say
“It is a body,” or “It was begotten,” is not sufficient to present clearly to the mind the various
objects of which these predicates are used, but you must also express the subject of which
you use them, if you would present the object of your thought clearly and adequately (for
every one of these predicates, corporeal, begotten, mortal, may be used of a man, or a cow,
or a horse). Just so he who is eagerly pursuing the nature of the Self-existent will not stop
at saying what He is not, but must go on beyond what He is not, and say what He is; inasmuch
as it is easier to take in some single point than to go on disowning point after point in endless
detail, in order, both by the elimination of negatives and the assertion of positives to arrive
at a comprehension of this subject.</p>
<p>But a man who states what God is not without going on to say what He is, acts much
in the same way as one would who when asked how many twice five make, should answer,
“Not two, nor three, nor four, nor five, nor twenty, nor thirty, nor in short any number below
ten, nor any multiple of ten;” but would not answer “ten,” nor settle the mind of his questioner
upon the firm ground of the answer. For it is much easier, and more concise to shew
what a thing is not from what it is, than to demonstrate what it is by stripping it of what it
is not. And this surely is evident to every one.</p>
<note type="footnote">3445 Petavius (De Trin. IV. ii. 7) notes that ὑπόστασις seems used here of the Essence and Nature common
to the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity.</note>

<pb n="591"/>
<p>X. Now since we have ascertained that God is incorporeal, let us proceed a little further
with our examination. Is He Nowhere or Somewhere. For if He is Nowhere,3446 then some
person of a very inquiring turn of mind might ask, How is it then that He can even exist?
For if the non-existent is nowhere, then that which is nowhere is also perhaps non-existent.
But if He is Somewhere, He must be either in the Universe, or above the Universe. And if
He is in the Universe, then He must be either in some part or in the whole. If in some part,
then He will be circumscribed by that part which is less than Himself; but if everywhere,
then by one which is further and greater—I mean the Universal, which contains the Particular;
if the Universe is to be contained by the Universe, and no place is to be free from circumscription.
This follows if He is contained in the Universe. And besides, where was He
before the Universe was created, for this is a point of no little difficulty. But if He is above
the Universe, is there nothing to distinguish this from the Universe, and where is this above
situated? And how could this Transcendence and that which is transcended be distinguished
in thought, if there is not a limit to divide and define them? Is it not necessary that there
shall be some mean to mark off the Universe from that which is above the Universe? And
what could this be but Place, which we have already rejected? For I have not yet brought
forward the point that God would be altogether circumscript, if He were even comprehensible
in thought: for comprehension is one form of circumscription.</p>
<p>XI. Now, why have I gone into all this, perhaps too minutely for most people to listen
to, and in accordance with the present manner of discourse, which despises noble simplicity,
and has introduced a crooked and intricate3447 style? That the tree may be known by its
fruits;3448 I mean, that the darkness which is at work in such teaching may be known by
the obscurity of the arguments. For my purpose in doing so was, not to get credit for myself
for astonishing utterances, or excessive wisdom, through tying knots and solving difficulties
(this was the great miraculous gift of Daniel),3449 but to make clear the point at which my
argument has aimed from the first. And what was this? That the Divine Nature cannot be
apprehended by human reason, and that we cannot even represent to ourselves all its
greatness. And this not out of envy, for envy is far from the Divine Nature, which is passionless,
and only good and Lord of all;3450 especially envy of that which is the most honour-
<note type="footnote">3446 Nowhere is in this passage used in an ambiguous sense. As asserted of God, it means that His being is
in no way limited by place: not that He has no existence in place, for He is everywhere, and He transcends all
place. Before the creation of the Universe He existed, and He created Place, which therefore cannot be the seat
of His Being.

able3451 of all His creatures. For what does the Word prefer to the rational and speaking
creatures? Why, even their very existence is a proof of His supreme goodness. Nor yet is
this incomprehensibility for the sake of His own glory and honour, Who is full,3452 as if His
possession of His glory and majesty depended upon the impossibility of approaching Him.
For it is utterly sophistical and foreign to the character, I will not say of God, but of any
moderately good man, who has any right ideas about himself, to seek his own supremacy
by throwing a hindrance in the way of another.</p>
<p>XII. But whether there be other causes for it also, let them see who are nearer God, and
are eye witnesses and spectators of His unsearchable judgments;3453 if there are any who
are so eminent in virtue, and who walk in the paths of the Infinite, as the saying is. As far,
however, as we have attained, who measure with our little measure things hard to be understood,
perhaps one reason is to prevent us from too readily throwing away the possession
because it was so easily come by. For people cling tightly to that which they acquire with
labour; but that which they acquire easily they quickly throw away, because it can be easily
recovered. And so it is turned into a blessing, at least to all men who are sensible, that this
blessing is not too easy. Or perhaps it is in order that we may not share the fate of Lucifer,
who fell, and in consequence of receiving the full light make our necks stiff against the Lord
Almighty, and suffer a fall, of all things most pitiable, from the height we had attained. Or
perhaps it may be to give a greater reward hereafter for their labour and glorious life to those
who have here been purified, and have exercised long patience in respect of that which they
desired.</p>
<p>Therefore this darkness of the body has been placed between us and God, like the cloud
of old between the Egyptians and the Hebrews;3454 and this is perhaps what is meant by
“He made darkness His secret place,”3455 namely our dulness, through which few can see
even a little. But as to this point, let those discuss it whose business it is; and let them ascend
as far as possible in the examination. To us who are (as Jeremiah saith), “prisoners of the
earth,”3456 and covered with the denseness of carnal nature, this at all events is known, that
as it is impossible for a man to step over his own shadow, however fast he may move (for
the shadow will always move on as fast as it is being overtaken) or, as it is impossible for
the eye to draw near to visible objects apart from the intervening air and light, or for a fish
to glide about outside of the waters; so it is quite impracticable for those who are in the body

to be conversant with objects of pure thought apart altogether from bodily objects. For
something in our own environment is ever creeping in, even when the mind has most fully
detached itself from the visible, and collected itself, and is attempting to apply itself to those
invisible things which are akin to itself.</p>
<p>XIII. This will be made clear to you as follows:—Are not Spirit, and Fire, and Light,
Love, and Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Mind and Reason, and the like, the names of
the First Nature? What then? Can you conceive of Spirit apart from motion and diffusion;
or of Fire without its fuel and its upward motion, and its proper colour and form? Or of
Light unmingled with air, and loosed from that which is as it were its father and source?
And how do you conceive of a mind? Is it not that which is inherent in some person not
itself, and are not its movements thoughts, silent or uttered? And Reason…what else can
you think it than that which is either silent within ourselves, or else outpoured (for I shrink
from saying loosed)? And if you conceive of Wisdom, what is it but the habit of mind which
you know as such, and which is concerned with contemplations either divine or human?
And Justice and Love, are they not praiseworthy dispositions, the one opposed to injustice,
the other to hate, and at one time intensifying themselves, at another relaxed, now taking
possession of us, now leaving us alone, and in a word, making us what we are, and changing
us as colours do bodies? Or are we rather to leave all these things, and to look at the Deity
absolutely, as best we can, collecting a fragmentary perception of It from Its images? What
then is this subtile thing, which is of these, and yet is not these, or how can that Unity which
is in its Nature uncomposite and incomparable, still be all of these, and each one of them
perfectly? Thus our mind faints to transcend corporeal things, and to consort with the Incorporeal,
stripped of all clothing of corporeal ideas, as long as it has to look with its inherent
weakness at things above its strength. For every rational nature longs for God and for the
First Cause, but is unable to grasp Him, for the reasons I have mentioned. Faint therefore
with the desire, and as it were restive and impatient of the disability, it tries a second course,
either to look at visible things, and out of some of them to make a god…(a poor contrivance,
for in what respect and to what extent can that which is seen be higher and more godlike
than that which sees, that this should worship that?) or else through the beauty and order
of visible things to attain to that which is above sight; but not to suffer the loss of God
through the magnificence of visible things.</p>
<p>XIV. From this cause some have made a god of the Sun, others of the Moon, others of
the host of Stars, others of heaven itself with all its hosts, to which they have attributed the
guiding of the Universe, according to the quality or quantity of their movement. Others
again of the Elements, earth, air, water, fire, because of their useful nature, since without
them human life cannot possibly exist. Others again have worshipped any chance visible
objects, setting up the most beautiful of what they saw as their gods. And there are those
who worship pictures and images, at first indeed of their own ancestors—at least, this is the

<pb n="594"/>
case with the more affectionate and sensual—and honour the departed with memorials; and
afterwards even those of strangers are worshipped by men of a later generation separated
from them by a long interval; through ignorance of the First Nature, and following the traditional
honour as lawful and necessary; for usage when confirmed by time was held to be
Law. And I think that some who were courtiers of arbitrary power and extolled bodily
strength and admired beauty, made a god in time out of him whom they honoured, perhaps
getting hold of some fable to help on their imposture.</p>
<p>XV. And those of them who were most subject to passion deified their passions, or
honoured them among their gods; Anger and Blood-thirstiness, Lust and Drunkenness,
and every similar wickedness; and made out of this an ignoble and unjust excuse for their
own sins. And some they left on earth, and some they hid beneath the earth (this being the
only sign of wisdom about them), and some they raised to heaven.3457 O ridiculous distribution
of inheritance! Then they gave to each of these concepts the name of some god or
demon, by the authority and private judgment of their error, and set up statues whose
costliness is a snare, and thought to honour them with blood and the steam of sacrifices,
and sometimes even by most shameful actions, frenzies and manslaughter. For such honours
were the fitting due of such gods. And before now men have insulted themselves by worshipping
monsters, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things,3458 and of the very vilest
and most absurd, and have made an offering to them of the glory of God; so that it is not
easy to decide whether we ought most to despise the worshippers or the objects of their
worship. Probably the worshippers are far the most contemptible, for though they are of a
rational nature, and have received grace from God, they have set up the worse as the better.
And this was the trick of the Evil One, who abused good to an evil purpose, as in most of
his evil deeds. For he laid hold of their desire in its wandering in search of God, in order
to distort to himself3459 the power, and steal the desire, leading it by the hand, like a blind
man asking a road; and he hurled down and scattered some in one direction and some in
another, into one pit of death and destruction.</p>
<p>XVI. This was their course. But reason receiving us in our desire for God, and in our
sense of the impossibility of being without a leader and guide, and then making us apply
ourselves to things visible and meeting with the things which have been since the beginning,
doth not stay its course even here. For it was not the part of Wisdom to grant the sovereignty

to things which are, as observation tells us, of equal rank. By these then it leads to that which
is above these, and by which being is given to these. For what is it which ordered things in
heaven and things in earth, and those which pass through air, and those which live in water;
or rather the things which were before these, heaven and earth, air and water? Who mingled
these, and who distributed them? What is it that each has in common with the other, and
their mutual dependence and agreement? For I commend the man, though he was a heathen,
who said, What gave movement to these, and drives their ceaseless and unhindered motion?
Is it not the Artificer of them Who implanted reason in them all, in accordance with which
the Universe is moved and controlled? Is it not He who made them and brought them into
being? For we cannot attribute such a power to the Accidental. For, suppose that its existence
is accidental, to what will you let us ascribe its order? And if you like we will grant you this:
to what then will you ascribe its preservation and protection in accordance with the terms
of its first creation. Do these belong to the Accidental, or to something else? Surely not to
the Accidental. And what can this Something Else be but God? Thus reason that proceeds
from God, that is implanted in all from the beginning and is the first law in us, and is bound
up in all, leads us up to God through visible things. Let us begin again, and reason this out.</p>
<p>XVII. What God is in nature and essence, no man ever yet has discovered or can discover.
Whether it will ever be discovered is a question which he who will may examine and
decide. In my opinion it will be discovered when that within us which is godlike and divine,
I mean our mind and reason, shall have mingled with its Like, and the image shall have ascended
to the Archetype, of which it has now the desire. And this I think is the solution of
that vexed problem as to “We shall know even as we are known.”3460 But in our present
life all that comes to us is but a little effluence, and as it were a small effulgence from a great
Light. So that if anyone has known God, or has had the testimony of Scripture to his
knowledge of God, we are to understand such an one to have possessed a degree of knowledge
which gave him the appearance of being more fully enlightened than another who did not
enjoy the same degree of illumination; and this relative superiority is spoken of as if it were
absolute knowledge, not because it is really such, but by comparison with the power of that
other.</p>
<p>XVIII. Thus Enos “hoped to call upon the Name of the Lord.”3461 Hope was that for
which he is commended; and that, not that he should know God, but that he should call
upon him. And Enoch was translated,3462 but it is not yet clear whether it was because he

already comprehended the Divine Nature, or in order that he might comprehend it. And
Noah’s3463 glory was that he was pleasing to God; he who was entrusted with the saving of
the whole world from the waters, or rather of the Seeds of the world, escaped the Deluge in
a small Ark. And Abraham, great Patriarch though he was, was justified by faith,3464 and
offered a strange victim,3465 the type of the Great Sacrifice. Yet he saw not God as God, but
gave Him food as a man.3466 He was approved because he worshipped as far as he comprehended.
3467 And Jacob dreamed of a lofty ladder and stair of Angels, and in a mystery
anointed a pillar3468—perhaps to signify the Rock that was anointed for our sake—and gave
to a place the name of The House of God3469 in honour of Him whom he saw; and wrestled
with God in human form; whatever this wrestling of God with man may mean…possibly
it refers to the comparison of man’s virtue with God’s; and he bore on his body the marks
of the wrestling, setting forth the defeat of the created nature; and for a reward of his reverence
he received a change of his name; being named, instead of Jacob, Israel—that great
and honourable name. Yet neither he nor any one on his behalf, unto this day, of all the
Twelve Tribes who were his children, could boast that he comprehended the whole nature
or the pure sight of God.</p>
<p>XIX. To Elias neither the strong wind, nor the fire, nor the earthquake, as you learn
from the story,3470 but a light breeze adumbrated the Presence of God, and not even this
His Nature. And who was this Elias? The man whom a chariot of fire took up to heaven,
signifying the superhuman excellency of the righteous man. And are you not amazed at
Manoah the Judge of yore, and at Peter the disciple in later days; the one being unable to
endure the sight even of one in whom was a representation of God; and saying, “We are
undone, O wife, we have seen God;”3471 speaking as though even a vision of God could not

be grasped by human beings, let alone the Nature of God; and the other unable to endure
the Presence of Christ in his boat and therefore bidding Him depart;3472 and this though
Peter was more zealous than the others for the knowledge of Christ, and received a blessing
for this,3473 and was entrusted with the greatest gifts. What would you say of Isaiah or
Ezekiel, who was an eyewitness of very great mysteries, and of the other Prophets; for one
of these saw the Lord of Sabaoth sitting on the Throne of glory,3474 and encircled and praised
and hidden by the sixwinged Seraphim, and was himself purged by the live coal, and equipped
for his prophetic office. And the other describes the Cherubic Chariot3475 of God, and the
Throne upon them, and the Firmament over it, and Him that shewed Himself in the Firmament,
and Voices, and Forces, and Deeds.3476 And whether this was an appearance by
day, only visible to Saints, or an unerring vision of the night, or an impression on the mind
holding converse with the future as if it were the present; or some other ineffable form of
prophecy, I cannot say; the God of the Prophets knoweth, and they know who are thus inspired.
But neither these of whom I am speaking, nor any of their fellows ever stood before
the Council3477 and Essence of God, as it is written, or saw, or proclaimed the Nature of
God.</p>
<p>XX. If it had been permitted to Paul to utter what the Third Heaven3478 contained, and
his own advance, or ascension, or assumption thither, perhaps we should know something
more about God’s Nature, if this was the mystery of the rapture. But since it was ineffable,
we too will honour it by silence. Thus much we will hear Paul say about it, that we know
in part and we prophesy in part.3479 This and the like to this are the confessions of one who
is not rude in knowledge,3480 who threatens to give proof of Christ speaking in him, the

great doctor and champion of the truth. Wherefore he estimates all knowledge on earth
only as through a glass darkly,3481 as taking its stand upon little images of the truth. Now,
unless I appear to anyone too careful, and over anxious about the examination of this matter,
perhaps it was of this and nothing else that the Word Himself intimated that there were
things which could not now be borne, but which should be borne and cleared up hereafter,
3482 and which John the Forerunner of the Word and great Voice of the Truth declared
even the whole world could not contain.3483</p>
<p>XXI. The truth then, and the whole Word is full of difficulty and obscurity; and as it
were with a small instrument we are undertaking a great work, when with merely human
wisdom we pursue the knowledge of the Self-existent, and in company with, or not apart
from, the senses, by which we are borne hither and thither, and led into error, we apply
ourselves to the search after things which are only to be grasped by the mind, and we are
unable by meeting bare realities with bare intellect to approximate somewhat more closely
to the truth, and to mould the mind by its concepts.</p>
<p>Now the subject of God is more hard to come at,3484 in proportion as it is more perfect
than any other, and is open to more objections, and the solutions of them are more laborious.
For every objection, however small, stops and hinders the course of our argument, and cuts
off its further advance, just like men who suddenly check with the rein the horses in full
career, and turn them right round by the unexpected shock. Thus Solomon, who was the
wisest of all men,3485 whether before him or in his own time, to whom God gave breadth
of heart, and a flood of contemplation, more abundant than the sand, even he, the more he
entered into the depth, the more dizzy he became, and declared the furthest point of wisdom
to be the discovery of how very far off she was from him.3486 Paul also tries to arrive at, I
will not say the nature of God, for this he knew was utterly impossible, but only the judgments
of God; and since he finds no way out, and no halting place in the ascent, and moreover,
since the earnest searching of his mind after knowledge does not end in any definite conclusion,
because some fresh unattained point is being continually disclosed to him (O marvel,
that I have a like experience), he closes his discourse with astonishment, and calls this the
riches of God,3487 and the depth, and confesses the unsearchableness of the judgments of

God, in almost the very words of David, who at one time calls God’s judgments the great
deep whose foundations cannot be reached by measure or sense;3488 and at another says
that His knowledge of him and of his own constitution was marvellous,3489 and had attained
greater strength than was in his own power or grasp.</p>
<p>XXII. For if, he says, I leave everything else alone, and consider myself and the whole
nature and constitution of man, and how we are mingled, and what is our movement, and
how the mortal was compounded with the immortal, and how it is that I flow downwards,
and yet am borne upwards, and how the soul is circumscribed;3490 and how it gives life and
shares in feelings; and how the mind is at once circumscribed and unlimited,3491 abiding
in us and yet travelling over the Universe in swift motion and flow; how it is both received
and imparted by word, and passes through air, and enters with all things; how it shares in
sense, and enshrouds itself away from sense. And even before these questions—what was
our first moulding and composition in the workshop of nature, and what is our last formation
and completion? What is the desire for and imparting of nourishment, and who brought
us spontaneously to those first springs and sources of life? How is the body nourished by
food, and the soul by reason? What is the drawing of nature, and the mutual relation between
parents and children, that it should be held together by a spell of love? How is it that species
are permanent, and are different in their characteristics, although there are so many that
their individual marks cannot be described? How is it that the same animal is both mortal
and immortal3492, the one by decease, the other by coming into being? For one departs,
and another takes its place, just like the flow of a river, which is never still, yet ever constant.
And you might discuss many more points concerning men’s members and parts, and their
mutual adaptation both for use and beauty, and how some are connected and others disjoined,
some are more excellent and others less comely, some are united and others divided,
some contain and others are contained, according to the law and reason of Nature. Much
too might be said about voices and ears. How is it that the voice is carried by the vocal organs,
and received by the ears, and both are joined by the smiting and resounding of the medium
of the air? Much too of the eyes, which have an indescribable communion with visible objects,
and which are moved by the will alone, and that together, and are affected exactly as is the

mind. For with equal speed the mind is joined to the objects of thought, the eye to those of
sight. Much too concerning the other senses, not objects of the research of reason. And
much concerning our rest in sleep, and the figments of dreams, and of memory and remembrance;
of calculation, and anger, and desire; and in a word, all by which this little world
called Man is swayed.</p>
<p>XXIII. Shall I reckon up for you the differences of the other animals, both from us and
from each other,—differences of nature, and of production, and of nourishment, and of
region, and of temper, and as it were of social life? How is it that some are gregarious and
others solitary, some herbivorous and others carnivorous, some fierce and others tame,
some fond of man and domesticated, others untamable and free? And some we might call
bordering on reason and power of learning, while others are altogether destitute of reason,
and incapable of being taught. Some with fuller senses, others with less; some immovable,
and some with the power of walking, and some very swift, and some very slow; some surpassing
in size or beauty, or in one or other of these respects; others very small or very ugly,
or both; some strong, others weak, some apt at self-defence, others timid and crafty3493 and
others again are unguarded. Some are laborious and thrifty, others altogether idle and improvident.
And before we come to such points as these, how is it that some are crawling
things, and others upright; some attached to one spot, some amphibious; some delight in
beauty and others are unadorned; some are married and some single; some temperate and
others intemperate; some have numerous offspring and others not; some are long-lived and
others have but short lives? It would be a weary discourse to go through all the details.</p>
<p>XXIV. Look also at the fishy tribe gliding through the waters, and as it were flying
through the liquid element, and breathing its own air, but in danger when in contact with
ours, as we are in the waters; and mark their habits and dispositions, their intercourse and
their births, their size and their beauty, and their affection for places, and their wanderings,
and their assemblings and departings, and their properties which so nearly resemble those
of the animals that dwell on land; in some cases community, in others contrast of properties,
both in name and shape. And consider the tribes of birds, and their varieties of form and
colour, both of those which are voiceless and of songbirds. What is the reason of their
melody, and from whom came it? Who gave to the grasshopper the lute in his breast, and
the songs and chirruping on the branches, when they are moved by the sun to make their
midday music, and sing among the groves, and escort the wayfarer with their voices? Who
wove the song for the swan when he spreads his wings to the breezes, and makes melody of
their rustling? For I will not speak of the forced voices, and all the rest that art contrives
against the truth. Whence does the peacock, that boastful bird of Media, get his love of
<note type="footnote">3493 The Benedictines here insert Some well protected; but it is their own conjecture, and is not found in the
Manuscripts.</note>

<pb n="601"/>
beauty and of praise (for he is fully conscious of his own beauty), so that when he sees any
one approaching, or when, as they say, he would make a show before his hens, raising his
neck and spreading his tail in circle around him, glittering like gold and studded with stars,
he makes a spectacle of his beauty to his lovers with pompous strides? Now Holy Scripture
admires the cleverness in weaving even of women, saying, Who gave to woman skill in
weaving and cleverness in the art of embroidery?3494 This belongeth to a living creature
that hath reason, and exceedeth in wisdom and maketh way even as far as the things of
heaven.</p>
<p>XXV. But I would have you marvel at the natural knowledge even of irrational creatures,
and if you can, explain its cause. How is it that birds have for nests rocks and trees and
roofs, and adapt them both for safety and beauty, and suitably for the comfort of their
nurslings? Whence do bees and spiders get their love of work and art, by which the former
plan their honeycombs, and join them together by hexagonal and co-ordinate tubes, and
construct the foundation by means of a partition and an alternation of the angles with
straight lines; and this, as is the case, in such dusky hives and dark combs; and the latter
weave their intricate webs by such light and almost airy threads stretched in divers ways,
and this from almost invisible beginnings, to be at once a precious dwelling, and a trap for
weaker creatures with a view to enjoyment of food? What Euclid ever imitated these, while
pursuing philosophical enquiries with lines that have no real existence, and wearying himself
with demonstrations? From what Palamedes came the tactics, and, as the saying is, the
movements and configurations of cranes, and the systems of their movement in ranks and
their complicated flight? Who were their Phidiæ and Zeuxides, and who were the Parrhasii
and Aglaophons who knew how to draw and mould excessively beautiful things? What
harmonious Gnossian chorus of Dædalus, wrought for a girl3495 to the highest pitch of
beauty? What Cretan Labyrinth, hard to get through, hard to unravel, as the poets say, and
continually crossing itself through the tricks of its construction? I will not speak of the ants’
storehouses and storekeepers, and of their treasurings of wood in quantities corresponding
to the time for which it is wanted, and all the other details which we know are told of their
marches and leaders and their good order in their works.</p>
<p>XXVI. If this knowledge has come within your reach and you are familiar with these
branches of science, look at the differences of plants also, up to the artistic fashion of the
leaves, which is adapted both to give the utmost pleasure to the eye, and to be of the greatest
advantage to the fruit. Look too at the variety and lavish abundance of fruits, and most of
all at the wondrous beauty of such as are most necessary. And consider the power of roots,

and juices, and flowers, and odours, not only so very sweet, but also serviceable as medicines;
and the graces and qualities of colours; and again the costly value, and the brilliant transparency
of precious stones. Since nature has set before you all things as in an abundant banquet
free to all, both the necessaries and the luxuries of life, in order that, if nothing else, you
may at any rate know God by His benefits, and by your own sense of want be made wiser
than you were. Next, I pray you, traverse the length and breadth of earth, the common
mother of all, and the gulfs of the sea bound together with one another and with the land,
and the beautiful forests, and the rivers and springs abundant and perennial, not only of
waters cold and fit for drinking, and on the surface of the earth; but also such as running
beneath the earth, and flowing under caverns, are then forced out by a violent blast, and
repelled, and then filled with heat by this violence of strife and repulsion, burst out by little
and little wherever they get a chance, and hence supply our need of hot baths in many parts
of the earth, and in conjunction with the cold give us a healing which is without cost and
spontaneous. Tell me how and whence are these things? What is this great web unwrought
by art? These things are no less worthy of admiration, in respect of their mutual relations
than when considered separately.</p>
<p>How is it that the earth stands solid and unswerving? On what is it supported? What
is it that props it up, and on what does that rest? For indeed even reason has nothing to
lean upon, but only the Will of God. And how is it that part of it is drawn up into mountain
summits, and part laid down in plains, and this in various and differing ways? And because
the variations are individually small, it both supplies our needs more liberally, and is more
beautiful by its variety; part being distributed into habitations, and part left uninhabited,
namely all the great height of Mountains, and the various clefts of its coast line cut off from
it. Is not this the clearest proof of the majestic working of God?</p>
<p>XXVII. And with respect to the Sea even if I did not marvel at its greatness, yet I should
have marvelled at its gentleness, in that although loose it stands within its boundaries; and
if not at its gentleness, yet surely at its greatness; but since I marvel at both, I will praise the
Power that is in both. What collected it? What bounded it? How is it raised and lulled to
rest, as though respecting its neighbour earth? How, moreover, does it receive all the rivers,
and yet remain the same, through the very superabundance of its immensity, if that term
be permissible? How is the boundary of it, though it be an element of such magnitude, only
sand? Have your natural philosophers with their knowledge of useless details anything to
tell us, those men I mean who are really endeavouring to measure the sea with a wineglass,
and such mighty works by their own conceptions? Or shall I give the really scientific explanation
of it from Scripture concisely, and yet more satisfactorily and truly than by the longest
arguments? “He hath fenced the face of the water with His command.”3496 This is the chain
<note type="footnote">3496 Job xxvi. 10. LXX.</note>

<pb n="603"/>
of fluid nature. And how doth He bring upon it the Nautilus that inhabits the dry land (i.e.,
man) in a little vessel, and with a little breeze (dost thou not marvel at the sight of this,—is
not thy mind astonished?), that earth and sea may be bound together by needs and commerce,
and that things so widely separated by nature should be thus brought together into one for
man? What are the first fountains of springs? Seek, O man, if you can trace out or find any
of these things. And who was it who cleft the plains and the mountains for the rivers, and
gave them an unhindered course? And how comes the marvel on the other side, that the
Sea never overflows, nor the Rivers cease to flow? And what is the nourishing power of
water, and what the difference therein; for some things are irrigated from above, and others
drink from their roots, if I may luxuriate a little in my language when speaking of the luxuriant
gifts of God.</p>
<p>XXVIII. And now, leaving the earth and the things of earth, soar into the air on the
wings of thought, that our argument may advance in due path; and thence I will take you
up to heavenly things, and to heaven itself, and things which are above heaven; for to that
which is beyond my discourse hesitates to ascend, but still it shall ascend as far as may be.
Who poured forth the air, that great and abundant wealth, not measured to men by their
rank or fortunes; not restrained by boundaries; not divided out according to people’s ages;
but like the distribution of the Manna,3497 received in sufficiency, and valued for its equality
of distribution; the chariot of the winged creation; the seat of the winds; the moderator of
the seasons; the quickener of living things, or rather the preserver of natural life in the body;
in which bodies have their being, and by which we speak; in which is the light and all that
it shines upon, and the sight which flows through it? And mark, if you please, what follows.
I cannot give to the air the whole empire of all that is thought to belong to the air. What
are the storehouses of the winds?3498 What are the treasuries of the snow? Who, as Scripture

of rain, unless he govern the Universe by his own measures and balances? What scientific
laws, pray, can you lay down concerning thunder and lightning, O you who thunder from
the earth, and cannot shine with even little sparks of truth? To what vapours from earth
will you attribute the creation of cloud, or is it due to some thickening of the air, or pressure
or crash of clouds of excessive rarity, so as to make you think the pressure the cause of the
lightning, and the crash that which makes the thunder? Or what compression of wind
having no outlet will account to you for the lightning by its compression, and for the thunder
by its bursting out?</p>
<p>Now if you have in your thought passed through the air and all the things of air, reach
with me to heaven and the things of heaven. And let faith lead us rather than reason, if at
least you have learnt the feebleness of the latter in matters nearer to you, and have known
reason by knowing the things that are beyond reason, so as not to be altogether on the earth
or of the earth, because you are ignorant even of your ignorance.</p>
<p>XXIX. Who spread the sky around us, and set the stars in order? Or rather, first, can
you tell me, of your own knowledge of the things in heaven, what are the sky and the stars;
you who know not what lies at your very feet, and cannot even take the measure of yourself,
and yet must busy yourself about what is above your nature, and gape at the illimitable?
For, granted that you understand orbits and periods, and waxings and wanings, and settings
and risings, and some degrees and minutes, and all the other things which make you so
proud of your wonderful knowledge; you have not arrived at comprehension of the realities
themselves, but only at an observation of some movement, which, when confirmed by longer
practice, and drawing the observations of many individuals into one generalization, and
thence deducing a law, has acquired the name of Science (just as the lunar phenomena have
become generally known to our sight), being the basis of this knowledge. But if you are very
scientific on this subject, and have a just claim to admiration, tell me what is the cause of
this order and this movement. How came the sun to be a beacon-fire to the whole world,
and to all eyes like the leader of some chorus, concealing all the rest of the stars by his
brightness, more completely than some of them conceal others. The proof of this is that
they shine against him, but he outshines them and does not even allow it to be perceived
that they rose simultaneously with him, fair as a bridegroom, swift and great as a giant3501
for I will not let his praises be sung from any other source than my own Scriptures—so
mighty in strength that from one end to the other of the world he embraces all things in his
heat, and there is nothing hid from the feeling thereof, but it fills both every eye with light,
and every embodied creature with heat; warming, yet not burning, by the gentleness of its
temper, and the order of its movement, present to all, and equally embracing all.</p>

<p>XXX. Have you considered the importance of the fact that a heathen writer3502 speaks
of the sun as holding the same position among material objects as God does among objects
of thought? For the one gives light to the eyes, as the Other does to the mind; and is the
most beautiful of the objects of sight, as God is of those of thought. But who gave him motion
at first? And what is it which ever moves him in his circuit, though in his nature stable and
immovable, truly unwearied, and the giver and sustainer of life, and all the rest of the titles
which the poets justly sing of him, and never resting in his course or his benefits? How
comes he to be the creator of day when above the earth, and of night when below it? or
whatever may be the right expression when one contemplates the sun? What are the mutual
aggressions and concessions of day and night, and their regular irregularities—to use a
somewhat strange expression? How comes he to be the maker and divider of the seasons,
that come and depart in regular order, and as in a dance interweave with each other, or
stand apart by a law of love on the one hand, and of order on the other, and mingle little by
little, and steal on their neighbour, just as nights and days do, so as not to give us pain by
their suddenness. This will be enough about the sun.</p>
<p>Do you know the nature and phenomena of the Moon, and the measures and courses
of light, and how it is that the sun bears rule over the day, and the moon presides over the
night; and while She gives confidence to wild beasts, He stirs Man up to work, raising or
lowering himself as may be most serviceable? Know you the bond of Pleiades, or the fence
of Orion3503 as He who counteth the number of the stars and calleth them all by their
names?3504 Know you the differences of the glory3505 of each, and the order of their
movement, that I should trust you, when by them you weave the web of human concerns,
and arm the creature against the Creator?</p>
<p>XXXI. What say you? Shall we pause here, after discussing nothing further than matter
and visible things, or, since the Word knows the Tabernacle of Moses to be a figure of the
whole creation—I mean the entire system of things visible and invisible—shall we pass the
first veil, and stepping beyond the realm of sense, shall we look into the Holy Place, the Intellectual
and Celestial creation? But not even this can we see in an incorporeal way, though
it is incorporeal, since it is called—or is—Fire and Spirit. For He is said to make His Angels
spirits, and His Ministers a flame of fire3506<gap reason="omitted"/>though perhaps this “making” means preserving
by that Word by which they came into existence. The Angel then is called spirit and fire;
Spirit, as being a creature of the intellectual sphere; Fire, as being of a purifying nature; for

I know that the same names belong to the First Nature. But, relatively to us at least, we must
reckon the Angelic Nature incorporeal, or at any rate as nearly so as possible. Do you see
how we get dizzy over this subject, and cannot advance to any point, unless it be as far as
this, that we know there are Angels and Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Princedoms,
Powers, Splendours, Ascents, Intelligent Powers or Intelligencies, pure natures and unalloyed,
immovable to evil, or scarcely movable; ever circling in chorus round the First Cause (or
how should we sing their praises?) illuminated thence with the purest Illumination, or one
in one degree and one in another, proportionally to their nature and rank<gap reason="omitted"/>so conformed
to beauty and moulded that they become secondary Lights, and can enlighten others by the

contemplating the Eternal Glory, not that God may thereby gain an increase of glory, for
nothing can be added to that which is full—to Him, who supplies good to all outside Himself
but that there may never be a cessation of blessings to these first natures after God. If we
have told these things as they deserve, it is by the grace of the Trinity, and of the one Godhead
in Three Persons; but if less perfectly than we have desired, yet even so our discourse has
gained its purpose. For this is what we were labouring to shew, that even the secondary
natures surpass the power of our intellect; much more then the First and (for I fear to say
merely That which is above all), the only Nature.</p>

<p>I. This then is what might be said to cut short our opponents’ readiness to argue and
their hastiness with its consequent insecurity in all matters, but above all in those discussions
which relate to God. But since to rebuke others is a matter of no difficulty whatever, but a
very easy thing, which any one who likes can do; whereas to substitute one’s own belief for
theirs is the part of a pious and intelligent man; let us, relying on the Holy Ghost, Who
among them is dishonoured, but among us is adored, bring forth to the light our own conceptions
about the Godhead, whatever these may be, like some noble and timely birth. Not
that I have at other times been silent; for on this subject alone I am full of youthful strength
and daring; but the fact is that under present circumstances I am even more bold to declare
the truth, that I may not (to use the words of Scripture) by drawing back fall into the condemnation
of being displeasing to God.3507 And since every discourse is of a twofold nature,
the one part establishing one’s own, and the other overthrowing one’s opponents’ position;
let us first of all state our own position, and then try to controvert that of our opponents;—
and both as briefly as possible, so that our arguments may be taken in at a glance
(like those of the elementary treatises which they have devised to deceive simple or foolish
persons), and that our thoughts may not be scattered by reason of the length of the discourse,
like water which is not contained in a channel, but flows to waste over the open land.</p>
<p>II. The three most ancient opinions concerning God are Anarchia, Polyarchia, and
Monarchia. The first two are the sport of the children of Hellas, and may they continue to
be so. For Anarchy is a thing without order; and the Rule of Many is factious, and thus anarchical,
and thus disorderly. For both these tend to the same thing, namely disorder; and
this to dissolution, for disorder is the first step to dissolution.</p>
<p>But Monarchy is that which we hold in honour. It is, however, a Monarchy that is not
limited to one Person, for it is possible for Unity if at variance with itself to come into a
condition of plurality;3508 but one which is made of an equality of Nature and a Union of
mind, and an identity of motion, and a convergence of its elements to unity—a thing which
is impossible to the created nature—so that though numerically distinct there is no severance
of Essence. Therefore Unity3509 having from all eternity arrived by motion at Duality, found

<pb n="608"/>
its rest in Trinity. This is what we mean by Father and Son and Holy Ghost. The Father is
the Begetter and the Emitter;3510 without passion of course, and without reference to time,
and not in a corporeal manner. The Son is the Begotten, and the Holy Ghost the Emission;
for I know not how this could be expressed in terms altogether excluding visible things.
For we shall not venture to speak of “an overflow of goodness,” as one of the Greek Philosophers
dared to say, as if it were a bowl overflowing, and this in plain words in his Discourse
on the First and Second Causes.3511 Let us not ever look on this Generation as involuntary,
like some natural overflow, hard to be retained, and by no means befitting our conception
of Deity. Therefore let us confine ourselves within our limits, and speak of the Unbegotten
and the Begotten and That which proceeds from the Father, as somewhere God the Word
Himself saith.</p>
<p>III. When did these come into being? They are above all “When.” But, if I am to speak
with something more of boldness,—when the Father did. And when did the Father come
into being. There never was a time when He was not. And the same thing is true of the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Ask me again, and again I will answer you, When was the Son begotten?
When the Father was not begotten. And when did the Holy Ghost proceed? When the Son
was, not proceeding but, begotten—beyond the sphere of time, and above the grasp of
reason; although we cannot set forth that which is above time, if we avoid as we desire any
expression which conveys the idea of time. For such expressions as “when” and “before”
and “after” and “from the beginning” are not timeless, however much we may force them;
unless indeed we were to take the Æon, that interval which is coextensive with the eternal
things, and is not divided or measured by any motion, or by the revolution of the sun, as
time is measured.</p>
<p>How then are They not alike unoriginate, if They are coeternal? Because They are from
Him, though not after Him. For that which is unoriginate is eternal, but that which is
<note type="footnote">that the movement of self-consciousness in God from all Eternity made the Generation of the Son, and the
Procession of the Holy Ghost, a necessity. All is objective in God. cf. Petav. de Deo, II., viii., 16; also, Greg.

<note type="footnote">3510 προβολεὺς-προβολὴ was a term used by the Gnostics to describe the Emanations by which the distance
between the Finite and the Infinite was according to them bridged over; and on this account it fell under suspicion,
and was rejected by both Arius and Athanasius. Tertullian used it with an explanation which is satisfactory as
regards the προβολὴ of the Son; but when he comes to apply it to the Procession of the Holy Ghost he uses an
illustration which is in almost the very words rejected by Gregory (c. Prax., 7, 8. See Swete, p. 56). Origen did
not admit it. Later when this danger was past, the word came into use again as the equivalent of ἐκπόρευσις, at
first with reserve and explanations in the text, but later on as an accepted term. See Swete ,“On The Doctrine
Of The Holy Spirit,” p. 36.</note>

<pb n="609"/>
eternal is not necessarily unoriginate, so long as it may be referred to the Father as its origin.
Therefore in respect of Cause They are not unoriginate; but it is evident that the Cause is
not necessarily prior to its effects, for the sun is not prior to its light. And yet They are in
some sense unoriginate, in respect of time, even though you would scare simple minds with
your quibbles, for the Sources of Time are not subject to time.</p>
<p>IV. But how can this generation be passionless? In that it is incorporeal. For if corporeal
generation involves passion, incorporeal generation excludes it. And I will ask of you in
turn, How is He God if He is created? For that which is created is not God. I refrain from
reminding you that here too is passion if we take the creation in a bodily sense, as time, desire,
imagination, thought, hope, pain, risk, failure, success, all of which and more than all find
a place in the creature, as is evident to every one. Nay, I marvel that you do not venture so
far as to conceive of marriages and times of pregnancy, and dangers of miscarriage, as if the
Father could not have begotten at all if He had not begotten thus; or again, that you did not
count up the modes of generation of birds and beasts and fishes, and bring under some one
of them the Divine and Ineffable Generation, or even eliminate the Son out of your new
hypothesis. And you cannot even see this, that as His Generation according to the flesh
differs from all others (for where among men do you know of a Virgin Mother?), so does
He differ also in His spiritual Generation; or rather He, Whose Existence is not the same as
ours, differs from us also in His Generation.</p>
<p>V. Who then is that Father Who had no beginning? One Whose very Existence had
no beginning; for one whose existence had a beginning must also have begun to be a Father.
He did not then become a Father after He began to be, for His being had no beginning.
And He is Father in the absolute sense, for He is not also Son; just as the Son is Son in the
absolute sense, because He is not also Father. These names do not belong to us in the absolute
sense, because we are both, and not one more than the other; and we are of both, and not
of one only; and so we are divided, and by degrees become men, and perhaps not even men,
and such as we did not desire, leaving and being left, so that only the relations remain,
without the underlying facts.3512</p>
<p>But, the objector says, the very form of the expression “He begat” and “He was begotten,”
brings in the idea of a beginning of generation. But what if you do not use this expression,
but say, “He had been begotten from the beginning” so as readily to evade your far-fetched
and time-loving objections? Will you bring Scripture against us, as if we were forging
something contrary to Scripture and to the truth? Why, every one knows that in practice
we very often find tenses interchanged when time is spoken of; and especially is this the
custom of Holy Scripture, not only in respect of the past tense, and of the present; but even
<note type="footnote">3512 Elias explains this to refer to the fact that children leave and are left by parents; or else to the death of
either one or the other.</note>

<pb n="610"/>
of the future, as for instance “Why did the heathen rage?”3513 when they had not yet raged
and “they shall cross over the river on foot,”3514 where the meaning is they did cross over.
It would be a long task to reckon up all the expressions of this kind which students have
noticed.</p>
<p>VI. So much for this point. What is their next objection, how full of contentiousness
and impudence? He, they say, either voluntarily begat the Son, or else involuntarily. Next,
as they think, they bind us on both sides with cords; these however are not strong, but very
weak. For, they say, if it was involuntarily He was under the sway of some one, and who
exercised this sway? And how is He, over whom it is exercised, God? But if voluntarily, the
Son is a Son of Will; how then is He of the Father?—and they thus invent a new sort of
Mother for him,—the Will,—in place of the Father. There is one good point which they
may allege about this argument of theirs; namely, that they desert Passion, and take refuge
in Will. For Will is not Passion.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us look at the strength of their argument. And it were best to wrestle with
them at first at close quarters. You yourself, who so recklessly assert whatever takes your
fancy; were you begotten voluntarily or involuntarily by your father? If involuntarily, then
he was under some tyrant’s sway (O terrible violence!) and who was the tyrant? You will
hardly say it was nature,—for nature is tolerant of chastity. If it was voluntarily, then by a
few syllables your father is done away with, for you are shewn to be the son of Will, and not
of your father. But I pass to the relation between God and the creature, and I put your own
question to your own wisdom. Did God create all things voluntarily or under compulsion?
If under compulsion, here also is the tyranny, and one who played the tyrant; if voluntarily,
the creatures also are deprived of their God, and you before the rest, who invent such arguments
and tricks of logic. For a partition is set up between the Creator and the creatures in
the shape of Will. And yet I think that the Person who wills is distinct from the Act of
willing; He who begets from the Act of begetting; the Speaker from the speech, or else we
are all very stupid. On the one side we have the mover, and on the other that which is, so
to speak, the motion. Thus the thing willed is not the child of will, for it does not always
result therefrom; nor is that which is begotten the child of generation, nor that which is
heard the child of speech, but of the Person who willed, or begat, or spoke. But the things
of God are beyond all this, for with Him perhaps the Will to beget is generation, and there
is no intermediate action (if we may accept this altogether, and not rather consider generation
superior to will).</p>
<p>VII. Will you then let me play a little upon this word Father, for your example encourages
me to be so bold? The Father is God either willingly or unwillingly; and how will you
<note type="footnote">3513 Ps. ii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">3514 Ps. lxvi. 6.</note>

<pb n="611"/>
escape from your own excessive acuteness? If willingly, when did He begin to will? It could
not have been before He began to be, for there was nothing prior to Him. Or is one part of
Him Will and another the object of Will? If so, He is divisible. So the question arises, as
the result of your argument, whether He Himself is not the Child of Will. And if unwillingly,
what compelled Him to exist, and how is He God if He was compelled—and that to nothing
less than to be God? How then was He begotten, says my opponent. How was He created,
if as you say, He was created? For this is a part of the same difficulty. Perhaps you would
say, By Will and Word. You have not yet solved the whole difficulty; for it yet remains for
you to shew how Will and Word gained the power of action. For man was not created in
this way.</p>
<p>VIII. How then was He begotten? This Generation would have been no great thing, if
you could have comprehended it who have no real knowledge even of your own generation,
or at least who comprehend very little of it, and of that little you are ashamed to speak; and
then do you think you know the whole? You will have to undergo much labour before you
discover the laws of composition, formation, manifestation, and the bond whereby soul is
united to body,—mind to soul, and reason to mind; and movement, increase, assimilation
of food, sense, memory, recollection, and all the rest of the parts of which you are compounded;
and which of them belongs to the soul and body together, and which to each independently
of the other, and which is received from each other. For those parts whose maturity
comes later, yet received their laws at the time of conception. Tell me what these laws are?
And do not even then venture to speculate on the Generation of God; for that would be
unsafe. For even if you knew all about your own, yet you do not by any means know about
God’s. And if you do not understand your own, how can you know about God’s? For in
proportion as God is harder to trace out than man, so is the heavenly Generation harder to
comprehend than your own. But if you assert that because you cannot comprehend it,
therefore He cannot have been begotten, it will be time for you to strike out many existing
things which you cannot comprehend; and first of all God Himself. For you cannot say
what He is, even if you are very reckless, and excessively proud of your intelligence. First,
cast away your notions of flow and divisions and sections, and your conceptions of immaterial
as if it were material birth, and then you may perhaps worthily conceive of the Divine
Generation. How was He begotten?—I repeat the question in indignation. The Begetting
of God must be honoured by silence. It is a great thing for you to learn that He was begotten.
But the manner of His generation we will not admit that even Angels can conceive, much
less you. Shall I tell you how it was? It was in a manner known to the Father Who begat,
and to the Son Who was begotten. Anything more than this is hidden by a cloud, and escapes
your dim sight.</p>

<pb n="612"/>
<p>IX. Well, but the Father begat a Son who either was or was not in existence.3515 What
utter nonsense! This is a question which applies to you or me, who on the one hand were
in existence, as for instance Levi in the loins of Abraham;3516 and on the other hand came
into existence; and so in some sense we are partly of what existed, and partly of what was
nonexistent; whereas the contrary is the case with the original matter, which was certainly
created out of what was non-existent, notwithstanding that some pretend that it is unbegotten.
But in this case “to be begotten,” even from the beginning, is concurrent with “to be.”
On what then will you base this captious question? For what is older than that which is
from the beginning, if we may place there the previous existence or non-existence of the
Son? In either case we destroy its claim to be the Beginning. Or perhaps you will say, if we
were to ask you whether the Father was of existent or non-existent substance, that he is
twofold, partly pre-existing, partly existing; or that His case is the same with that of the Son;
that is, that He was created out of non-existing matter, because of your ridiculous questions
and your houses of sand, which cannot stand against the merest ripple.</p>
<p>I do not admit either solution, and I declare that your question contains an absurdity,
and not a difficulty to answer. If however you think, in accordance with your dialectic assumptions,
that one or other of these alternatives must necessarily be true in every case, let
me ask you one little question: Is time in time, or is it not in time? If it is contained in time,
then in what time, and what is it but that time, and how does it contain it? But if it is not
contained in time, what is that surpassing wisdom which can conceive of a time which is
timeless? Now, in regard to this expression, “I am now telling a lie,” admit one of these alternatives,
either that it is true, or that it is a falsehood, without qualification (for we cannot
admit that it is both). But this cannot be. For necessarily he either is lying, and so is telling
the truth, or else he is telling the truth, and so is lying. What wonder is it then that, as in
this case contraries are true, so in that case they should both be untrue, and so your clever
puzzle prove mere foolishness? Solve me one more riddle. Were you present at your own
generation, and are you now present to yourself, or is neither the case? If you were and are
present, who were you, and with whom are you present? And how did your single self become
thus both subject and object? But if neither of the above is the case, how did you get
separated from yourself, and what is the cause of this disjoining? But, you will say, it is
stupid to make a fuss about the question whether or no a single individual is present to
himself; for the expression is not used of oneself but of others. Well, you may be certain
that it is even more stupid to discuss the question whether That which was begotten from
the beginning existed before its generation or not. For such a question arises only as to
matter divisible by time.</p>
<note type="footnote">3515 This is the Arian dilemma, “Did the Son exist before he was begotten?”</note>
<note type="footnote">3516 Heb. vii. 10.</note>

<pb n="613"/>
<p>X. But they say, The Unbegotten and the Begotten are not the same; and if this is so,
neither is the Son the same as the Father. It is clear, without saying so, that this line of argument
manifestly excludes either the Son or the Father from the Godhead. For if to be Unbegotten
is the Essence of God, to be begotten is not that Essence; if the opposite is the case,
the Unbegotten is excluded. What argument can contradict this? Choose then whichever
blasphemy you prefer, my good inventor of a new theology, if indeed you are anxious at all
costs to embrace a blasphemy. In the next place, in what sense do you assert that the Unbegotten
and the Begotten are not the same? If you mean that the Uncreated and the created
are not the same, I agree with you; for certainly the Unoriginate and the created are not of
the same nature. But if you say that He That begat and That which is begotten are not the
same, the statement is inaccurate. For it is in fact a necessary truth that they are the same.
For the nature of the relation of Father to Child is this, that the offspring is of the same
nature with the parent. Or we may argue thus again. What do you mean by Unbegotten
and Begotten, for if you mean the simple fact of being unbegotten or begotten, these are not
the same; but if you mean Those to Whom these terms apply, how are They not the same?
For example, Wisdom and Unwisdom are not the same in themselves, but yet both are attributes
of man, who is the same; and they mark not a difference of essence, but one external
to the essence.3517 Are immortality and innocence and immutability also the essence of
God? If so God has many essences and not one; or Deity is a compound of these. For He
cannot be all these without composition, if they be essences.</p>
<p>XI. They do not however assert this, for these qualities are common also to other beings.
But God’s Essence is that which belongs to God alone, and is proper to Him. But they, who
consider matter and form to be unbegotten, would not allow that to be unbegotten is the
property of God alone (for we must cast away even further the darkness of the
Manichæans).3518 But suppose that it is the property of God alone. What of Adam? Was
he not alone the direct creature of God? Yes, you will say. Was he then the only human
being? By no means. And why, but because humanity does not consist in direct creation?
For that which is begotten is also human. Just so neither is He Who is Unbegotten alone
God, though He alone is Father. But grant that He Who is Begotten is God; for He is of
God, as you must allow, even though you cling to your Unbegotten. Then how do you describe
the Essence of God? Not by declaring what it is, but by rejecting what it is not. For
your word signifies that He is not begotten; it does not present to you what is the real nature
or condition of that which has no generation. What then is the Essence of God? It is for
your infatuation to define this, since you are so anxious about His Generation too; but to

us it will be a very great thing, if ever, even in the future, we learn this, when this darkness
and dulness is done away for us, as He has promised Who cannot lie. This then may be the
thought and hope of those who are purifying themselves with a view to this. Thus much
we for our part will be bold to say, that if it is a great thing for the Father to be Unoriginate,
it is no less a thing for the Son to have been Begotten of such a Father. For not only would
He share the glory of the Unoriginate, since he is of the Unoriginate, but he has the added
glory of His Generation, a thing so great and august in the eyes of all those who are not altogether
grovelling and material in mind.</p>
<p>XII. But, they say, if the Son is the Same as the Father in respect of Essence, then if the
Father is unbegotten, the Son must be so likewise. Quite so—if the Essence of God consists
in being unbegotten; and so He would be a strange mixture, begottenly unbegotten. If,
however, the difference is outside the Essence, how can you be so certain in speaking of
this? Are you also your father’s father, so as in no respect to fall short of your father, since
you are the same with him in essence? Is it not evident that our enquiry into the Nature of
the Essence of God, if we make it, will leave Personality absolutely unaffected? But that
Unbegotten is not a synonym of God is proved thus. If it were so, it would be necessary
that since God is a relative term, Unbegotten should be so likewise; or that since Unbegotten
is an absolute term, so must God be.<gap reason="omitted"/>God of no one. For words which are absolutely
identical are similarly applied. But the word Unbegotten is not used relatively. For to what
is it relative? And of what things is God the God? Why, of all things. How then can God
and Unbegotten be identical terms? And again, since Begotten and Unbegotten are contradictories,
like possession and deprivation, it would follow that contradictory essences would
co-exist, which is impossible.3519 Or again, since possessions are prior to deprivations, and
the latter are destructive of the former, not only must the Essence of the Son be prior to that
of the Father, but it must be destroyed by the Father, on your hypothesis.</p>
<p>XIII. What now remains of their invincible arguments? Perhaps the last they will take
refuge in is this. If God has never ceased to beget, the Generation is imperfect; and when
will He cease? But if He has ceased, then He must have begun. Thus again these carnal
minds bring forward carnal arguments. Whether He is eternally begotten or not, I do not
yet say, until I have looked into the statement, “Before all the hills He begetteth Me,”3520
more accurately. But I cannot see the necessity of their conclusion. For if, as they say,
everything that is to come to an end had also a beginning, then surely that which has no
end had no beginning. What then will they decide concerning the soul, or the Angelic
nature? If it had a beginning, it will also have an end; and if it has no end, it is evident that
according to them it had no beginning. But the truth is that it had a beginning, and will

<pb n="615"/>
never have an end. Their assertion, then, that which will have an end had also a beginning,
is untrue. Our position, however, is, that as in the case of a horse, or an ox, or a man, the
same definition applies to all the individuals of the same species, and whatever shares the
definition has also a right to the Name; so in the very same way there is One Essence of God,
and One Nature, and One Name; although in accordance with a distinction in our thoughts
we use distinct Names and that whatever is properly called by this Name really is God; and
what He is in Nature, That He is truly called—if at least we are to hold that Truth is a matter
not of names but of realities. But our opponents, as if they were afraid of leaving any stone
unturned to subvert the Truth, acknowledge indeed that the Son is God when they are
compelled to do so by arguments3521 and evidences; but they only mean that He is God in
an ambiguous sense, and that He only shares the Name.</p>
<p>XIV. And when we advance this objection against them, “What do you mean to say
then? That the Son is not properly God, just as a picture of an animal is not properly an
animal? And if not properly God, in what sense is He God at all?” They reply, Why should
not these terms be ambiguous, and in both cases be used in a proper sense? And they will
give us such instances as the land-dog and the dogfish; where the word Dog is ambiguous,
and yet in both cases is properly used, for there is such a species among the ambiguously
named, or any other case in which the same appellative is used for two things of different
nature. But, my good friend, in this case, when you include two natures under the same
name, you do not assert that either is better than the other, or that the one is prior and the
other posterior, or that one is in a greater degree and the other in a lesser that which is predicated
of them both, for there is no connecting link which forces this necessity upon them.
One is not a dog more than the other, and one less so; either the dogfish more than the landdog,
or the land-dog than the dogfish. Why should they be, or on what principle? But the
community of name is here between things of equal value, though of different nature. But
in the case of which we are speaking, you couple the Name of God with adorable Majesty,
and make It surpass every essence and nature (an attribute of God alone), and then you
ascribe this Name to the Father, while you deprive the Son of it, and make Him subject to
the Father, and give Him only a secondary honour and worship; and even if in words you
bestow on Him one which is Equal, yet in practice you cut off His Deity, and pass malignantly
from a use of the same Name implying an exact equality, to one which connects things
which are not equal. And so the pictured and the living man are in your mouth an apter
illustration of the relations of Deity than the dogs which I instanced. Or else you must
concede to both an equal dignity of nature as well as a common name—even though you
introduced these natures into your argument as different; and thus you destroy the analogy
<note type="footnote">3521 The Benedictines here translate λόγῳ by “Scripture,” on the ground that Reason is not competent to
assert the Divinity of the Word.</note>

<pb n="616"/>
of your dogs, which you invented as an instance of inequality. For what is the force of your
instance of ambiguity, if those whom you distinguish are not equal in honour? For it was
not to prove an equality but an inequality that you took refuge in your dogs. How could
anybody be more clearly convicted of fighting both against his own arguments, and against
the Deity?</p>
<p>XV. And if, when we admit that in respect of being the Cause the Father is greater than
the Son, they should assume the premiss that He is the Cause by Nature, and then deduce
the conclusion that He is greater by Nature also, it is difficult to say whether they mislead
most themselves or those with whom they are arguing. For it does not absolutely follow
that all that is predicated of a class can also be predicated of all the individuals composing
it; for the different particulars may belong to different individuals. For what hinders me, if
I assume the same premiss, namely, that the Father is greater by Nature, and then add this
other, Yet not by nature in every respect greater nor yet Father—from concluding, Therefore
the Greater is not in every respect greater, nor the Father in every respect Father? Or, if you
prefer it, let us put it in this way: God is an Essence: But an Essence is not in every case
God; and draw the conclusion for yourself—Therefore God is not in every case God. I think
the fallacy here is the arguing from a conditioned to an unconditioned use of a term,3522 to
use the technical expression of the logicians. For while we assign this word Greater to His
Nature viewed as a Cause, they infer it of His Nature viewed in itself. It is just as if when
we said that such a one was a dead man they were to infer simply that he was a Man.</p>
<p>XVI. How shall we pass over the following point, which is no less amazing than the
rest? Father, they say, is a name either of an essence or of an Action, thinking to bind us
down on both sides. If we say that it is a name of an essence, they will say that we agree with
them that the Son is of another Essence, since there is but one Essence of God, and this,
according to them, is preoccupied by the Father. On the other hand, if we say that it is the
name of an Action, we shall be supposed to acknowledge plainly that the Son is created and
not begotten. For where there is an Agent there must also be an Effect. And they will say
they wonder how that which is made can be identical with That which made it. I should
myself have been frightened with your distinction, if it had been necessary to accept one or
other of the alternatives, and not rather put both aside, and state a third and truer one,
namely, that Father is not a name either of an essence or of an action, most clever sirs. But
it is the name of the Relation in which the Father stands to the Son, and the Son to the
Father. For as with us these names make known a genuine and intimate relation, so, in the
case before us too, they denote an identity of nature between Him That is begotten and Him
<note type="footnote">3522 Or as the schoolmen say the fallacy is, A dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter, one of the many
forms of Undistributed Middle Term. Petavius, however (De Trin.. II., v., 12), pronounces the argument of this
section unsatisfactory.</note>

<pb n="617"/>
That begets. But let us concede to you that Father is a name of essence, it will still bring in
the idea of Son, and will not make it of a different nature, according to common ideas and
the force of these names. Let it be, if it so please you, the name of an action; you will not
defeat us in this way either. The Homoousion would be indeed the result of this action, or
otherwise the conception of an action in this matter would be absurd. You see then how,
even though you try to fight unfairly, we avoid your sophistries. But now, since we have
ascertained how invincible you are in your arguments and sophistries, let us look at your
strength in the Oracles of God, if perchance you may choose to persuade us out of them.</p>
<p>XVII. For we have learnt to believe in and to teach the Deity of the Son from their great
and lofty utterances. And what utterances are these? These: God—The Word—He That
Was In The Beginning and With The Beginning, and The Beginning. “In the Beginning
was The Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,”3523 and “With Thee
is the Beginning,”3524 and “He who calleth her The Beginning from generations.”3525 Then
the Son is Only-begotten: The only “begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, it
says, He hath declared Him.”3526 The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light. “I am the Way,
the Truth, and the Life;” and “I am the Light of the World.”3527 Wisdom and Power, “Christ,
the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God.”3528 The Effulgence, the Impress, the Image,
the Seal; “Who being the Effulgence of His glory and the Impress of His Essence,”3529 and
“the Image of His Goodness,”3530 and “Him hath God the Father sealed.”3531 Lord, King,
He That Is, The Almighty. “The Lord rained down fire from the Lord;”3532 and “A sceptre
of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom;”3533 and “Which is and was and is to come,
the Almighty”3534—all which are clearly spoken of the Son, with all the other passages of
the same force, none of which is an afterthought, or added later to the Son or the Spirit, any
more than to the Father Himself. For Their Perfection is not affected by additions. There
never was a time when He was without the Word, or when He was not the Father, or when

made Himself of no reputation and was Incarnate—yes, for it is no worse thing to say, was

carnal and grovelling doctrines, and learn to be more sublime, and to ascend with His

But afterwards for a cause He was born. And that cause was that you might be saved, who
insult Him and despise His Godhead, because of this, that He took upon Him your denser
nature, having converse with Flesh by means of Mind.3557 While His inferior Nature, the
Humanity, became God, because it was united to God, and became One Person3558 because
the Higher Nature prevailed in order that I too might be made God so far as He is made
Man.3559 He was born—but He had been begotten: He was born of a woman—but she was

to Cledonius (v. infra) the Priest, against Apollinarius, which is sometimes reckoned as the 51st Oration, S.
Gregory says, “The Godhead and the Manhood are two natures, just as soul and body are. But there are not
two Sons or two Gods; although Paul did thus entangle the outward man and the inward. And, to speak succinctly,
the Natures which make our Saviour are distinct, for the Invisible is not the same as the visible, nor the Timeless
as that which is subject to time; but He is not two Persons, God forbid, for both these are one in the union, God
being made Man, and Man being made God, or however else you may express it.” And upon this S. Thomas
Aquinas remarks that it is true, if by Man you understand simply Human Nature, and not a Human Person; in
this sense it was brought to pass that Man was God; or in other words Human Nature was made that of the Son
of God. (Summa, III., xvi., 7.)</note>
<note type="footnote">3560 “If any does not admit Mary to be the Mother of God (θεοτόκον), he is separated from God. If any say
that He passed through the Virgin as through a conduit, and that He was not formed in her both divinely and
humanly (divinely, because without a human father; humanly, because in accordance with the laws of gestation),
he is in like manner atheistic. If any assert that the Humanity was thus formed, and the Deity subsequently
added, he is condemned; for this is not a generation of God, but an evasion of generation” (S. G. N. ad Cled.,
Ep. i.) S. Thomas Aquinas explains the fitness of the title thus: The Blessed Virgin could be denied to be the
Mother of God only if either His Humanity had been conceived and born before That Man was the Son of
God:—which was the position taken up by Photinus; or else if the Humanity had not been assumed into the
unity of the Person (or Hypostasis) of the Son of God;—which was the position of Nestorius. Both these positions
are erroneous. Therefore to deny that the Blessed Virgin is the Mother of God is heretical (Summa, III.. xxxv.
4). In the text S. Gregory merely means that the Godhead of our Lord was not derived from His Blessed Mother,
just as his Manhood was not derived from any man; but, as the extract at the beginning of this Note shews, he
would be the last to take up the Nestorian notion, which was afterwards condemned at the Council of Ephesus.</note>

(for light talk and contradictions of words are not agreeable to the faithful, and one Adversary
is enough for us), but of necessity, for the sake of our assailants (for medicines exist because
of diseases), that they may be led to see that they are not all-wise nor invincible in those
superfluous arguments which make void the Gospel. For when we leave off believing, and
protect ourselves by mere strength of argument, and destroy the claim which the Spirit has
upon our faith by questionings, and then our argument is not strong enough for the importance
of the subject (and this must necessarily be the case, since it is put in motion by an
organ of so little power as is our mind), what is the result? The weakness of the argument
appears to belong to the mystery, and thus elegance of language makes void the Cross, as
Paul also thought.3592 For faith is that which completes our argument. But may He who
proclaimeth unions and looseth those that are bound, and who putteth into our minds to
solve the knots of their unnatural dogmas, if it may be, change these men and make them

<p>The Fourth Theological Oration, Which is the Second Concerning the Son.</p>
<p>I. Since I have by the power of the Spirit sufficiently overthrown the subtleties and intricacies
of the arguments, and already solved in the mass the objections and oppositions
drawn from Holy Scripture, with which these sacrilegious robbers of the Bible and thieves
of the sense of its contents draw over the multitude to their side, and confuse the way of
truth; and that not without clearness, as I believe all candid persons will say; attributing to
the Deity the higher and diviner expressions, and the lower and more human to Him Who
for us men was the Second Adam, and was God made capable of suffering to strive against
sin; yet we have not yet gone through the passages in detail, because of the haste of our argument.
But since you demand of us a brief explanation of each of them, that you may not
be carried away by the plausibilities of their arguments, we will therefore state the explanations
summarily, dividing them into numbers for the sake of carrying them more easily in
mind.</p>
<p>II. In their eyes the following is only too ready to hand “The Lord created me at the
beginning of His ways with a view to His works.”3595 How shall we meet this? Shall we
bring an accusation against Solomon, or reject his former words because of his fall in afterlife?
Shall we say that the words are those of Wisdom herself, as it were of Knowledge and
the Creator-word, in accordance with which all things were made? For Scripture often
personifies many even lifeless objects; as for instance, “The Sea said”3596 so and so; and,
“The Depth saith, It is not in me;”3597 and “The Heavens declare the glory of God;”3598 and
<note type="footnote">3595 Prov. viii. 22. The A.V. has in the place Possessed, and this has very high authority: but the Hebrew
word in almost every case signifies to Acquire. It is used, says Bp. Wordsworth (ad h. l.), about eighty times in
the O.T., and in only five places is it rendered in our Translation by Possess;—in two of which (Gen. xiv. 10, 22,
and Ps. cxxxix. 13) it might well have the sense of Creating, and in two (Jer. xxxii. 15, and Zech. xi. 5) of Getting.
In some ancient Versions (LXX. and Syr.) it is rendered by Create. S. Jerome in his Ep. ad Cypr. (ii. 697) says
that the word may here be understood of possession, but in his Comm. on Ephes. ii. (p. 342) he adopts the rendering
Create, which he applies to the Incarnation, as in several places does S. Athanasius. But Wordsworth
thinks it better to apply the words to the Eternal Generation, as S. Hilary expounds it (c. Arianos, who argued
from it that Christ was a creature); “quia Filius Dei non corporalis parturitionis est genitus exemplo, sed ex
perfecto Deo perfectus Deus natus; et ideo ait creatam se esse Sapientia; omnem in generatione sua notionem
passionis corporalis excludens.”</note>

again a command is given to the Sword;3599 and the Mountains and Hills are asked the
reason of their skipping.3600 We do not allege any of these, though some of our predecessors
used them as powerful arguments. But let us grant that the expression is used of our Saviour
Himself, the true Wisdom. Let us consider one small point together. What among all things
that exist is unoriginate? The Godhead. For no one can tell the origin of God, that otherwise
would be older than God. But what is the cause of the Manhood, which for our sake God
assumed? It was surely our Salvation. What else could it be? Since then we find here clearly
both the Created and the Begetteth Me, the argument is simple. Whatever we find joined
with a cause we are to refer to the Manhood, but all that is absolute and unoriginate we are
to reckon to the account of His Godhead. Well, then, is not this “Created” said in connection
with a cause? He created Me, it so says, as the beginning of His ways, with a view to his
works. Now, the Works of His Hands are verity and judgment;3601 for whose sake He was
anointed with Godhead;3602 for this anointing is of the Manhood; but the “He begetteth
Me” is not connected with a cause; or it is for you to shew the adjunct. What argument then
will disprove that Wisdom is called a creature, in connection with the lower generation, but
Begotten in respect of the first and more incomprehensible?</p>
<p>III. Next is the fact of His being called Servant3603 and serving many well, and that it
is a great thing for Him to be called the Child of God. For in truth He was in servitude to
flesh and to birth and to the conditions of our life with a view to our liberation, and to that
of all those whom He has saved, who were in bondage under sin. What greater destiny can
befall man’s humility than that he should be intermingled with God, and by this intermingling
should be deified,3604 and that we should be so visited by the Dayspring from on high,3605
that even that Holy Thing that should be born should be called the Son of the Highest,3606
and that there should be bestowed upon Him a Name which is above every name? And
what else can this be than God?—and that every knee should bow to Him That was made
of no reputation for us, and That mingled the Form of God with the form of a servant, and
that all the House of Israel should know that God hath made Him both Lord and Christ?3607

For all this was done by the action of the Begotten, and by the good pleasure of Him That

<p>IV. Well, what is the second of their great irresistible passages? “He must reign,”3608
till such and such a time…and “be received by heaven until the time of restitution,”3609 and
“have the seat at the Right Hand until the overthrow of His enemies.”3610 But after this?
Must He cease to be King, or be removed from Heaven? Why, who shall make Him cease,
or for what cause? What a bold and very anarchical interpreter you are; and yet you have
heard that Of His Kingdom there shall be no end.3611 Your mistake arises from not understanding
that Until is not always exclusive of that which comes after, but asserts up to that
time, without denying what comes after it. To take a single instance—how else would you
understand, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world?”3612 Does it mean
that He will no longer be so afterwards. And for what reason? But this is not the only cause
of your error; you also fail to distinguish between the things that are signified. He is said
to reign in one sense as the Almighty King, both of the willing and the unwilling; but in
another as producing in us submission, and placing us under His Kingship as willingly acknowledging
His Sovereignty. Of His Kingdom, considered in the former sense, there shall
be no end. But in the second sense, what end will there be? His taking us as His servants,
on our entrance into a state of salvation. For what need is there to Work Submission in us
when we have already submitted? After which He arises to judge the earth, and to separate
the saved from the lost. After that He is to stand as God in the midst of gods,3613 that is, of
the saved, distinguishing and deciding of what honour and of what mansion each is worthy.</p>
<p>V. Take, in the next place, the subjection by which you subject the Son to the Father.
What, you say, is He not now subject, or must He, if He is God, be subject to God?3614 You
are fashioning your argument as if it concerned some robber, or some hostile deity. But
look at it in this manner: that as for my sake He was called a curse,3615 Who destroyed my
curse; and sin,3616 who taketh away the sin of the world; and became a new Adam3617 to

take the place of the old, just so He makes my disobedience His own as Head of the whole
body. As long then as I am disobedient and rebellious, both by denial of God and by my
passions, so long Christ also is called disobedient on my account. But when all things shall
be subdued unto Him on the one hand by acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a
reformation, then He Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom
He has saved to God. For this, according to my view, is the subjection of Christ; namely,
the fulfilling of the Father’s Will. But as the Son subjects all to the Father, so does the
Father to the Son; the One by His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already
said. And thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected, making our
condition His own. Of the same kind, it appears to me, is the expression, “My God, My
God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”3618 It was not He who was forsaken either by the
Father, or by His own Godhead, as some have thought, as if It were afraid of the Passion,
and therefore withdrew Itself from Him in His Sufferings (for who compelled Him either
to be born on earth at all, or to be lifted up on the Cross?) But as I said, He was in His own
Person representing us. For we were the forsaken and despised before, but now by the
Sufferings of Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up and saved. Similarly, He makes
His own our folly and our transgressions; and says what follows in the Psalm, for it is very
evident that the Twenty-first3619 Psalm refers to Christ.</p>
<p>VI. The same consideration applies to another passage, “He learnt obedience by the
things which He suffered,”3620 and to His “strong crying and tears,” and His “Entreaties,”
and His “being heard,” and His” Reverence,” all of which He wonderfully wrought out, like
a drama whose plot was devised on our behalf. For in His character of the Word He was
neither obedient nor disobedient. For such expressions belong to servants, and inferiors,
and the one applies to the better sort of them, while the other belongs to those who deserve
punishment. But, in the character of the Form of a Servant, He condescends to His fellow
servants, nay, to His servants, and takes upon Him a strange form, bearing all me and mine
in Himself, that in Himself He may exhaust the bad, as fire does wax, or as the sun does the
mists of earth; and that I may partake of His nature by the blending. Thus He honours
obedience by His action, and proves it experimentally by His Passion. For to possess the
disposition is not enough, just as it would not be enough for us, unless we also proved it by
our acts; for action is the proof of disposition.</p>
<p>And perhaps it would not be wrong to assume this also, that by the art3621 of His love
for man He gauges our obedience, and measures all by comparison with His own Sufferings,

<pb n="628"/>
so that He may know our condition by His own, and how much is demanded of us, and
how much we yield, taking into the account, along with our environment, our weakness
also. For if the Light shining through the veil3622 upon the darkness, that is upon this life,
as persecuted by the other darkness (I mean, the Evil One and the Tempter), how much
more will the darkness be persecuted, as being weaker than it? And what marvel is it, that
though He entirely escaped, we have been, at any rate in part, overtaken? For it is a more
wonderful thing that He should have been chased than that we should have been captured;—
at least to the minds of all who reason aright on the subject. I will add yet another
passage to those I have mentioned, because I think that it clearly tends to the same sense.
I mean “In that He hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.”
3623 But God will be all in all in the time of restitution; not in the sense that the Father
alone will Be; and the Son be wholly resolved into Him, like a torch into a great pyre, from
which it was reft away for a little space, and then put back (for I would not have even the
Sabellians injured3624 by such an expression); but the entire Godhead…when we shall be
no longer divided (as we now are by movements and passions), and containing nothing at
all of God, or very little, but shall be entirely like.</p>
<p>VII. As your third point you count the Word Greater;3625 and as your fourth, To My
God and your God.3626 And indeed, if He had been called greater, and the word equal had
not occurred, this might perhaps have been a point in their favour. But if we find both
words clearly used what will these gentlemen have to say? How will it strengthen their argument?
How will they reconcile the irreconcilable? For that the same thing should be at
once greater than and equal to the same thing is an impossibility; and the evident solution
is that the Greater refers to origination, while the Equal belongs to the Nature; and this we
acknowledge with much good will. But perhaps some one else will back up our attack on
your argument, and assert, that That which is from such a Cause is not inferior to that which
has no Cause; for it would share the glory of the Unoriginate, because it is from the Unoriginate.
And there is, besides, the Generation, which is to all men a matter so marvellous
and of such Majesty. For to say that he is greater than the Son considered as man, is true
indeed, but is no great thing. For what marvel is it if God is greater than man? Surely that
is enough to say in answer to their talk about Greater.</p>

<p>VIII. As to the other passages, My God would be used in respect, not of the Word, but
of the Visible Word. For how could there be a God of Him Who is properly God? In the
same way He is Father, not of the Visible, but of the Word; for our Lord was of two Natures;
so that one expression is used properly, the other improperly in each of the two cases; but
exactly the opposite way to their use in respect of us. For with respect to us God is properly
our God, but not properly our Father. And this is the cause of the error of the Heretics,
namely the joining of these two Names, which are interchanged because of the Union of
the Natures. And an indication of this is found in the fact that wherever the Natures are
distinguished in our thoughts from one another, the Names are also distinguished; as you
hear in Paul’s words, “The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory.”3627 The God
of Christ, but the Father of glory. For although these two terms express but one Person, yet
this is not by a Unity of Nature, but by a Union of the two. What could be clearer?</p>
<p>IX. Fifthly, let it be alleged that it is said of Him that He receives life,3628 judgment,3629
inheritance of the Gentiles,3630 or power over all flesh,3631 or glory,3632 or disciples, or
whatever else is mentioned. This also belongs to the Manhood; and yet if you were to ascribe
it to the Godhead, it would be no absurdity. For you would not so ascribe it as if it were
newly acquired, but as belonging to Him from the beginning by reason of nature, and not
as an act of favour.</p>
<p>X. Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but
what He seeth the Father do.3633 The solution of this is as follows:—Can and Cannot are
not words with only one meaning, but have many meanings. On the one hand they are
used sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and
sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an Athlete, or,
A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so. Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete,
the puppy will see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any
other. Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally true. For instance,—A city
that is set on a hill cannot be hid;3634 while yet it might possibly be hidden by another
higher hill being in a line with it. Or in another sense they are used of a thing which is not

reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with
them;3635 whether He be considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning
among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. For why should they
keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word?3636 Or, again, they are used of that which
is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief,
3637—i.e. of those who should receive them. For since in order to healing there is need
of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer,3638 when one of the two failed the
other was impossible. But probably this sense also is to be referred to the head of the unreasonable.
For healing is not reasonable in the case of those who would afterwards be injured
by unbelief. The sentence The world cannot hate you,3639 comes under the same head, as
does also How can ye, being evil, speak good things?3640 For in what sense is either impossible,
except that it is contrary to the will? There is a somewhat similar meaning in the
expressions which imply that a thing impossible by nature is possible to God if He so wills;3641
as that a man cannot be born a second time,3642 or that a needle will not let a camel through
it.3643 For what could prevent either of these things happening, if God so willed?</p>
<p>XI. And besides all this, there is the absolutely impossible and inadmissible, as that
which we are now examining. For as we assert that it is impossible for God to be evil, or
not to exist—for this would be indicative of weakness in God rather than of strength—or
for the non-existent to exist, or for two and two to make both four and ten,3644 so it is impossible
and inconceivable that the Son should do anything that the Father doeth not.3645
For all things that the Father hath are the Son’s;3646 and on the other hand, all that belongs
to the Son is the Father’s. Nothing then is peculiar, because all things are in common. For
Their Being itself is common and equal, even though the Son receive it from the Father. It
is in respect of this that it is said I live by the Father;3647 not as though His Life and Being

were kept together by the Father, but because He has His Being from Him beyond all time,
and beyond all cause. But how does He see the Father doing, and do likewise? Is it like
those who copy pictures and letters, because they cannot attain the truth unless by looking
at the original, and being led by the hand by it? But how shall Wisdom stand in need of a
teacher, or be incapable of acting unless taught? And in what sense does the Father “Do”
in the present or in the past? Did He make another world before this one, or is He going
to make a world to come? And did the Son look at that and make this? Or will He look at
the other, and make one like it? According to this argument there must be Four worlds,
two made by the Father, and two by the Son. What an absurdity! He cleanses lepers, and
delivers men from evil spirits, and diseases, and quickens the dead, and walks upon the sea,
and does all His other works; but in what case, or when did the Father do these acts before
Him? Is it not clear that the Father impressed the ideas of these same actions, and the Word
brings them to pass, yet not in slavish or unskilful fashion, but with full knowledge and in
a masterly way, or, to speak more properly, like the Father? For in this sense I understand
the words that whatsoever is done by the Father, these things doeth the Son likewise; not,
that is, because of the likeness of the things done, but in respect of the Authority. This might
well also be the meaning of the passage which says that the Father worketh hitherto and the
Son also;3648 and not only so but it refers also to the government and preservation of the
things which He has made; as is shewn by the passage which says that He maketh His Angels
Spirits,3649 and that the earth is founded upon its steadfastness (though once for all these
things were fixed and made) and that the thunder is made firm and the wind created.3650
Of all these things the Word was given once, but the Action is continuous even now.</p>
<p>XII. Let them quote in the seventh place that The Son came down from Heaven, not
to do His own Will, but the Will of Him That sent Him.3651 Well, if this had not been said
by Himself Who came down, we should say that the phrase was modelled as issuing from
the Human Nature, not from Him who is conceived of in His character as the Saviour, for
His Human Will cannot be opposed to God, seeing it is altogether taken into God; but
conceived of simply as in our nature, inasmuch as the human will does not completely follow
the Divine, but for the most part struggles against and resists it. For we understand in the
same way the words, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me; Nevertheless let not
what I will but Thy Will prevail.3652 For it is not likely that He did not know whether it was
possible or not, or that He would oppose will to will. But since, as this is the language of

Him Who assumed our Nature (for He it was Who came down), and not of the Nature
which He assumed, we must meet the objection in this way, that the passage does not mean
that the Son has a special will of His own, besides that of the Father, but that He has not; so
that the meaning would be, “not to do Mine own Will, for there is none of Mine apart from,
but that which is common to, Me and Thee; for as We have one Godhead, so We have one
Will.”3653 For many such expressions are used in relation to this Community, and are expressed
not positively but negatively; as, e.g., God giveth not the Spirit by measure,3654 for
as a matter of fact He does not give the Spirit to the Son, nor does He measure It, for God
is not measured by God; or again, Not my transgression nor my sin.3655 The words are not
used because He has these things, but because He has them not. And again, Not for our
righteousness which we have done,3656 for we have not done any. And this meaning is
evident also in the clauses which follow. For what, says He, is the Will of My Father? That
everyone that believeth on the Son should be saved,3657 and obtain the final Resurrection.3658
Now is this the Will of the Father, but not of the Son? Or does He preach the Gospel, and
receive men’s faith against His will? Who could believe that? Moreover, that passage, too,
which says that the Word which is heard is not the Son’s3659 but the Father’s has the same
force. For I cannot see how that which is common to two can be said to belong to one alone,
however much I consider it, and I do not think any one else can. If then you hold this
opinion concerning the Will, you will be right and reverent in your opinion, as I think, and
as every right-minded person thinks.</p>
<p>XIII. The eighth passage is, That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ Whom Thou hast sent;3660 and There is none good save one, that is, God.3661 The
solution of this appears to me very easy. For if you attribute this only to the Father, where
will you place the Very Truth? For if you conceive in this manner of the meaning of To the
only wise God,3662 or Who only hath Immortality, Dwelling in the light which no man can

approach unto,3663 or of to the king of the Ages, immortal, invisible, and only wise God,3664
then the Son has vanished under sentence of death, or of darkness, or at any rate condemned
to be neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor God at all, which sums up all these points.
And how will you prevent His Goodness, which especially belongs to God alone, from perishing
with the rest? I, however, think that the passage That they may know Thee the only
true God, was said to overthrow those gods which are falsely so called, for He would not
have added and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were contrasted
with Him, and the sentence did not proceed upon the basis of a common Godhead. The
“None is Good” meets the tempting Lawyer, who was testifying to His Goodness viewed as
Man. For perfect goodness, He says, is God’s alone, even if a man is called perfectly good.
As for instance, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good
things.3665 And, I will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee.3666…Words of
God, speaking to Saul about David. Or again, Do good, O Lord, unto the good3667…and
all other like expressions concerning those of us who are praised, upon whom it is a kind
of effluence from the Supreme Good, and has come to them in a secondary degree. It will
be best of all if we can persuade you of this. But if not, what will you say to the suggestion
on the other side, that on your hypothesis the Son has been called the only God. In what
passage? Why, in this:—This is your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison
with Him, and a little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon earth, and conversed
with men.3668 This addition proves clearly that the words are not used of the Father, but
of the Son; for it was He Who in bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower
world. Now, if we should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the Father,
and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very terms which we were
pressing against the Son. And what could be more disastrous than such a victory?</p>
<p>XIV. Ninthly, they allege, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for us.3669 O, how
beautiful and mystical and kind. For to intercede does not imply to seek for vengeance, as
is most men’s way (for in that there would be something of humiliation), but it is to plead
for us by reason of His Mediatorship, just as the Spirit also is said to make intercession for
us.3670 For there is One God, and One Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ

Jesus.3671 For He still pleads even now as Man for my salvation; for He continues to wear
the Body which He assumed, until He make me God by the power of His Incarnation; although
He is no longer known after the flesh3672—I mean, the passions of the flesh, the
same, except sin, as ours. Thus too, we have an Advocate,3673 Jesus Christ, not indeed
prostrating Himself for us before the Father, and falling down before Him in slavish fashion…
Away with a suspicion so truly slavish and unworthy of the Spirit! For neither is it
seemly for the Father to require this, nor for the Son to submit to it; nor is it just to think it
of God. But by what He suffered as Man, He as the Word and the Counsellor persuades
Him to be patient. I think this is the meaning of His Advocacy.</p>
<p>XV. Their tenth objection is the ignorance, and the statement that Of the last day and
hour knoweth no man, not even the Son Himself, but the Father.3674 And yet how can
Wisdom be ignorant of anything—that is, Wisdom Who made the worlds, Who perfects
them, Who remodels them, Who is the Limit of all things that were made, Who knoweth
the things of God as the spirit of a man knows the things that are in him?3675 For what can
be more perfect than this knowledge? How then can you say that all things before that hour
He knows accurately, and all things that are to happen about the time of the end, but of the
hour itself He is ignorant? For such a thing would be like a riddle; as if one were to say that
he knew accurately all that was in front of the wall, but did not know the wall itself; or that,
knowing the end of the day, he did not know the beginning of the night—where knowledge
of the one necessarily brings in the other. Thus everyone must see that He knows as God,
and knows not as Man;—if one may separate the visible from that which is discerned by
thought alone. For the absolute and unconditioned use of the Name “The Son” in this
passage, without the addition of whose Son, gives us this thought, that we are to understand
the ignorance in the most reverent sense, by attributing it to the Manhood, and not to the
Godhead.</p>
<p>XVI. If then this argument is sufficient, let us stop here, and not enquire further. But
if not, our second argument is as follows:—Just as we do in all other instances, so let us refer
His knowledge of the greatest events, in honour of the Father, to The Cause. And I think
that anyone, even if he did not read it in the way that one of our own Students3676 did,
would soon perceive that not even the Son knows the day or hour otherwise than as the

Father does. For what do we conclude from this? That since the Father knows, therefore
also does the Son, as it is evident that this cannot be known or comprehended by any but
the First Nature. There remains for us to interpret the passage about His receiving commandment,
3677 and having kept His Commandments, and done always those things that
please Him; and further concerning His being made perfect,3678 and His exaltation,3679 and
His learning obedience by the things which He suffered; and also His High Priesthood, and
His Oblation, and His Betrayal, and His prayer to Him That was able to save Him from
death, and His Agony and Bloody Sweat and Prayer,3680 and such like things; if it were not
evident to every one that such words are concerned, not with That Nature Which is unchangeable
and above all capacity of suffering, but with the passible Humanity. This, then,
is the argument concerning these objections, so far as to be a sort of foundation and
memorandum for the use of those who are better able to conduct the enquiry to a more
complete working out. It may, however, be worth while, and will be consistent with what
has been already said, instead of passing over without remark the actual Titles of the Son
(there are many of them, and they are concerned with many of His Attributes), to set before
you the meaning of each of them, and to point out the mystical meaning of the names.</p>
<p>XVII. We will begin thus. The Deity cannot be expressed in words. And this is proved
to us, not only by argument, but by the wisest and most ancient of the Hebrews, so far as
they have given us reason for conjecture. For they appropriated certain characters to the
honour of the Deity, and would not even allow the name of anything inferior to God to be
written with the same letters as that of God, because to their minds it was improper that the
Deity should even to that extent admit any of His creatures to a share with Himself. How
then could they have admitted that the invisible and separate Nature can be explained by
divisible words? For neither has any one yet breathed the whole air, nor has any mind entirely
comprehended, or speech exhaustively contained the Being of God. But we sketch Him by
His Attributes, and so obtain a certain faint and feeble and partial idea concerning Him,
and our best Theologian is he who has, not indeed discovered the whole, for our present
chain does not allow of our seeing the whole, but conceived of Him to a greater extent than
another, and gathered in himself more of the Likeness or adumbration of the Truth, or
whatever we may call it.</p>
<p>XVIII. As far then as we can reach, He Who Is, and God, are the special names of His
Essence; and of these especially He Who Is, not only because when He spake to Moses in
the mount, and Moses asked what His Name was, this was what He called Himself, bidding

him say to the people “I Am hath sent me,”3681 but also because we find that this Name is
the more strictly appropriate. For the Name Θεός (God), even if, as those who are skilful
in these matters say, it were derived from Θέειν3682 (to run) or from Αἴθειν (to blaze), from
continual motion, and because He consumes evil conditions of things (from which fact He
is also called A Consuming Fire),3683 would still be one of the Relative Names, and not an
Absolute one; as again is the case with Lord,3684 which also is called a name of God. I am
the Lord Thy God, He says, that is My name;3685 and, The Lord is His name.3686 But we
are enquiring into a Nature Whose Being is absolute and not into Being bound up with
something else. But Being is in its proper sense peculiar to God, and belongs to Him entirely,
and is not limited or cut short by any Before or After, for indeed in him there is no past or
future.</p>
<p>XIX. Of the other titles, some are evidently names of His Authority, others of His
Government of the world, and of this viewed under a twofold aspect, the one before the
other in the Incarnation. For instance the Almighty, the King of Glory, or of The Ages, or
of The Powers, or of The Beloved, or of Kings. Or again the Lord of Sabaoth, that is of
Hosts, or of Powers, or of Lords; these are clearly titles belonging to His Authority. But the
God either of Salvation or of Vengeance, or of Peace, or of Righteousness; or of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and of all the spiritual Israel that seeth God,—these belong to His Government.
For since we are governed by these three things, the fear of punishment, the hope of
salvation and of glory besides, and the practice of the virtues by which these are attained,
the Name of the God of Vengeance governs fear, and that of the God of Salvation our hope,
and that of the God of Virtues our practice; that whoever attains to any of these may, as
carrying God in himself, press on yet more unto perfection, and to that affinity which arises
out of virtues. Now these are Names common to the Godhead, but the Proper Name of the

Unoriginate is Father, and that of the unoriginately Begotten is Son, and that of the unbegottenly
Proceeding or going forth is The Holy Ghost. Let us proceed then to the Names
of the Son, which were our starting point in this part of our argument.</p>
<p>XX. In my opinion He is called Son because He is identical with the Father in Essence;
and not only for this reason, but also because He is Of Him. And He is called Only-Begotten,
not because He is the only Son and of the Father alone, and only a Son; but also because the
manner of His Sonship is peculiar to Himself and not shared by bodies. And He is called
the Word, because He is related to the Father as Word to Mind; not only on account of His
passionless Generation, but also because of the Union, and of His declaratory function.
Perhaps too this relation might be compared to that between the Definition and the Thing
defined3687 since this also is called Λόγος.3688 For, it says, he that hath mental perception
of the Son (for this is the meaning of Hath Seen) hath also perceived the Father;3689 and
the Son is a concise demonstration and easy setting forth of the Father’s Nature. For every
thing that is begotten is a silent word of him that begat it. And if any one should say that
this Name was given Him because He exists in all things that are, he would not be wrong.
For what is there that consists but by the word? He is also called Wisdom, as the Knowledge
of things divine and human. For how is it possible that He Who made all things should be
ignorant of the reasons of what He has made? And Power, as the Sustainer of all created
things, and the Furnisher to them of power to keep themselves together. And Truth, as
being in nature One and not many (for truth is one and falsehood is manifold), and as the
pure Seal of the Father and His most unerring Impress. And the Image as of one substance
with Him, and because He is of the Father, and not the Father of Him. For this is of the
Nature of an Image, to be the reproduction of its Archetype, and of that whose name it
bears; only that there is more here. For in ordinary language an image is a motionless representation
of that which has motion; but in this case it is the living reproduction of the
Living One, and is more exactly like than was Seth to Adam,3690 or any son to his father.
For such is the nature of simple Existences, that it is not correct to say of them that they are
Like in one particular and Unlike in another; but they are a complete resemblance, and
should rather be called Identical than Like. Moreover he is called Light as being the
Brightness of souls cleansed by word and life. For if ignorance and sin be darkness, knowledge
and a godly life will be Light.…And He is called Life, because He is Light, and is the
constituting and creating Power of every reasonable soul. For in Him we live and move and
have our being,3691 according to the double power of that Breathing into us; for we were

all inspired by Him with breath,3692 and as many of us as were capable of it, and in so far
as we open the mouth of our mind, with God the Holy Ghost. He is Righteousness, because
He distributes according to that which we deserve, and is a righteous Arbiter both for those
who are under the Law and for those who are under Grace, for soul and body, so that the
former should rule, and the latter obey, and the higher have supremacy over the lower; that
the worse may not rise in rebellion against the better. He is Sanctification, as being Purity,
that the Pure may be contained by Purity. And Redemption, because He sets us free, who
were held captive under sin, giving Himself a Ransom for us, the Sacrifice to make expiation
for the world. And Resurrection, because He raises up from hence, and brings to life again
us, who were slain by sin.</p>
<p>XXI. These names however are still common to Him Who is above us, and to Him
Who came for our sake. But others are peculiarly our own, and belong to that nature which
He assumed. So He is called Man, not only that through His Body He may be apprehended
by embodied creatures, whereas otherwise this would be impossible because of His incomprehensible
nature; but also that by Himself He may sanctify humanity, and be as it were a
leaven to the whole lump; and by uniting to Himself that which was condemned may release
it from all condemnation, becoming for all men all things that we are, except sin;—body,
soul, mind and all through which death reaches—and thus He became Man, who is the
combination of all these; God in visible form, because He retained that which is perceived
by mind alone. He is Son of Man, both on account of Adam, and of the Virgin from Whom
He came; from the one as a forefather, from the other as His Mother, both in accordance
with the law of generation, and apart from it. He is Christ, because of His Godhead. For
this is the Anointing of His Manhood, and does not, as is the case with all other Anointed
Ones, sanctify by its action, but by the Presence in His Fulness of the Anointing One; the
effect of which is that That which anoints is called Man, and makes that which is anointed
God. He is The Way, because He leads us through Himself; The Door, as letting us in; the
Shepherd, as making us dwell in a place of green pastures,3693 and bringing us up by waters
of rest, and leading us there, and protecting us from wild beasts, converting the erring,
bringing back that which was lost, binding up that which was broken, guarding the strong,
and bringing them together in the Fold beyond, with words of pastoral knowledge. The
Sheep, as the Victim: The Lamb, as being perfect: the Highpriest, as the Offerer;
Melchisedec, as without Mother in that Nature which is above us, and without Father in
ours; and without genealogy above (for who, it says, shall declare His generation?) and
moreover, as King of Salem, which means Peace, and King of Righteousness, and as receiving
tithes from Patriarchs, when they prevail over powers of evil. They are the titles of the Son.

<p>On the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>I. Such then is the account of the Son, and in this manner He has escaped those who
would stone Him, passing through the midst of them.3694 For the Word is not stoned, but
casts stones when He pleases; and uses a sling against wild beasts—that is, words—approaching
the Mount3695 in an unholy way. But, they go on, what have you to say about the Holy
Ghost? From whence are you bringing in upon us this strange God, of Whom Scripture is
silent? And even they who keep within bounds as to the Son speak thus. And just as we
find in the case of roads and rivers, that they split off from one another and join again, so
it happens also in this case, through the superabundance of impiety, that people who differ
in all other respects have here some points of agreement, so that you never can tell for certain
either where they are of one mind, or where they are in conflict.</p>
<p>II. Now the subject of the Holy Spirit presents a special difficulty, not only because
when these men have become weary in their disputations concerning the Son, they struggle
with greater heat against the Spirit (for it seems to be absolutely necessary for them to have
some object on which to give expression to their impiety, or life would appear to them no
longer worth living), but further because we ourselves also, being worn out by the multitude
of their questions, are in something of the same condition with men who have lost their
appetite; who having taken a dislike to some particular kind of food, shrink from all food;
so we in like manner have an aversion from all discussions. Yet may the Spirit grant it to
us, and then the discourse will proceed, and God will be glorified. Well then, we will leave
to others3696 who have worked upon this subject for us as well as for themselves, as we have
worked upon it for them, the task of examining carefully and distinguishing in how many
senses the word Spirit or the word Holy is used and understood in Holy Scripture, with the
evidence suitable to such an enquiry; and of shewing how besides these the combination of
the two words—I mean, Holy Spirit—is used in a peculiar sense; but we will apply ourselves
to the remainder of the subject.</p>
<p>III. They then who are angry with us on the ground that we are bringing in a strange
or interpolated God, viz.:—the Holy Ghost, and who fight so very hard for the letter, should
know that they are afraid where no fear is;3697 and I would have them clearly understand
that their love for the letter is but a cloak for their impiety, as shall be shewn later on, when
we refute their objections to the utmost of our power. But we have so much confidence in

the Deity of the Spirit Whom we adore,3698 that we will begin our teaching concerning His
Godhead by fitting to Him the Names which belong to the Trinity, even though some persons
may think us too bold. The Father was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming
into the world. The Son was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into the
world. The Other Comforter was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into
the world.3699 Was and Was and Was, but Was One Thing. Light thrice repeated; but One
Light and One God. This was what David represented to himself long before when he said,
In Thy Light shall we see Light.3700 And now we have both seen and proclaim concisely
and simply the doctrine3701 of God the Trinity, comprehending out of Light (the Father),
Light (the Son), in Light (the Holy Ghost). He that rejects it, let him reject it;3702 and he
that doeth iniquity, let him do iniquity; we proclaim that which we have understood. We
will get us up into a high mountain,3703 and will shout, if we be not heard, below; we will
exalt the Spirit; we will not be afraid; or if we are afraid, it shall be of keeping silence, not of
proclaiming.</p>
<p>IV. If ever there was a time when the Father was not, then there was a time when the
Son was not. If ever there was a time when the Son was not, then there was a time when
the Spirit was not. If the One was from the beginning, then the Three were so too. If you
throw down the One, I am bold to assert that you do not set up the other Two. For what
profit is there in an imperfect Godhead? Or rather, what Godhead can there be if It is not
perfect? And how can that be perfect which lacks something of perfection? And surely
there is something lacking if it hath not the Holy, and how would it have this if it were
without the Spirit? For either holiness is something different from Him, and if so let some
one tell me what it is conceived to be; or if it is the same, how is it not from the beginning,
as if it were better for God to be at one time imperfect and apart from the Spirit? If He is
not from the beginning, He is in the same rank with myself, even though a little before me;
for we are both parted from Godhead by time. If He is in the same rank with myself, how
can He make me God, or join me with Godhead?</p>

<p>V. Or rather, let me reason with you about Him from a somewhat earlier point, for we
have already discussed the Trinity. The Sadducees altogether denied the existence of the
Holy Spirit, just as they did that of Angels and the Resurrection; rejecting, I know not upon
what ground, the important testimonies concerning Him in the Old Testament. And of the
Greeks those who are more inclined to speak of God, and who approach nearest to us, have
formed some conception of Him, as it seems to me, though they have differed as to His
Name, and have addressed Him as the Mind of the World, or the External Mind, and the
like. But of the wise men amongst ourselves, some have conceived of him as an Activity,
some as a Creature, some as God; and some have been uncertain which to call Him, out of
reverence for Scripture, they say, as though it did not make the matter clear either way.
And therefore they neither worship Him nor treat Him with dishonour, but take up a
neutral position, or rather a very miserable one, with respect to Him. And of those who
consider Him to be God, some are orthodox in mind only, while others venture to be so
with the lips also. And I have heard of some who are even more clever, and measure Deity;
and these agree with us that there are Three Conceptions; but they have separated these
from one another so completely as to make one of them infinite both in essence and power,
and the second in power but not in essence, and the third circumscribed in both; thus imitating
in another way those who call them the Creator, the Co-operator, and the Minister,
and consider that the same order and dignity which belongs to these names is also a sequence
in the facts.</p>
<p>VI. But we cannot enter into any discussion with those who do not even believe in His
existence, nor with the Greek babblers (for we would not be enriched in our argument with
the oil of sinners).3704 With the others, however, we will argue thus. The Holy Ghost must
certainly be conceived of either as in the category of the Self-existent, or as in that of the
things which are contemplated in another; of which classes those who are skilled in such
matters call the one Substance and the other Accident. Now if He were an Accident, He
would be an Activity of God, for what else, or of whom else, could He be, for surely this is
what most avoids composition? And if He is an Activity, He will be effected, but will not
effect and will cease to exist as soon as He has been effected, for this is the nature of an
Activity. How is it then that He acts and says such and such things, and defines, and is
grieved, and is angered, and has all the qualities which belong clearly to one that moves,
and not to movement? But if He is a Substance and not an attribute of Substance, He will
be conceived of either as a Creature of God, or as God. For anything between these two,
whether having nothing in common with either, or a compound of both, not even they who
invented the goat-stag could imagine. Now, if He is a creature, how do we believe in Him,
how are we made perfect in Him? For it is not the same thing to believe IN a thing and to
<note type="footnote">3704 Ps. cxli. 5.</note>

<pb n="643"/>
believe About it. The one belongs to Deity, the other to—any thing. But if He is God, then
He is neither a creature, nor a thing made, nor a fellow servant, nor any of these lowly appellations.</p>
<p>VII. There—the word is with you. Let the slings be let go; let the syllogism be woven.
Either He is altogether Unbegotten, or else He is Begotten. If He is Unbegotten, there are
two Unoriginates. If he is Begotten, you must make a further subdivision. He is so either
by the Father or by the Son. And if by the Father, there are two Sons, and they are Brothers.
And you may make them twins if you like, or the one older and the other younger, since
you are so very fond of the bodily conceptions. But if by the Son, then such a one will say,
we get a glimpse of a Grandson God, than which nothing could be more absurd. For my
part however, if I saw the necessity of the distinction, I should have acknowledged the facts
without fear of the names. For it does not follow that because the Son is the Son in some
higher relation (inasmuch as we could not in any other way than this point out that He is
of God and Consubstantial), it would also be necessary to think that all the names of this
lower world and of our kindred should be transferred to the Godhead. Or may be you would
consider our God to be a male, according to the same arguments, because he is called God
and Father, and that Deity is feminine, from the gender of the word, and Spirit neuter, because
It has nothing to do with generation; But if you would be silly enough to say, with the
old myths and fables, that God begat the Son by a marriage with His own Will, we should
be introduced3705 to the Hermaphrodite god of Marcion and Valentinus3706 who imagined
these newfangled Æons.</p>
<p>VIII. But since we do not admit your first division, which declares that there is no mean
between Begotten and Unbegotten, at once, along with your magnificent division, away go
your Brothers and your Grandsons, as when the first link of an intricate chain is broken
they are broken with it, and disappear from your system of divinity. For, tell me, what position
will you assign to that which Proceeds, which has started up between the two terms of
your division, and is introduced by a better Theologian than you, our Saviour Himself? Or
perhaps you have taken that word out of your Gospels for the sake of your Third Testament,
The Holy Ghost, which proceedeth from the Father;3707 Who, inasmuch as He proceedeth
<note type="footnote">3705 Irenæus. I., 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">3706 It would seem that S. Gregory commonly confused Marcion with Marcus, one of the leaders of the
Gnostic School of Valentinus. In another place he speaks of the Æons of Marcion and Valentinus, evidently
meaning Marcus; for the system of Marcion is characterized by an entire absence of any theory of Emanations
(Æons). Similarly there is no trace in Marcion of this notion of a hermaphrodite Deity, but there is something
very like it in the account of Marcus given by S. Irenæus.</note>
<note type="footnote">3707 John xv. 26. “It did not fall within this Father’s (Greg. Naz.) province to develop the doctrine of the
Procession. He is content to shew that the Spirit was not Generated, seeing that according to Christ’s own

<pb n="644"/>
from That Source, is no Creature; and inasmuch as He is not Begotten is no Son; and inasmuch
as He is between the Unbegotten and the Begotten is God. And thus escaping the
toils of your syllogisms, He has manifested himself as God, stronger than your divisions.
What then is Procession? Do you tell me what is the Unbegottenness of the Father, and I
will explain to you the physiology of the Generation of the Son and the Procession of the
Spirit, and we shall both of us be frenzy-stricken for prying into the mystery of God.3708
And who are we to do these things, we who cannot even see what lies at our feet, or number
the sand of the sea, or the drops of rain, or the days of Eternity, much less enter into the
Depths of God, and supply an account of that Nature which is so unspeakable and transcending
all words?</p>
<p>IX. What then, say they, is there lacking to the Spirit which prevents His being a Son,
for if there were not something lacking He would be a Son? We assert that there is nothing
lacking—for God has no deficiency. But the difference of manifestation, if I may so express
myself, or rather of their mutual relations one to another, has caused the difference of their
Names. For indeed it is not some deficiency in the Son which prevents His being Father
(for Sonship is not a deficiency), and yet He is not Father. According to this line of argument
there must be some deficiency in the Father, in respect of His not being Son. For the Father
is not Son, and yet this is not due to either deficiency or subjection of Essence; but the very
fact of being Unbegotten or Begotten, or Proceeding has given the name of Father to the
First, of the Son to the Second, and of the Third, Him of Whom we are speaking, of the Holy
Ghost that the distinction of the Three Persons may be preserved in the one nature and
dignity of the Godhead. For neither is the Son Father, for the Father is One, but He is what
the Father is; nor is the Spirit Son because He is of God, for the Only-begotten is One, but
He is what the Son is. The Three are One in Godhead, and the One Three in properties; so
that neither is the Unity a Sabellian one,3709 nor does the Trinity countenance the present
evil distinction.</p>

<note type="footnote">3709 Sabellius, who taught at Rome during the Pontificate of Callistus, was by far the most important heresiarch
of his period, and his opinions by far the most dangerous. While strongly emphasizing the fundamental doctrine
of the Divine Unity, he also admitted in terms a Trinity, but his Trinity was not that of the Catholic dogma, for
he represented it as only a threefold manifestation of the one Divine Essence. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
are in his view only temporary phænomena, which fulfil their mission, and then return into the abstract Monad.
Dr. Schaff (Hist. of the Church, Ante-Nicene Period, p. 582) gives the following concise account of his teaching:
“The unity of God, without distinction in itself, unfolds or extends itself in the course of the word’s development</note>

<pb n="645"/>
<p>X. What then? Is the Spirit God? Most certainly. Well then, is He Consubstantial?
Yes, if He is God. Grant me, says my opponent, that there spring from the same Source
One who is a Son, and One who is not a Son, and these of One Substance with the Source,
and I admit a God and a God. Nay, if you will grant me that there is another God and another
nature of God I will give you the same Trinity with the same name and facts. But
since God is One and the Supreme Nature is One, how can I present to you the Likeness?
Or will you seek it again in lower regions and in your own surroundings? It is very shameful,
and not only shameful, but very foolish, to take from things below a guess at things above,
and from a fluctuating nature at the things that are unchanging, and as Isaiah says, to seek
the Living among the dead.3710 But yet I will try, for your sake, to give you some assistance
for your argument, even from that source. I think I will pass over other points, though I
might bring forward many from animal history, some generally known, others only known
to a few, of what nature has contrived with wonderful art in connection with the generation
of animals. For not only are likes said to beget likes, and things diverse to beget things diverse,
but also likes to be begotten by things diverse, and things diverse by likes. And if we may
believe the story, there is yet another mode of generation, when an animal is self-consumed
and self-begotten.3711 There are also creatures which depart in some sort from their true
natures, and undergo change and transformation from one creature into another, by a
magnificence of nature. And indeed sometimes in the same species part may be generated
and part not; and yet all of one substance; which is more like our present subject. I will just
mention one fact of our own nature which every one knows, and then I will pass on to another
part of the subject.</p>
<note type="footnote">in three different forms and periods of revelation, and after the completion of redemption returns into Unity.
The Father reveals Himself in the giving of the Law or the Old Testament Economy (not in the creation also,
which in his view precedes the Trinitarian revelation); the Son in the Incarnation; the Holy Ghost in inspiration;
the revelation of the Son ends with the Ascension; that of the Spirit goes on in generation and sanctification.
He illustrates the Trinitarian revelation by comparing the Father to the disc of the sun, the Son to its enlightening
power, the Spirit to its warming influence. He is also said to have likened the Father to the body, the Son to the
soul, the Holy Ghost to the spirit of man: but this is unworthy of his evident speculative discrimination. His
view of the Logos too is peculiar. The Logos is not identical with the Son, but is the Monad itself in its transition
to Triad; that is, God conceived as vital motion and creating principle; the Speaking God, as distinguished from
the Silent God. Each Person (or Aspect—the word is ambiguous) is another Uttering; and the Three Persons
together are only successive evolutions of the Logos, or world-ward aspect of the Divine Nature. As the Logos
proceeded from God, so He at last returns into Him, and the process of Trinitarian development closes.”</note>

<p>XI. What was Adam? A creature of God. What then was Eve? A fragment of the
creature. And what was Seth? The begotten of both. Does it then seem to you that Creature
and Fragment and Begotten are the same thing? Of course it does not. But were not these
persons consubstantial? Of course they were. Well then, here it is an acknowledged fact
that different persons may have the same substance. I say this, not that I would attribute
creation or fraction or any property of body to the Godhead (let none of your contenders
for a word be down upon me again), but that I may contemplate in these, as on a stage,
things which are objects of thought alone. For it is not possible to trace out any image exactly
to the whole extent of the truth. But, they say, what is the meaning of all this? For is not
the one an offspring, and the other a something else of the One? Did not both Eve and Seth
come from the one Adam? And were they both begotten by him? No; but the one was a
fragment of him, and the other was begotten by him. And yet the two were one and the
same thing; both were human beings; no one will deny that. Will you then give up your
contention against the Spirit, that He must be either altogether begotten, or else cannot be
consubstantial, or be God; and admit from human examples the possibility of our position?
I think it will be well for you, unless you are determined to be very quarrelsome, and to fight
against what is proved to demonstration.</p>
<p>XII. But, he says, who in ancient or modern times ever worshipped the Spirit? Who
ever prayed to Him? Where is it written that we ought to worship Him, or to pray to Him,
and whence have you derived this tenet of yours? We will give the more perfect reason
hereafter, when we discuss the question of the unwritten; for the present it will suffice to
say that it is the Spirit in Whom we worship, and in Whom we pray. For Scripture says,
God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.3712
And again,—We know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;3713 and I will pray with the
Spirit and I will pray with the understanding also;3714—that is, in the mind and in the
Spirit. Therefore to adore or to pray to the Spirit seems to me to be simply Himself offering
prayer or adoration to Himself. And what godly or learned man would disapprove of this,
because in fact the adoration of One is the adoration of the Three, because of the equality
of honour and Deity between the Three? So I will not be frightened by the argument that
all things are said to have been made by the Son;3715 as if the Holy Spirit also were one of
<note type="footnote">3712 John iv. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">3713 Rom. viii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">3714 1 Cor. xiv. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">3715 John i. 2.</note>

<pb n="647"/>
these things. For it says all things that were made, and not simply all things. For the Father
was not, nor were any of the things that were not made. Prove that He was made, and then
give Him to the Son, and number Him among the creatures; but until you can prove this
you will gain nothing for your impiety from this comprehensive phrase. For if He was made,
it was certainly through Christ; I myself would not deny that. But if He was not made, how
can He be either one of the All, or through Christ? Cease then to dishonour the Father in
your opposition to the Only-begotten (for it is no real honour, by presenting to Him a
creature to rob Him of what is more valuable, a Son), and to dishonour the Son in your
opposition to the Spirit. For He is not the Maker of a Fellow servant, but He is glorified
with One of co-equal honour. Rank no part of the Trinity with thyself, lest thou fall away
from the Trinity; cut not off from Either the One and equally august Nature; because if thou
overthrow any of the Three thou wilt have overthrown the whole. Better to take a meagre
view of the Unity than to venture on a complete impiety.</p>
<p>XIII. Our argument has now come to its principal point; and I am grieved that a problem
that was long dead, and that had given way to faith, is now stirred up afresh; yet it is necessary
to stand against these praters, and not to let judgment go by default, when we have the Word
on our side, and are pleading the cause of the Spirit. If, say they, there is God and God and
God, how is it that there are not Three Gods, or how is it that what is glorified is not a
plurality of Principles? Who is it who say this? Those who have reached a more complete
ungodliness, or even those who have taken the secondary part; I mean who are moderate
in a sense in respect of the Son. For my argument is partly against both in common, partly
against these latter in particular. What I have to say in answer to these is as follows:—What
right have you who worship the Son, even though you have revolted from the Spirit, to call
us Tritheists? Are not you Ditheists? For if you deny also the worship of the Only Begotten,
you have clearly ranged yourself among our adversaries. And why should we deal kindly
with you as not quite dead? But if you do worship Him, and are so far in the way of salvation,
we will ask you what reasons you have to give for your ditheism, if you are charged with it?
If there is in you a word of wisdom answer, and open to us also a way to an answer. For the
very same reason with which you will repel a charge of Ditheism will prove sufficient for us
against one of Tritheism. And thus we shall win the day by making use of you our accusers
as our Advocates, than which nothing can be more generous.</p>
<p>XIV. What is our quarrel and dispute with both? To us there is One God, for the
Godhead is One, and all that proceedeth from Him is referred to One, though we believe
in Three Persons. For one is not more and another less God; nor is One before and another
after; nor are They divided in will or parted in power; nor can you find here any of the
qualities of divisible things; but the Godhead is, to speak concisely, undivided in separate
Persons; and there is one mingling of Light, as it were of three suns joined to each other.
When then we look at the Godhead, or the First Cause, or the Monarchia, that which we

<pb n="648"/>
conceive is One; but when we look at the Persons in Whom the Godhead dwells, and at
Those Who timelessly and with equal glory have their Being from the First Cause—there
are Three Whom we worship.</p>
<p>XV. What of that, they will say perhaps; do not the Greeks also believe in one Godhead,
as their more advanced philosophers declare? And with us Humanity is one, namely the
entire race; but yet they have many gods, not One, just as there are many men. But in this
case the common nature has a unity which is only conceivable in thought; and the individuals
are parted from one another very far indeed, both by time and by dispositions and by power.
For we are not only compound beings, but also contrasted beings, both with one another
and with ourselves; nor do we remain entirely the same for a single day, to say nothing of
a whole lifetime, but both in body and in soul are in a perpetual state of flow and change.
And perhaps the same may be said of the Angels3716 and the whole of that superior nature
which is second to the Trinity alone; although they are simple in some measure and more
fixed in good, owing to their nearness to the highest Good.</p>
<p>XVI. Nor do those whom the Greeks worship as gods, and (to use their own expression)
dæmons, need us in any respect for their accusers, but are convicted upon the testimony of
their own theologians, some as subject to passion, some as given to faction, and full of innumerable
evils and changes, and in a state of opposition, not only to one another, but even
to their first causes, whom they call Oceani and Tethyes and Phanetes, and by several other
names; and last of all a certain god who hated his children through his lust of rule, and
swallowed up all the rest through his greediness that he might become the father of all men
and gods whom he miserably devoured, and then vomited forth again. And if these are but
myths and fables, as they say in order to escape the shamefulness of the story, what will they
say in reference to the dictum that all things are divided into three parts,3717 and that each
god presides over a different part of the Universe, having a distinct province as well as a
distinct rank? But our faith is not like this, nor is this the portion of Jacob, says my Theologian.
3718 But each of these Persons possesses Unity, not less with that which is United to
it than with itself, by reason of the identity of Essence and Power.3719 And this is the account
of the Unity, so far as we have apprehended it. If then this account is the true one, let us
thank God for the glimpse He has granted us; if it is not let us seek for a better.</p>
<note type="footnote">3716 “Similarly it is clear concerning the Angels, that they have a being incapable of change, so far as pertains
to their nature, with a capacity of change as to choice, and of intelligence and affections and places, in their own
manner” (S. Thomas Aq., Summa, I., x., 5).</note>

<pb n="649"/>
<p>XVII. As for the arguments with which you would overthrow the Union which we
support, I know not whether we should say you are jesting or in earnest. For what is this
argument? “Things of one essence, you say, are counted together,” and by this “counted
together,” you mean that they are collected into one number.3720 But things which are not
of one essence are not thus counted…so that you cannot avoid speaking of three gods, according
to this account, while we do not run any risk at all of it, inasmuch as we assert that
they are not consubstantial. And so by a single word you have freed yourselves from trouble,
and have gained a pernicious victory, for in fact you have done something like what men
do when they hang themselves for fear of death. For to save yourselves trouble in your
championship of the Monarchia you have denied the Godhead, and abandoned the question
to your opponents. But for my part, even if labor should be necessary, I will not abandon
the Object of my adoration. And yet on this point I cannot see where the difficulty is.</p>
<p>XVIII. You say, Things of one essence are counted together, but those which are not
consubstantial are reckoned one by one. Where did you get this from? From what teachers
of dogma or mythology? Do you not know that every number expresses the quantity of
what is included under it, and not the nature of the things? But I am so old fashioned, or
perhaps I should say so unlearned, as to use the word Three of that number of things, even
if they are of a different nature, and to use One and One and One in a different way of so
many units, even if they are united in essence, looking not so much at the things themselves
as at the quantity of the things in respect of which the enumeration is made. But since you
hold so very close to the letter (although you are contending against the letter), pray take
your demonstrations from this source. There are in the Book of Proverbs three things which
go well, a lion, a goat, and a cock; and to these is added a fourth;—a King making a speech
before the people,3721 to pass over the other sets of four which are there counted up, although
things of various natures. And I find in Moses two Cherubim3722 counted singly. But now,
in your technology, could either the former things be called three, when they differ so greatly
in their nature, or the latter be treated as units when they are so closely connected and of
one nature? For if I were to speak of God and Mammon, as two masters, reckoned under
one head, when they are so very different from each other, I should probably be still more
laughed at for such a connumeration.</p>
<p>XIX. But to my mind, he says, those things are said to be connumerated and of the
same essence of which the names also correspond, as Three Men, or Three gods, but not
<note type="footnote">3720 συναριθμεῖται, as when you say Three Gods, or Three Men, and the like, as you do when you reckon
up things of the same sort. On the other hand, you must use the plural number in reckoning up things which
differ in kind.</note>
<note type="footnote">3721 Prov. xxx. 29, 30. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">3722 Exod. xxxvii. 7.</note>

<pb n="650"/>
Three this and that. What does this concession amount to? It is suitable to one laying down
the law as to names, not to one who is asserting the truth. For I also will assert that Peter
and James and John are not three or consubstantial, so long as I cannot say Three Peters,
or Three Jameses, or Three Johns; for what you have reserved for common names we demand
also for proper names, in accordance with your arrangement; or else you will be unfair in
not conceding to others what you assume for yourself. What about John then, when in his
Catholic Epistle he says that there are Three that bear witness,3723 the Spirit and the Water
and the Blood? Do you think he is talking nonsense? First, because he has ventured to
reckon under one numeral things which are not consubstantial, though you say this ought
to be done only in the case of things which are consubstantial. For who would assert that
these are consubstantial? Secondly, because he has not been consistent in the way he has
happened upon his terms; for after using Three in the masculine gender he adds three words
which are neuter, contrary to the definitions and laws which you and your grammarians
have laid down. For what is the difference between putting a masculine Three first, and
then adding One and One and One in the neuter, or after a masculine One and One and
One to use the Three not in the masculine but in the neuter, which you yourself disclaim
in the case of Deity? What have you to say about the Crab, which may mean either an animal,
or an instrument, or a constellation? And what about the Dog, now terrestrial, now
aquatic, now celestial? Do you not see that three crabs or dogs are spoken of? Why of course
it is so. Well then, are they therefore of one substance? None but a fool would say that. So
you see how completely your argument from connumeration has broken down, and is refuted
by all these instances. For if things that are of one substance are not always counted under
one numeral, and things not of one substance are thus counted, and the pronunciation of
the name3724 once for all is used in both cases, what advantage do you gain towards your
doctrine?</p>
<p>XX. I will look also at this further point, which is not without its bearing on the subject.
One and One added together make Two; and Two resolved again becomes One and One,
as is perfectly evident. If, however, elements which are added together must, as your theory
<note type="footnote">3723 This is the famous passage of the Witnesses in 1 John v. 8. In some few later codices of the Vulgate are
found the words which form verse 7 of our A.V. But neither verse 7 nor these words are to be found in any
Greek ms. earlier than the Fifteenth Century; nor are they quoted by any Greek Father, and by very few and late
Latin ones. They have been thought to be cited by S. Cyprian in his work on the Unity of the Church; and this
citation, if a fact, would be a most important one, as it would throw back their reception to an early date. But
Tischendorf (Gk. Test., Ed. viii., ad. loc.) gives reasons for believing that the quotation is only apparent, and is
really of the last clause of verse 8.</note>

requires, be consubstantial, and those which are separate be heterogeneous, then it will follow
that the same things must be both consubstantial and heterogeneous. No: I laugh at your
Counting Before and your Counting After, of which you are so proud, as if the facts themselves
depended upon the order of their names. If this were so, according to the same law,
since the same things are in consequence of the equality of their nature counted in Holy
Scripture, sometimes in an earlier, sometimes in a later place, what prevents them from
being at once more honourable and less honourable than themselves? I say the same of the
names God and Lord, and of the prepositions Of Whom, and By Whom, and In Whom, by
which you describe the Deity according to the rules of art for us, attributing the first to the
Father, the second to the Son, and the third to the Holy Ghost. For what would you have
done, if each of these expressions were constantly allotted to Each Person, when, the fact
being that they are used of all the Persons, as is evident to those who have studied the
question, you even so make them the ground of such inequality both of nature and dignity.
This is sufficient for all who are not altogether wanting in sense. But since it is a matter of
difficulty for you after you have once made an assault upon the Spirit, to check your rush,
and not rather like a furious boar to push your quarrel to the bitter end, and to thrust
yourself upon the knife until you have received the whole wound in your own breast; let us
go on to see what further argument remains to you.</p>
<p>XXI. Over and over again you turn upon us the silence of Scripture. But that it is not
a strange doctrine, nor an afterthought, but acknowledged and plainly set forth both by the
ancients and many of our own day, is already demonstrated by many persons who have
treated of this subject, and who have handled the Holy Scriptures, not with indifference or
as a mere pastime, but have gone beneath the letter and looked into the inner meaning, and
have been deemed worthy to see the hidden beauty, and have been irradiated by the light
of knowledge. We, however in our turn will briefly prove it as far as may be, in order not
to seem to be over-curious or improperly ambitious, building on another’s foundation. But
since the fact, that Scripture does not very clearly or very often write Him God in express
words (as it does first the Father and afterwards the Son), becomes to you an occasion of
blasphemy and of this excessive wordiness and impiety, we will release you from this inconvenience
by a short discussion of things and names, and especially of their use in Holy
Scripture.</p>
<p>XXII. Some things have no existence, but are spoken of; others which do exist are not
spoken of; some neither exist nor are spoken of, and some both exist and are spoken of. Do
you ask me for proof of this? I am ready to give it. According to Scripture God sleeps and
is awake, is angry, walks, has the Cherubim for His Throne. And yet when did He become

<pb n="652"/>
liable to passion, and have you ever heard that God has a body? This then is, though not
really fact, a figure of speech. For we have given names according to our own comprehension
from our own attributes to those of God. His remaining silent apart from us, and as it were
not caring for us, for reasons known to Himself, is what we call His sleeping; for our own
sleep is such a state of inactivity. And again, His sudden turning to do us good is the waking
up; for waking is the dissolution of sleep, as visitation is of turning away. And when He
punishes, we say He is angry; for so it is with us, punishment is the result of anger. And His
working, now here now there, we call walking; for walking is change from one place to another.
His resting among the Holy Hosts, and as it were loving to dwell among them, is His
sitting and being enthroned; this, too, from ourselves, for God resteth nowhere as He doth
upon the Saints. His swiftness of moving is called flying, and His watchful care is called His
Face, and his giving and bestowing3725 is His hand; and, in a word, every other of the powers
or activities of God has depicted for us some other corporeal one.</p>
<p>XXIII. Again, where do you get your Unbegotten and Unoriginate, those two citadels
of your position, or we our Immortal? Show me these in so many words, or we shall either
set them aside, or erase them as not contained in Scripture; and you are slain by your own
principle, the names you rely on being overthrown, and therewith the wall of refuge in which
you trusted. Is it not evident that they are due to passages which imply them, though the
words do not actually occur? What are these passages?—I am the first, and I am the last,3726
and before Me there was no God, neither shall there be after Me.3727 For all that depends
on that Am makes for my side, for it has neither beginning nor ending. When you accept
this, that nothing is before Him, and that He has not an older Cause, you have implicitly
given Him the titles Unbegotten and Unoriginate. And to say that He has no end of Being
is to call Him Immortal and Indestructible. The first pairs, then, that I referred to are accounted
for thus. But what are the things which neither exist in fact nor are said? That God
is evil; that a sphere is square; that the past is present; that man is not a compound being.
Have you ever known a man of such stupidity as to venture either to think or to assert any
such thing? It remains to shew what are the things which exist, both in fact and in language.
God, Man, Angel, Judgment, Vanity (viz., such arguments as yours), and the subversion of
faith and emptying of the mystery.</p>
<p>XXIV. Since, then, there is so much difference in terms and things, why are you such
a slave to the letter, and a partisan of the Jewish wisdom, and a follower of syllables at the
expense of facts? But if, when you said twice five or twice seven, I concluded from your
words that you meant Ten or Fourteen; or if, when you spoke of a rational and mortal an-
<note type="footnote">3725 var. lect., receiving.</note>
<note type="footnote">3726 Isa. xli. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">3727 Ib. xliii. 10.</note>

<pb n="653"/>
imal, that you meant Man, should you think me to be talking nonsense? Surely not, because
I should be merely repeating your own meaning; for words do not belong more to the
speaker of them than to him who called them forth. As, then, in this case, I should have
been looking, not so much at the terms used, as at the thoughts they were meant to convey;
so neither, if I found something else either not at all or not clearly expressed in the Words
of Scripture to be included in the meaning, should I avoid giving it utterance, out of fear of
your sophistical trick about terms. In this way, then, we shall hold our own against the
semi-orthodox—among whom I may not count you. For since you deny the Titles of the
Son, which are so many and so clear, it is quite evident that even if you learnt a great many
more and clearer ones you would not be moved to reverence. But now I will take up the
argument again a little way further back, and shew you, though you are so clever, the reason
for this entire system of secresy.</p>
<p>XXV. There have been in the whole period of the duration of the world two conspicuous
changes of men’s lives, which are also called two Testaments,3728 or, on account of the wide
fame of the matter, two Earthquakes; the one from idols to the Law, the other from the Law
to the Gospel. And we are taught in the Gospel of a third earthquake, namely, from this
Earth to that which cannot be shaken or moved.3729 Now the two Testaments are alike in
this respect, that the change was not made on a sudden, nor at the first movement of the
endeavour. Why not (for this is a point on which we must have information)? That no violence
might be done to us, but that we might be moved by persuasion. For nothing that
is involuntary is durable; like streams or trees which are kept back by force. But that which
is voluntary is more durable and safe. The former is due to one who uses force, the latter
is ours; the one is due to the gentleness of God, the other to a tyrannical authority. Wherefore
God did not think it behoved Him to benefit the unwilling, but to do good to the willing.
And therefore like a Tutor or Physician He partly removes and partly condones ancestral
habits, conceding some little of what tended to pleasure, just as medical men do with their
patients, that their medicine may be taken, being artfully blended with what is nice. For it
is no very easy matter to change from those habits which custom and use have made honourable.
For instance, the first cut off the idol, but left the sacrifices; the second, while it
destroyed the sacrifices did not forbid circumcision.3730 Then, when once men had submitted
to the curtailment, they also yielded that which had been conceded to them;3731 in the first
<note type="footnote">3728 Heb. xii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">3729 Referring to the earthquake at the giving of the Law on Mt. Sinai (Heb. xiii.), and to the prophesy of

xii. 26).</note>

<pb n="654"/>
instance the sacrifices, in the second circumcision; and became instead of Gentiles, Jews,
and instead of Jews, Christians, being beguiled into the Gospel by gradual changes. Paul is
a proof of this; for having at one time administered circumcision, and submitted to legal
purification, he advanced till he could say, and I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why
do I yet suffer persecution?3732 His former conduct belonged to the temporary dispensation,
his latter to maturity.</p>
<p>XXVI. To this I may compare the case of Theology3733 except that it proceeds the reverse
way. For in the case by which I have illustrated it the change is made by successive subtractions;
whereas here perfection is reached by additions. For the matter stands thus. The Old
Testament proclaimed the Father openly, and the Son more obscurely. The New manifested
the Son, and suggested the Deity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit Himself dwells among us,
and supplies us with a clearer demonstration of Himself. For it was not safe, when the
Godhead of the Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the Son; nor when
that of the Son was not yet received to burden us further (if I may use so bold an expression)
with the Holy Ghost; lest perhaps people might, like men loaded with food beyond their
strength, and presenting eyes as yet too weak to bear it to the sun’s light, risk the loss even
of that which was within the reach of their powers; but that by gradual additions, and, as
David says, Goings up, and advances and progress from glory to glory,3734 the Light of the
Trinity might shine upon the more illuminated. For this reason it was, I think, that He
gradually came to dwell in the Disciples, measuring Himself out to them according to their
capacity to receive Him, at the beginning of the Gospel, after the Passion, after the Ascension,
making perfect their powers, being breathed upon them, and appearing in fiery tongues.
And indeed it is by little and little that He is declared by Jesus, as you will learn for yourself
if you will read more carefully. I will ask the Father, He says, and He will send you another
Comforter, even the spirit of Truth.3735 This He said that He might not seem to be a rival
God, or to make His discourses to them by another authority. Again, He shall send Him,
but it is in My Name. He leaves out the I will ask, but He keeps the Shall send,3736 then
again, I will send,—His own dignity. Then shall come,3737 the authority of the Spirit.</p>

<note type="footnote">3733 Theology is here used in a restricted sense, as denoting simply the doctrine of the Deity of the Son or
Logos. It is very frequently used in this limited sense; examples of which may readily be found in Gregory of
Nyssa, Basil, Chrysostom, and others. A similar use occurs in Orat. XXXVIII., c. 8, in which passage θεολογία
is contrasted with οἰκονομία, the doctrine of our Lord’s Divinity with that of the Incarnation.</note>

<pb n="655"/>
<p>XXVII. You see lights breaking upon us, gradually; and the order of Theology, which
it is better for us to keep, neither proclaiming things too suddenly, nor yet keeping them
hidden to the end. For the former course would be unscientific, the latter atheistical; and
the former would be calculated to startle outsiders, the latter to alienate our own people. I
will add another point to what I have said; one which may readily have come into the mind
of some others, but which I think a fruit of my own thought. Our Saviour had some things
which, He said, could not be borne at that time by His disciples3738 (though they were filled
with many teachings), perhaps for the reasons I have mentioned; and therefore they were
hidden. And again He said that all things should be taught us by the Spirit when He should
come to dwell amongst us.3739 Of these things one, I take it, was the Deity of the Spirit
Himself, made clear later on when such knowledge should be seasonable and capable of
being received after our Saviour’s restoration, when it would no longer be received with
incredulity because of its marvellous character. For what greater thing than this did either
He promise, or the Spirit teach. If indeed anything is to be considered great and worthy of
the Majesty of God, which was either promised or taught.</p>
<p>XXVIII. This, then, is my position with regard to these things, and I hope it may be al-
ways my position, and that of whosoever is dear to me; to worship God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghost, Three Persons, One Godhead, undivided in honour and glory
and substance and kingdom, as one of our own inspired philosophers3740 not long departed
shewed. Let him not see the rising of the Morning Star, as Scripture saith,3741 nor the glory
of its brightness, who is otherwise minded, or who follows the temper of the times, at one
time being of one mind and of another at another time, and thinking unsoundly in the
highest matters. For if He is not to be worshipped, how can He deify me by Baptism? but
if He is to be worshipped, surely He is an Object of adoration, and if an Object of adoration
He must be God; the one is linked to the other, a truly golden and saving chain. And indeed
from the Spirit comes our New Birth, and from the New Birth our new creation, and from
the new creation our deeper knowledge of the dignity of Him from Whom it is derived.</p>

<note type="footnote">3740 Perhaps S. Gregory Thaumaturgus is meant. He was born about a.d. 210. The date of his death is uncertain,
but was probably not before 270. He was Bishop of Neocæsarea in Pontus. Amongst his works was an
Exposition of the Faith, which he is said to have received by direct revelation, and in it the words in the text
were contained. S. Gregory in another Oration refers to the closing sentences as the substance of the Formula
itself: “There is nothing created or servile in the Trinity, nor anything superinduced, as though previously nonexisting
and introduced afterwards. Never therefore, was the Son wanting to the Father, nor the Spirit to the
Son; but there is ever the same Trinity, unchangeable and unalterable”(Reynolds, in Dict. Biog.).</note>

<pb n="656"/>
<p>XXIX. This, then, is what may be said by one who admits the silence of Scripture. But
now the swarm of testimonies shall burst upon you from which the Deity of the Holy
Ghost3742 shall be shewn to all who are not excessively stupid, or else altogether enemies
to the Spirit, to be most clearly recognized in Scripture. Look at these facts:—Christ is born;
the Spirit is His Forerunner. He is baptized; the Spirit bears witness. He is tempted; the
Spirit leads Him up.3743 He works miracles; the Spirit accompanies them. He ascends; the
Spirit takes His place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in His
power?3744 What titles which belong to God are not applied to Him, except only Unbegotten
and Begotten? For it was needful that the distinctive properties of the Father and the Son
should remain peculiar to Them, lest there should be confusion in the Godhead Which
brings all things, even disorder3745 itself, into due arrangement and good order. Indeed I
tremble when I think of the abundance of the titles, and how many Names they outrage
who fall foul of the Spirit. He is called the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Mind of
Christ, the Spirit of The Lord, and Himself The Lord, the Spirit of Adoption, of Truth, of
Liberty; the Spirit of Wisdom, of Understanding, of Counsel, of Might, of Knowledge, of
Godliness, of the Fear of God. For He is the Maker of all these, filling all with His Essence,
containing all things, filling the world in His Essence, yet incapable of being comprehended
in His power by the world; good, upright, princely, by nature not by adoption; sanctifying,
not sanctified; measuring, not measured; shared, not sharing; filling, not filled; containing,
not contained; inherited, glorified, reckoned with the Father and the Son; held out as a
threat;3746 the Finger of God; fire like God; to manifest, as I take it, His consubstantiality);
the Creator-Spirit, Who by Baptism and by Resurrection creates anew; the Spirit That
knoweth all things, That teacheth, That bloweth where and to what extent He listeth; That
guideth, talketh, sendeth forth, separateth, is angry or tempted; That revealeth, illumineth,
quickeneth, or rather is the very Light and Life; That maketh Temples; That deifieth; That
perfecteth so as even to anticipate Baptism,3747 yet after Baptism to be sought as a separate
gift;3748 That doeth all things that God doeth; divided into fiery tongues; dividing gifts;
making Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers; understanding manifold,
clear, piercing, undefiled, unhindered, which is the same thing as Most wise and varied in
His actions; and making all things clear and plain; and of independent power, unchangeable,

Almighty, all-seeing, penetrating all spirits that are intelligent, pure, most subtle (the Angel
Hosts I think); and also all prophetic spirits and apostolic in the same manner and not in
the same places; for they lived in different places; thus showing that He is uncircumscript.</p>
<p>XXX. They who say and teach these things, and moreover call Him another Paraclete
in the sense of another God, who know that blasphemy against Him alone cannot be forgiven,
3749 and who branded with such fearful infamy Ananias and Sapphira for having lied to
the Holy Ghost, what do you think of these men?3750 Do they proclaim the Spirit God, or
something else? Now really, you must be extraordinarily dull and far from the Spirit if you
have any doubt about this and need some one to teach you. So important then, and so vivid
are His Names. Why is it necessary to lay before you the testimony contained in the very
words? And whatever in this case also3751 is said in more lowly fashion, as that He is Given,
Sent, Divided; that He is the Gift, the Bounty, the Inspiration, the Promise, the Intercession
for us, and, not to go into any further detail, any other expressions of the sort, is to be referred
to the First Cause, that it may be shewn from Whom He is, and that men may not in heathen
fashion admit Three Principles. For it is equally impious to confuse the Persons with the
Sabellians, or to divide the Natures with the Arians.</p>
<p>XXXI. I have very carefully considered this matter in my own mind, and have looked
at it in every point of view, in order to find some illustration of this most important subject,
but I have been unable to discover any thing on earth with which to compare the nature of
the Godhead. For even if I did happen upon some tiny likeness it escaped me for the most
part, and left me down below with my example. I picture to myself an eye,3752 a fountain,
a river, as others have done before, to see if the first might be analogous to the Father, the
second to the Son, and the third to the Holy Ghost. For in these there is no distinction in
time, nor are they torn away from their connexion with each other, though they seem to be
parted by three personalities. But I was afraid in the first place that I should present a flow
in the Godhead, incapable of standing still; and secondly that by this figure a numerical
unity would be introduced. For the eye and the spring and the river are numerically one,
though in different forms.</p>
<p>XXXII. Again I thought of the sun and a ray and light. But here again there was a fear
lest people should get an idea of composition in the Uncompounded Nature, such as there
is in the Sun and the things that are in the Sun. And in the second place lest we should give
Essence to the Father but deny Personality to the Others, and make Them only Powers of

called, but as the Eye or the centre of a spring, the point from which the water flows.</note>

<pb n="658"/>
God, existing in Him and not Personal. For neither the ray nor the light is another sun, but
they are only effulgences from the Sun, and qualities of His essence. And lest we should
thus, as far as the illustration goes, attribute both Being and Not-being to God, which is
even more monstrous. I have also heard that some one has suggested an illustration of the
following kind. A ray of the Sun flashing upon a wall and trembling with the movement of
the moisture which the beam has taken up in mid air, and then, being checked by the hard
body, has set up a strange quivering. For it quivers with many rapid movements, and is not
one rather than it is many, nor yet many rather than one; because by the swiftness of its
union and separating it escapes before the eye can see it.</p>
<p>XXXIII. But it is not possible for me to make use of even this; because it is very evident
what gives the ray its motion; but there is nothing prior to God which could set Him in
motion; for He is Himself the Cause of all things, and He has no prior Cause. And secondly
because in this case also there is a suggestion of such things as composition, diffusion, and
an unsettled and unstable nature…none of which we can suppose in the Godhead. In a
word, there is nothing which presents a standing point to my mind in these illustrations
from which to consider the Object which I am trying to represent to myself, unless one may
indulgently accept one point of the image while rejecting the rest. Finally, then, it seems
best to me to let the images and the shadows go, as being deceitful and very far short of the
truth; and clinging myself to the more reverent conception, and resting upon few words,
using the guidance of the Holy Ghost, keeping to the end as my genuine comrade and
companion the enlightenment which I have received from Him, and passing through this
world to persuade all others also to the best of my power to worship Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, the One Godhead and Power. To Him belongs all glory and honour and might for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XXXIII.</head>
<head>Against The Arians, and Concerning Himself.</head>
<p>Delivered at Constantinople about the middle of the year 380.</p>
<p>I. Where are they who reproach us with our poverty, and boast themselves of their own
riches; who define the Church by numbers,3753 and scorn the little flock; and who measure
Godhead,3754 and weigh the people in the balance, who honour the sand, and despise the
luminaries of heaven; who treasure pebbles and overlook pearls; for they know not that sand
is not in a greater degree more abundant than stars, and pebbles than lustrous stones—that
the former are purer and more precious than the latter? Are you again indignant? Do you
again arm yourselves? Do you again insult us?3755 Is this a new faith? Restrain your threats
a little while that I may speak. We will not insult you, but we will convict you; we will not
threaten, but we will reproach you; we will not strike, but we will heal. This too appears an
insult! What pride! Do you here also regard your equal as your slave? If not, permit me
to speak openly; for even a brother chides his brother if he has been defrauded by him.</p>
<p>II. Would you like me to utter to you the words of God to Israel, stiff-necked and
hardened? “O my people what have I done unto thee, or wherein have I injured thee, or
wherein have I wearied thee?”3756 This language indeed is fitter from me to you who insult
me. It is a sad thing that we watch for opportunities against each other, and having destroyed
our fellowship of spirit by diversities of opinion have become almost more inhuman and
savage to one another than even the barbarians who are now engaged in war against us,
banded together against us by the Trinity whom we have separated; with this difference that
we are not foreigners making forays and raids upon foreigners, nor nations of different
language, which is some little consolation in the calamity, but are making war upon one
another, and almost upon those of the same household; or if you will, we the members of
the same body are consuming and being consumed by one another. Nor is this, bad though
it be, the extent of our calamity, for we even regard our diminution as a gain. But since we
are in such a condition, and regulate our faith by the times, let us compare the times with
one another; you your Emperor,3757 and I my Sovereigns;3758 you Ahab and I Josias. Tell

for your actions and I will declare my own.</p>
<p>III. What tumultuous mob have I led against you? What soldiers have I armed? What
general boiling with rage, and more savage than his employers, and not even a Christian,
but one who offers his impiety against us as his private worship to his own gods?3759 Whom
have I besieged while engaged in prayer and lifting up their hands to God? When have I
put a stop to psalmody with trumpets? or mingled the Sacramental Blood with blood of
massacre? What spiritual sighs have I put an end to by cries of death, or tears of penitence
by tears of tragedy? What House of prayer have I made a burialplace? What liturgical vessels
which the multitude may not touch have I given over to the hands of the wicked, of a Nebuzaradan,
3760 chief of the cooks, or of a Belshazzar, who wickedly used the sacred vessels
for his revels,3761 and then paid a worthy penalty for his madness? “Altars beloved” as Holy
Scripture saith, but “now defiled.”3762 And what licentious youth has insulted you for our
sake with shameful writhings and contortions? O precious Throne, seat and rest of precious
men, which hast been occupied by a succession of pious Priests, who from ancient times
have taught the divine Mysteries, what heathen popular speaker and evil tongue hath
mounted thee to inveigh against the Christian’s faith? O modesty and majesty of Virgins,
that cannot endure the looks of even virtuous men, which of us hath shamed thee, and
outraged thee by the exposure of what may not be seen, and showed to the eyes of the impious
a pitiable sight, worthy of the fires of Sodom? I say nothing of deaths, which were more
endurable than this shame.</p>
<note type="footnote">3759 Dr. Ullmann makes this passage refer to outrages perpetrated in Constantinople itself on Gregory, by
his Arian opponents. On one occasion, he says, in the night time the meetingplace of the Orthodox was assailed;
a mob of Arians, and in particular women of the lowest stamp, set on by monks, armed themselves with sticks
and stones, and forced an entrance into the peaceful place of holy worship. The champion of orthodoxy well
nigh became a martyr to his convictions; the Altar was profaned, the consecrated wine was mixed with blood;
the house of prayer was made a scene of outrage and unbridled licentiousness. The Benedictine Editors, however,
whom Benoit follows, think the reference is to the disturbances in Alexandria when the Arian Lucius was forcibly
intruded into the Chair of Athanasius by the Prefect Palladius. A full account of the atrocities by which his installation
was marked is to be found in a letter of Peter, the expelled or orthodox Patriarch, preserved in Theodoret
(H. E. IV. 22). This Lucius was living in Constantinople and abetting the Arian party there at the time when
Gregory pronounced this Oration.</note>

<p>IV. What wild beasts have we let loose upon the bodies of Saints,—like some who have
prostituted human nature,—on one single accusation, that of not consenting to their impiety;
or defiled ourselves by communion with them, which we avoid like the poison of a snake,
not because it injures the body, but because it blackens the depths of the soul? Against
whom have we made it a matter of criminal accusation that they buried the dead, whom
the very beasts reverenced? And what a charge, worthy of another theatre and of other
beasts! What Bishop’s aged flesh have we carded with hooks in the presence of their disciples,
impotent to help them save by tears, hung up with Christ, conquering by suffering, and
sprinkling the people with their precious blood, and at last carried away to death, to be both
crucified and buried and glorified with Christ; with Christ Who conquered the world by
such victims and sacrifices? What priests have those contrary elements fire and water divided,
raising a strange beacon over the sea, and set on fire together with the ship in which they
put to sea?3763 Who (to cover the more numerous part of our woes with a veil of silence)
have been accused of inhumanity by the very magistrates who conferred such favour on
them? For even if they did obey the lusts of those men, yet at any rate they hated the cruelty
of their purpose. The one was opportunism, the other calculation; the one came of the
lawlessness of the Emperor, the other of a consciousness of the laws by which they had to
judge.</p>
<p>V. And to speak of older things, for they too belong to the same fraternity; whose hands
living or dead have I cut off—to bring a lying accusation against Saints,3764 and to triumph
over the faith by bluster? Whose exiles have I numbered as benefits, and failed to reverence
even the sacred colleges of sacred philosophers, whence I sought their suppliants? Nay the
very contrary is the case; I have reckoned as Martyrs those who incurred anger for the truth.
Upon whom have I, whom you accuse of licentiousness of language, brought harlots when
they were almost fleshless and bloodless? Which of the faithful have I exiled from their
country and given over to the hands of lawless men, that they might be kept like wild beasts
in rooms without light, and (for this is the saddest part of the tragedy) left separated from
each other to endure the hardships of hunger and thirst, with food measured out to them,

of Nicomedia, being afraid to execute the Emperor’s commands by a public action, put these men on board a
ship, as if to send them into exile, but gave orders to the crew to set the vessel on fire on the high seas, and leave
the prisoners to their fate. Billius, however, thinks that the reference is to the martyrdom of a single Priest, whose
death in this way is described by S. Gregory in his panegyric on Maximus (Or. xxv. 10, p. 461, 462).</note>

which they had to receive through narrow openings, so that they might not be permitted
even to see their companions in misery. And what were they who suffered thus? Men of
whom the world was not worthy.3765 Is it thus that you honour faith? Is this your kind
treatment of it? Ye know not the greater part of these things, and that reasonably, because
of the number of these facts and the pleasure of the action. But he who suffers has a better
memory. There have been even some more cruel than the times themselves, like wild boars
hurled against a fence. I demand your victim of yesterday3766 the old man, the Abrahamlike
Father, whom on his return from exile you greeted with stones in the middle of the day
and in the middle of the city. But we, if it is not invidious to say so, begged off even our
murderers from their danger. God says somewhere in Scripture, How shall I pardon thee
for this?3767 Which of these things shall I praise; or rather for which shall I bind a wreath
upon you?</p>
<p>VI. Now since your antecedents are such, I should be glad if you too will tell me of my
crimes, that I may either amend my life or be put to shame. My greatest wish is that I may
be found free from wrong altogether; but if this may not be, at least to be converted from
my crime; for this is the second best portion of the prudent. For if like the just man I do
not become my own accuser in the first instance,3768 yet at any rate I gladly receive healing
from another. “Your City, you say to me, is a little one, or rather is no city at all, but only
a village, arid, without beauty, and with few inhabitants.” But, my good friend, this is my
misfortune, rather than my fault;—if indeed it be a misfortune; and if it is against my will,
I am to be pitied for my bad luck, if I may put it so; but if it be willingly, I am a philosopher.
Which of these is a crime? Would anyone abuse a dolphin for not being a land animal, or
an ox because it is not aquatic, or a lamprey because it is amphibious? But we, you go on,
have walls and theatres and racecourses and palaces, and beautiful great Porticoes, and that
marvellous work the underground and overhead river,3769 and the splendid and admired
column,3770 and the crowded marketplace and a restless people, and a famous senate of
highborn men.</p>

contest between land and sea as to which owns the City, and which adorns our Royal City

with all their good things? This then is our crime, that while you are great and splendid,
we are small and come from a small place? Many others do you this wrong, indeed all those
whom you excel; and must we die because we have not reared a city, nor built walls around
it, nor can boast of our racecourse, or our stadia, and pack of hounds, and all the follies that
are connected with these things; nor have to boast of the beauty and splendour of our baths,
and the costliness of their marbles and pictures and golden embroideries of all sorts of species,
almost rivalling nature? Nor have we yet rounded off the sea for ourselves, or mingled the
seasons, as of course you, the new Creators, have done, that we may live in what is at once
the pleasantest and the safest way. Add if you like other charges, you who say, The silver is
mine and the gold is mine,3771 those words of God. We neither think much of riches, on
which, if they increase, our Law forbids us to set our hearts, nor do we count up yearly and
daily revenues; nor do we rival one another in loading our tables with enchantments for
our senseless belly. For neither do we highly esteem those things which after we have
swallowed them are all of the same worth, or rather I should say worthlessness, and are rejected.
But we live so simply and from hand to mouth, as to differ but little from beasts
whose sustenance is without apparatus and inartificial.</p>
<p>VIII. Do you also find fault with the raggedness of my dress, and the want of elegance
in the disposition of my face? for these are the points upon which I see that some persons
who are very insignificant pride themselves. Will you leave my head alone, and not jeer at
it, as the children did at Elissæus? What followed I will not mention. And will you leave
out of your allegations my want of education, and what seems to you the roughness and
rusticity of my elocution? And where will you put the fact that I am not full of small talk,
nor a jester popular with company, nor great hunter of the marketplace, nor given to chatter
and gossip with any chance people upon all sorts of subjects, so as to make even conversation
grievous; nor a frequenter of Zeuxippus, that new Jerusalem;3772 nor one who strolls from
house to house flattering and stuffing himself; but for the most part staying at home, of low
spirits and with a melancholy cast of countenance, quietly associating with myself, the
genuine critic of my actions; and perhaps worthy of imprisonment for my uselessness?
How is it that you pardon me for all this, and do not blame me for it? How sweet and kind
you are.</p>
<p>IX. But I am so old fashioned and such a philosopher as to believe that one heaven is
common to all; and that so is the revolution of the sun and the moon, and the order and
arrangement of the stars; and that all have in Common an equal share and profit in day and
night, and also change of seasons, rains, fruits, and quickening power of the air; and that

the flowing rivers are a common and abundant wealth to all; and that one and the same is
the Earth, the mother and the tomb, from which we were taken, and to which we shall return,
none having a greater share than another. And further, above this, we have in common
reason, the Law, the Prophets, the very Sufferings of Christ, by which we were all without
exception created anew, who partake of the same Adam, and were led astray by the serpent
and slain by sin, and are saved by the heavenly Adam and brought back by the tree of shame
to the tree of life from whence we had fallen.</p>
<p>X. I was deceived too by the Ramah of Samuel, that little fatherland of the great man;
which was no dishonour to the Prophet, for it drew its honour not so much from itself as
from him; nor was he hindered on its account from being given to God before his birth, or
from uttering oracles, and foreseeing the future; nor only so, but also anointing Kings and
Priests, and judging the men of illustrious cities. I heard also of Saul, how while seeking his
father’s asses he found a kingdom. And even David himself was taken from the sheepfolds
to be the shepherd of Israel. What of Amos? Was he not, while a goatherd and scraper of
sycamore fruit entrusted with the gifts of prophecy? How is it that I have passed over Joseph,
who was both a slave and the giver of corn to Egypt, and the father of many myriads who
were promised before to Abraham? Aye and I was deceived by the Carmel of Elias, who
received the car of fire; and by the sheepskin of Elissæus that had more power than a silken
web or than gold forced into garments. I was deceived by the desert of John, which held
the greatest among them that are born of women, with that clothing, that food, that girdle,
which we know. And I ventured even beyond these, and found God Himself the Patron of
my rusticity. I will range myself with Bethlehem, and will share the ignominy of the Manger;
for since you refuse on this account honour to God, it is no wonder that on the same account
you despise His herald also. And I will bring up to you the Fishermen, and the poor to
whom the Gospel is preached, as preferred before many rich. Will you ever leave off priding
yourselves upon your cities? Will you ever revere that wilderness which you abominate and
despise? I do not yet say that gold has its birthplace in sand; nor that translucent stones are
the product and gifts of rocks; for if to these I should oppose all that is dishonourable in
cities perhaps it would be to no good end that I should use my freedom of speech.</p>
<p>XI. But perhaps some one who is very circumscribed and carnally minded will say, “But
our herald is a stranger and a foreigner.” What of the Apostles? Were not they strangers
to the many nations and cities among whom they were divided, that the Gospel might have
free course everywhere, that nothing might miss the illumination of the Threefold Light, or
be unenlightened by the Truth; but that the night of ignorance might be dissolved for those
who sat in darkness and the shadow of death? You have heard the words of Paul, “that we
might go the Gentiles, and they to the Circumcision.”3773 Be it that Judæa is Peter’s home;

what has Paul in common with the Gentiles, Luke with Achaia, Andrew with Epirus, John
with Ephesus, Thomas with India, Marc with Italy, or the rest, not to go into particulars,
with those to whom they went? So that you must either blame them or excuse me, or else
prove that you, the ambassadors of the true Gospel, are being insulted by trifling. But since
I have argued with you in a petty way about these matters, I will now proceed to take a larger
and more philosophic view of them.</p>
<p>XII. My friend, every one that is of high mind has one Country, the Heavenly Jerusalem,
in which we store up our Citizenship. All have one family—if you look at what is here below
the dust—or if you look higher, that Inbreathing of which we are partakers, and which we
were bidden to keep, and with which I must stand before my Judge to give an account of
my heavenly nobility, and of the Divine Image. Everyone then is noble who has guarded
this through virtue and consent to his Archetype. On the other hand, everyone is ignoble
who has mingled with evil, and put upon himself another form, that of the serpent. And
these earthly countries and families are the playthings of this our temporary life and scene.
For our country is whatever each may have first occupied, either as tyrant, or in misfortune;
and in this we are all alike strangers and pilgrims, however much we may play with names.
And the family is accounted noble which is either rich from old days, or is recently raised;
and of ignoble birth that which is of poor parents, either owing to misfortune or to want of
ambition. For how can a nobility be given from above which is at one time beginning and
at another coming to an end; and which is not given to some, but is bestowed on others by
letters patent? Such is my mind on this matter. Therefore I leave it to you to pride yourself
on tombs or in myths, and I endeavour as far as I can, to purify myself from deceits, that I
may keep if possible my nobility, or else may recover it.</p>
<p>XIII. It is thus then and for these reasons that I, who am small and of a country without
repute, have come upon you, and that not of my own accord, nor self-sent, like many of
those who now seize upon the chief places; but because I was invited, and compelled, and
have followed the scruples of my conscience and the Call of the Spirit. If it be otherwise,
may I continue to fight here to no purpose, and deliver no one from his error, but may they
obtain their desire who seek the barrenness of my soul, if I lie. But since I am come, and
perchance with no contemptible power (if I may boast myself a little of my folly), which of
those who are insatiable have I copied, what have I emulated of opportunism, although I
have such examples, even apart from which it is hard and rare not to be bad? Concerning
what churches or property have I disputed with you; though you have more than enough
of both, and the others too little? What imperial edict have we rejected and emulated? What
rulers have we fawned upon against you? Whose boldness have we denounced? And what
has been done on the other side against me? “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge,” even

<pb n="666"/>
then I said, for I remembered in season the words of Stephen,3774 and so I pray now. Being
reviled, we bless: being blasphemed we retreat.3775</p>
<p>XIV. And if I am doing wrong in this, that when tyrannized over I endure it, forgive
me this wrong; I have borne to be tyrannized over by others too; and I am thankful that my
moderation has brought upon me the charge of folly. For I reckon thus, using considerations
altogether higher than any of yours; what a mere fraction are these trials of the spittings and
blows which Christ, for Whom and by Whose aid we encounter these dangers, endured. I
do not count them, taken altogether, worth the one crown of thorns which robbed our
conqueror of his crown, for whose sake also I learn that I am crowned for the hardness of
life. I do not reckon them worth the one reed by which the rotten empire was destroyed;
of the gall alone, the vinegar alone, by which we were cured of the bitter taste; of the gentleness
alone which He shewed in His Passion. Was He betrayed with a kiss? He reproves
with a kiss, but smites not. Is he suddenly arrested? He reproaches indeed, but follows; and
if through zeal thou cuttest off the ear of Malchus with the sword, He will be angry, and will
restore it. And if one flee in a linen sheet,3776 he will defend him. And if you ask for the
fire of Sodom upon his captors, he will not pour it forth; and if he take a thief hanging upon
the cross for his crime he will bring him into Paradise through His Goodness. Let all the
acts of one that loves men be loving, as were all the sufferings of Christ, to which we could
add nothing greater than, when God even died for us, to refuse on our part to forgive even
the smallest wrongs of our fellowmen.</p>
<p>XV. Moreover this also I reckoned and still reckon with myself; and do you see if it is
not quite correct. I have often discussed it with you before. These men have the houses,
but we the Dweller in the house; they the Temples, we the God; and besides it is ours to be
living temples of the Living God, lively sacrifices, reasonable burnt-offerings, perfect sacrifices,
yea, gods through the adoration of the Trinity. They have the people, we the Angels;
they rash boldness, we faith; they threatenings, we prayer; they smiting, we endurance; they
gold and silver, we the pure word. “Thou hast built for thyself a wide house and large
chambers (recognize the words of Scripture), a house celled and pierced with windows.”3777
But not yet is this loftier than my faith, and than the heavens to which I am being borne
onwards. Is mine a little flock? But it is not being carried over a precipice. Is mine a narrow
fold? But it is unapproachable by wolves; it cannot be entered by a robber, nor climbed by
thieves and strangers. I shall yet see it, I know well, wider. And many of those who are now
wolves, I must reckon among my sheep, and perhaps even amongst the shepherds. This is

the glad tidings brought me by the Good Shepherd, for Whose sake I lay down my life for
the sheep. I fear not for the little flock; for it is seen at a glance. I know my sheep and am
known of mine. Such are they that know God and are known of God. My sheep hear my
voice, which I have heard from the oracles of God, which I have been taught by the Holy
Fathers, which I have taught alike on all occasions, not conforming myself to the fortune,
and which I will never cease to teach; in which I was born, and in which I will depart.</p>
<p>XVI. These I call by name (for they are not nameless like the stars which are numbered
and have names),3778 and they follow me, for I rear them up beside the waters of rest; and
they follow every such shepherd, whose voice they love to hear, as you see; but a stranger
they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have a habit of distinguishing the
voice of their own from that of strangers. They will flee from Valentinus3779 with his division
of one into two, refusing to believe that the Creator is other than the Good. They will flee
from Depth and Silence, and the mythical Æons, that are verily worthy of Depth and Silence.
They will flee from Marcion’s3780 god, compounded of elements and numbers; from
Montanus’3781 evil and feminine spirit; from the matter and darkness of Manes;3782 from

<note type="footnote">3779 Valentinus, a celebrated Gnostic leader of the Second Century, was one of the first Gnostics who taught
in Rome. He was probably of Ægypto-Jewish descent, and was educated at Alexandria. He died in Cyprus about
160. His system is a very curious one, giving the reins to the wildest vagaries of the imagination. The original
eternal Being, or Absolute Existence, he called Bythos or Depth; and to this he assigned as a wife Sige or Silence.
From this union there sprang thirty Æons or Emanations, who unfolded the Attributes of the Deity and created
the world.</note>
<note type="footnote">3780 Marcion was a contemporary of Valentinus. He was a native of Sinope in Pontus, of which city his
father was Bishop. He supposed Three Principles, the Good God, Who was first revealed by Christ; the Just
Creator, Who is the “hot tempered and imperfect” God of the Jews; and the intrinsically evil Hyle or Matter,
which is ruled by the Devil. He also distinguished two Messiahs; one a mere warrior prince sent by the Jewish
God to restore Israel; the other sent by the Good God for the delivery of the whole human race.</note>

whole Church into confusion. He was very early anathematized by Bishops and Synods of Asia, but he carried

Novatus’3783 boasting and wordy assumption of purity; from the analysis and confusion of
Sabellius,3784 and if I may use the expression, his absorption, contracting the Three into
One, instead of defining the One in Three Personalities; from the difference of natures
taught by Arius3785 and his followers, and their new Judaism, confining the Godhead to the
Unbegotten; from Photinus3786 earthly Christ, who took his beginning from Mary. But
they worship the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, One Godhead; God the Father,
God the Son and (do not be angry) God the Holy Ghost, One Nature in Three Personalities,
intellectual, perfect, Self-existent, numerically separate, but not separate in Godhead.</p>
<p>XVII. These words let everyone who threatens me to-day concede to me; the rest let
whoever will claim. The Father will not endure to be deprived of the Son, nor the Son of
the Holy Ghost. Yet that must happen if They are confined to time, and are created Beings…
for that which is created is not God. Neither will I bear to be deprived of my consecration;
One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism. If this be cancelled, from whom shall I get a
second? What say you, you who destroy Baptism or repeat it? Can a man be spiritual
without the Spirit? Has he a share in the Spirit who does not honour the Spirit? Can he
honour Him who is baptized into a creature and a fellow-servant? It is not so; it is not so;
for all your talk. I will not play Thee false, O Unoriginate Father, or Thee O Only-begotten
Word, or Thee O Holy Ghost. I know Whom I have confessed, and whom I have renounced,
and to Whom I have joined myself. I will not allow myself, after having been taught the
words of the faithful, to learn also those of the unfaithful; to confess the truth, and then
range myself with falsehood; to come down for consecration and to go back even less hallowed;
having been baptised that I might live, to be killed by the water, like infants who die
in the very birthpangs, and receive death simultaneously with birth. Why make me at once

<head>Oration XXXIV.</head>
<p>On the Arrival of the Egyptians.</p>
<p>This Oration was preached at Constantinople in 380, under the following circumstances:
Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, had sent a mission of five of his Suffragans to consecrate the
impostor Maximus to the Throne occupied by Gregory. This had led to much trouble, but in
the end the intruder had been expelled and banished. Shortly afterwards an Egyptian fleet,
probably the regular corn ships, had arrived at Constantinople, apparently on the day before
a Festival. The crews of the ships, landing next day to go to Church, passed by the numerous
Churches held by the Arians, and betook themselves to the little Anastasia. S. Gregory felt
himself moved to congratulate them specially on such an act, after what had recently passed,
and accordingly pronounced the following discourse.</p>
<p>I. I will address myself as is right to those who have come from Egypt; for they have
come here eagerly, having overcome illwill by zeal, from that Egypt which is enriched by
the River, raining out of the earth, and like the sea in its season,—if I too may follow in my
small measure those who have so eloquently spoken of these matters; and which is also enriched
by Christ my Lord, Who once was a fugitive into Egypt, and now is supplied by Egypt;
the first, when He fled from Herod’s massacre of the children;3788 and now by the love of
the fathers for their children, by Christ the new Food of those who hunger after good;3789
the greatest alms of corn of which history speaks and men believe; the Bread which came
down from heaven and giveth life to the world, that life which is indestructible and indissoluble,
concerning Whom I now seem to hear the Father saying, Out of Egypt have I called
My Son.3790</p>
<p>II. For from you hath sounded forth the Word to all men; healthfully believed and
preached; and you are the best bringers of fruit of all men, specially of those who now hold
the right faith, as far as I know, who am not only a lover of such food, but also its distributor,
and not at home only but also abroad. For you indeed supply bodily food to peoples and
cities so far as your lovingkindness reaches; and you supply spiritual food also, not to a
particular people, nor to this or that city, circumscribed by narrow boundaries, though its
people may think it very illustrious, but to almost the whole world. And you bring the
remedy not for famine of bread or thirst of water,3791 which is no very terrible famine—and
to avoid it is easy; but to a famine of hearing the Word of the Lord, which it is most miserable

to suffer, and a most laborious matter to cure at the present time, because iniquity hath
abounded,3792 and scarce anywhere do I find its genuine healers.</p>
<p>III. Such was Joseph your Superintendent of corn measures, whom I may call ours also;
who by his surpassing wisdom was able both to foresee the famine and to cure it by decrees
of government, healing the ill-favoured and starving kine by means of the fair and fat.3793
And indeed you may understand by Joseph which you will, either the great lover and creator
and namesake of immortality or his successor in throne and word and hoary hair, our new
Peter,3794 not inferior in virtue or fame to him by whom the middle course was destroyed
and crushed, though it still wriggles a little weakly, like the tail of a snake after it is cut off;
the one of whom, after having departed this life in a good old age after many conflicts and
wrestlings, looks upon us from above, I well know, and reaches a hand to those who are labouring
for the right: and this the more, in proportion as he is freed from his bonds; and
the other is hastening to the same end or dissolution of life, and is already drawing near the
dwellers in heaven, but is still so far in the flesh as is needed to give the last aids to the Word,
and to take his journey with richer provision.</p>
<p>IV. Of these great men and doctors and soldiers of the truth and victors, you are the
nurslings and offspring; of these neither times nor tyrants, reason nor envy, nor fear, nor
accuser, nor slanderer, whether waging open war against them, or plotting secretly; nor any
who appeared to be of our side, nor any stranger, nor gold—that hidden tyrant, through
which now almost everything is turned upside down and made to depend on the hazard of
a die; nor flatteries nor threats, nor long and distant exiles (for they only could not be affected
by confiscation, because of their great riches, which were—to possess nothing) nor anything
else, whether absent or present or expected, could induce to take the worse part, and to be
anywise traitor to the Trinity, or to suffer loss of the Godhead. On the contrary indeed,
they grew strong by dangers, and became more zealous for true religion. For to suffer thus
for Christ adds to one’s love, and is as it were an earnest to high-souled men of further
conflicts. These, O Egypt, are thy present tales and wonders.</p>
<p>V. Once thou didst praise me thy Mendesian Goats, and thy Memphite Apis, a fatted
and fleshy calf, and the rites of Isis, and the mutilations of Osiris, and thy venerable Serapis,
a log that was honoured by myths and ages and the madness of its worshippers, as some
unknown and heavenly matter, however it may have been aided by falsehood; and things
yet more shameful than these, multiform images of monstrous beasts and creeping things,
all of which Christ and the heralds of Christ have conquered, both the others who have been
illustrious in their own times, and also the Fathers whom I have named just now; by whom,

O admirable country, thou art more famous today than all others put together, whether in
ancient or modern history.</p>
<p>VI. Wherefore I embrace and salute thee, O noblest of peoples and most Christian, and
of warmest piety, and worthy of thy leaders; for I can find nothing greater to say of thee
than this, nor anything by which better to welcome thee. And I greet thee, to a small extent
with my tongue, but very heartily with the movements of my affections.3795 O my people,
for I call you mine, as of one mind and one faith, instructed by the same Fathers, and adoring
the same Trinity. My people, for mine thou art, though it seem not so to those who envy
me. And that they who are in this case may be the deeper wounded, see, I give the right
hand of fellowship before so many witnesses, seen and unseen. And I put away the old
calumny by this new act of kindness. O my people, for mine thou art, though in saying so
I, who am least of all men, am claiming for myself that which is greatest. For such is the
grace of the Spirit that it makes of equal honour those who are of one mind. O my people,
for mine thou art, though it be afar, because we are divinely joined together,3796 and in a
manner wholly different to the unions of carnal people; for bodies are united in place, but
souls are fitted together by the Spirit. O my people, who didst formerly study how to suffer
for Christ, but now if thou wilt hearken unto me, wilt study not to do aught, but to consider
the power of doing to be a sufficient gain, and to deem that thou art offering a sacrifice to
Christ, as in those days of thy endurance so in these of meekness. O people to whom the
Lord hath prepared Himself to do good, as to do evil to thine enemies.3797 O people, whom
the Lord hath chosen to Himself out of all peoples; O people who art graven upon the hands
of the Lord, to whom saith the Lord, Thou art My Will; and, Thy gates are carved work, and
all the rest that is said to them that are being saved. O people;—nay, marvel not at my insatiability
that I repeat your name so often; for I delight in this continual naming of you, like
those who can never have enough of their enjoyment of certain spectacles or sounds.</p>
<p>VII. But, O people of God and mine, beautiful also was your yesterday’s assembly,
which you held upon the sea, and pleasant, if any sight ever was, to the eyes, when I saw the
sea like a forest, and hidden by a cloud made with hands, and the beauty and speed of your
ships, as though ordered for a procession, and the slight breeze astern, as though purposely
escorting you, and wafting to the City your city of the Sea. Yet the present assembly which
we now behold is more beautiful and more magnificent. For you have not hastened to
mingle with the larger number, nor have you reckoned religion by numbers, nor endured
to be a mere unorganized rabble, rather than a people purified by the Word of God; but
having, as is right, rendered to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, ye have offered besides to

God the things that are God’s; to the former Custom, to the latter Fear; and after feeding
the people with your cargoes, you yourselves have come to be fed by us. For we also distribute
corn, and our distribution is perhaps not worth less than yours. Come eat of my Bread and
drink of the Wine which I have mingled for you.3798 I join with Wisdom in bidding you
to my table. For I commend your good feeling, and I hasten to meet your ready mind, because
ye came to us as to your own harbour, running to your like; and ye valued the kindred
Faith, and thought it monstrous that, while they who insult higher things are in harmony
with each other and think alike, and think to make good each man’s individual falsehood
by their common conspiracy, like ropes which get strength from being twisted together; yet
you should not meet nor combine with those who are of the same mind, with whom it is
more reasonable that you should associate, for we gather in the Godhead also. And that
you may see that not in vain have you come to us, and that you have not brought up in a
port among strangers and foreigners, but amongst your own people, and have been well
guided by the Holy Ghost; we will discourse to you briefly concerning God; and do you recognize
your own, like those who distinguish their kindred by the ensigns of their arms.</p>
<p>VIII. I find two highest differences in things that exist, viz.:—Rule, and Service; not
such as among us either tyranny has cut or poverty has severed, but which nature has distinguished,
if any like to use this word. For That which is First is also above nature. Of
these the former is creative, and originating, and unchangeable; but the other is created,
and subject and changing; or to speak yet more plainly, the one is above time, and the other
subject to time. The Former is called God, and subsists in Three Greatest, namely, the Cause,
the Creator, and the Perfecter; I mean the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are
neither so separated from one another as to be divided in nature, nor so contracted as to be
circumscribed by a single person; the one alternative being that of the Arian madness, the
other that of the Sabellian heresy; but they are on the one hand more single than what is
altogether divided, and on the other more abundant than what is altogether singular. The
other division is with us, and is called Creation, though one may be exalted above another
according to the proportion of their nearness to God.</p>
<p>IX. This being so, if any be on the Lord’s side let him come with us,3799 and let us adore
the One Godhead in the Three; not ascribing any name of humiliation to the unapproachable
Glory, but having the exaltations of the Triune God continually in our mouth.3800 For since
we cannot properly describe even the greatness of Its Nature, on account of Its infinity and
undefinableness, how can we assert of It humiliation? But if any one be estranged from
God, and therefore divideth the One Supreme Substance into an inequality of Natures, it

were marvellous if such an one were not cut in sunder by the sword, and his portion appointed
with the unbelievers,3801 reaping any evil fruit of his evil thought both now and hereafter.</p>
<p>X. What must we say of the Father, Whom by common consent all who have been
preoccupied with natural conceptions share, although He hath endured the beginnings of
dishonour, having been first divided by ancient innovation into the Good and the Creator.
And of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, see how simply and concisely we shall discourse. If
any one could say of Either that He was mutable or subject to change; or that either in time,
or place, or power, or energy He could be measured; or that He was not naturally good, or
not Self-moved, or not a free agent, or a Minister, or a Hymnsinger; or that He feared, or
was a recipient of freedom, or was not counted with God; let him prove this and we will
acquiesce, and will be glorified by the Majesty of our Fellow Servants, though we lose our
God. But if all that the Father has belongs likewise to the Son, except Causality; and all that
is the Son’s belongs also to the Spirit, except His Sonship, and whatsoever is spoken of Him
as to Incarnation for me a man, and for my salvation, that, taking of mine, He may impart
His own by this new commingling; then cease your babbling, though so late, O ye sophists
of vain talk that falls at once to the ground; for why will ye die O House of Israel?3802—if I
may mourn for you in the words of Scripture.</p>
<p>XI. For my part I revere also the Titles of the Word, which are so many, and so high
and great, which even the demons respect. And I revere also the Equal Rank of the Holy
Ghost; and I fear the threat pronounced against those who blaspheme Him. And blasphemy
is not the reckoning Him God, but the severing Him from the Godhead. And here you
must remark that That which is blasphemed is Lord, and That which is avenged is the Holy
Ghost, evidently as Lord. I cannot bear to be unenlightened after my Enlightenment, by
marking with a different stamp any of the Three into Whom I was baptized; and thus to be
indeed buried in the water, and initiated not into Regeneration, but into death.</p>
<p>XII. I dare to utter something, O Trinity; and may pardon be granted to my folly, for
the risk is to my soul. I too am an Image of God, of the Heavenly Glory, though I be placed
on earth. I cannot believe that I am saved by one who is my equal. If the Holy Ghost is not
God, let Him first be made God, and then let Him deify me His equal. But now what deceit
this is on the part of grace, or rather of the givers of grace, to believe in God and to come
away godless; by one set of questions and confessions leading to another set of conclusions.
Alas for this fair fame, if after the Laver I am blackened, if I am to see those who are not yet
cleansed brighter than myself; if I am cheated by the heresy of my Baptizer; if I seek for the
stronger Spirit and find Him not. Give me a second Font before you think evil of the first.
Why do you grudge me a complete regeneration? Why do you make me, who am the Temple
<note type="footnote">3801 Luke xii. 46.</note>
<note type="footnote">3802 Ezek. xviii. 31.</note>

<pb n="675"/>
of the Holy Ghost as of God, the habitation of a creature? Why do you honour part of what
belongs to me, and dishonour part, judging falsely of the Godhead, to cut me off from the
Gift, or rather to cut me in two by the gift? Either honour the Whole, or dishonour the
Whole, O new Theologian, that, if you are wicked, you may at any rate be consistent with
yourself, and not judge unequally of an equal nature.</p>
<p>XIII. To sum up my discourse:—Glorify Him with the Cherubim, who unite the Three
Holies into One Lord,3803 and so far indicate the Primal Substance as their wings open to
the diligent. With David be enlightened, who said to the Light, In Thy Light shall we see
Light,3804 that is, in the Spirit we shall see the Son; and what can be of further reaching ray?
With John thunder, sounding forth nothing that is low or earthly concerning God, but what
is high and heavenly, Who is in the beginning, and is with God, and is God the Word,3805
and true God of the true Father, and not a good fellow-servant honoured only with the title
of Son; and the Other Comforter (other, that is, from the Speaker, Who was the Word of
God). And when you read, I and the Father are One,3806 keep before your eyes the Unity
of Substance; but when you see, “We will come to him, and make Our abode with him,”3807
remember the distinction of Persons; and when you see the Names, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, think of the Three Personalities.</p>
<p>XIV. With Luke be inspired as you study the Acts of the Apostles. Why do you range
yourself with Ananias and Sapphira, those vain embezzlers (if indeed the theft of one’s own
property be a vain thing) and that by appropriating, not silver nor any other cheap and
worthless thing, like a wedge of gold,3808 or a didrachma, as did of old a rapacious soldier;
but stealing the Godhead Itself, and lying, not to men but to God, as you have heard. What?
Will you not reverence even the authority of the Spirit Who breathes upon whom, and
when, and as He wills? He comes upon Cornelius and his companions before Baptism, to
others after Baptism, by the hands of the Apostles; so that from both sides, both from the
fact that He comes in the guise of a Master and not of a Servant, and from the fact of His
being sought to make perfect, the Godhead of the Spirit is testified.</p>
<p>XV. Speak of God with Paul, who was caught up to the third Heaven,3809 and who
sometimes counts up the Three Persons, and that in varied order, not keeping the same
order, but reckoning one and the same Person now first, now second, now third; and for

what purpose? Why, to shew the equality of the Nature. And sometimes he mentions Three,
sometimes Two or One, became That which is not mentioned is included. And sometimes
he attributes the operation of God to the Spirit, as in no respect different from Him, and
sometimes instead of the Spirit he brings in Christ; and at times he separates the Persons
saying, “One God, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things, and we by Him;”3810 at other times he brings together the one Godhead,
“For of Him and through Him and in Him are all things;”3811 that is, through the Holy
Ghost, as is shown by many places in Scripture. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XXXVII.</head>
<p>On the Words of the Gospel, “When Jesus Had Finished These Sayings,” Etc.—S.
Matt. xix. 1</p>
<p>I. Jesus Who Chose The Fishermen, Himself also useth a net, and changeth place for
place. Why? Not only that He may gain more of those who love God by His visitation; but
also, as it seems to me, that He may hallow more places. To the Jews He becomes as a Jew
that He may gain the Jews; to them that are under the Law as under the Law, that He may
redeem them that are under the Law; to the weak as weak, that He may save the weak. He
is made all things to all men that He may gain all. Why do I say, All things to all men? For
even that which Paul could not endure to say of himself I find that the Saviour suffered.
For He is made not only a Jew, and not only doth He take to Himself all monstrous and vile
names, but even that which is most monstrous of all, even very sin and very curse; not that
He is such, but He is called so. For how can He be sin, Who setteth us free from sin; and
how can He be a curse, Who redeemeth us from the curse of the Law?3812 But it is in order
that He may carry His display of humility even to this extent, and form us to that humility
which is the producer of exaltation. As I said then, He is made a Fisherman; He condescendeth
to all; He casteth the net; He endureth all things, that He may draw up the fish from
the depths, that is, Man who is swimming in the unsettled and bitter waves of life.</p>
<p>II. Therefore now also, when He had finished these sayings He departed from Galilee
and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan; He dwelleth well in Galilee, in order that
the people which sat in darkness may see great Light.3813 He removeth to Judea in order
that He may persuade people to rise up from the Letter and to follow the Spirit. He teacheth,
now on a mountain; now He discourseth on a plain; now He passeth over into a ship; now
He rebuketh the surges. And perhaps He goes to sleep, in order that He may bless sleep
also; perhaps He is tired that He may hallow weariness also; perhaps He weeps that He may
make tears blessed. He removeth from place to place, Who is not contained in any place;
the timeless, the bodiless, the uncircumscript, the same Who was and is; Who was both
above time, and came under time, and was invisible and is seen. He was in the beginning
and was with God, and was God.3814 The word Was occurs the third time to be confirmed
by number. What He was He laid aside; what He was not He assumed; not that He became
two, but He deigned to be One made out of the two. For both are God, that which assumed,
and that which was assumed; two Natures meeting in One, not two Sons (let us not give a
false account of the blending). He who is such and so great—but what has befallen me? I

<pb n="678"/>
have fallen into human language. For how can So Great be said of the Absolute, and how
can That which is without quantity be called Such? But pardon the word, for I am speaking
of the greatest things with a limited instrument. And That great and long-suffering and
formless and bodiless Nature will endure this, namely, my words as if of a body, and weaker
than the truth. For if He condescended to Flesh, He will also endure such language.</p>
<p>III. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there, where the multitude
was greater. If He had abode upon His own eminence, if He had not condescended to infirmity,
if He had remained what He was, keeping Himself unapproachable and incompre-
hensible, a few perhaps would have followed Him—perhaps not even a few, possibly only
Moses—and He only so far as to see with difficulty the Back Parts of God.3815 For He
penetrated the cloud, either being placed outside the weight of the body or being withdrawn
from his senses; for how could he have gazed upon the subtlety, or the incorporeity, or I
know not how one should call it, of God, being incorporate and using material eyes? But
inasmuch as He strips Himself for us, inasmuch as He comes down (and speak of an exinanition,
as it were, a laying aside and a diminution of His glory), He becomes by this comprehensible.</p>
<p>IV. And pardon me meanwhile that I again suffer a human affection. I am filled with
indignation and grief for my Christ (and would that you might sympathize with me) when
I see my Christ dishonoured on this account on which He most merited honour. Is He on
this account to be dishonoured, tell me, that for you He was humble? Is He therefore a
Creature, because He careth for the creature? Is He therefore subject to time, because He
watches over those who are subject to time? Nay, He beareth all things, He endureth all
things.3816 And what marvel? He put up with blows, He bore spittings, He tasted gall for
my taste. And even now He bears to be stoned, not only by those who deal despitefully with
Him, but also by ourselves who seem to reverence Him. For to use corporeal names when
discoursing of the incorporeal is perhaps the part of those who deal despitefully and stone
Him; but pardon, I say again to our infirmity, for I do not willingly stone Him; but having
no other words to use, we use what we have. Thou art called the Word, and Thou art above
Word; Thou art above Light, yet art named Light; Thou art called Fire not as perceptible to
sense, but because Thou purgest light and worthless matter; a Sword, because Thou severest
the worse from the better; a Fan, because Thou purgest the threshing-floor, and blowest
away all that is light and windy, and layest up in the garner above all that is weighty and
full; an Axe, because Thou cuttest down the worthless fig-tree, after long patience, because
Thou cuttest away the roots of wickedness; the Door, because Thou bringest in; the Way,
because we go straight; the Sheep, because Thou art the Sacrifice; the High Priest, because

<note type="footnote">3816 1 Cor. xiii. 7.</note>

<pb n="679"/>
Thou offerest the Body the Son, because Thou art of the Father. Again I stir men’s tongues;
again some men rave against Christ, or rather against me, who have been deemed worthy
to be a herald of the Word. I am like John, The Voice of one crying in the wilderness3817—a
wilderness that once was dry, but now is only too populous.</p>
<p>V. But, as I was saying, to return to my argument; for this reason great multitudes followed
Him, because He condescended to our infirmities. What next? The Pharisees also,
it says, came unto Him, tempting Him, and saying unto Him, is it lawful for a man to put
away his wife for every cause? Again the Pharisees tempt Him; again they who read the Law
do not know the Law; again they who are expounders of the Law need others to teach them.
It was not enough that Sadducees should tempt Him concerning the Resurrection, and
Lawyers question Him about perfection, and the Herodians about the poll-tax, and others
about authority; but some one must also ask about Marriage at Him who cannot be tempted,
the Creator of wedlock, Him who from the First Cause made this whole race of mankind.
And He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read that He which made them at the
beginning made them male and female? He knoweth how to solve some of their questions
and to bridle others. When He is asked, By what authority doest thou these things? He
Himself, because of the utter ignorance of those who asked Him, replies with another
question; The baptism of John, was it from Heaven or of men? He on both sides entangles
His questioners, so that we also are able, following the example of Christ, sometimes to
check those who argue with us over-officiously, and with still more absurd questions to
solve the absurdity of their questions. For we too are wise in vanity at times, if I may boast
of the things of folly. But when He sees a question that calls for reasoning, then He does
not deem His questioners unworthy of prudent answers.</p>
<p>VI. The question which you have put seems to me to do honour to chastity, and to demand
a kind reply. Chastity, in respect of which I see that the majority of men are ill-disposed,
and that their laws are unequal and irregular. For what was the reason why they restrained
the woman, but indulged the man, and that a woman who practises evil against her
husband’s bed is an adulteress, and the penalties of the law for this are very severe; but if
the husband commits fornication against his wife, he has no account to give? I do not accept
this legislation; I do not approve this custom. They who made the Law were men, and
therefore their legislation is hard on women, since they have placed children also under the
authority of their fathers, while leaving the weaker sex uncared for. God doth not so; but
saith Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise;
that it may be well with thee; and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
Similarly He gave honour to good and punishment to evil. And, The blessing of a father
strengtheneth the houses of children, but the curse of a mother uprooteth the founda-
<note type="footnote">3817 Matt. iii. 3.</note>

<pb n="680"/>
tions.3818 See the equality of the legislation. There is one Maker of man and woman; one
debt is owed by children to both their parents.</p>
<p>VII. How then dost thou demand Chastity, while thou dost not thyself observe it? How
dost thou demand that which thou dost not give? How, though thou art equally a body,
dost thou legislate unequally? If thou enquire into the worse—The Woman Sinned, and so
did Adam.3819 The serpent deceived them both; and one was not found to be the stronger
and the other the weaker. But dost thou consider the better? Christ saves both by His Passion.
Was He made flesh for the Man? So He was also for the woman. Did He die for the
Man? The Woman also is saved by His death. He is called of the seed of David;3820 and so
perhaps you think the Man is honoured; but He is born of a Virgin, and this is on the Woman’s
side. They two, He says, shall be one Flesh; so let the one flesh have equal honour.
And Paul legislates for chastity by His example. How, and in what way? This Sacrament is
great, he says, But I speak concerning Christ and the Church.3821 It is well for the wife to
reverence Christ through her husband: and it is well for the husband not to dishonor the
Church through his wife. Let the wife, he says, see that she reverence her husband, for so
she does Christ; but also he bids the husband cherish his wife, for so Christ does the
Church.3822 Let us, then, give further consideration to this saying.</p>
<p>VIII. Churn milk and it will be butter;3823 examine this and perhaps you may find
something more nourishing in it. For I think that the Word here seems to deprecate second
marriage. For, if there were two Christs, there may be two husbands or two wives; but if
Christ is One, one Head of the Church, let there be also one flesh, and let a second be rejected;
and if it hinder the second what is to be said for a third? The first is law, the second is indulgence,
the third is transgression, and anything beyond this is swinish, such as has not even
many examples of its wickedness. Now the Law grants divorce for every cause; but Christ
not for every cause; but He allows only separation from the whore; and in all other things
He commands patience. He allows to put away the fornicatress, because she corrupts the
offspring; but in all other matters let us be patient and endure; or rather be ye3824 enduring
and patient, as many as have received the yoke of matrimony. If you see lines or marks
upon her, take away her ornaments; if a hasty tongue, restrain it; if a meretricious laugh,
make it modest; if immoderate expenditure or drink, reduce it; if unseasonable going out,

shackle it; if a lofty eye, chastise it. It is uncertain which is in danger, the separator or the
separated. Let thy fountain of water, it says, be only thine own, and let no stranger share it
with thee;3825 and, let the colt of thy favours and the stag of thy love company with thee;
do thou then take care not to be a strange river, nor to please others better than thine own
wife. But if thou be carried elsewhere, then thou makest a law of lewdness for thy partner
also. Thus saith the Saviour.</p>
<p>IX. But what of the Pharisees? To them this word seems harsh. Yes, for they are also
displeased at other noble words—both the older Pharisees, and the Pharisees of the present
day. For it is not only race, but disposition also that makes a Pharisee. Thus also I reckon
as an Assyrian or an Egyptian him who is ranged among these by his character. What then
say the Pharisees? If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. Is it
only now, O Pharisee, that thou understandest this, It is not good to marry?3826 Didst thou
not know it before when thou sawest widowhoods, and orphanhoods, and untimely deaths,
and mourning succeeding to shouting, and funerals coming upon weddings, and childlessness,
and all the comedy or tragedy that is connected with this? Either is most appropriate
language. It is good to marry; I too admit it, for marriage is honourable in all, and the bed
undefiled.3827 It is good for the temperate, not for those who are insatiable, and who desire
to give more than due honour to the flesh. When marriage is only marriage and conjunction
and the desire for a succession of children, marriage is honourable, for it brings into the
world more to please God. But when it kindles matter, and surrounds us with thorns, and
as it were discovers the way of vice, then I too say, It is not good to marry.</p>
<p>X. Marriage is honourable; but I cannot say that it is more lofty than virginity; for virginity
were no great thing if it were not better than a good thing. Do not however be angry,
ye women that are subject to the yoke. We must obey God rather than man. But be ye
bound together, both virgins and wives, and be one in the Lord, and each others’ adornment.
There would be no celibate if there were no marriage. For whence would the virgin have
passed into this life? Marriage would not have been venerable unless it had borne virgin
fruit to God and to life. Honour thou also thy mother, of whom thou wast born. Honour
thou also her who is of a mother and is a mother.3828 A mother she is not, but a Bride of
Christ she is. The visible beauty is not hidden, but that which is unseen is visible to God.
All the glory of the King’s Daughter is within,3829 clothed with golden fringes, embroidered
whether by actions or by contemplation. And she who is under the yoke, let her also in

some degree be Christ’s; and the virgin altogether Christ’s. Let the one be not entirely
chained to the world,3830 and let the other not belong to the world at all. For that which is
a part to the yoked, is to the virgin all in all. Hast thou chosen the life of Angels? Art thou
ranked among the unyoked? Sink not down to the flesh; sink not down to matter; be not
wedded to matter, while otherwise thou remainest unwedded. A lascivious eye guardeth
not virginity; a meretricious tongue mingles with the Evil One; feet that walk disorderly
accuse of disease or danger. Let the mind also be virgin; let it not rove about; let it not
wander; let it not carry in itself forms of evil things (for the form is a part of harlotry); let it
not make idols in its soul of hateful things.</p>
<p>XI. But He said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is
given. Do you see the sublimity of the matter? It is found to be nearly incomprehensible.
For surely it is more than carnal that that which is born of flesh should not beget to the
flesh. Surely it is Angelic that she who is bound to flesh should live not according to flesh,
but be loftier than her nature. The flesh bound her to the world, but reason led her up to
God. The flesh weighed her down, but reason gave her wings; the flesh bound her, but desire
loosed her. With thy whole soul, O Virgin, be intent upon God (I give this same injunction
to men and to women); and do not take the same view in other respects of what is honourable
as the mass of men do; of family, of wealth, of throne, of dynasty, of that beauty which shews
itself in complexion and composition of members, the plaything of time and disease. If
thou hast poured out upon God the whole of thy love; if thou hast not two objects of desire,
both the passing and the abiding, both the visible and the invisible, then thou hast been so
pierced by the arrow of election, and hast so learned the beauty of the Bridegroom, that
thou too canst say with the bridal drama and song, thou art sweetness and altogether loveliness.</p>
<p>XII. You see how streams confined in lead pipes, through being much compressed and
carried to one point, often so far depart from the nature of water that that which is pushed
from behind will often flow constantly upwards. So if thou confine thy desire, and be wholly
joined to God, thou wilt not fall downward; thou wilt not be dissipated; thou wilt remain
entirely Christ’s, until thou see Christ thy Bridegroom. Keep thyself unapproachable, both
in word and work and life, and thought and action. From all sides the Evil One interferes
with thee; he spies thee everywhere, where he may strike, where wound thee; let him not
find anything bared and ready to his stroke. The purer he sees thee, the more he strives to
stain thee, for the stains on a shining garment are more conspicuous. Let not eye draw eye,
nor laughter, nor familiarity night, lest night bring destruction. For that which is gradually
drawn away and stolen, works a mischief which is unperceived at the time, but yet attains
to the consummation of wickedness.</p>
<note type="footnote">3830 Luke viii. 14.</note>

<pb n="683"/>
<p>XIII. All men, He saith, cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. When
you hear this, It is given, do not understand it in a heretical fashion, and bring in differences
of nature, the earthly and the spiritual and the mixed. For there are people so evilly disposed
as to think that some men are of an utterly ruined nature, and some of a nature which is
saved, and that others are of such a disposition as their will may lead them to, either to the
better, or to the worse. For that men may have a certain aptitude, one more, another less,
I too admit; but not that this aptitude alone suffices for perfection, but that it is reason which
calls this out, that nature may proceed to action, just as fire is produced when a flint is struck
with iron. When you hear To whom it is given, add, And it is given to those who are called
and to those who incline that way. For when you hear, Not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy,3831 I counsel you to think the same. For since
there are some who are so proud of their successes that they attribute all to themselves and
nothing to Him that made them and gave them wisdom and supplied them with good; such
are taught by this word that even to wish well needs help from God; or rather that even to
choose what is right is divine and a gift of the mercy of God. For it is necessary both that
we should be our own masters and also that our salvation should be of God. This is why
He saith not of him that willeth; that is, not of him that willeth only, nor of him that runneth
only, but also of God. That sheweth mercy. Next; since to will also is from God, he has attributed
the whole to God with reason. However much you may run, however much you
may wrestle, yet you need one to give the crown. Except the Lord build the house, they laboured
in vain that built it: Except the Lord keep the city, in vain they watched that keep
it.3832 I know, He says, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,3833 nor
the victory to the fighters, nor the harbours to the good sailors; but to God it belongs both
to work victory, and to bring the barque safe to port.</p>
<p>XIV. In another place it is also said and understood, and perhaps it is necessary that I
should add it as follows to what has already been said, in order that I may impart to you
also my wealth. The Mother of the Sons of Zebedee, in an impulse of parental affection,
asked a thing in ignorance of the measure of what she was asking,3834 but pardonably,
through the excess of her love and of the kindness due to her children. For there is nothing
more affectionate than a Mother,—and I speak of this that I may lay down a law for honouring
Mothers. Their mother, then, asked Jesus that they might sit, the one on His right hand,
the other on his left. But what saith the Saviour? He first asks if they can drink the Cup
Which He Himself was about to drink; and when this was professed, and the Saviour accepted
<note type="footnote">3831 Rom. ix. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">3832 Ps. cxxvii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">3833 Eccles. ix. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">3834 Matt. xx. 20, etc.</note>

<pb n="684"/>
the profession (for He knew that they were being perfected by the same, or rather that they
would be perfected thereby); what saith He? “They shall drink the cup; but to sit on My
right hand and on My left—it is not Mine, He saith, to give this, but to whom it hath been
given.” Is then the ruling mind nothing? Nothing the labour? Nothing the reasoning?
Nothing the philosophy? Nothing the fasting? Nothing the vigils, the sleeping on the
ground, the shedding floods of tears? Is it for nothing of these, but in accordance with some
election by lot, that a Jeremias is sanctified, and others are estranged from the womb?</p>
<p>XV. I fear lest some monstrous reasoning may come in, as of the soul having lived
elsewhere, and then having been bound to this body, and that it is from that other life that
some receive the gift of prophecy, and others are condemned, namely, those who lived
badly. But since such a conception is too absurd, and contrary to the traditions of the Church
(others if they like may play with such doctrines, but it is unsafe for us to play with them);
we must in this place too add to the words “To whom it hath been given,” this, “who are
worthy;” who have not only received this character from the Father, but have given it to
themselves.</p>
<p>XVI. For there are eunuchs which were made eunuchs from their mother’s womb, etc.
I should very much like to be able to say something bold about eunuchs. Be not proud, ye
who are eunuchs by nature. For, in point of self-restraint, this is perhaps unwilling. For it
has not come to the test, nor has your self-restraint been proved by trial. For the good which
is by nature is not a subject of merit; that which is the result of purpose is laudable. What
merit has fire for burning, for it is its nature to burn? What merit has water for falling, a
property given to it by its Maker? What thanks does the snow get for its coldness, or the
sun for its shining?—It shines even if it does not wish. Claim merit if you please by willing
the better things. You will claim it if, being carnal, you make yourself spiritual; if, while
drawn down by the leaden flesh, you receive wings from reason; if though lowly born, you
are found to be heavenly; if while chained down to the flesh, you shew yourself superior to
the flesh.</p>
<p>XVII. Since then, natural chastity is not meritorious, I demand something else from
the eunuchs. Do not go a whoring in respect of the Godhead. Having been wedded to
Christ, do not dishonour Christ. Being perfected by the spirit, do not make the Spirit your
own equal. If I yet pleased men, says Paul, I should not be the servant of Christ.3835 If I
worshipped a creature, I should not be called a Christian. For why is Christianity precious?
Is it not that Christ is God, unless my mingling with Him in love is a mere human passion?
And yet I honour Peter, but I am not called a Petrine; and Paul, but have never been called
a Pauline. I cannot allow myself to be named after a man, who am born of God. So then,
if it is because you believe Him to be God that you are called a Christian, may you ever be
<note type="footnote">3835 Galat. i. 10.</note>

<pb n="685"/>
so called, and may you remain in both the name and the thing; but if you are called from
Christ only because you have an affection for Him, you attribute no more to him than other
names which are given from some practice or fact.</p>
<p>XVIII. Consider those men who are devoted to horse racing. They are named after the
colours and the sides on which they have placed themselves. You know the names without
my mentioning them. If it is thus that you have got the name of Christian, the mere title is
a very small thing even though you pride yourself upon it. But if it is because you believe
Him to be God, shew your faith by your works. If the Son is a creature, even now also you
are worshipping the creature instead of the Creator. If the Holy Ghost is a creature, you
are baptized in vain, and are only sound on two sides, or rather not even on them; but on
one you are altogether in danger. Imagine the Trinity to be a single pearl, alike on all sides
and equally glistening. If any part of the pearl be injured; the whole beauty of the stone is
gone. So when you dishonour the Son in order to honour the Father, He does not accept
your honour. The Father doth not glory in the dishonour of the Son. If a wise Son maketh
a glad Father,3836 how much more doth the honour of the Son become that of the Father!
And if you also accept this saying, My Son, glory not in the dishonour of thy Father,3837
similarly the Father doth not glory in the Son’s dishonour. If you dishonour the Holy Ghost,
the Son receiveth not your honour. For though He be not of the Father in the same way as
the Son, yet He is of the same Father. Either honour the whole or dishonour the whole, so
as to have a consistent mind. I cannot accept your half piety. I would have you altogether
pious, but in the way that I desire. Pardon my affection: I am grieved even for those who
hate me. You were one of my members, even though you are now cut off: perhaps you will
again become a member; and therefore I speak kindly. Thus much for the sake of the Eunuchs,
that they may be chaste in respect of the Godhead.</p>
<p>XIX. For it is not only bodily sin which is called fornication and adultery, but any sin
you have committed, and especially transgression against that which is divine. Perhaps you
ask how we can prove this:—They went a whoring, it says, with their own inventions.3838
Do you see an impudent act of fornication? And again, They committed adultery in the
wood.3839 See you a kind of adulterous religion? Do not then commit spiritual adultery,
while keeping your bodies chaste. Do not shew that it is unwillingly you are chaste in body,
by not being chaste where you can commit fornication. Why have you done your impiety?
Why are you hurried to vice, so that it is all one to call a man a Eunuch or a villain? Place
yourselves on the side of men, and, even though so late, have some manly thoughts. Avoid

the women’s apartments; do not let the disgrace of proclamation be added to the disgrace
of the name. Would you have us persevere a little longer in this discourse, or are you tired
with what we have said? Nay, by what follows let even the eunuchs be honoured. For the
word is one of praise.</p>
<p>XX. There are, He says, some eunuchs which were so born from their mother’s womb;
and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men; and there be eunuchs which
have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive
it, let him receive it. I think that the discourse would sever itself from the body, and represent
higher things by bodily figures; for to stop the meaning at bodily eunuchs would be small
and very weak, and unworthy of the Word; and we must understand in addition something
worthy of the Spirit. Some, then, seem by nature to incline to good. And when I speak of
nature, I am not slighting free will, but supposing both—an aptitude for good, and that
which brings the natural aptitude to effect. And there are others whom reason cleanses, by
cutting them off from the passions. These I imagine to be meant by those whom men have
made Eunuchs, when the word of teaching distinguishing the better from the worse and
rejecting the one and commanding the other (like the verse, Depart from evil and do
good),3840 works spiritual chastity. This sort of making eunuchs I approve; and I highly
praise both teachers and taught, that the one have nobly effected, and the other still more
nobly endured, the cutting off.</p>
<p>XXI. And there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of
Heaven’s sake. Others, too, who have not met with teachers, have been laudable teachers
to themselves. No father nor mother, no Priest or Bishop, nor any of those commissioned
to teach, taught you your duty; but by moving reason in yourself and by kindling the spark
of good by your free will, you made yourself a eunuch, and acquired such a habit of virtue
that impulse to vice became almost an impossibility to you. Therefore I praise this kind of
Eunuch-making also, and perhaps even above the others. He that is able to receive it let
him receive it. Choose which part you will; either follow the Teacher or be your own
teacher. One thing alone is shameful—that the passions be not extirpated. It matters not
how they are extirpated. The teacher is God’s creature; and you also have the same origin;
and whether the teacher grasp this grace, or the good be your own—it is equally good.</p>
<p>XXII. Only let us cut ourselves off from passion, lest any root of bitterness springing
up trouble us;3841 only let us follow the image; only let us reverence our Archetype. Cut off
the bodily passions; cut off also the spiritual. For by how much the soul is more precious
than the body, by so much more precious is it to cleanse the soul than the body. And if
cleansing of the body be a praiseworthy act, see, I pray you, how much greater and higher
<note type="footnote">3840 Ps. xxxvii. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">3841 Heb. xii. 15.</note>

<pb n="687"/>
is that of the soul. Cut away the Arian impiety; cut away the false opinion of Sabellius; do
not join more than is right, or wrongly sever; do not either confuse the Three Persons into
One, or make Three diversities of Nature. The One is praiseworthy if rightly understood;
and the Three when rightly divided, when the division is of Persons, not of Godhead.</p>
<p>XXIII. I enact this for Laymen too, and I enjoin it also upon all Priests, and upon those
commissioned to rule. Come to the aid of the Word, all of you to whom God has given
power to aid. It is a great thing to check murder, to punish adultery, to chastise theft; much
more to establish piety by law, and to bestow sound doctrine. My word will not be able to
do as much in fighting for the Holy Trinity as your Edict, if you will bridle the ill disposed,
if you will help the persecuted, if you will check the slayers, and prevent people from being
slain. I am speaking not merely of bodily but of spiritual slaughter. For all sin is the death
of the soul. Here let my discourse end.</p>
<p>XXIV. But it remains that I speak a prayer for those who are assembled. Husbands
alike and wives, rulers and ruled, old men, and young men, and maidens, every sort of age,
bear ye every loss whether of money or of body, but one thing alone do not endure—to lose
the Godhead. I adore the Father, I adore the Son, I adore the Holy Ghost; or rather We
adore them; I, who am speaking, before all and after all and with all, in the same Christ our
Lord, to whom be the glory and the might for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XXXVIII.</head>
<p>On the Theophany, or Birthday of Christ.</p>
<p>The Title of this Oration has given rise to a doubt whether it was preached on Dec.
25, 380, or on Jan. 6, 381. The word Theophania is well known as a name for the Epiphany;
which, however, according to Schaff,3842 was originally a celebration both of the Nativity
and the Baptism of our Lord. The two words seem both to have been used in the simplest
sense of the Manifestation of God, and certainly were applied to Christmas Day. Thus
Suidas, “The Epiphany is the Incarnation of the Saviour;” and Epiphanius (Hær., 53),
“The Day of the Epiphany is the day on which Christ was born according to the flesh.”
But S. Jerome applies the word to the Baptism of Christ; “The day of the Epiphany is still
venerable; not, as some think, on account of His Birth in the flesh; for then He was hidden,
not manifested; but it agrees with the time at which it was said, This is My beloved Son
(In Ezech. I.). There is also a Sermon, attributed to S. Chrysostom, “On the Baptism of
Christ,” in which it is expressly denied that the name Theophany applies to Christmas.
The Oration itself, however, contains evidence to shew that the Festival of our Lord’s Birth
was kept at the earlier date; for in c. 16 the Preacher says, “A little later you shall see Jesus
submitting to be purified in the river Jordan for my purification.” And another piece of
evidence occurs in the oration In Sancta Lumina, c. 14, “At His Birth we duly kept festival,
both I the leader of the feast, and you. Now we are come to another action of Christ and
another Mystery.”</p>
<p>The Oration is thus analysed by Abbe Benoît:</p>
<p>“After an exordium which is full of the enthusiasm and joy which such a subject
naturally inspires the Orator recommends his hearers to celebrate the Festival by a
pious gladness, and by hearing the Word of God; and not as the heathen celebrated
their feasts, by profane amusements and all kinds of excess. He will try to satisfy their
desires by speaking to them of God. God is infinite, ineffable, eternal, the Sovereign
Good. He created the Angels in the beginning out of goodness. The fall of the Angels
was followed by the creation of the material world. Man too fell, and God shewed
His mercy even in the punishment. He used various means to raise him again; and
at length He came Himself. Then the speaker forcibly argues against those who misuse
the infinite condescension of the Word to contest His Godhead; he rapidly traces the
principal features of His Life—at once human and Divine; and ends with a recommendation
to his hearers to imitate in all things the Life of Christ, so that they may
have a share in His Kingdom in Heaven.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3842 H. E., Nic. Per., p. 399.</note>

<pb n="689"/>
<p>It is considered one of the best of Gregory’s discourses. “By the grandeur of the
plan,” says Benoît, “the elevation of the ideas, and the rich fund of doctrine, this discourse
is incontestably one of S. Gregory’s most remarkable efforts.”</p>
<p>I. Christ is born, glorify ye Him. Christ from heaven, go ye out to meet Him. Christ
on earth; be ye exalted. Sing unto the Lord all the whole earth;3843 and that I may join both
in one word, Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, for Him Who is of heaven
and then of earth. Christ in the flesh, rejoice with trembling and with joy; with trembling
because of your sins, with joy because of your hope. Christ of a Virgin; O ye Matrons live
as Virgins, that ye may be Mothers of Christ. Who doth not worship Him That is from the
beginning? Who doth not glorify Him That is the Last?</p>
<p>II. Again the darkness is past; again Light is made; again Egypt is punished with darkness;
again Israel is enlightened by a pillar.3844 The people that sat in the darkness of ignorance,
let it see the Great Light of full knowledge.3845 Old things are passed away, behold all things
are become new.3846 The letter gives way, the Spirit comes to the front. The shadows flee
away, the Truth comes in upon them. Melchisedec is concluded.3847 He that was without
Mother becomes without Father (without Mother of His former state, without Father of
His second). The laws of nature are upset; the world above must be filled. Christ commands
it, let us not set ourselves against Him. O clap your hands together all ye people,3848 because
unto us a Child is born, and a Son given unto us, Whose Government is upon His shoulder
(for with the Cross it is raised up), and His Name is called The Angel of the Great Counsel
of the Father.3849 Let John cry, Prepare ye the way of the Lord:3850 I too will cry the power
of this Day. He Who is not carnal is Incarnate; the Son of God becomes the Son of Man,
Jesus Christ the Same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.3851 Let the Jews be offended, let

<note type="footnote">3847 The meaning clearly is that the type presented by Melchisedec (Heb. vii. 3) is fulfilled in Christ. The
explanation here given by S. Gregory is the ordinary one found in the Fathers. Thus, e.g., Theodoret says, “Christ
our Lord is without Mother as God, for He was begotten of the Father alone; and without Father as Man, for
He was born of a pure Virgin.” OEcumenius has almost the exact words of Gregory. So also S. Augustine (Tract
in Joann, 8), “Christ was singularly born of a Father without a Mother, of a Mother without a Father; without
Mother as God, without Father as Man.”</note>

the Greeks deride;3852 let heretics talk till their tongues ache. Then shall they believe, when
they see Him ascending up into heaven; and if not then, yet when they see Him coming out
of heaven and sitting as Judge.</p>
<p>III. Of these on a future occasion; for the present the Festival is the Theophany or Birthday,
for it is called both, two titles being given to the one thing. For God was manifested to
man by birth. On the one hand Being, and eternally Being, of the Eternal Being, above cause
and word, for there was no word before The Word; and on the other hand for our sakes
also Becoming, that He Who gives us our being might also give us our Well-being, or rather
might restore us by His Incarnation, when we had by wickedness fallen from wellbeing.
The name Theophany is given to it in reference to the Manifestation, and that of Birthday
in respect of His Birth.</p>
<p>IV. This is our present Festival; it is this which we are celebrating to-day, the Coming
of God to Man, that we might go forth,3853 or rather (for this is the more proper expression)
that we might go back to God—that putting off the old man, we might put on the New; and
that as we died in Adam, so we might live in Christ,3854 being born with Christ and crucified
with Him and buried with Him and rising with Him.3855 For I must undergo the beautiful
conversion, and as the painful succeeded the more blissful, so must the more blissful come
out of the painful. For where sin abounded Grace did much more abound;3856 and if a taste
condemned us, how much more doth the Passion of Christ justify us? Therefore let us keep
the Feast, not after the manner of a heathen festival, but after a godly sort; not after the way
of the world, but in a fashion above the world; not as our own but as belonging to Him Who
is ours, or rather as our Master’s; not as of weakness, but as of healing; not as of creation,
but of re-creation.</p>
<p>V. And how shall this be? Let us not adorn our porches, nor arrange dances, nor decorate
the streets; let us not feast the eye, nor enchant the ear with music, nor enervate the
nostrils with perfume, nor prostitute the taste, nor indulge the touch, those roads that are
so prone to evil and entrances for sin; let us not be effeminate in clothing soft and flowing,
whose beauty consists in its uselessness, nor with the glittering of gems or the sheen of
gold3857 or the tricks of colour, belying the beauty of nature, and invented to do despite
unto the image of God; Not in rioting and drunkenness, with which are mingled, I know
well, chambering and wantonness, since the lessons which evil teachers give are evil; or

rather the harvests of worthless seeds are worthless. Let us not set up high beds of leaves,
making tabernacles for the belly of what belongs to debauchery. Let us not appraise the
bouquet of wines, the kickshaws of cooks, the great expense of unguents. Let not sea and
land bring us as a gift their precious dung, for it is thus that I have learnt to estimate luxury;
and let us not strive to outdo each other in intemperance (for to my mind every superfluity
is intemperance, and all which is beyond absolute need),—and this while others are hungry
and in want, who are made of the same clay and in the same manner.</p>
<p>VI. Let us leave all these to the Greeks and to the pomps and festivals of the Greeks,
who call by the name of gods beings who rejoice in the reek of sacrifices, and who consistently
worship with their belly; evil inventors and worshippers of evil demons. But we, the Object
of whose adoration is the Word, if we must in some way have luxury, let us seek it in word,
and in the Divine Law, and in histories; especially such as are the origin of this Feast; that
our luxury may be akin to and not far removed from Him Who hath called us together. Or
do you desire (for to-day I am your entertainer) that I should set before you, my good Guests,
the story of these things as abundantly and as nobly as I can, that ye may know how a foreigner
can feed3858 the natives of the land, and a rustic the people of the town, and one who
cares not for luxury those who delight in it, and one who is poor and homeless those who
are eminent for wealth?</p>
<p>We will begin from this point; and let me ask of you who delight in such matters to
cleanse your mind and your ears and your thoughts, since our discourse is to be of God and
Divine; that when you depart, you may have had the enjoyment of delights that really fade

<p>VII. God always was,3859 and always is, and always will be. Or rather, God always Is.
For Was and Will be are fragments of our time, and of changeable nature, but He is Eternal
Being. And this is the Name that He gives to Himself when giving the Oracle to Moses in
the Mount. For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having neither beginning
in the past nor end in the future; like some great Sea of Being, limitless and unbounded,
transcending all conception of time and nature, only adumbrated by the mind, and that
very dimly and scantily…not by His Essentials, but by His Environment; one image being
got from one source and another from another, and combined into some sort of presentation
of the truth, which escapes us before we have caught it, and takes to flight before we have
conceived it, blazing forth upon our Master-part, even when that is cleansed, as the lightning
flash which will not stay its course, does upon our sight<gap reason=" omitted"/>in order as I conceive by that part

of it which we can comprehend to draw us to itself (for that which is altogether incomprehensible
is outside the bounds of hope, and not within the compass of endeavour), and by
that part of It which we cannot comprehend to move our wonder, and as an object of wonder
to become more an object of desire, and being desired to purify, and by purifying to make
us like God;3860 so that when we have thus become like Himself, God may, to use a bold
expression, hold converse with us as Gods, being united to us, and that perhaps to the same
extent as He already knows those who are known to Him. The Divine Nature then is
boundless and hard to understand; and all that we can comprehend of Him is His boundlessness;
even though one may conceive that because He is of a simple nature He is therefore
either wholly incomprehensible, or perfectly comprehensible. For let us further enquire
what is implied by “is of a simple nature.” For it is quite certain that this simplicity is not
itself its nature, just as composition is not by itself the essence of compound beings.</p>
<p>VIII. And when Infinity is considered from two points of view, beginning and end (for
that which is beyond these and not limited by them is Infinity), when the mind looks to the
depth above, not having where to stand, and leans upon phenomena to form an idea of God,
it calls the Infinite and Unapproachable which it finds there by the name of Unoriginate.
And when it looks into the depths below, and at the future, it calls Him Undying and Imperishable.
And when it draws a conclusion from the whole it calls Him Eternal (αἴωνιος).
For Eternity (αἵων) is neither time nor part of time; for it cannot be measured. But what
time, measured by the course of the sun, is to us, that Eternity is to the Everlasting, namely,
a sort of time-like movement and interval co-extensive with their existence. This, however,
is all I must now say about God; for the present is not a suitable time, as my present subject
is not the doctrine of God, but that of the Incarnation. But when I say God, I mean Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. For Godhead is neither diffused beyond these, so as to bring in a mob
of gods; nor yet is it bounded by a smaller compass than these, so as to condemn us for a
poverty-stricken conception of Deity; either Judaizing to save the Monarchia, or falling into
heathenism by the multitude of our gods. For the evil on either side is the same, though
found in contrary directions. This then is the Holy of Holies,3861 which is hidden even from
the Seraphim, and is glorified with a thrice repeated Holy,3862 meeting in one ascription of

some words on this point in his treatise De Coelest. Hier., c. 7. But the most competent scholars deny the authenticity
of the works attributed to S. Dionysius, and place them from one hundred to one hundred and fifty

the Title Lord and God, as one of our predecessors has most beautifully and loftily pointed
out.</p>
<p>IX. But since this movement of self-contemplation alone could not satisfy Goodness,
but Good must be poured out and go forth beyond Itself to multiply the objects of Its beneficence,
for this was essential to the highest Goodness, He first conceived the Heavenly and
Angelic Powers. And this conception was a work fulfilled by His Word, and perfected by
His Spirit. And so the secondary Splendours came into being, as the Ministers of the Primary
Splendour; whether we are to conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or as Fire of an immaterial
and incorruptible kind, or as some other nature approaching this as near as may be.
I should like to say that they were incapable of movement in the direction of evil, and susceptible
only of the movement of good, as being about God, and illumined with the first
rays from God—for earthly beings have but the second illumination; but I am obliged to
stop short of saying that, and to conceive and speak of them only as difficult to move because
of him,3863 who for his splendour was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness
through his pride; and the apostate hosts who are subject to him, creators of evil3864 by their
revolt against good and our inciters.</p>
<p>X. Thus, then, and for these reasons, He gave being to the world of thought, as far as I
can reason upon these matters, and estimate great things in my own poor language. Then
when His first creation was in good order, He conceives a second world, material and visible;
and this a system and compound of earth and sky, and all that is in the midst of them—an
admirable creation indeed, when we look at the fair form of every part, but yet more worthy
of admiration when we consider the harmony and the unison of the whole, and how each
part fits in with every other, in fair order, and all with the whole, tending to the perfect
completion of the world as a Unit. This was to shew that He could call into being, not only
a Nature akin to Himself, but also one altogether alien to Himself. For akin to Deity are
those natures which are intellectual, and only to be comprehended by mind; but all of which
sense can take cognisance are utterly alien to It; and of these the furthest removed are all
those which are entirely destitute of soul and of power of motion. But perhaps some one
of those who are too festive and impetuous may say, What has all this to do with us? Spur

<note type="footnote">3864 Evil, says Nicetas here, has no positive existence, but is the negation of good. “The faculties of mind
and body which are used in a sinful action are indeed things, and are the creatures of God; but the sin itself is

<p>XI. Mind, then, and sense, thus distinguished from each other, had remained within
their own boundaries, and bore in themselves the magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent
praisers3865 and thrilling heralds of His mighty work. Not yet was there any mingling of
both, nor any mixtures of these opposites, tokens of a greater Wisdom and Generosity in
the creation of natures; nor as yet were the whole riches of Goodness made known. Now
the Creator-Word, determining to exhibit this, and to produce a single living being out of
both—the visible and the invisible creations, I mean—fashions Man; and taking a body from
already existing matter, and placing in it a Breath taken from Himself3866 which the Word
knew to be an intelligent soul and the Image of God, as a sort of second world. He placed
him, great in littleness3867 on the earth; a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully initiated
into the visible creation, but only partially into the intellectual; King of all upon earth, but
subject to the King above; earthly and heavenly; temporal and yet immortal; visible and yet
intellectual; half-way between greatness and lowliness; in one person combining spirit and
flesh; spirit, because of the favour bestowed on him; flesh, because of the height to which
he had been raised; the one that he might continue to live and praise his Benefactor, the
other that he might suffer, and by suffering be put in remembrance, and corrected if he became
proud of his greatness. A living creature trained here, and then moved elsewhere;
and, to complete the mystery, deified by its inclination to God. For to this, I think, tends
that Light of Truth which we here possess but in measure, that we should both see and experience
the Splendour of God, which is worthy of Him Who made us, and will remake us
again after a loftier fashion.</p>
<p>XII. This being He placed in Paradise, whatever the Paradise may have been, having
honoured him with the gift of Free Will (in order that God might belong to him as the result
of his choice, no less than to Him who had implanted the seeds of it), to till the immortal
plants, by which is meant perhaps the Divine Conceptions, both the simpler and the more
perfect; naked in his simplicity and inartificial life, and without any covering or screen; for
it was fitting that he who was from the beginning should be such. Also He gave him a Law,
as a material for his Free Will to act upon. This Law was a Commandment as to what plants
he might partake of, and which one he might not touch. This latter was the Tree of Knowledge;
not, however, because it was evil from the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden
because God grudged it to us…Let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that direction,

or imitate the Serpent<gap reason="omitted"/>But it would have been good if partaken of at the proper time, for
the tree was, according to my theory, Contemplation, upon which it is only safe for those
who have reached maturity of habit to enter; but which is not good for those who are still
somewhat simple and greedy in their habit; just as solid food is not good for those who are
yet tender, and have need of milk.3868 But when through the Devil’s malice and the woman’s
caprice, to which she succumbed as the more tender, and which she brought to bear upon
the man, as she was the more apt to persuade, alas for my weakness! (for that of my first
father was mine), he forgot the Commandment which had been given to him;3869 he yielded
to the baleful fruit; and for his sin he was banished, at once from the Tree of Life, and from
Paradise, and from God; and put on the coats of skins<gap reason="omitted"/>that is, perhaps, the coarser flesh,
both mortal and contradictory. This was the first thing that he learnt—his own shame;3870
and he hid himself from God. Yet here too he makes a gain, namely death, and the cutting
off of sin, in order that evil may not be immortal. Thus his punishment is changed into a
mercy; for it is in mercy, I am persuaded, that God inflicts punishment.</p>
<p>XIII. And having been first chastened by many means (because his sins were many,
whose root of evil sprang up through divers causes and at sundry times), by word, by law,
by prophets, by benefits, by threats, by plagues, by waters, by fires, by wars, by victories, by
defeats, by signs in heaven and signs in the air and in the earth and in the sea, by unexpected
changes of men, of cities, of nations (the object of which was the destruction of wickedness),
at last he needed a stronger remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual slaughters,
adulteries, perjuries, unnatural crimes, and that first and last of all evils, idolatry and the
transfer of worship from the Creator to the Creatures. As these required a greater aid, so
also they obtained a greater. And that was that the Word of God Himself—Who is before
all worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, Beginning of Beginning,3871
the Light of Light, the Source of Life and Immortality, the Image of the Archetypal Beauty,
the immovable Seal, the unchangeable Image, the Father’s Definition3872 and Word, came

to His own Image, and took on Him flesh for the sake of our flesh, and mingled Himself
with an intelligent soul for my soul’s sake, purifying like by like; and in all points except sin
was made man. Conceived by the Virgin,3873 who first in body and soul was purified by
the Holy Ghost3874 (for it was needful both that Childbearing should be honoured, and that
Virginity should receive a higher honour), He came forth then as God with that which He
had assumed, One Person in two Natures, Flesh and Spirit, of which the latter deified the
former.3875 O new commingling; O strange conjunction; the Self-Existent comes into being,
the Uncreate is created, That which cannot be contained is contained, by the intervention
of an intellectual soul, mediating between the Deity and the corporeity of the flesh. And
He Who gives riches becomes poor, for He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume
the richness of His Godhead. He that is full empties Himself, for He empties Himself
of His glory for a short while, that I may have a share in His Fulness. What is the riches of
His Goodness? What is this mystery that is around me? I had a share in the image; I did
not keep it; He partakes of my flesh that He may both save the image and make the flesh
immortal. He communicates a second Communion far more marvellous than the first,
inasmuch as then He imparted the better Nature, whereas now Himself partakes of the
worse. This is more godlike than the former action, this is loftier in the eyes of all men of
understanding.</p>

One? Do you turn this benefit into a reproach to God? Wilt thou deem Him little on this
account, that He humbled Himself for thee; because the Good Shepherd,3876 He who lays
down His life for His sheep, came to seek for that which had strayed upon the mountains
and the hills, on which thou wast then sacrificing, and found the wanderer; and having
found it,3877 took it upon His shoulders—on which He also took the Wood of the Cross;
and having taken it, brought it back to the higher life; and having carried it back, numbered
it amongst those who had never strayed. Because He lighted a candle—His own Flesh—and
swept the house, cleansing the world from sin; and sought the piece of money, the Royal

the light that exceeds in brightness; and to the Voice the Word succeeds; and to the Bridegroom’s

cleansing them by water in preparation for the Spirit? Dost thou reproach God with all
this? Dost thou on this account deem Him lessened, because He girds Himself with a towel
and washes His disciples’ feet, and shows that humiliation is the best road to exaltation?
Because for the soul that was bent to the ground He humbles Himself, that He may raise up
with Himself the soul that was tottering to a fall under a weight of sin? Why dost thou not
also charge upon Him as a crime the fact that He eats with Publicans and at Publicans’
tables,3879 and that He makes disciples of Publicans, that He too may gain somewhat<gap reason="omitted"/>and
what?<gap reason="omitted"/>the salvation of sinners. If so, we must blame the physician for stooping over sufferings,

<p>XV. He was sent, but as man, for He was of a twofold Nature; for He was wearied, and
hungered, and was thirsty, and was in an agony, and shed tears, according to the nature of
a corporeal being. And if the expression be also used of Him as God, the meaning is that
the Father’s good pleasure is to be considered a Mission, for to this He refers all that concerns
Himself; both that He may honour the Eternal Principle, and because He will not be taken
to be an antagonistic God. And whereas it is written both that He was betrayed, and also
that He gave Himself up3881 and that He was raised up by the Father, and taken up into
heaven; and on the other hand, that He raised Himself and went up; the former statement
of each pair refers to the good pleasure of the Father, the latter to His own Power. Are you
then to be allowed to dwell upon all that humiliates Him, while passing over all that exalts
Him, and to count on your side the fact that He suffered, but to leave out of the account the
fact that it was of His own will? See what even now the Word has to suffer. By one set He

<note type="footnote">3882 The Sabellian heresy may be briefly described as the doctrine of One God exercising three offices, as
opposed to the Catholic Faith of One God in three Persons. Sabellius himself was a Priest of the Libyan Pentapolis,
who at Rome in the time of Pope Zephyrinus embraced the heresy of Notus, which maintained that God
the Father suffered for us on the cross in the form of Christ. His followers, who openly declared themselves
first about a.d. 357, thought that God, to Whom as the Source of all things the name of Father is given, is called
the Son when He united Himself to the humanity of Jesus for the work of our redemption; and in like manner
He is the Holy Spirit when manifested for the work of sanctification. Sabellius was condemned by a Council
held at Rome, probably in 258; again at Nicæa, and again at Constantinople, where Sabellian Baptism was pronounced
invalid.</note>
<note type="footnote">3883 Arianism was the result of a strong opposition to Sabellianism, coupled with a misunderstanding of the
argument against it. There was, no doubt, a danger of falling into the opposite error of Tritheism, to avoid
which Arianism “divided the Substance” and virtually—and in the end explicity—denied the Godhead of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Arius was a Priest of Alexandria, and it was there that he began to publish his opinions, in
the early years of the Fourth Century (318); but Newman traces the origin of the heresy to Antioch and its
Judaizing tendency. At a meeting of the clergy in Alexandria the Bishop, S. Alexander, gave an address on the
coeternity, and coequality of the Father and the Son, and used the expression τὴν αὐτὴν οὐσίαν ἔχειν, that They
had the same Substance. Arius protested against this as a Sabellian statement, and used the words κτίσμα
(creature) and ποίημα (a thing made) of the Son, adding the sentence which became so famous, ἦν ὅτε οὐκ
ἦν,—there was a time when the Son did not exist. Having ineffectually tried private remonstrance, S. Alexander
brought the matter in 321 before his Provincial Synod, in which were present about 100 Egyptian and Pentapolitan
Bishops, who after giving the matter a patient hearing, excommunicated Arius and his principal adherents.
But it was too late to undo the mischief. The heresy spread widely, and the whole Eastern Church was stirred
by the controversy. At last a great Council of the whole Church met at Nicæa in 325, summoned by the Emperor;
and there the heresy was unequivocally condemned, and the great Creed propounded with its watchword, the
Homoousion. The false teaching had however struck its roots deep and wide; and though now banned by the
anathema of the Church, it was long in dying; and indeed at one time, it seemed as if—humanly speaking—it
must swamp the whole Catholic Church. Under various forms the Semi-Arians who claimed to differ from the
faith of Nicæa only by a single letter, the Aetians and Eunomians, who went to the furthest extreme of the
Falsehood (Anomoeans), and many others, the heresy spread far and wide: and when S. Gregory came to Constantinople
there was not one Catholic Church or Priest to be found in the place, and only a few scattered folk
who still held to the Faith of the Consubstantial. Gregory’s wonderful discourses however came to their aid,
and partly under his presidency was held the Second OEcumenical Synod, which condemned the heresy of
Macedonius, a still further development of Arianism, which denied also the Deity of the Holy Ghost. Arianism
survived for another two centuries among the Goths and Vandals, the Burgundians and Lombards; but it never
rose again as a power in the Church.</note>

<head>Oration XXXIX.</head>
<p>Oration on the Holy Lights.</p>
<p>The Oration on the Holy Lights was preached on the Festival of the Epiphany 381, and
was followed the next day by that on Baptism. In the Eastern Church this Festival is regarded
as more particularly the commemoration of our Lord’s Baptism, and is accordingly one of the
great days for the solemn ministration of the Sacrament. It is generally called Theophania,
and the Gospel in the Liturgy is S. Matthew iii. 13–17. The Sunday in the Octave is called
μετὰ τὰ φῶτα (After The Lights), pointing to a time when the Feast was known as the “Holy
Lights,” as seems to have been the case in S. Gregory’s day. This name is derived from Baptism,
which was often in ancient days called Illumination, in reference to which name (derived from
the spiritual grace of the Sacrament) lighted torches or candles were carried by the neophytes.
It would appear that the solemnites of the Festival lasted two days, of which the second was
devoted to the solemn conferring of the Sacrament. Accordingly we find two Orations belonging
to the Festival. In the first, delivered on the Day itself he dwells more especially on the Feast
and the Mystery of our Lord’s Baptism therein commemorated; and proceeds to speak of the
different kinds of Baptism, of which he enumerates Five, viz.:—</p>
<p>1. The figurative Baptism of Israel by Moses in the cloud and in the Sea.</p>
<p>2. The preparatory Baptism of repentance ministered by S. John the Baptist.</p>
<p>3. The spiritual Baptism of water and the Holy Ghost given us by our Lord.</p>
<p>4. The glorious Baptism of Martyrdom.</p>
<p>5. The painful Baptism of Penance.</p>
<p>In speaking of this last he takes occasion to refute the extreme rigorism of the followers of
Novatus, who denied absolution to certain classes of sins committed after Baptism.</p>
<p>In the second Oration, delivered next day, he dwells on the Sacrament of Baptism and its
spiritual effects; and takes occasion to reprove the then still prevalent practice of deferring
Baptism till the near approach of death. He likewise dwells on the truth that the validity and
spiritual effect of the Sacrament is wholly independent of the rank or worthiness of the Priest
who may minister it; and he concludes with a sketch of the obligations which its reception involves,
with a very valuable exposition of the Creed, and of the Ceremonies which accompanied
the administration of the Sacrament.</p>
<p>I. Again My Jesus, and again a mystery; not deceitful nor disorderly, nor belonging to
Greek error or drunkenness (for so I call their solemnities, and so I think will every man of
sound sense); but a mystery lofty and divine, and allied to the Glory above. For the Holy
Day of the Lights, to which we have come, and which we are celebrating to-day, has for its
origin the Baptism of my Christ, the True Light That lighteneth every man that cometh into

<pb n="703"/>
the world,3909 and effecteth my purification, and assists that light which we received from
the beginning from Him from above, but which we darkened and confused by sin.</p>
<p>II. Therefore listen to the Voice of God, which sounds so exceeding clearly to me, who
am both disciple and master of these mysteries, as would to God it may sound to you; I Am
The Light Of The World.3910 Therefore approach ye to Him and be enlightened, and let
not your faces be ashamed,3911 being signed with the true Light. It is a season of new
birth,3912 let us be born again. It is a time of reformation, let us receive again the first
Adam.3913 Let us not remain what we are, but let us become what we once were. The Light
Shineth In Darkness,3914 in this life and in the flesh, and is chased by the darkness, but is
not overtaken by it:—I mean the adverse power leaping up in its shamelessness against the
visible Adam, but encountering God and being defeated;—in order that we, putting away
the darkness, may draw near to the Light, and may then become perfect Light, the children
of perfect Light. See the grace of this Day; see the power of this mystery. Are you not lifted
up from the earth? Are you not clearly placed on high, being exalted by our voice and
meditation? and you will be placed much higher when the Word shall have prospered the
course of my words.</p>
<p>III. Is there any such among the shadowy purifications of the Law, aiding as it did with
temporary sprinklings, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean;3915 or do the
gentiles celebrate any such thing in their mysteries, every ceremony and mystery of which
to me is nonsense, and a dark invention of demons, and a figment of an unhappy mind,
aided by time, and hidden by fable? For what they worship as true, they veil as mythical.
But if these things are true, they ought not to be called myths, but to be proved not to be
shameful;3916 and if they are false, they ought not to be objects of wonder; nor ought people
so inconsiderately to hold the most contrary opinions about the same thing, as if they were
playing in the market-place with boys or really ill-disposed men, not engaged in discussion
with men of sense, and worshippers of the Word, though despisers of this artificial plausibility.</p>
<p>IV. We are not concerned in these mysteries with birth of Zeus and thefts of the Cretan
Tyrant3917 (though the Greeks may be displeased at such a title for him), nor with the name

of Curetes, and the armed dances, which were to hide the wailings of a weeping god, that
he might escape from his father’s hate. For indeed it would be a strange thing that he who
was swallowed as a stone should be made to weep as a child.3918 Nor are we concerned with
Phrygian mutilations and flutes and Corybantes,3919 and all the ravings of men concerning
Rhea, consecrating people to the mother of the gods, and being initiated into such ceremonies
as befit the mother of such gods as these. Nor have we any carrying away of the Maiden,3920
nor wandering of Demeter, nor her intimacy with Celei and Triptolemi and Dragons; nor
her doings and sufferings<gap reason="omitted"/>for I am ashamed to bring into daylight that ceremony of the
night, and to make a sacred mystery of obscenity. Eleusis knows these things, and so do
those who are eyewitnesses of what is there guarded by silence, and well worthy of it. Nor
is our commemoration one of Dionysus, and the thigh that travailed with an incomplete
birth, as before a head had travailed with another;3921 nor of the hermaphrodite god, nor a
chorus of the drunken and enervated host; nor of the folly of the Thebans which honours
him; nor the thunderbolt of Semele which they adore. Nor is it the harlot mysteries of
Aphrodite, who, as they themselves admit, was basely born and basely honoured; nor have
we here Phalli and Ithyphalli,3922 shameful both in form and action; nor Taurian massacres
of strangers;3923 nor blood of Laconian youths shed upon the altars, as they scourged
<note type="footnote">3918 The allusion is to the birth of Zeus. Kronos the Titan, father of the gods, was the husband of Rhea, who
bore him children. But an oracle having declared that Kronos should be dethroned by his children, he swallowed
them immediately after they were born. Rhea, however, on the birth of Zeus, aided by the Curetes, a wild band
of Cretan Priests, concealed the child, and substituted a stone, which Kronos swallowed in his haste without
perceiving the difference. The stone made him very sick, and he vomited forth the children whom he had previously
swallowed; and by them and Zeus the prophecy was fulfilled. Kronos was deposed and imprisoned in
Tartarus.</note>
<note type="footnote">3919 There was a temple of Rhea in Phrygia, in which at her festivals people mutilated themselves to do her
honour. The flutes alluded to served to turn the thoughts of the sufferers from the pain of the operation. The
Corybantes were the ministers of the goddess, who led the wild orgies of her worship. It is believed that there
is an allusion to this practice of self-mutilation in Galat. v. 12. So at least S. Jerome, S. Ambrose, and all the
Greek Fathers take the passage. S. Thomas Aquinas, understanding the word in the same sense, applies it mystically;
and Estius, who here follows Erasmus, refers the “cutting off” merely to excommunication, a sense which
he calls “Apostolico sensu dignior,” though why “dignior” it is not easy to see. Yet he acknowledges that those
who interpret it literally do so “non immerito.”</note>

a goddess, and her a virgin. For these same people both honour effeminacy, and worship
boldness.</p>
<p>V. And where will you place the butchery of Pelops,3925 which feasted hungry gods,
that bitter and inhuman hospitality? Where the horrible and dark spectres of Hecate, and
the underground puerilities and sorceries of Trophonius, or the babblings of the Dodonæan
Oak, or the trickeries of the Delphian tripod, or the prophetic draught of Castalia, which
could prophesy anything, except their own being brought to silence?3926 Nor is it the sacrificial
art of Magi, and their entrail forebodings, nor the Chaldæan astronomy and horoscopes,
comparing our lives with the movements of the heavenly bodies, which cannot know even
what they are themselves, or shall be. Nor are these Thracian orgies, from which the word
Worship (θρησκεία) is said to be derived; nor rites and mysteries of Orpheus, whom the
Greeks admired so much for his wisdom that they devised for him a lyre which draws all
things by its music. Nor the tortures of Mithras3927 which it is just that those who can endure
to be initiated into such things should suffer; nor the manglings of Osiris,3928 another
calamity honoured by the Egyptians; nor the ill-fortunes of Isis3929 and the goats more
venerable than the Mendesians, and the stall of Apis,3930 the calf that luxuriated in the folly
of the Memphites, nor all those honours with which they outrage the Nile, while themselves
proclaiming it in song to be the Giver of fruits and corn, and the measurer of happiness by
its cubits.3931</p>

<p>VI. I pass over the honours they pay to reptiles, and their worship of vile things, each
of which has its peculiar cultus and festival, and all share in a common devilishness; so that,
if they were absolutely bound to be ungodly, and to fall away from honouring God, and to
be led astray to idols and works of art and things made with hands, men of sense could not
imprecate anything worse upon themselves than that they might worship just such things,
and honour them in just such a way; that, as Paul says, they might receive in themselves
that recompense of their error which was meet,3932 in the very objects of their worship; not
so much honouring them as suffering dishonour by them; abominable because of their error,
and yet more abominable from the vileness of the objects of their adoration and worship;
so that they should be even more without understanding than the objects of their worship;
being as excessively foolish as the latter are vile.</p>
<p>VII. Well, let these things be the amusement of the children of the Greeks and of the
demons to whom their folly is due, who turn aside the honour of God to themselves, and
divide men in various ways in pursuit of shameful thoughts and fancies, ever since they
drove us away from the Tree of Life, by means of the Tree of Knowledge unseasonably3933
and improperly imparted to us, and then assailed us as now weaker than before; carrying
clean away the mind, which is the ruling power in us, and opening a door to the passions.
For, being of a nature envious and man-hating, or rather having become so by their own
wickedness, they could neither endure that we who were below should attain to that which
is above, having themselves fallen from above upon the earth; nor that such a change in
their glory and their first natures should have taken place. This is the meaning of their
persecution of the creature. For this God’s Image was outraged; and as we did not like to
keep the Commandments,3934 we were given over to the independence of our error. And
as we erred we were disgraced by the objects of our worship. For there was not only this
calamity, that we who were made for good works3935 to the glory and praise of our Maker,
and to imitate God as far as might be, were turned into a den of all sorts of passions, which
cruelly devour and consume the inner man; but there was this further evil, that man actually
<note type="footnote">3932 Rom. i. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">3933 cf. Orat. in Theoph. c. 12. The explanation seems to be, that the “Knowledge of good and evil” was a
necessary part of the development of man’s intellect, but that a premature attempt to attain it per saltum instead
of by a gradual progress would prove fatal. Had human nature gone through its originally intended educational
stages, it might have reached to the knowledge of evil without having that knowledge alloyed and deteriorated
by the experience of evil, but might have known it, as God does, without taint. (Blount, Ann. Bible on Gen. ii.
7.)</note>

made gods the advocates of his passions, so that sin might be reckoned not only irresponsible,
but even divine, taking refuge in the objects of his worship as his apology.</p>
<p>VIII. But since to us grace has been given to flee from superstitious error and to be
joined to the truth and to serve the living and true God, and to rise above creation, passing
by all that is subject to time and to first motion; let us look at and reason upon God and
things divine in a manner corresponding to this Grace given us. But let us begin our discussion
of them from the most fitting point. And the most fitting is, as Solomon laid down for
us; us; The beginning of wisdom, he says, is to get wisdom.3936 And what this is he tells us;
the beginning of wisdom is fear.3937 For we must not begin with contemplation and leave
off with fear (for an unbridled contemplation would perhaps push us over a precipice), but
we must be grounded and purified and so to say made light by fear, and thus be raised to
the height. For where fear is there is keeping of commandments; and where there is keeping
of commandments there is purifying of the flesh, that cloud which covers the soul and suffers
it not to see the Divine Ray. And where there is purifying there is Illumination; and Illumination
is the satisfying of desire to those who long for the greatest things, or the Greatest
Thing, or That Which surpasses all greatness.</p>
<p>IX. Wherefore we must purify ourselves first, and then approach this converse with
the Pure; unless we would have the same experience as Israel,3938 who could not endure the
glory of the face of Moses, and therefore asked for a veil;3939 or else would feel and say with
Manoah “We are undone O wife, we have seen God,”3940 although it was God only in his
fancy; or like Peter would send Jesus out of the boat,3941 as being ourselves unworthy of
such a visit; and when I say Peter, I am speaking of the man who walked upon the waves;3942
or like Paul would be stricken in eyes,3943 as he was before he was cleansed from the guilt
of his persecution, when he conversed with Him Whom he was persecuting—or rather with
a short flash of That great Light; or like the Centurion3944 would seek for healing, but would
not, through a praiseworthy fear, receive the Healer into his house. Let each one of us also

speak so, as long as he is still uncleansed, and is a Centurion still, commanding many in
wickedness, and serving in the army of Cæsar, the World-ruler of those who are being
dragged down; “I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.” But when he
shall have looked upon Jesus, though he be little of stature like Zaccheus3945 of old, and
climb up on the top of the sycamore tree by mortifying his members which are upon the
earth,3946 and having risen above the body of humiliation, then he shall receive the Word,
and it shall be said to him, This day is salvation come to this house.3947 Then let him lay
hold on the salvation, and bring forth fruit more perfectly, scattering and pouring forth
rightly that which as a publican he wrongly gathered.</p>
<p>X. For the same Word is on the one hand terrible through its nature to those who are
unworthy, and on the other through its loving kindness can be received by those who are
thus prepared, who have driven out the unclean and worldly spirit from their souls, and
have swept and adorned their own souls by self-examination, and have not left them idle
or without employment, so as again to be occupied with greater armament by the seven
spirits of wickedness…the same number as are reckoned of virtue (for that which is hardest
to fight against calls for the sternest efforts)…but besides fleeing from evil, practise virtue,
making Christ entirely, or at any rate to the greatest extent possible, to dwell within them,
so that the power of evil cannot meet with any empty place to fill it again with himself, and
make the last state of that man worse than the first, by the greater energy of his assault, and
the greater strength and impregnability of the fortress. But when, having guarded our soul
with every care, and having appointed goings up in our heart,3948 and broken up our fallow
ground,3949 and sown unto righteousness,3950 as David and Solomon and Jeremiah bid us,
let us enlighten ourselves with the light of knowledge, and then let us speak of the Wisdom
of God that hath been hid in a mystery,3951 and enlighten others. Meanwhile let us purify
ourselves, and receive the elementary initiation of the Word, that we may do ourselves the
utmost good, making ourselves godlike, and receiving the Word at His coming; and not
only so, but holding Him fast and shewing Him to others.</p>
<p>XI. And now, having purified the theatre by what has been said, let us discourse a little
about the Festival, and join in celebrating this Feast with festal and pious souls. And, since
the chief point of the Festival is the remembrance of God, let us call God to mind. For I

think that the sound of those who keep Festival There, where is the dwelling of all the
Blissful, is nothing else than this, the hymns and praises of God, sung by all who are counted
worthy of that City. Let none be astonished if what I have to say contains some things that
I have said before; for not only will I utter the same words, but I shall speak of the same
subjects, trembling both in tongue and mind and thought when I speak of God for you too,
that you may share this laudable and blessed feeling. And when I speak of God you must
be illumined at once by one flash of light and by three. Three in Individualities or Hypostases,
if any prefer so to call them, or persons,3952 for we will not quarrel about names so long as
<note type="footnote">3952 The sense of Person (here πρόσωπον), which is the usual post-Nicene equivalent of ὑπόστασις, was by
no means generally attached to that word during the first Four Centuries, though here and there there are traces
of such a use. Throughout the Arian controversy a great deal of trouble and misunderstanding was caused by
the want of a precise definition of the meaning of ὑπόστασις. It seems to have been at first understood by the
Eastern Church to mean Real Personal Existence—Reality being the fundamental idea. In this fundamental
sense it was used in Theology as expressing the distinct individuality and relative bearing of the Three “Persons”
of the Blessed Trinity to each other (τὸ ἴδίον πὰρα τὸ κοινόν, Suidas). But Arius gave it a heretical twist, and
said that there are Three Hypostases, in the sense of Natures or Substances; and this doctrine was anathematized
by the Nicene Council, which, apparently regarding the term ὑπόστασις as exactly equivalent to οὐσία (as Arius
tried to make it) condemned the proposition that the Son is ἐξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας (Symb. Nic.).
Similar is the use of the word in S. Athanasius. As against Sabellius, however, who taught that in the Godhead
there are τρία πρόσωπα (using this word in the sense of Aspects only) but would not allow τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις
(i.e., Self-existent Personalities), the post-Nicene Church regarded ὑπόστασις as designating the Person, and
spoke freely of τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις. The Western Church increased the confusion by continuing to regard ὑπόστασις
as equivalent to οὐσία, and translating it by Substantia or Subsistentia. It was not till the word Essentia came
into use to express οὐσία that the Western Church grasped the difference, so long accepted in the East, so as to
use the words accurately. Meantime, however, there would seem to have grown up a difference in the use of
the two words supposed to represent ὑπόστασις, of the same kind as that between ὑπόστασις and οὐσία; Substantia
being appropriated to the Essence of a thing, that which is the foundation of its being; while Subsistentia
came rather to connote a limitation, i.e., Personality. Thus the West also became confused, and Substantia was
held to be the true equivalent of ὑπόστασις. Hence the condemnation at Sardica (a.d. 347) by the Western
Bishops of the doctrine of Three Hypostases as Arian. The confusion lasted long, but in 362 a Council was held
at Alexandria, when this difference was seen to be a mere logomachy, and it was pronounced orthodox to confess
either τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις in the sense of “Persons,” or μἰαν ὑπόστασιν in that of “Substance.” Our author in his
Oration to the Fathers of the Council of Constantinople fully acknowledges this. “What do you mean,” he says,
“by ὑποστάσεις or πρόσωπα? You mean that the Three are distinct, not in Nature, but in Personality.” And in
the Panegyric on S. Athanasius (Or. xxi. c. 35), he remarks on the orthodoxy of the phrase μία οὐσία, τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις, that the first expression refers to the Nature of the Godhead, the second to the special properties
of the Persons. With this, he says, the Italians agree, but the poverty of their language is such that it does not</note>

<pb n="710"/>
the syllables amount to the same meaning; but One in respect of the Substance—that is, the
Godhead. For they are divided without division, if I may so say; and they are united in divi-
sion. For the Godhead is one in three, and the three are one, in whom the Godhead is, or
to speak more accurately, Who are the Godhead. Excesses and defects we will omit, neither
making the Unity a confusion, nor the division a separation. We would keep equally far
from the confusion of Sabellius and from the division of Arius, which are evils diametrically
opposed, yet equal in their wickedness. For what need is there heretically to fuse God together,
or to cut Him up into inequality?</p>
<p>XII. For to us there is but One God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and One Lord
Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things; and One Holy Ghost, in Whom are all things;3953 yet
these words, of, by, in, whom, do not denote a difference of nature (for if this were the case,
the three prepositions, or the order of the three names would never be altered), but they
characterize the personalities of a nature which is one and unconfused. And this is proved
by the fact that They are again collected into one, if you will read—not carelessly—this
other passage of the same Apostle, “Of Him and through Him and to Him are all things; to
Him be glory forever, Amen.”3954 The Father is Father, and is Unoriginate, for He is of no
one; the Son is Son, and is not unoriginate, for He is of the Father. But if you take the word
Origin in a temporal sense, He too is Unoriginate, for He is the Maker of Time, and is not
subject to Time. The Holy Ghost is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed, but
not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by Generation but by Procession (since I must
coin a word for the sake of clearness3955); for neither did the Father cease to be Unbegotten
because of His begetting something, nor the Son to be begotten because He is of the Unbegotten
(how could that be?), nor is the Spirit changed into Father or Son because He proceeds,
or because He is God—though the ungodly do not believe it. For Personality is unchangeable;
else how could Personality remain, if it were changeable, and could be removed from one

(Doctr. of H. S. p. 118) says, “It is instructive to notice how at this period the two great Sees of Rome and Constantinople
seem to have agreed in abstaining from a minuter definition of the Procession. Both in East and
West the relations of the Spirit to the Son were being examined by individual theologians; but S. Gregory and
S. Damasus appear to have alike refrained from entering upon a question which did not touch the essentials of
the Faith.” He adds in a note “This is the more remarkable because Damasus was of Spanish origin.”</note>

to another? But they who make “Unbegotten” and “Begotten” natures of equivocal gods
would perhaps make Adam and Seth differ in nature, since the former was not born of flesh
(for he was created), but the latter was born of Adam and Eve. There is then One God in
Three, and These Three are One, as we have said.</p>
<p>XIII. Since then these things are so, or rather since This is so; and His Adoration ought
not to be rendered only by Beings above, but there ought to be also worshippers on earth,
that all things may be filled with the glory of God (forasmuch as they are filled with God
Himself); therefore man was created and honored with the hand3956 and Image of God.
But to despise man, when by the envy of the Devil and the bitter taste of sin he was pitiably
severed from God his Maker—this was not in the Nature of God. What then was done, and
what is the great Mystery that concerns us? An innovation is made upon nature, and God
is made Man. “He that rideth upon the Heaven of Heavens in the East”3957 of His own
glory and Majesty, is glorified in the West of our meanness and lowliness. And the Son of
God deigns to become and to be called Son of Man; not changing what He was (for It is
unchangeable); but assuming what He was not (for He is full of love to man), that the Incomprehensible3958
might be comprehended, conversing with us through the mediation of
the Flesh as through a veil; since it was not possible for that nature which is subject to birth
and decay to endure His unveiled Godhead. Therefore the Unmingled is mingled; and not

(Wordsworth in Gen. ii. 7.) “There was a peculiar glory in the creation of Man, distinguishing him from the rest
of the creatures. The creatures inferior to man were called into being by a simple act of the Divine Will; but in
the case of man, bearing as he does the nature and the form which God was about to assume as His own, and
which, once assumed, was never again to be laid aside, the process of creation was markedly different. Then for
the first time the Most Holy Persons of the Blessed Trinity appear upon the scene. They are manifested as in
mutual consultation and common action personally engaged.…‘Let Us make Man in Our Image after Our
Likeness’…Then followed the exercise of creative power as a personal act, the putting forth the Hand of God to
fashion the body of Man; ‘The Lord God formed Man of the dust of the earth.’ Afterwards came the yet higher
work in the infusion of the immaterial invisible life enshrined in the body, perfecting the work of God; ‘He
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul.’” (T. T. Carter, The Divine Dispensations,

the double sense that the Infinite Godhead entered in Christ into the limitations of a finite human life; and in

became in this limitation cognisable in some degree to it, as it was not before this special manifestation in Christ.</note>

only is God mingled with birth and Spirit3959 with flesh, and the Eternal with time, and the
Uncircumscribed with measure; but also Generation with Virginity, and dishonour with
Him who is higher than all honour; He who is impassible with Suffering,3960 and the Immortal
with the corruptible. For since that Deceiver thought that he was unconquerable in
his malice, after he had cheated us with the hope of becoming gods, he was himself cheated
by God’s assumption of our nature; so that in attacking Adam as he thought, he should
really meet with God, and thus the new Adam should save the old, and the condemnation
of the flesh should be abolished, death being slain by flesh.</p>
<p>XIV. At His birth we duly kept Festival, both I, the leader of the Feast, and you, and all
that is in the world and above the world. With the Star we ran, and with the Magi we worshipped,
and with the Shepherds we were illuminated, and with the Angels we glorified
Him, and with Simeon we took Him up in our arms, and with Anna the aged and chaste
we made our responsive confession. And thanks be to Him who came to His own in the
guise of a stranger, because He glorified the stranger.3961 Now, we come to another action
of Christ, and another mystery. I cannot restrain my pleasure; I am rapt into God. Almost
like John I proclaim good tidings; for though I be not a Forerunner, yet am I from the
desert.3962 Christ is illumined, let us shine forth with Him. Christ is baptized, let us descend
with Him that we may also ascend with Him. Jesus is baptized; but we must attentively
consider not only this but also some other points. Who is He, and by whom is He baptized,
and at what time? He is the All-pure; and He is baptized by John; and the time is the beginning
of His miracles. What are we to learn and to be taught by this? To purify ourselves
first; to be lowly minded; and to preach only in maturity both of spiritual and bodily stature.
The first3963 has a word especially for those who rush to Baptism off hand, and without due
preparation, or providing for the stability of the Baptismal Grace by the disposition of their
minds to good. For since Grace contains remission of the past (for it is a grace), it is on that

speaks to those who rebel against the Stewards of this Mystery, if they are their superiors in
rank. The third is for those who are confident in their youth, and think that any time is the
right one to teach or to preside. Jesus is purified, and dost thou despise purification?…and
by John, and dost thou rise up against thy herald?…and at thirty years of age, and dost thou
before thy beard has grown presume to teach the aged, or believe that thou teachest them,
though thou be not reverend on account of thine age, or even perhaps for thy character?
But here it may be said, Daniel, and this or that other, were judges in their youth, and examples
are on your tongues; for every wrongdoer is prepared to defend himself. But I reply
that that which is rare is not the law of the Church. For one swallow does not make a summer,
nor one line a geometrician, nor one voyage a sailor.</p>
<p>XV. But John baptizes, Jesus comes to Him3964…perhaps to sanctify the Baptist himself,
but certainly to bury the whole of the old Adam in the water; and before this and for the
sake of this, to sanctify Jordan; for as He is Spirit and Flesh, so He consecrates us by Spirit
and water.3965 John will not receive Him; Jesus contends. “I have need to be baptized of
Thee”3966 says the Voice to the Word, the Friend to the Bridegroom;3967 he that is above
all among them that are born of women,3968 to Him Who is the Firstborn of every
creature;3969 he that leaped in the womb,3970 to Him Who was adored in the womb; he who
was and is to be the Forerunner3971 to Him Who was and is to be manifested. “I have need
to be baptized of Thee;” add to this “and for Thee;” for he knew that he would be baptized
by Martyrdom, or, like Peter, that he would be cleansed not only as to his feet.3972 “And
comest Thou to me?” This also was prophetic; for he knew that after Herod would come
the madness of Pilate, and so that when he had gone before Christ would follow him. But
what saith Jesus? “Suffer it to be so now,” for this is the time of His Incarnation; for He
knew that yet a little while and He should baptize the Baptist. And what is the “Fan?” The

the better,3974 and makes a division between the faithful and the unbeliever;3975 and stirs
up the son and the daughter and the bride against the father and the mother and the
mother in law,3976 the young and fresh against the old and shadowy. And what is the Latchet
of the shoe, which thou John who baptizest Jesus mayest not loose?3977 thou who art of the
desert, and hast no food, the new Elias,3978 the more than Prophet, inasmuch as thou sawest
Him of Whom thou didst prophesy, thou Mediator of the Old and New Testaments. What

may be loosed, I say not by those3979 who are yet carnal and babes in Christ, but not even
by those who are like John in spirit.</p>

world<gap reason=" omitted"/>and sees the heaven opened which Adam had shut against himself and all his posterity,
3980 as the gates of Paradise by the flaming sword. And the Spirit bears witness to His
Godhead, for he descends upon One that is like Him, as does the Voice from Heaven (for
He to Whom the witness is borne came from thence), and like a Dove, for He honours the
Body (for this also was God, through its union with God) by being seen in a bodily form;
and moreover, the Dove has from distant ages been wont to proclaim the end of the Deluge.
3981 But if you are to judge of Godhead by bulk and weight, and the Spirit seems to
you a small thing because He came in the form of a Dove, O man of contemptible littleness
of thought concerning the greatest of things, you must also to be consistent despise the
Kingdom of Heaven, because it is compared to a grain of mustard seed;3982 and you must

<p>XVII. Now, since our Festival is of Baptism, and we must endure a little hardness with
Him Who for our sake took form, and was baptized, and was crucified; let us speak about
the different kinds of Baptism, that we may come out thence purified. Moses baptized3988
but it was in water, and before that in the cloud and in the sea.3989 This was typical as Paul
saith; the Sea of the water, and the Cloud of the Spirit; the Manna, of the Bread of Life; the
Drink, of the Divine Drink. John also baptized; but this was not like the baptism of the Jews,
for it was not only in water, but also “unto repentance.” Still it was not wholly spiritual, for
he does not add “And in the Spirit.” Jesus also baptized, but in the Spirit. This is the perfect
Baptism. And how is He not God, if I may digress a little, by whom you too are made God?
I know also a Fourth Baptism—that by Martyrdom and blood, which also Christ himself
underwent:—and this one is far more august than all the others, inasmuch as it cannot be
defiled by after-stains. Yes, and I know of a Fifth also, which is that of tears, and is much
more laborious, received by him who washes his bed every night and his couch with tears;3990
whose bruises stink through his wickedness;3991 and who goeth mourning and of a sad
countenance; who imitates the repentance of Manasseh3992 and the humiliation of the
Ninevites3993 upon which God had mercy; who utters the words of the Publican in the
Temple, and is justified rather than the stiff-necked Pharisee;3994 who like the Canaanite
woman bends down and asks for mercy and crumbs, the food of a dog that is very hungry.3995</p>
<p>XVIII. I, however, for I confess myself to be a man,—that is to say, an animal shifty
and of a changeable nature,—both eagerly receive this Baptism, and worship Him Who has
given it me, and impart it to others; and by shewing mercy make provision for mercy. For
I know that I too am compassed with infirmity,3996 and that with what measure I mete it

but not in intention, who dischargest upon us the sentiments of Novatus,3999 though thou
sharest the same infirmities? Wilt thou not give any place to weeping? Wilt thou shed no
tear? Mayest thou not meet with a Judge like thyself? Art thou not ashamed by the mercy
of Jesus, Who took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses;4000 Who came not to call the
righteous but sinners to repentance;4001 Who will have mercy rather than sacrifice; who
forgiveth sins till seventy times seven.4002 How blessed would your exaltation be if it really
were purity, not pride, making laws above the reach of men, and destroying improvement
by despair. For both are alike evil, indulgence not regulated by prudence, and condemnation
that will never forgive; the one because it relaxes all reins, the other because it strangles by
its severity. Shew me your purity, and I will approve your boldness. But as it is, I fear that
being full of sores you will render them incurable. Will you not admit even David’s repentance,
to whom his penitence preserved even the gift of prophecy? nor the great Peter himself,
who fell into human weakness at the Passion of our Saviour? Yet Jesus received him, and
by the threefold question and confession healed the threefold denial.4003 Or will you even
refuse to admit that he was made perfect by blood (for your folly goes even as far as that)?

Cornelius, the recently elected Bishop of the Apostolic See. The plea urged on behalf of the schism was that
Cornelius, who was of one accord with Cyprian, had lapsed in the time of the persecution under Decius, a.d.
250, and that he had relaxed the discipline of the Church by admitting to Communion on too easy terms those
who had been guilty of a similar offence; and that therefore he ought not to be recognized as a true Bishop of
the Church, but a faithful Pastor should be chosen in his place. Consequently Novatian was elected by some
who held these views, and was consecrated by three Bishops. There seem to have been a good many of his followers
in Constantinople at this time. There had been at one time a disposition among them to reunite themselves
to the Catholic Church, for they were orthodox in faith; but it had been hindered by the malevolence of their
party leaders; so that the schism continued, and the Novatians must be added to the opponents with whom S.
Gregory had to deal.</note>

to grant liberty of marriage to young widows on account of the liability of their age to fall?
Paul ventured to do so; but of course you can teach him; for you have been caught up to the
Fourth heaven, and to another Paradise, and have heard words more unspeakable, and
comprehend a larger circle in your Gospel.</p>
<p>XIX. But these sins were not after Baptism, you will say. Where is your proof? Either
prove it—or refrain from condemning; and if there be any doubt, let charity prevail. But
Novatus, you say, would not receive those who lapsed in the persecution. What do you
mean by this? If they were unrepentant he was right; I too would refuse to receive those
who either would not stoop at all or not sufficiently, and who would refuse to make their
amendment counterbalance their sin; and when I do receive them, I will assign them their
proper place;4006 but if he refused those who wore themselves away with weeping, I will not
imitate him. And why should Novatus’s want of charity be a rule for me? He never punished
covetousness, which is a second idolatry; but he condemned fornication as though he himself
were not flesh and body. What say you? Are we convincing you by these words? Come
and stand here on our side, that is, on the side of humanity. Let us magnify the Lord together.
Let none of you, even though he has much confidence in himself, dare to say, Touch me
not for I am pure, and who is so pure as I? Give us too a share in your brightness. But
perhaps we are not convincing you? Then we will weep for you. Let these men then if they
will, follow our way, which is Christ’s way; but if they will not, let them go their own. Perhaps
in it they will be baptized with Fire, in that last Baptism which is more painful and longer,
which devours wood like grass,4007 and consumes the stubble of every evil.</p>

<p>The Oration on Holy Baptism.</p>
<p>Preached at Constantinople Jan. 6, 381, being the day following the delivery of that on the
Holy Lights.</p>
<p>I. Yesterday we kept high Festival on the illustrious Day of the Holy Lights; for it was
fitting that rejoicings should be kept for our Salvation, and that far more than for weddings
and birthdays, and namedays, and house-warmings, and registrations of children, and anniversaries,
and all the other festivities that men observe for their earthly friends. And now
to-day let us discourse briefly concerning Baptism, and the benefits which accrue to us
therefrom, even though our discourse yesterday spoke of it cursorily; partly because the
time pressed us hard, and partly because the sermon had to avoid tediousness. For too great
length in a sermon is as much an enemy to people’s ears, as too much food is to their bodies.…
It will be worth your while to apply your minds to what we say, and to receive our
discourse on so important a subject not perfunctorily, but with ready mind, since to know
the power of this Sacrament is itself Enlightenment.4009</p>
<p>II. The Word recognizes three Births for us; namely, the natural birth, that of Baptism,
and that of the Resurrection. Of these the first is by night, and is servile, and involves passion;
but the second is by day, and is destructive of passion, cutting off all the veil4010 that is derived
from birth, and leading on to the higher life; and the third is more terrible and shorter,
bringing together in a moment all mankind,4011 to stand before its Creator, and to give an
account of its service and conversation here; whether it has followed the flesh, or whether
it has mounted up with the spirit, and worshipped the grace of its new creation. My Lord
Jesus Christ has showed that He honoured all these births in His own Person; the first, by
that first and quickening Inbreathing;4012 the second by His Incarnation and the Baptism
wherewith He Himself was baptized; and the third by the Resurrection of which He was the
Firstfruits; condescending, as He became the Firstborn4013 among many brethren, so also
to become the Firstborn from the dead.4014</p>
<note type="footnote">4009 Enlightenment (φωτισμός) is one of the most ancient names for Holy Baptism; the name, in fact, which
S. Gregory uses throughout this Oration, and which his Latin translator almost invariably renders by Baptismus.</note>

<p>III. Concerning two of these births, the first and the last, we have not to speak on the
present occasion. Let us discourse upon the second, which is now necessary for us, and
which gives its name to the Feast of the Lights. Illumination is the splendour of souls, the
conversion of the life, the question put to the Godward conscience.4015 It is the aid to our
weakness, the renunciation of the flesh, the following of the Spirit, the fellowship of the
Word, the improvement of the creature, the overwhelming of sin, the participation of light,
the dissolution of darkness. It is the carriage to God, the dying with Christ, the perfecting
of the mind, the bulwark of Faith, the key of the Kingdom of heaven, the change of life, the
removal of slavery, the loosing of chains, the remodelling of the whole man. Why should
I go into further detail? Illumination is the greatest and most magnificent of the Gifts of
God. For just as we speak of the Holy of Holies, and the Song of Songs, as more comprehensive
and more excellent than others, so is this called Illumination, as being more holy
than any other illumination which we possess.</p>
<p>IV. And as Christ the Giver of it is called by many various names, so too is this Gift,
whether it is from the exceeding gladness of its nature (as those who are very fond of a thing
take pleasure in using its name), or that the great variety of its benefits has reacted for us
upon its names. We call it, the Gift, the Grace, Baptism, Unction, Illumination, the Clothing
of Immortality, the Laver of Regeneration, the Seal, and everything that is honourable. We
call it the Gift, because it is given to us in return for nothing on our part; Grace, because it
is conferred even on debtors; Baptism, because sin is buried with it in the water; Unction,
as Priestly and Royal, for such were they who were anointed; Illumination, because of its
splendour; Clothing, because it hides our shame; the Laver, because it washes us; the Seal
because it preserves us, and is moreover the indication of Dominion. In it the heavens rejoice;
it is glorified by Angels, because of its kindred splendour. It is the image of the heavenly
bliss. We long indeed to sing out its praises, but we cannot worthily do so.</p>
<p>V. God is Light:4016 the highest, the unapproachable, the ineffable, That can neither
be conceived in the mind nor uttered with the lips,4017 That giveth life to every reasoning
creature.4018 He is in the world of thought, what the sun is in the world of sense; presenting
Himself to our minds in proportion as we are cleansed; and loved in proportion as He is
<note type="footnote">4015 This is the literal version of the passage, which is somewhat loosely quoted from 1 S. Peter iii. 21, where
the A.V. renders “the answer of a good conscience towards God,” and the R.V., “The interrogation (Marg. inquiry)
of a good conscience, etc.” The passage is usually explained as referring to the Interrogatories in Holy Baptism,
answered by the threefold Vow which enlists us “under Christ’s banner against sin, the world, and the Devil,”
professes the Faith, and promises obedience.</note>

presented to our mind; and again, conceived in proportion as we love Him; Himself contemplating
and comprehending Himself, and pouring Himself out upon what is external to
Him. That Light, I mean, which is contemplated in the Father and the Son and the Holy
Ghost, Whose riches is Their unity of nature, and the one outleaping of Their brightness.
A second Light is the Angel, a kind of outflow or communication of that first Light, drawing
its illumination from its inclination and obedience thereto; and I know not whether its illumination
is distributed according to the order of its state, or whether its order is due to the
respective measures of its illumination.4019 A third Light is man; a light which is visible to
external objects. For they call man light4020 because of the faculty of speech in us. And the
name is applied again to those of us who are more like God, and who approach God more
nearly than others. I also acknowledge another Light, by which the primeval darkness was
driven away or pierced. It was the first of all the visible creation to be called into existence;
and it irradiates the whole universe, the circling orbit of the stars, and all the heavenly beacon
fires.</p>
<p>VI. Light was also the firstborn commandment given to the firstborn man (for the
commandment of the Law is a lamp and a light;4021 and again, Because Thy judgments are
a light upon the earth);4022 although the envious darkness crept in and wrought wickedness.
And a Light typical and proportionate to those who were its subjects was the written law,
adumbrating the truth and the sacrament of the great Light, for Moses’ face was made
glorious by it.4023 And, to mention more Lights—it was Light that appeared out of Fire to
Moses, when it burned the bush indeed, but did not consume it,4024 to shew its nature and
to declare the power that was in it. And it was Light that was in the pillar of fire that led
Israel and tamed the wilderness.4025 It was Light that carried up Elias in the car of fire,4026
and yet did not burn him as it carried him. It was Light that shone round the Shepherds4027
when the Eternal Light was mingled with the temporal. It was Light that was the beauty of
the Star that went before to Bethlehem to guide the Wise Men’s way,4028 and to be the escort

of the Light That is above us, when He came amongst us. Light was That Godhead Which
was shewn upon the Mount to the disciples—and a little too strong for their eyes.4029 Light
was That Vision which blazed out upon Paul,4030 and by wounding his eyes healed the
darkness of his soul. Light is also the brilliancy of heaven to those who have been purified
here, when the righteous shall shine forth as the Sun,4031 and God shall stand in the midst
of them,4032 gods and kings, deciding and distinguishing the ranks of the Blessedness of
heaven. Light beside these in a special sense is the illumination of Baptism of which we are
now speaking; for it contains a great and marvellous sacrament of our salvation.</p>
<p>VII. For since to be utterly sinless belongs to God, and to the first and uncompounded
nature (for simplicity is peaceful, and not subject to dissension), and I venture to say also
that it belongs to the Angelic nature too; or at least, I would affirm that nature to be very
nearly sinless, because of its nearness to God; but to sin is human and belongs to the Compound
on earth (for composition is the beginning of separation); therefore the master did
not think it right to leave His creature unaided, or to neglect its danger of separation from
Himself; but on the contrary, just as He gave existence to that which did not exist, so He
gave new creation to that which did exist, a diviner creation and a loftier than the first, which
is to those who are beginning life a Seal, and to those who are more mature in age both a
gift and a restoration of the image which had fallen through sin, that we may not, by becoming
worse through despair, and ever being borne downward to that which is more evil, fall
altogether from good and from virtue, through despondency; and having fallen into a depth
of evil (as it is said) despise Him;4033 but that like those who in the course of a long journey
make a brief rest from labour at an inn, we should be enabled to accomplish the rest of the
road fresh and full of courage. Such is the grace and power of baptism; not an overwhelming
of the world as of old, but a purification of the sins of each individual, and a complete
cleansing from all the bruises and stains of sin.</p>
<p>VIII. And since we are double-made, I mean of body and soul, and the one part is visible,
the other invisible, so the cleansing also is twofold, by water and the spirit; the one received
visibly in the body, the other concurring with it invisibly and apart from the body; the one
typical, the other real and cleansing the depths. And this which comes to the aid of our first
birth, makes us new instead of old, and like God instead of what we now are; recasting us
without fire, and creating us anew without breaking us up. For, to say it all in one word,
the virtue of Baptism is to be understood as a covenant with God for a second life and a

purer conversation. And indeed all need to fear this very much, and to watch our own souls,
each one of us, with all care, that we do not become liars in respect of this profession. For
if God is called upon as a Mediator to ratify human professions, how great is the danger if
we be found transgressors of the covenant which we have made with God Himself; and if
we be found guilty before the Truth Himself of that lie, besides our other transgressions…and
that when there is no second regeneration, or recreation, or restoration to our former state,
even though we seek it with all our might, and with many sighs and tears, by which it is cicatrized
over (with great difficulty in my opinion, though we all believe that it may be cicatrized).
Yet if we might wipe away even the scars I should be glad, since I too have need of
mercy. But it is better not to stand in need of a second cleansing, but to stop at the first,
which is, I know, common to all, and involves no labour, and is of equal price to slaves, to
masters, to poor, to rich, to humble, to exalted, to gentle, to simple, to debtors, to those who
are free from debt; like the breathing of the air, and the pouring forth of the light, and the
changes of the seasons, and the sight of creation, that great delight which we all share alike,
and the equal distribution of the faith.</p>
<p>IX. For it is a strange thing to substitute for a painless remedy one which is more
painful; to cast away the grace of mercy, and owe a debt of punishment; and to measure our
amendment against sin. For how many tears must we contribute before they can equal the
fount of baptism; and who will be surety for us that death shall wait for our cure, and that
the judgment seat shall not summon us while still debtors, and needing the fire of the other
world? You perhaps, as a good and pitiful husbandman, will entreat the Master still to spare
the figtree,4034 and not yet to cut it down, though accused of unfruitfulness; but to allow
you to put dung about it in the shape of tears, sighs, invocations, sleepings on the ground,
vigils, mortifications of soul and body, and correction by confession and a life of humiliation.
But it is uncertain if the Master will spare it, inasmuch as it cumbers the ground of another
asking for mercy, and becoming deteriorated by the longsuffering shewn to this one. Let
us then be buried with Christ by Baptism,4035 that we may also rise with Him; let us descend
with Him, that we may also be exalted with Him; let us ascend with Him, that we may also
be glorified together.</p>
<p>X. If after baptism the persecutor and tempter of the light assail you (for he assailed
even the Word my God through the veil,4036 the hidden Light through that which was
manifested), you have the means to conquer him. Fear not the conflict; defend yourself
with the Water; defend yourself with the Spirit, by Which all the fiery darts of the wicked

shall be quenched.4037 It is Spirit, but That Spirit which rent the Mountains.4038 It is Water,
but that which quenches fire. If he assail you by your want (as he dared to assail Christ),
and asks that stones should be made bread, do not be ignorant of his devices.4039 Teach
him what he has not learnt. Defend yourself with the Word of life, Who is the Bread sent
down from heaven, and giving life to the world.4040 If he plot against you with vain glory
(as he did against Christ when he led Him up to the pinnacle of the temple and said to Him,
Cast Thyself down4041 as a proof of Thy Godhead), be not overborne by elation. If you be
taken by this he will not stop here. For he is insatiable, he grasps at every thing. He fawns
upon you with fair pretences, but he ends in evil; this is the manner of his fighting. Yes,
and the robber is skilled in Scripture. On the one side was that It is written about the Bread,
and on the other that it Is written about the Angels. It is written, quoth he, He shall give
His Angels charge concerning thee, and they shall bear thee in their hands.4042 O vile
sophist! how was it that thou didst suppress the words that follow, for I know it well, even
if thou passest it by in silence? I will make thee to go upon the asp and basilisk, and I will
tread upon serpents and scorpions, being fenced by the Trinity. If he wrestle against thee
to a fall through avarice, shewing thee all the Kingdoms at one instant and in the twinkling
of an eye, as belonging to himself, and demand thy worship, despise him as a beggar. Say
to him relying on the Seal, “I am myself the Image of God; I have not yet been cast down
from the heavenly Glory, as thou wast through thy pride; I have put on Christ; I have been
transformed into Christ by Baptism; worship thou me.” Well do I know that he will depart,
defeated and put to shame by this; as he did from Christ the first Light, so he will from those
who are illumined by Christ. Such blessings does the laver bestow on those who apprehend
it; such is the rich feast which it provides for those who hunger aright.</p>
<p>XI. Let us then be baptized that we may win the victory; let us partake of the cleansing
waters, more purifying than hyssop, purer than the legal blood, more sacred than the ashes
of the heifer sprinkling the unclean,4043 and providing a temporary cleansing of the body,
but not a complete taking away of sin; for if once purged, why should they need further
purification? Let us be baptized today, that we suffer not violence4044 to-morrow; and let
us not put off the blessing as if it were an injury, nor wait till we get more wicked that more

may be forgiven us; and let us not become sellers and traffickers of Christ, lest we become
more heavily burdened than we are able to bear, that we be not sunk with all hands4045 and
make shipwreck of the Gift, and lose all because we expected too much. While thou art still
master of thy thoughts run to the Gift. While thou art not yet sick in body or in mind, nor
seemest so to those who are with thee (though thou art really of sound mind); while thy
good is not yet in the power of others, but thou thyself art still master of it; while thy tongue
is not stammering or parched, or (to say no more) deprived of the power of pronouncing
the sacramental words; while thou canst still be made one of the faithful, not conjecturally
but confessedly; and canst still receive not pity but congratulation; while the Gift is still clear
to thee, and there is no doubt about it; while the grace can reach the depth of thy soul, and
it is not merely thy body that is washed for burial; and before tears surround thee announcing
thy decease—and even these restrained perhaps for thy sake—and thy wife and children
would delay thy departure, and are listening for thy dying words; before the physician is
powerless to help thee, and is giving thee but hours to live—hours which are not his to
give—and is balancing thy salvation with the nod of his head, and discoursing learnedly on
thy disease after thou art dead, or making his charges heavier by withdrawals, or hinting at
despair; before there is a struggle between the man who would baptize thee and the man
who seeks thy money, the one striving that thou mayest receive thy Viaticum, the other that
he may be inscribed in thy Will as heir—and there is no time for both.</p>
<p>XII. Why wait for a fever to bring you this blessing, and refuse it from God? Why will
you have it through lapse of time, and not through reason? Why will you owe it to a plotting
friend, and not to a saving desire? Why will you receive it of force and not of free will; of
necessity rather than of liberty? Why must you hear of your death from another, rather
than think of it as even now present? Why do you seek for drugs which will do no good, or
the sweat of the crisis, when the sweat of death is perhaps upon you? Heal yourself before
your extremity; have pity upon yourself the only true healer of your disease; apply to yourself
<note type="footnote">4045 Again a play upon words. Βαπτἰζεσθαι is sometimes used in the sense of to be drowned. The word
primarily means to Immerse, and this of course, when applied to a ship, is to sink her. The practice of immersion
in Holy Baptism was undoubtedly universal in the primitive ages, except where in cases of necessity persons
were baptized in sickness, or in prison under sentence of death; and in such cases this “Clinic” Baptism, though
recognized as valid, and therefore not to be repeated, was viewed as irregular, and disqualified its recipient from
subsequently receiving Holy Orders. Affusion was gradually allowed, probably for climatic reasons, to become
the prevailing practice of the West, though immersion predominated as late as the Twelfth Century. It is,
however, a remarkable fact that the Didache, a Manual of instruction which some date within the lifetime of
the Apostles, and nearly all are agreed in placing not later than the early years of the Second Century, expressly
permits affusion, without any hint of irregularity, or mention of any circumstance of necessity except scarcity
of water.</note>

<pb n="726"/>
the really saving medicine; while you are still sailing with a favouring breeze fear shipwreck,
and you will be in less danger of it, if you make use of your terror as a helper. Give yourself
occasion to celebrate the Gift with feasting, not with mourning; let the talent be cultivated,
not buried in the ground; let some time intervene between the grace and death, that not
only may the account of sins be wiped out, but something better may be written in its place;
that you may have not only the Gift, but also the Reward; that you may not only escape the
fire, but may also inherit the glory, which is bestowed by cultivation of the Gift. For to men
of little soul it is a great thing to escape torment; but men of great soul aim also at attaining
reward.</p>
<p>XIII. I know of three classes among the saved; the slaves, the hired servants, the sons.
If you are a slave, be afraid of the whip; if you are a hired servant, look only to receive your
hire; if you are more than this, a son, revere Him as a Father, and work that which is good,
because it is good to obey a Father; and even though no reward should come of it for you,
this is itself a reward, that you please your Father. Let us then take care not to despise these
things. How absurd it would be to grasp at money and throw away health; and to be lavish
of the cleansing of the body, but economical over the cleansing of the soul; and to seek for
freedom from earthly slavery, but not to care about heavenly freedom; and to make every
effort to be splendidly housed and dressed, but to have never a thought how you yourself
may become really very precious; and to be zealous to do good to others, without any desire
to do good to yourself. And if good could be bought, you would spare no money; but if
mercy is freely at your feet, you despise it for its cheapness. Every time is suitable for your
ablution, since any time may be your death. With Paul I shout to you with that loud voice,
“Behold now is the accepted time; behold Now is the day of salvation;”4046 and that Now
does not point to any one time, but is every present moment. And again “Awake, thou that
sleepest, and Christ shall give thee light,”4047 dispelling the darkness of sin. For as Isaiah
says,4048 In the night hope is evil, and it is more profitable to be received in the morning.</p>
<p>XIV. Sow in good season, and gather together, and open thy barns when it is the time
to do so; and plant in season, and let the clusters be cut when they are ripe, and launch
boldly in spring, and draw thy ship on shore again at the beginning of winter, when the sea
begins to rage. And let there be to thee also a time for war and a time for peace; a time to
marry, and a time to abstain from marrying; a time for friendship, and a time for discord,
if this be needed; and in short a time for everything, if you will follow Solomon’s advice.4049
And it is best to do so, for the advice is profitable. But the work of your salvation is one

upon which you should be engaged at all times; and let every time be to you the definite one
for Baptism. If you are always passing over to-day and waiting for to-morrow, by your little
procrastinations you will be cheated without knowing it by the Evil One, as his manner is.
Give to me, he says, the present, and to God the future; to me your youth, and to God old
age; to me your pleasures, and to Him your uselessness. How great is the danger that surrounds
you. How many the unexpected mischances. War has expended you; or an earthquake
overwhelmed you; or the sea swallowed you up; or a wild beast carried you off; or a
sickness killed you; or a crumb going the wrong way (a most insignificant thing, but what
is easier than for a man to die, though you are so proud of the divine image); or a too freely
indulged drinking bout;4050 or a wind knocked you down; or a horse ran away with you; or
a drug maliciously scheming against you, or perhaps found to be deleterious when meant
to be wholesome; or an inhuman judge; or an inexorable executioner; or any of the things
which make the change swiftest and beyond the power of human aid.</p>
<p>XV. But if you would fortify yourself beforehand with the Seal, and secure yourself for
the future with the best and strongest of all aids, being signed both in body and in soul with
the unction, as Israel was of old with that blood and unction of the firstborn at night that
guarded him,4051 what then can happen to you, and what has been wrought out for you?
Listen to the Proverbs. “If thou sittest, he says, thou shalt be without fear; and if thou
sleepest, thy sleep shall be sweet.”4052 And listen to David giving thee the good news, “Thou
shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, for mischance or noonday demon.”4053 This,
even while you live, will greatly contribute to your sense of safety (for a sheep that is sealed
is not easily snared, but that which is unmarked is an easy prey to thieves), and at your death
a fortunate shroud, more precious than gold, more magnificent than a sepulchre, more
reverent than fruitless libations,4054 more seasonable than ripe firstfruits, which the dead
bestow on the dead, making a law out of custom. Nay, if all things forsake thee,4055 or be
taken violently away from thee; money, possessions, thrones, distinctions, and everything
that belongs to this early turmoil, yet you will be able to lay down your life in safety, having
suffered no loss of the helps which God gave you unto salvation.</p>

<p>XVI. But are you afraid lest you should destroy the Gift, and do you therefore put off
your cleansing, because you cannot have it a second time? What? Would you not be afraid
of danger in time of persecution, and of losing the most precious Thing you have—Christ?
Would you then on this account avoid becoming a Christian? Perish the thought. Such a
fear is not for a sane man; such an argument argues insanity. O incautious caution, if I may
so. O trick of the Evil One! Truly he is darkness and pretends to be light; and when he can
no longer prevail in open war, he lays snares in secret, and gives advice, apparently good,
really evil, if by some trick at least he may prevail, and we find no escape from his plotting.
And this is clearly what he is aiming at in this instance. For, being unable to persuade you
to despise Baptism, he inflicts loss upon you through a fictitious security; that in consequence
of your fear you may suffer unconsciously the very thing you are afraid of; and because you
fear to destroy the Gift, you may for this very reason fail of the Gift altogether. This is his
character; and he will never cease his duplicity as long as he sees us pressing onwards towards
heaven from which he has fallen. Wherefore, O man of God, do thou recognize the plots
of thine adversary; for the battle is against him that hath, and it is concerned with the most
important interests. Take not thine enemy to be thy counsellor; despise not to be and to be
called Faithful. As long as you are a Catechumen you are but in the porch of Religion; you
must come inside, and cross the court, and observe the Holy Things, and look into the Holy
of Holies, and be in company with the Trinity. Great are the interests for which you are
fighting, great too the stability which you need. Protect yourself with the shield of faith.
He fears you, if you fight armed with this weapon, and therefore he would strip you of the
Gift, that he may the more easily overcome you unarmed and defenceless. He assails every
age, and every form of life; he must be repelled by all.</p>
<p>XVII. Art thou young? stand against thy passions; be numbered with the alliance in
the army of God:4056 do valiantly against Goliath.4057 Take your thousands or your myriads;
4058 thus enjoy your manhood; but do not allow your youth to be withered, being killed
by the imperfection of your faith. Are you old and near the predestined necessity? Aid your
few remaining days. Entrust the purification to your old age. Why do you fear youthful
passion in deep old age and at your last breath? Or will you wait to be washed till you are
dead, and not so much the object of pity as of dislike? Are you regretting the dregs of
pleasure, being yourself in the dregs of life? It is a shameful thing to be past indeed the

flower of your age, but not past your wickedness; but either to be involved in it still, or at
least to seem so by delaying your purification. Have you an infant child? Do not let sin get
any opportunity, but let him be sanctified from his childhood; from his very tenderest age
let him be consecrated by the Spirit. Fearest thou the Seal on account of the weakness of
nature? O what a small-souled mother, and of how little faith! Why, Anna even before
Samuel was born4059 promised him to God, and after his birth consecrated him at once,
and brought him up in the priestly habit, not fearing anything in human nature, but trusting
in God. You have no need of amulets or incantations, with which the Devil also comes in,
stealing worship from God for himself in the minds of vainer men. Give your child the
Trinity, that great and noble Guard.</p>
<p>XVIII. What more? Are you living in Virginity? Be sealed by this purification; make
this the sharer and companion of your life. Let this direct your life, your words, every
member, every movement, every sense. Honour it, that it may honour you; that it may give
to your head a crown of graces, and with a crown of delights may shield you.4060 Art thou
bound by wedlock? Be bound also by the Seal; make it dwell with you as a guardian of your
continence, safer than any number of eunuchs or of doorkeepers. Art thou not yet wedded
to flesh? Fear not this consecration; thou art pure even after marriage. I will take the risk
of that. I will join you in wedlock. I will dress the bride. We do not dishonour marriage
because we give a higher honour to virginity. I will imitate Christ, the pure Grooms-man
and Bridegroom, as He both wrought a miracle at a wedding, and honours wedlock with
His Presence.4061 Only let marriage be pure and unmingled with filthy lusts. This only I
ask; receive safety from the Gift, and give to the Gift the oblation of chastity in its due season,
when the fixed time of prayer comes round, and that which is more precious than business.
And do this by common consent and approval. For we do not command, we exhort; and
we would receive something of you for your own profit, and the common security of you
both. And in one word, there is no state of life and no occupation to which Baptism is not
profitable. You who are a free man,4062 be curbed by it; you who are in slavery, be made of
equal rank; you who are in grief, receive comfort; let the gladsome be disciplined; the poor
receive riches that cannot be taken away; the rich be made capable of being good stewards
of their possessions. Do not play tricks or lay plots against your own salvation. For even if
we can delude others we cannot delude ourselves. And so to play against oneself is very
dangerous and foolish.</p>

<p>XIX. But you have to live in the midst of public affairs, and are stained by them; and it
would be a terrible thing to waste this mercy. The answer is simple. Flee, if you can, even
from the forum, along with the good company, making yourself the wings of an eagle, or,
to speak more suitably, of a dove…for what have you to do with Cæsar or the things of
Cæsar?<gap reason=" omitted"/>until you can rest where there is no sin, and no blackening, and no biting snake
in the way to hinder your godly steps. Snatch your soul away from the world; flee from
Sodom; flee from the burning; travel on without turning back, lest you should be fixed as a
pillar of salt.4063 Escape to the Mountain lest you be destroyed with the plain. But if you
are already bound and constrained by the chain of necessity, reason thus with yourself; or
rather let me reason thus with you. It is better both to attain the good and to keep the
purification. But if it be impossible to do both it is surely better to be a little stained with
your public affairs than to fall altogether short of grace; just as I think it better to undergo
a slight punishment from father or master than to be put out of doors; and to be a little
beamed upon than to be left in total darkness. And it is the part of wise men to choose, as
in good things the greater and more perfect, so in evils the lesser and lighter. Wherefore
do not overmuch dread the purification. For our success is always judged by comparison
with our place in life by our just and merciful Judge; and often one who is in public life and
has had small success has had a greater reward than one who in the enjoyment of liberty
has not completely succeeded; as I think it more marvellous for a man to advance a little in
fetters, than for one to run who is not carrying any weight; or to be only a little spattered in
walking through mud, than to be perfectly clean when the road is clean. To give you a proof
of what I have said:—Rahab the harlot was justified by one thing alone, her hospitality,4064
though she receives no praise for the rest of her conduct; and the Publican was exalted by
one thing, his humility,4065 though he received no testimony for anything else; so that you
may learn not easily to despair concerning yourself.</p>
<p>XX. But some will say, What shall I gain, if, when I am preoccupied by baptism, and
have cut off myself by my haste from the pleasures of life, when it was in my power to give
the reins to pleasure, and then to obtain grace? For the labourers in the vineyard who had
worked the longest time gained nothing thereby, for equal wages were given to the very
last.4066 You have delivered me from some trouble, whoever you are who say this, because
you have at last with much difficulty told the secret of your delay; and though I cannot applaud
your shiftiness, I do applaud your confession. But come hither and listen to the interpretation
of the parable, that you may not be injured by Scripture for want of information.

First of all, there is no question here of baptism, but of those who believe at different times
and enter the good vineyard of the Church. For from the day and hour at which each believed,
from that day and hour he is required to work. And then, although they who entered
first contributed more to the measure of the labour yet they did not contribute more to the
measure of the purpose; nay perhaps even more was due to the last in respect of this, though
the statement may seem paradoxical. For the cause of their later entrance was their later
call to the work of the vineyard. In all other respects let us see how different they are. The
first did not believe or enter till they had agreed on their hire; but the others came forward
to do the work without an agreement, which is a proof of greater faith. And the first were
found to be of an envious and murmuring nature, but no such charge is brought against
the others. And to the first, that which was given was wages, though they were worthless
fellows; to the last it was the free gift. So that the first were convicted of folly, and with
reason deprived of the greater reward. Let us see what would have happened to them if they
had been late. Why, the equal pay, evidently. How then can they blame the employer as
unjust because of their equality? For all these things take away the merit of their labour
from the first, although they were at work first; and therefore it turns out that the distribution
of equal pay was just, if you measure the good will against the labour.</p>
<p>XXI. But supposing that the Parable does sketch the power of the font according to
your interpretation, what would prevent you, if you entered first, and bore the heat, from
avoiding envy of the last, that by this very lovingkindness you might obtain more, and receive
the reward, not as of grace but as of debt? And next, the workmen who receive the wages
are those who have entered, not those who have missed, the vineyard; which last is like to
be your case. So that if it were certain that you would obtain the Gift, though you are of
such a mind, and maliciously keep back some of the labour, you might be forgiven for taking
refuge in such arguments, and desiring to make unlawful gain out of the kindness of the
master; though I might assure you that the very fact of being able to labour is a greater reward
to any who is not altogether of a huckstering mind. But since there is a risk of your being
altogether shut out of the vineyard through your bargaining, and losing the capital through
stopping to pick up little gains, do let yourselves be persuaded by my words to forsake the
false interpretations and contradictions, and to come forward without arguing to receive
the Gift, lest you should be snatched away before you realize your hopes, and should find
out that it was to your own loss that you devised these sophistries.</p>
<p>XXII. But then, you say, is not God merciful, and since He knows our thoughts and
searches out our desires, will He not take the desire of Baptism instead of Baptism? You
are speaking in riddles, if what you mean is that because of God’s mercy the unenlightened
is enlightened in His sight; and he is within the kingdom of heaven who merely desires to
attain to it, but refrains from doing that which pertains to the kingdom. I will, however,
speak out boldly my opinion on these matters; and I think that all other sensible men will

<pb n="732"/>
range themselves on my side. Of those who have received the gift, some were altogether
alien from God and from salvation, both addicted to all manner of sin, and desirous to be
bad; others were semivicious, and in a kind of mean state between good and bad; others
again, while they did that which was evil, yet did not approve their own action, just as men
in a fever are not pleased with their own sickness. And others even before they were illuminated
were worthy of praise; partly by nature, and partly by the care with which they
prepared themselves for Baptism. These after their initiation became evidently better, and
less liable to fall; in the one case with a view to procuring good, and in the other in order to
preserve it. And amongst these, those who gave in to some evil are better than those who
were altogether bad; and better still than those who yielded a little, are those who were more
zealous, and broke up their fallow ground before Baptism; they have the advantage over the
others of having already laboured; for the font does not do away with good deeds as it does
with sins. But better even than these are they who are also cultivating the Gift, and are
polishing themselves to the utmost possible beauty.</p>
<p>XXIII. And so also in those who fail to receive the Gift, some are altogether animal or
bestial, according as they are either foolish or wicked; and this, I think, has to be added to
their other sins, that they have no reverence at all for this Gift, but look upon it as a mere
gift—to be acquiesced in if given them, and if not given them, then to be neglected. Others
know and honour the Gift, but put it off; some through laziness, some through greediness.
Others are not in a position to receive it, perhaps on account of infancy,4067 or some perfectly
involuntary circumstance through which they are prevented from receiving it, even if they
wish. As then in the former case we found much difference, so too in this. They who altogether
despise it are worse than they who neglect it through greed or carelessness. These
are worse than they who have lost the Gift through ignorance or tyranny, for tyranny is
nothing but an involuntary error.4068 And I think that the first will have to suffer punishment,
as for all their sins, so for their contempt of baptism; and that the second will also
have to suffer, but less, because it was not so much through wickedness as through folly that
they wrought their failure; and that the third will be neither glorified nor punished by the
righteous Judge, as unsealed and yet not wicked, but persons who have suffered rather than
done wrong. For not every one who is not bad enough to be punished is good enough to
be honoured; just as not every one who is not good enough to be honoured is bad enough
to be punished. And I look upon it as well from another point of view. If you judge the
<note type="footnote">4067 That S. Gregory did not reject infant Baptism is clear, from the directions given later on in this Oration
(c. xxviii; and cf. c. xvii. s. fin.). He is here referring simply to the inability of infants to bring themselves to the
font whereby through the mistaken scruples of parents many must have died unbaptized.</note>

murderously disposed man by his will alone, apart from the act of murder, then you may
reckon as baptized him who desired baptism apart from the reception of baptism. But if
you cannot do the one how can you do the other? I cannot see it. Or, if you like, we will
put it thus:—If desire in your opinion has equal power with actual baptism, then judge in
the same way in regard to glory, and you may be content with longing for it, as if that were
itself glory. And what harm is done you by your not attaining the actual glory, as long as
you have the desire for it?</p>
<p>XXIV. Therefore since you have heard these words, come forward to it, and be enlightened,
and your faces shall not be ashamed4069 through missing the Grace. Receive then
the Enlightenment in due season, that darkness pursue you not, and catch you, and sever
you from the Illumining. The night cometh when no man can work4070 after our departure
hence. The one is the voice of David, the other of the True Light which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.4071 And consider how Solomon reproves you who are too idle
or lethargic, saying, How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard,4072 and when wilt thou arise out
of thy sleep? You rely upon this or that, and “pretend pretences in sins;”4073 am waiting
for Epiphany; I prefer Easter; I will wait for Pentecost.4074 It is better to be baptized with
Christ, to rise with Christ on the Day of His Resurrection,4075 to honour the Manifestation
of the Spirit. And what then? The end will come suddenly in a day for which thou lookest
not, and in an hour that thou art not aware of; and then you will have for a companion lack
of grace; and you will be famished in the midst of all those riches of goodness, though you

of Holy Baptism; and S. Siricius Bishop of Rome about the time of S. Gregory of Nazianzus, states
that all the Churches agreed in keeping these exclusively. But this is a mistake (though Van Espen says (II., c.
i., tit. 2, c. 4) that S. Siricius acknowledges the existence of the different custom, but condemns it, and gives reference
to ad. Himerum Tarraconensem, c. 2), for there is evidence that in many Churches the Epiphany also
was thus observed, and in some Christmas also. But Tertullian (De Bapt.) says that no time is unsuitable. In
the Western Church, however, Papal decrees, Conciliar Canons, and Imperial Capitularies from the VIth to the
XIIIth. Centuries abound, limiting the administration, except in cases of sickness, to the two seasons of Easter
and Pentecost, on the Vigils of which it is still provided for in the Missals. No doubt it was felt to be a very
useful limitation, when most persons who were presented for Baptism were adults, and required preparation.
When this ceased to be the case the rule gradually became obsolete, and has long ceased to be observed.</note>

ought to reap the opposite fruit from the opposite course, a harvest by diligence, and refreshment
from the font, like the thirsty hart4076 that runs in haste to the spring, and quenches
the labour of his race by water; and not to be in Ishmael’s case, dried up for want of water,4077
or as the fable has it, punished by thirst in the midst of a spring.4078 It is a sad thing to let
the market day go by and then to seek for work. It is a sad thing to let the Manna pass and
then to long for food. It is a sad thing to take a counsel too late, and to become sensible of
the loss only when it is impossible to repair it; that is, after our departure hence, and the
bitter closing of the acts of each man’s life, and the punishment of sinners, and the glory of
the purified. Therefore do not delay in coming to grace, but hasten, lest the robber outstrip
you, lest the adulterer pass you by, lest the insatiate be satisfied before you, lest the murderer
seize the blessing first, or the publican or the fornicator, or any of these violent ones who
take the Kingdom of heaven by force.4079 For it suffers violence willingly, and is tyrannized
over through goodness.</p>
<p>XXV. Take my advice, my friend, and be slow to do evil, but swift to your salvation;
for readiness to evil and tardiness to good are equally bad. If you are invited to a revel, be
not swift to go; if to apostasy, leap away; if a company of evildoers say to you, “Come with
us, share our bloodguiltiness, let us hide in the earth a righteous man unjustly,”4080 do not
lend them even your ears. Thus you will make two very great gains; you will make known
to the other his sin, and you will deliver yourself from evil company. But if David the Great
say unto you, Come and let us rejoice in the Lord;4081 or another Prophet, Come and let us
ascend into the Mountain of the Lord;4082 or our Saviour Himself, Come unto me all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;4083 or, Arise, let us go hence,
shining brightly, glittering above snow, whiter than milk,4084 shining above the sapphire
stone; let us not resist or delay. Let us be like Peter and John, and let us hasten;4085 as they
did to the Sepulchre and the Resurrection, so we to the Font; running together, racing against

each other, striving to be first to obtain this Blessing. And say not, “Go away, and come
again, and tomorrow I will be baptized,”4086 when you may have the blessing today. “I will
have with me father, mother, brothers, wife, children, friends, and all whom I value, and
then I will be saved; but it is not yet the fitting time for me to be made bright;” for if you say
so, there is reason to fear lest you should have as sharers of your sorrow those whom you
hoped to have as sharers of your joy. If they will be with you, well;—but do not wait for
them. For it is base to say, “But where is my offering for my baptism, and where is my
baptismal robe, in which I shall be made bright, and where is what is wanted for the entertainment
of my baptizers, that in these too I may become worthy of notice? For, as you see,
all these things are necessary, and on account of this the Grace will be lessened.” Do not
thus trifle with great things, or allow yourself to think so basely. The Sacrament is greater
than the visible environment. Offer yourself; clothe yourself with Christ, feast me with your
conduct; I rejoice to be thus affectionately treated, and God Who gives these great gifts rejoices
thus. Nothing is great in the sight of God, but what the poor may give, so that the
poor may not here also be outrun, for they cannot contend with the rich. In other matters
there is a distinction between poor and rich, but here the more willing is the richer.</p>
<p>XXVI. Let nothing hinder you from going on, nor draw you away from your readiness.
While your desire is still vehement, seize upon that which you desire. While the iron is hot,
let it be tempered by the cold water, lest anything should happen in the interval, and put an
end to your desire. I am Philip; do you be Candace’s Eunuch.4087 Do you also say, “See,
here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?” Seize the opportunity; rejoice greatly
in the blessing; and having spoken be baptized; and having been baptized be saved; and
though you be an Ethiopian body, be made white in soul. Do not say, “A Bishop shall baptize
me,—and he a Metropolitan,—and he of Jerusalem (for the Grace does not come of a place,
but of the Spirit),—and he of noble birth, for it would be a sad thing for my nobility to be
insulted by being baptized by a man of no family.” Do not say, “I do not mind a mere Priest,
if he is a celibate, and a religious, and of angelic life; for it would be a sad thing for me to be
defiled even in the moment of my cleansing.” Do not ask for credentials of the preacher or
the baptizer. For another is his judge,4088 and the examiner of what thou canst not see. For
man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. But to thee let
every one be trustworthy for purification, so only he is one of those who have been approved,
not of those who are openly condemned, and not a stranger to the Church. Do not judge
your judges, you who need healing; and do not make nice distinctions about the rank of
those who shall cleanse you, or be critical about your spiritual fathers. One may be higher

<pb n="736"/>
or lower than another, but all are higher than you. Look at it this way. One may be golden,
another iron, but both are rings and have engraved on them the same royal image; and thus
when they impress the wax, what difference is there between the seal of the one and that of
the other? None. Detect the material in the wax, if you are so very clever. Tell me which
is the impression of the iron ring, and which of the golden. And how do they come to be
one? The difference is in the material and not in the seal. And so anyone can be your baptizer;
for though one may excel another in his life, yet the grace of baptism is the same, and
any one may be your consecrator who is formed in the same faith.</p>
<p>XXVII. Do not disdain to be baptized with a poor man, if you are rich; or if you are
noble, with one who is lowborn; or if you are a master, with one who is up to the present
time your slave. Not even so will you be humbling yourself as Christ, unto Whom you are
baptized today, Who for your sake took upon Himself even the form of a slave. From the
day of your new birth all the old marks were effaced, and Christ was put upon all in one
form. Do not disdain to confess your sins, knowing how John baptized, that by present
shame you may escape from future shame (for this too is a part of the future punishment);
and prove that you really hate sin by making a shew of it openly, and triumphing over it as
worthy of contempt. Do not reject the medicine of exorcism, nor refuse it because of its
length. This too is a touchstone of your right disposition for grace. What labour have you
to do compared with that of the Queen of Ethiopia,4089 who arose and came from the utmost
part of the earth to see the wisdom of Solomon? And behold a Greater than Solomon is
here4090 in the judgment of those who reason maturely. Do not hesitate either at length of
journey, or distance by sea; or fire, if this too lies before you; or of any other, small or great,
of the hindrances that you may attain to the gift. But if without any labour and trouble at
all you may obtain that which you desire, what folly it is to put off the gift: “Ho, every one
that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,”4091 Esaias invites you, “and he that hath no money,
come buy wine and milk, without money and without price.” O swiftness of His mercy: O
easiness of the Covenant: This blessing may be bought by you merely for willing it; He accepts
the very desire as a great price; He thirsts to be thirsted for; He gives to drink to all who
desire to drink; He takes it as a kindness to be asked for the kindness; He is ready and liberal;
He gives with more pleasure than others receive.4092 Only let us not be condemned for
frivolity by asking for little, and for what is unworthy of the Giver. Blessed is he from whom
Jesus asks drink, as He did from that Samaritan woman, and gives a well of water springing
up unto eternal life.4093 Blessed is he that soweth beside all waters, and upon every soul,

tomorrow to be ploughed and watered, which today the ox and the ass tread, while it is dry
and without water,4094 and oppressed with unreason. And blessed is he who, though he be
a “valley of rushes,”4095 is watered out of the House of the Lord; for he is made fruitbearing
instead of rushbearing, and produces that which is for the food of man, not that which is
rough and unprofitable. And for the sake of this we must be very careful not to miss the
Grace.</p>
<p>XXVIII. Be it so, some will say, in the case of those who ask for Baptism; what have you
to say about those who are still children, and conscious neither of the loss nor of the grace?
Are we to baptize them too? Certainly, if any danger presses. For it is better that they should
be unconsciously sanctified than that they should depart unsealed and uninitiated.</p>
<p>A proof of this is found in the Circumcision on the eighth day, which was a sort of
typical seal, and was conferred on children before they had the use of reason. And so is the
anointing of the doorposts,4096 which preserved the firstborn, though applied to things
which had no consciousness. But in respect of others4097 I give my advice to wait till the
end of the third year, or a little more or less, when they may be able to listen and to answer
something about the Sacrament; that, even though they do not perfectly understand it, yet
at any rate they may know the outlines; and then to sanctify them in soul and body with the
great sacrament of our consecration. For this is how the matter stands; at that time they
begin to be responsible for their lives, when reason is matured, and they learn the mystery
of life (for of sins of ignorance owing to their tender years they have no account to give),
and it is far more profitable on all accounts to be fortified by the Font, because of the sudden
assaults of danger that befall us, stronger than our helpers.</p>
<p>XXIX. But, one says, Christ was thirty years old when He was baptized,4098 and that
although He was God; and do you bid us hurry our Baptism?—You have solved the difficulty
when you say He was God. For He was absolute cleansing; He had no need of cleansing;
but it was for you that He was purified, just as it was for you that, though He had not flesh,
yet He is clothed with flesh. Nor was there any danger to Him from putting off Baptism,
for He had the ordering of His own Passion as of His own Birth. But in your case the danger
is to no small interests, if you were to depart after a birth to corruption alone, and without
being clothed with incorruption. And there is this further point for me to consider, that
that particular time of baptism was a necessity for Him, but your case is not the same. He
manifested Himself in the thirtieth year after His birth and not before; first, in order that

<pb n="738"/>
He might not appear ostentatious, which is a condition belonging to vulgar minds; and next,
because that age tests virtue thoroughly, and is the right time to teach. And since it was
needful for Him to undergo the passion which saves the world, it was needful also that all
things which belong to the passion should fit into the passion; the Manifestation, the Baptism,
the Witness from Heaven, the Proclamation, the concourse of the multitude, the Miracles;
and that they should be as it were one body, not torn asunder, nor broken apart by intervals.
For out of the Baptism and Proclamation arose that earthquake of people coming together,
4099 for so Scripture calls that time;4100 and out of the multitude arose the shewing of the
signs and the miracles that lead up to the Gospel. And out of these came the jealousy, and
from this the hatred, and out of the hatred the circumstance of the plot against Him, and
the betrayal; and out of these the Cross, and the other events by which our Salvation has
been effected. Such are the reasons in the case of Christ4101 so far as we can attain to them.
And perhaps another more secret reason might be found.</p>
<p>XXX. But for you, what necessity is there that by following the examples which are far
above you, you should do a thing so ill-advised for yourself? For there are many other details
of the Gospel History which are quite different to what happens nowadays, and the seasons
of which do not correspond. For instance Christ fasted a little before His temptation, we
before Easter. As far as the fasting days are concerned it is the same,4102 but the difference
in the seasons is no little one. He armed Himself with them against temptation; but to us
this fast is symbolical of dying with Christ, and it is a purification in preparation for the
festival. And He fasted absolutely for forty days, for He was God; but we measure our fasting
by our power, even though some are led by zeal to rush beyond their strength. Again, He
gave the Sacrament of the Passover to His Disciples in an upper chamber, and after supper,
and one day before He suffered; but we celebrate it in Houses of Prayer, and before food,4103
and after His resurrection. He rose again the third day; our resurrection is not till after a
long time. But matters which have to do with Him are neither abruptly separated from us,
nor yet yoked together with those which concern us in point of time; but they were handed
down to us just so far as to be patterns of what we should do, and then they carefully avoided
an entire and exact resemblance.</p>

<p>XXXI. If then you will listen to me, you will bid a long farewell to all such arguments,
and you will jump at this Blessing, and begin to struggle in a twofold conflict; first, to prepare
yourself for baptism by purifying yourself; and next, to preserve the baptismal gift; for it is
a matter of equal difficulty to obtain a blessing which we have not, and to keep it when we
have gained it. For often what zeal has acquired sloth has destroyed; and what hesitation
has lost diligence has regained. A great assistance to the attainment of what you desire are
vigils, fasts, sleeping on the ground, prayers, tears, pity of and almsgiving to those who are
in need. And let these be your thanksgiving for what you have received, and at the same
time your safeguard of them. You have the benefit to remind you of many commandments;
so do not transgress them. Does a poor man approach you? Remember how poor you once
were, and how rich you were made. One in want of bread or of drink, perhaps another
Lazarus,4104 is cast at your gate; respect the Sacramental Table to which you have approached,
the Bread of Which you have partaken, the Cup in Which you have communicated,4105
being consecrated by the Sufferings of Christ. If a stranger fall at your feet, homeless and a
foreigner, welcome in him Him who for your sake was a stranger, and that among His
own,4106 and who came to dwell in you by His grace, and who drew you towards the heavenly
dwelling place. Be a Zaccheus,4107 who yesterday was a Publican, and is to-day of liberal
soul; offer all to the coming in of Christ, that though small in bodily stature you may show
yourself great, nobly contemplating Christ. A sick or a wounded man lies before you; respect
your own health, and the wounds from which Christ delivered you. If you see one naked
clothe him, in honour of your own garment of incorruption, which is Christ, for as many
as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.4108 If you find a debtor falling at your
feet,4109 tear up every document, whether just or unjust. Remember the ten thousand talents
which Christ forgave you, and be not a harsh exactor of a smaller debt—and that from
whom? From your fellow servant, you who were forgiven so much more by the Master.
Otherwise you will have to give satisfaction to His mercy, which you would not imitate and
take as your copy.</p>
<p>XXXII. Let the laver be not for your body only, but also for the image of God in you;
not merely a washing away of sins in you, but also a correction of your temper; let it not
only wash away the old filth, but let it purify the fountainhead. Let it not only move you to

honourable acquisition, but let it teach you also honourably to lose possession; or, which is
more easy, to make restitution of what you have wrongfully acquired. For what profit is it
that your sin should have been forgiven you, but the loss which you have inflicted should
not be repaired to him whom you have injured? Two sins are on your conscience, the one
that you made a dishonest gain, the other that you retained the gains; you received forgiveness
for the one, but in respect of the other you are still in sin, for you have still possession of
what belongs to another; and your sin has not been put to an end, but only divided by the
time which has elapsed. Part of it was perpetrated before your Baptism, but part remains
after your Baptism; for Baptism carries forgiveness of Past, not of Present sins; and its
purification must not be played with, but be genuinely impressed upon you; you must be
made perfectly bright, and not be merely coloured; you must receive the gift, not of a mere
covering of your sins, but of a taking them clean away. Blessed are they whose iniquities
are forgiven4110…this is done by the complete cleansing…and whose sins are hidden…this
belongs to those who are not yet healed in their deepest soul. Blessed is the man to whom
the Lord will not impute sin.…This is a third class of sinners, whose actions are not praiseworthy,
but who are innocent of intention.</p>
<p>XXXIII. What say I then, and what is my argument? Yesterday you were a Canaanite
soul bent together4111 by sin; today you have been made straight by the Word. Do not be
bent gain, and condemned to the earth, as if weighed down by the Devil with a wooden
collar, nor get an incurable curvature. Yesterday you were being dried up4112 by an
abundant hæmorrhage, for you were pouring out crimson sin; today stanched and flourishing
again, for you have touched the hem of Christ and your issue has been stayed. Guard, I
pray you, the cleansing lest you should again have a hæmorrhage, and not be able to lay
hold of Christ to steal salvation; for Christ does not like to be stolen from often, though He
is very merciful. Yesterday you were flung upon a bed, exhausted and paralyzed, and you
had no one when the water should be troubled to put you into the pool.4113 Today you
have Him Who is in one Person Man and God, or rather God and Man. You were raised
up from your bed, or rather you took up your bed, and publicly acknowledged the benefit.
Do not again be thrown upon your bed by sinning, in the evil rest of a body paralyzed by
its pleasures. But as you now are, so walk, mindful of the command,4114 Behold thou art
made whole; sin no more lest a worse thing happen unto thee if thou prove thyself bad after
the blessing thou hast received. You have heard the loud voice, Lazarus, come forth,4115 as

you lay in the tomb; not, however, after four days, but after many days; and you were loosed
from the bonds of your graveclothes. Do not again become dead, nor live with those who
dwell in the tombs;4116 nor bind yourself with the bonds of your own sins;4117 for it is uncertain
whether you will rise again from the tomb till the last and universal resurrection,
which will bring every work into judgment,4118 not to be healed, but to be judged, and to
give account of all which for good or evil it has treasured up.</p>
<p>XXXIV. If you were full of leprosy, that shapeless evil, yet you scraped off the evil
matter, and received again the Image whole. Shew your cleansing to me your Priest, that I
may recognize how much more precious it is than the legal one. Do not range yourself with
the nine unthankful men, but imitate the tenth.4119 For although he was a Samaritan, yet
he was of better mind than the others. Make certain that you will not break out again with
evil ulcers, and find the indisposition of your body hard to heal. Yesterday meanness and
avarice were withering your hand; to-day let liberality and kindness stretch it out.4120 It is
a noble cure for a weak hand to disperse abroad, to give to the poor,4121 to pour out the
things which we possess abundantly, till we reach the very bottom; and perhaps this will
gush forth food for you, as for the woman of Sarepta,4122 and especially if you happen to
be feeding an Elias, to recognize that it is a good abundance to be needy for the sake of
Christ, Who for our sakes became poor. If you were deaf and dumb, let the Word sound4123
in your ears, or rather keep there Him Who hath sounded. Do not shut your ears to the
Instruction of the Lord, and to His Counsel, like the adder to charms.4124 If you are blind
and unenlightened, lighten your eyes that you sleep not in death.4125 In God’s Light see
light,4126 and in the Spirit of God be enlightened by the Son, That Threefold and Undivided
Light. If you receive all the Word, you will bring therewith upon your own soul all the
healing powers of Christ, with which separately these individuals were healed. Only be not
ignorant of the measure of grace; only let not the enemy, while you sleep, maliciously sow
tares.4127 Only take care that as by your cleansing you have become an object of enmity to

the Evil One, you do not again make yourself an object of pity by sin. Only be careful lest,
while rejoicing and lifted up above measure by the blessing, you fall again through pride.
Only be diligent as to your cleansing, “setting ascensions in your heart,”4128 and keep with
all diligence the remission which you have received as a gift, in order that, while the remission
comes from God, the preservation of it may come from yourself also.</p>
<p>XXXV. How shall this be? Remember always the parable,4129 and so will you best and
most perfectly help yourself. The unclean and malignant spirit is gone out of you, being
chased by baptism. He will not submit to the expulsion, he will not resign himself to be
houseless and homeless: He goes through waterless places, dry of the Divine Stream, and
there he desires to abide. He wanders, seeking rest; he finds none. He lights on baptized
souls, whose sins the font has washed away. He fears the water; he is choked with the
cleansing, as the Legion were in the sea.4130 Again he returns to the house whence he came
out. He is shameless, he is contentious, he makes a fresh assault upon it, he makes a new
attempt. If he finds that Christ has taken up His abode there, and has filled the place which
he had vacated, he is driven back again, and goes off without success and is become an object
of pity in his wandering state. But if he finds in you a place, swept and garnished indeed,
but empty and idle, equally ready to take in this or that which shall first occupy it, he makes
a leap into it, he takes up his abode there with a larger train; and the last state is worse than
the first, inasmuch as then there was a hope of amendment and safety, but now the evil is
rampant, and drags in sin by its flight from good, and therefore the possession is more secure
to him who dwells there.</p>
<p>XXXVI. I will remind you again about Illuminations, and that often, and will reckon
them up from Holy Scripture. For I myself shall be happier for remembering them (for
what is sweeter than light to those who have tasted light?) and I will dazzle you with my
words. There is sprung up a light for the righteous, and its partner joyful gladness.4131
And, The light of the righteous is everlasting;4132 and Thou art shining wondrously from
the everlasting mountains, is said to God, I think of the Angelic powers which aid our efforts
after good. And you have heard David’s words; The Lord is my Light and my Salvation,
whom then shall I fear?4133 And now he asks that the Light and the Truth may be sent forth
<note type="footnote">4128 Ps. lxxxiv. 6. So LXX. and Vulgate. Various interpretations are given of these Steps, but they differ only
by indicating different virtues and good works as especially intended, and may well be summed up under the
three heads of the purgative, illuminative, and unitive ways of salvation. A man can set in his heart such a “going
up” by the co-operation of grace and free will.—Neale U+0026 Littledale in Pss.</note>

for him,4134 now giving thanks that he has a share in it, in that the Light of God is marked
upon him;4135 that is, that the signs of the illumination given are impressed upon him and
recognized. One light alone let us shun—that which is the offspring of the baleful fire; let
us not walk in the light of our fire,4136 and in the flame which we have kindled. For I know
a cleansing fire which Christ came to send upon the earth,4137 and He Himself is anagogically4138
called a Fire. This Fire takes away whatsoever is material and of evil habit; and this
He desires to kindle with all speed, for He longs for speed in doing us good, since He gives
us even coals of fire to help us.4139 I know also a fire which is not cleansing, but avenging;
either that fire of Sodom4140 which He pours down on all sinners,4141 mingled with brimstone
and storms, or that which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels4142 or that which
proceeds from the face of the Lord, and shall burn up his enemies round about;4143 and one
even more fearful still than these, the unquenchable fire4144 which is ranged with the worm
that dieth not but is eternal for the wicked. For all these belong to the destroying power;
though some may prefer even in this place to take a more merciful view4145 of this fire,
worthily of Him That chastises.</p>
<p>XXXVII. And as I know of two kinds of fire, so also do I of light. The one is the light
of our ruling power directing our steps according to the will of God; the other is a deceitful
and meddling one, quite contrary to the true light, though pretending to be that light, that
it may cheat us by its appearance. This really is darkness, yet has the appearance of noonday,
the high perfection of light. And so I read that passage of those who continually flee in
darkness at noonday;4146 for this is really night, and yet is thought to be bright light by those
who have been ruined by luxury. For what saith David? “Night was around me and I knew

it not, for I thought that my luxury was enlightenment.”4147 But such are they, and in this
condition; but let us kindle for ourselves the light of knowledge.4148 This will be done by
sowing unto righteousness, and reaping the fruit of life, for action is the patron of contemplation,
that amongst other things we may learn also what is the true light, and what the
false, and be saved from falling unawares into evil wearing the guise of good. Let us be made
light, as it was said to the disciples by the Great Light, ye are the light of the world.4149 Let
us be made lights in the world, holding forth the Word of Life;4150 that is, let us be made a
quickening power to others. Let us lay hold of the Godhead; let us lay hold of the First and
Brightest Light. Let us walk towards Him shining, before our feet stumble upon dark and
hostile mountains.4151 While it is day let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,4152 which are the dishonesties of the
night.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. Let us cleanse every member, Brethren, let us purify every sense; let nothing
in us be imperfect or of our first birth; let us leave nothing unilluminated. Let us enlighten
our eyes,4153 that we may look straight on, and not bear in ourselves any harlot idol through
curious and busy sight; for even though we might not worship lust, yet our soul would be
defiled. If there be beam or mote,4154 let us purge it away, that we may be able to see those
of others also. Let us be enlightened in our ears; let us be enlightened in our tongue, that
we may hearken what the Lord God will speak,4155 and that He may cause4156 us to hear
His lovingkindness in the morning, and that we may be made to hear of joy and gladness,4157
spoken into godly ears, that we may not be a sharp sword, nor a whetted razor,4158 nor turn
under our tongue labour and toil,4159 but that we may speak the Wisdom of God in a mystery,

even the hidden Wisdom,4160 reverencing the fiery tongues.4161 Let us be healed also in
the smell, that we be not effeminate; and be sprinkled with dust instead of sweet perfumes,4162
but may smell the Ointment that was poured out for us,4163 spiritually receiving it; and so
formed and transformed by it, that from us too a sweet odour may be smelled. Let us cleanse
our touch, our taste, our throat, not touching them over gently, nor delighting in smooth
things, but handling them as is worthy of Him, the Word That was made flesh for us; and
so far following the example of Thomas,4164 not pampering them with dainties and sauces,
those brethren of a more baleful pampering,4165 but tasting and learning that the Lord is
good,4166 with the better and abiding taste; and not for a short while refreshing that baneful
and thankless dust, which lets pass and does not hold that which is given to it; but delighting
it with the words which are sweeter than honey.4167</p>

the head which is the workshop of the senses is cleansed, to hold fast the Head of Christ,4168
from which the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted; and to cast down our
sin that exalted itself, when it would exalt us above our better part. It is good also for the
shoulder to be sanctified and purified that it may be able to take up the Cross of Christ,
which not everyone can easily do. It is good for the hands to be consecrated, and the feet;
the one that they may in every place be lifted up holy;4169 and that they may lay hold of the
discipline4170 of Christ, lest the Lord at any time be angered; and that the Word may gain
credence by action, as was the case with that which was given in the hand of a prophet;4171
the other, that they be not swift to shed blood, nor to run to evil,4172 but that they be prompt
to run to the Gospel and the Prize4173 of the high Calling, and to receive Christ Who washes
and cleanses them. And if there be also a cleansing of that belly which receiveth and digesteth

the food of the Word, it were good also; not to make it a god by luxury and the meat that
perisheth,4174 but rather to give it all possible cleansing, and to make it more spare, that it
may receive the Word of God at the very heart, and grieve honourably over the sins of Israel.
4175 I find also the heart and inward parts deemed worthy of honour. David convinces
me of this, when he prays that a clean heart may be created in him, and a right spirit renewed
in his inward parts;4176 meaning, I think, the mind and its movements or thoughts.</p>
<p>XL. And what of the loins, or reins, for we must not pass these over? Let the purification
take hold of these also. Let our loins be girded about and kept in check by continence, as
the Law bade Israel of old when partaking of the Passover.4177 For none comes out of Egypt
purely, or escapes the Destroyer, except he who has disciplined these. And let the reins be
changed by that good conversion by which they transfer all the affections to God, so that
they can say, Lord, all my desire is before Thee,4178 and the day of man have I not desired;4179
for you must be a man of desires,4180 but they must be those of the spirit. For thus you
would destroy the dragon that carries the greater part of his strength upon his navel and his
loins,4181 by slaying the power that comes to him from these. Do not be surprised at my
giving a more abundant honour to our uncomely parts,4182 mortifying them and making
them chaste by my speech, and standing up against the flesh. Let us give to God all our
members which are upon the earth;4183 let us consecrate them all; not the lobe of the liver4184

Again Moses assigned the shoulder and the breast of some sacrifices to the Priests, hinting obscurely at this,
that we ought to take care to offer our hearts to the Priests by confession (for the heart is signified by the breast
which protects it) and also our actions, which are intended by the shoulder, that by the Priest they may be
presented to God. But the Apostle bids us mortify all our members which are upon the earth, and offer ourselves
entire as a sacrifice to God, destroying with the sword of the Word of God all our evil and corrupt affections.—

sacrifices; and let us not make only the shoulder or the breast a portion for the Priest to take
away,4186 for that would be a small thing, but let us give ourselves entire, that we may receive
back ourselves entire; for this is to receive entirely, when we give ourselves to God and offer
as a sacrifice our own salvation.</p>
<p>XLI. Besides all this and before all, keep I pray you the good deposit, by which I live
and work, and which I desire to have as the companion of my departure; with which I endure
all that is so distressful, and despise all delights; the confession of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost. This I commit unto you to-day; with this I will baptize you and make
you grow. This I give you to share, and to defend all your life, the One Godhead and Power,
found in the Three in Unity, and comprising the Three separately, not unequal, in substances
or natures, neither increased nor diminished by superiorities or inferiorities; in every respect
equal, in every respect the same; just as the beauty and the greatness of the heavens is one;
the infinite conjunction of Three Infinite Ones, Each God when considered in Himself; as
the Father so the Son, as the Son so the Holy Ghost; the Three One God when contemplated
together; Each God because Consubstantial; One God because of the Monarchia. No
sooner do I conceive of the One than I am illumined by the Splendour of the Three; no
sooner do I distinguish Them than I am carried back to the One. When I think of any One
of the Three I think of Him as the Whole, and my eyes are filled, and the greater part of
what I am thinking of escapes me.4187 I cannot grasp the greatness of That One so as to
attribute a greater greatness to the Rest. When I contemplate the Three together, I see but
one torch, and cannot divide or measure out the Undivided Light.</p>
<p>XLII. Do you fear to speak of Generation lest you should attribute aught of passion to
the impassible God? I on the other hand fear to speak of Creation, lest I should destroy God
by the insult and the untrue division, either cutting the Son away from the Father, or from
the Son the Substance of the Spirit. For this paradox is involved, that not only is a created
Life foisted into the Godhead by those who measure Godhead badly; but even this created
life is divided against itself. For as these low earthly minds make the Son subject to the
Father, so again is the rank of the Spirit made inferior to that of the Son, until both God and

I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ, says the Apostle;4189 and if I yet
worshipped a creature, or were baptized into a creature, I should not be made divine, nor
have changed my first birth. What shall I say to those who worship Astarte or Chemosh,
the abomination of the Sidonians, or the likeness of a star,4190 a god a little above them to
these idolaters, but yet a creature and a piece of workmanship, when I myself either do not
worship Two of Those into Whose united Name I am baptized, or else worship my fellowservants,
for they are fellow-servants, even if a little higher in the scale; for differences must
exist among fellow-servants.</p>
<p>XLIII. I should like to call the Father the greater, because from him flows both the
Equality and the Being of the Equals (this will be granted on all hands), but I am afraid to
use the word Origin, lest I should make Him the Origin of Inferiors, and thus insult Him
by precedencies of honour. For the lowering of those Who are from Him is no glory to the
Source. Moreover, I look with suspicion at your insatiate desire, for fear you should take
hold of this word Greater, and divide the Nature, using the word Greater in all senses,
whereas it does not apply to the Nature, but only to Origination. For in the Consubstantial
Persons there is nothing greater or less in point of Substance. I would honour the Son as
Son before the Spirit, but Baptism consecrating me through the Spirit does not allow of this.
But are you afraid of being reproached with Tritheism? Do you take possession of this good
thing, the Unity in the Three, and leave me to fight the battle. Let me be the shipbuilder,
and do you use the ship; or if another is the builder of the ship, take me for the architect of
the house, and do you live in it with safety, though you spent no labour upon it. You shall
not have a less prosperous voyage, or a less safe habitation than I who built them, because
you have not laboured upon them. See how great is my indulgence; see the goodness of the
Spirit; the war shall be mine, yours the achievement; I will be under fire, and you shall live
in peace; but join with your defender in prayer, and give me your hand by the Faith. I have
three stones which I will sling at the Philistine;4191 I have three inspirations against the son
of the Sareptan,4192 with which I will quicken the slain; I have three floods against the faggots
with which I will consecrate the Sacrifice with water, raising the most unexpected fire;4193
and I will throw down the prophets of shame by the power of the Sacrament.</p>
<p>XLIV. What need have I any more of speech? It is the time for teaching, not for controversy.

thy heart is written upon in some other way than as my teaching demands, come and have
the writing changed; I am no unskilled caligrapher of these truths. I write that which is
written upon my own heart; and I teach that which I have been taught, and have kept from
the beginning up to these hoar hairs.4195 Mine is the risk; be mine also the reward of being
the Director of your soul, and consecrating you by Baptism. But if you are already rightly
disposed, and marked with the good inscription, see that you keep what is written, and remain
unchanged in a changing time concerning an unchanging Thing. Follow Pilate’s example
in the better sense; you who are rightly written on, imitate him who wrote wrongfully. Say
to those who would persuade you differently, what I have written, I have written.4196 For
indeed I should be ashamed if, while that which was wrong remained inflexible, that which
is right should be so easily bent aside; whereas we ought to be easily bent to that which is
better from that which is worse, but immovable from the better to the worse. If it be thus,
and according to this teaching that you come to Baptism, lo I will not refrain my lips,4197
lo I lend my hands to the Spirit; let us hasten your salvation. The Spirit is eager, the Consecrator
is ready, the Gift is prepared. But if you still halt and will not receive the perfectness
of the Godhead, go and look for someone else to baptize—or rather to drown you: I have
no time to cut the Godhead, and to make you dead in the moment of your regeneration,
that you should have neither the Gift nor the Hope of Grace, but should in so short a time
make shipwreck of your salvation. For whatever you may subtract from the Deity of the
Three, you will have overthrown the whole, and destroyed your own being made perfect.
XLV. But not yet perhaps is there formed upon your soul any writing good or bad; and
you want to be written upon today, and formed by us unto perfection. Let us go within the
cloud. Give me the tables of your heart; I will be your Moses, though this be a bold thing
to say; I will write on them with the finger of God a new Decalogue.4198 I will write on them
a shorter method of salvation. And if there be any heretical or unreasoning beast, let him
remain below, or he will run the risk of being stoned by the Word of truth. I will baptize
you and make you a disciple in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost;4199 and These Three have One common name, the Godhead. And you shall know,
both by appearances4200 and by words that you reject all ungodliness, and are united to all

the Godhead. Believe that all that is in the world, both all that is seen and all that is unseen,
was made out of nothing by God, and is governed by the Providence of its Creator, and will
receive a change to a better state. Believe that evil has no substance or kingdom, either unoriginate
or self-existent or created by God; but that it is our work, and the evil one’s, and
came upon us through our heedlessness, but not from our Creator. Believe that the Son of
God, the Eternal Word, Who was begotten of the Father before all time and without body,
was in these latter days for your sake made also Son of Man, born of the Virgin Mary ineffably
and stainlessly (for nothing can be stained where God is, and by which salvation comes), in
His own Person at once entire Man and perfect God, for the sake of the entire sufferer, that
He may bestow salvation on your whole being, having destroyed the whole condemnation
of your sins: impassible in His Godhead, passible in that which He assumed; as much Man
for your sake as you are made God for His. Believe that for us sinners He was led to death;
was crucified and buried, so far as to taste of death; and that He rose again the third day,
and ascended into heaven, that He might take you with Him who were lying low; and that
He will come again with His glorious Presence to judge the quick and the dead; no longer
flesh, nor yet without a body, according to the laws which He alone knows of a more godlike
body, that He may be seen by those who pierced Him,4201 and on the other hand may remain
as God without carnality. Receive besides this the Resurrection, the Judgment and the Reward
according to the righteous scales of God; and believe that this will be Light to those whose
mind is purified (that is, God—seen and known) proportionate to their degree of purity,
which we call the Kingdom of heaven; but to those who suffer from blindness of their ruling
faculty, darkness, that is estrangement from God, proportionate to their blindness here.
Then, in the tenth place, work that which is good upon this foundation of dogma; for faith
without works is dead,4202 even as are works apart from faith. This is all that may be divulged
of the Sacrament, and that is not forbidden to the ear of the many. The rest you shall learn
within the Church by the grace of the Holy Trinity; and those matters you shall conceal
within yourself, sealed and secure.</p>

The Psalmody with which you will be received is a prelude to the Psalmody of Heaven; the
lamps which you will kindle are a Sacrament of the illumination there with which we shall
meet the Bridegroom, shining and virgin souls, with the lamps of our faith shining, not
sleeping through our carelessness, that we may not miss Him that we look for if He come
unexpectedly; nor yet unfed, and without oil, and destitute of good works, that we be not
cast out of the Bridechamber. For I see how pitiable is such a case. He will come when the
cry demands the meeting, and they who are prudent shall meet Him, with their light shining
and its food abundant, but the others seeking for oil too late from those who possess it.
And He will come with speed, and the former shall go in with Him, but the latter shall be
shut out, having wasted in preparations the time of entrance; and they shall weep sore when
all too late they learn the penalty of their slothfulness, when the Bride-chamber can no
longer be entered by them for all their entreaties, for they have shut it against themselves
by their sin, following in another fashion the example of those who missed the Wedding
feast4204 with which the good Father feasts the good Bridegroom; one on account of a newly
wedded wife; another of a newly purchased field; another of a yoke of oxen; which he and
they acquired to their misfortune, since for the sake of the little they lose the great. For none
are there of the disdainful, nor of the slothful, nor of those who are clothed in filthy rags
and not in the Wedding garment even though here they may have thought themselves
worthy of wearing the bright robe there, and secretly intruded themselves, deceiving themselves
with vain hopes. And then, What? When we have entered, then the Bridegroom
knows what He will teach us, and how He will converse with the souls that have come in
with Him. He will converse with them, I think in teaching things more perfect and more
pure. Of which may we all, both Teachers and Taught, have share, in the Same Christ our
Lord, to Whom be the Glory and the Empire, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XLI.</head>
<p>On Pentecost.</p>
<p>It is uncertain to what year the following Oration belongs. It was, however, certainly delivered
at Constantinople; the Benedictine Editors think in the year 381, in which case the day
would be May 16. An indication tending to establish this date is found in c. 14, in the expression
of apprehension of personal danger to himself for his boldness in setting forth the true
faith. In fact, in the earlier part of this year, after the Emperor Theodosius had put him in
possession of the Patriarchal Throne, vacant by the expulsion and deposition of the Arian
Demophilus, he had narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of the Arians.</p>
<p>The Oration deals again with the subject of the Fifth Theological Oration, the question
of the Deity of the Holy Ghost, but proceeds to establish the point by quite a different set of
arguments from those adopted in the former discourse, none of whose points are here repeated.</p>
<p>The Preacher begins by commenting on the various ways in which Festivals are kept by
Jews, by Heathen and by Christians. Then he remarked on the mystical significance of the
number Seven, which he illustrates by several instances; and next proceeds with his principal
Subject.</p>
<p>God the Holy Ghost, he says, completes the work of Christ. Those who regard Him as a
Created Being, as did the followers of Macedonius, are thereby guilty of blasphemy and impiety.
The true Faith recognizes Him as God; and this belief is necessary to salvation; yet some reserve
must be employed in applying that Name to Him. We must indeed insist on the recognition
of His possession of all the attributes of Godhead; and we must at any rate bear with those
who, like the Orator himself, also give Him the Name of God, which he hopes all his hearers
will receive from the Holy Ghost grace to do. Then he proceeds to shew from Holy Scripture
that in fact all the Attributes of Deity do belong to the Holy Spirit; and that His distinctive
Personal Mark is that He is neither Unbegotten like the Father, nor Begotten like the Son. He
does not touch on the question of the double Procession.</p>
<p>It would seem from some expressions in c. 8 that this Discourse was not delivered to his
usual audience, but to an Assembly of “Religious.”</p>
<p>The Title of the Oration varies in different mss. Thus some have it “Of The Same On
Pentecost,” to which one adds “And On The Holy Spirit;” and another puts it “Of The Same,
a Homily on Pentecost.” The printed Editions before the Benedictine have “On The Holy
Pentecost.”</p>
<p>I. Let us reason a little about the Festival, that we may keep it spiritually. For different
persons have different ways of keeping Festival; but to the worshipper of the Word a discourse
seems best; and of discourses, that which is best adapted to the occasion. And of all beautiful
things none gives so much joy to the lover of the beautiful, as that the lover of festivals should

<pb n="753"/>
keep them spiritually. Let us look into the matter thus. The Jew keeps festival as well as we,
but only in the letter. For while following after the bodily Law, he has not attained to the
spiritual Law. The Greek too keeps festival, but only in the body, and in honour of his own
gods and demons, some of whom are creators of passion by their own admission, and others
were honoured out of passion. Therefore even their manner of keeping festival is passionate,
as though their very sin were an honour to God, in Whom their passion takes refuge as a
thing to be proud of.4205 We too keep festival, but we keep it as is pleasing to the Spirit.
And it is pleasing to Him that we should keep it by discharging some duty, either of action
or speech. This then is our manner of keeping festival, to treasure up in our soul some of
those things which are permanent and will cleave to it, not of those which will forsake us
and be destroyed, and which only tickle our senses for a little while; whereas they are for
the most part, in my judgment at least, harmful and ruinous. For sufficient unto the body
is the evil thereof. What need has that fire of further fuel, or that beast of more plentiful
food, to make it more uncontrollable, and too violent for reason?</p>
<p>II. Wherefore we must keep the feast spiritually. And this is the beginning of our discourse;
for we must speak, even if our speech do seem a little too discursive; and we must
be diligent for the sake of those who love learning, that we may as it were mix up some
seasoning with our solemn festival. The children of the Hebrews do honour to the number
Seven, according to the legislation of Moses (as did the Pythagoreans in later days to the
number Four, by which indeed they were in the habit of swearing4206 as the Simonians and
Marcionites4207 do by the number Eight and the number Thirty, inasmuch as they have
<note type="footnote">4205 They deify bad passions, and then act as if the gratification of them were an honour to the gods in whom
they have personified them.</note>
<note type="footnote">4206 The followers of Pythagoras swore by their master, who taught them the mystic properties of the number
Four, which he called the Fountain of the Universe, because all things were made of four elements.</note>
<note type="footnote">4207 The Simonians and Marcionites were two Gnostic sects, the one deriving its name from Simon Magus,
the other from Marcion of Sinope. Simon, of whom we read in the Acts c. viii., is generally regarded by the
Fathers as the precursor of the Gnostic Heresies. He maintained a system of Emanations from God, of which
he claimed to be himself the chief. In his teaching the first cause of all things was an Ineffable Existence or Nonexistence,
which he sometimes called Silence and sometimes Fire, from which the Universe was generated by a
series of six Emanations called Roots, which he arranged in pairs, male and female; and these six contained
among them the whole Essence of his first Principle Silence. These Roots with Simon himself and his consort
Helena, make up the Ogdoad referred to in the text. Marcion was a native of Sinope in Pontus, and flourished
about the middle of the Second Century. His system of teaching was mainly rationalistic, and did not recognize
(Dr. Mansel tells us, “Gnostic Heresies,” p. 203) any theory of Emanations as connecting links between God and
the world; for from his point of view the Supreme God was not, even indirectly, the Author of the world. It
would seem that S. Gregory is confusing Marcion with Valentinus, and Egyptian heresiarch who flourished
about the same time. In his theory we first find a system of “Æons,” divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a</note>

<pb n="754"/>
given names to and reverence a system of Æons of these numbers); I cannot say by what
rules of analogy, or in consequence of what power of this number; anyhow they do honour
to it. One thing indeed is evident, that God, having in six days created matter, and given it
form, and having arranged it in all kinds of shapes and mixtures, and having made this
present visible world, on the seventh day rested from all His works, as is shewn by the very
name of the Sabbath, which in Hebrew means Rest. If there be, however, any more lofty
reason than this, let others discuss it. But this honour which they pay to it is not confined
to days alone, but also extends to years. That belonging to days the Sabbath proves, because
it is continually observed among them; and in accordance with this the removal of leaven
is for that number of days.4208 And that belonging to years is shewn by the seventh year,
the year of Release;4209 and it consists not only of Hebdomads, but of Hebdomads of Hebdomads,
alike in days and years. The Hebdomads of days give birth to Pentecost, a day
called holy among them; and those of years to what they call the Jubilee, which also has a
release of land, and a manumission of slaves, and a release of possessions bought. For this
nation consecrates to God, not only the firstfruits of offspring, or of firstborn, but also those
of days and years. Thus the veneration paid to the number Seven gave rise also to the veneration
of Pentecost. For seven being multiplied by seven generates fifty all but one day,
which we borrow from the world to come, at once the Eighth and the first, or rather one
and indestructible. For the present sabbatism of our souls can find its cessation there, that
a portion may be given to seven and also to eight4210 (so some of our predecessors have
interpreted this passage of Solomon).</p>
<p>III. As to the honour paid to Seven there are many testimonies, but we will be content
with a few out of the many. For instance, seven precious spirits are named; for I think
Isaiah4211 loves to call the activities of the Spirit spirits; and the Oracles of the Lord are
purified seven times according to David,4212 and the just is delivered from six troubles and
in the seventh is not smitten.4213 But the sinner is pardoned not seven times, but seventy

enjoining liberal almsgiving. S. Ambrose (in Luc. vi.) has a mystical interpretation somewhat resembling that
here referred to: but I cannot find a predecessor of Gregory on the verse. Some later commentators, according
to Cornelius and Lapide, take the Seven of the poor in this life, and the Eight of the souls in Purgatory, following
a common interpretation of these numbers.</note>

times seven.4214 And we may see it by the contrary also (for the punishment of wickedness
is to be praised), Cain being avenged seven times, that is, punishment being exacted from
him for his fratricide, and Lamech seventy times seven,4215 because he was a murderer after
the law and the condemnation.4216 And wicked neighbours receive sevenfold into their
<note type="footnote">4214 Matt. xviii. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">4215 Gen. iv. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">4216 It will be worth while, says Nicetas, to add S. John Chrysostom’s account of the sevenfold punishment
which was inflicted on Cain. The number Seven he says (Hom. in Gen. xix. 5, p. 168 c.) is often used in Holy
Scripture in the sense of multitude, as e.g., in such places, as, “The barren hath borne seven,” and the like. So
here; the greatness of the crime is implied, and that it is not a simple and single crime, but seven sins; and those
of such a sort that every one of them must be avenged by a very severe punishment. First, that he envied his
brother when he saw that God loved him, a sin which without any other added to it was sufficient to be deadly.
The next was that this sin was against a brother. The third that he compassed a deceit. The fourth that he perpetrated
a murder. The fifth that it was his brother that he slew. The sixth that he was the first man to commit
a murder. The seventh that he lied to God. You have followed these steps with your mind, or do you desire
that I should repeat the enumeration in a fuller way, to make you understand how each of these sins would be
visited with a very severe penalty, even if it stood alone. Who would judge a man worthy of pardon who envies
another simply because he enjoys the favour and love of God? Here then is one very great and inexpiable sin.
And this is shewn to be even more atrocious when he who is envied is a brother, and has done him no wrong.
Further, he contrived a deceit, bringing his brother out by a trick into the field, without reverence for nature
herself. The fourth crime is the murder which he committed. The fifth is that it was his brother whom he put
to death; his brother, I say, that came out of the same womb. Sixthly, he was the first inventor of murder. Seventhly,
when questioned by God he did not hesitate to lie. And therefore because he dared to lay hands on his
brother, he draws upon himself severe punishments. He then proceeds to shew how Lamech’s crime was worse
than Cain’s, and is therefore said to be punished seventy times; that is, in manifold ways. Lamech slew a man
and a young man, and this, after the law against murder had been given; that is, after God had punished Cain.
Cain’s punishment he says was sevenfold, corresponding to his seven sins:—1. Cursed is the ground for thy
sake. 2. Thou shalt till the ground; i.e., thou shalt never rest from the toils of husbandry. 3. It shall not yield
unto thee its strength; 4. thy labours shall be barren, and 5. “sighing and trembling” shalt thou be. And the sixth
is from the lips of Cain himself:—“If Thou castest me out from the earth,” i.e., from all earthly conveniences,
“from Thy face shall I be hid.” And God put a mark upon Cain; this is the seventh punishment—a mark of infamy
declaring his guilt and shame to all that should see him. Others according to the same authority (and Bishop
Wordsworth adopts the explanation) explains it thus. From Cain to the Deluge are seven generations, and then
the world was punished because sin had spread far and wide. But Lamech’s sin could not be cured by the Deluge,
but only by Him Who taketh away the sin of the world. Then count all the generations from Adam to Christ,</note>

bosom;4217 and the House of Wisdom rests on seven pillars4218 and the Stone of Zerubbabel
is adorned with seven eyes;4219 and God is praised seven times a day.4220 And again the
barren beareth seven,4221 the perfect number, she who is contrasted with her who is imperfect
in her children.4222</p>
<p>IV. And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that Enoch,4223 the seventh
among our ancestors, was honoured by translation. I perceive also that the twenty-first,
Abraham,4224 was given the glory of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater mystery.
For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number. And one who is very bold might
venture even to come to the New Adam, my God and Lord Jesus Christ, Who is counted
the Seventy-seventh from the old Adam who fell under sin, in the backward genealogy according
to Luke.4225 And I think of the seven trumpets of Jesus, the son of Nave, and the
same number of circuits and days and priests, by which the walls of Jericho were shaken
down.4226 And so too the seven compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a
mystery in the threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life into the
son of the Sareptan widow,4227 and the same number of his floodings of the wood,4228 when
he consumed the sacrifice with fire sent from God, and condemned the prophets of shame
who could not do the like at his challenge. And the sevenfold looking for the cloud imposed
upon the young servant; and Elissæus stretching himself that number of times upon the

child of the Shunammite, by which stretching the breath of life was restored.4229 To the
same doctrine belongs, I think (if I may omit the seven-stemmed and seven-lamped candlestick
of the Temple4230) that the ceremony of the Priests’ consecration lasted seven days;4231
and seven that of the purifying of a leper,4232 and that of the Dedication of the Temple4233
the same number, and that in the seventieth year the people returned from the Captivity;4234
that whatever is in Units may appear also in Decads, and the mystery of the Hebdomad be
reverenced in a more perfect number. But why do I speak of the distant past? Jesus Himself
who is pure perfection, could in the desert and with five loaves feed five thousand, and again
with seven loaves four thousand. And the leavings after they were satisfied were in the first
case twelve baskets full, and in the other seven baskets;4235 neither, I imagine, without a
reason or unworthy of the Spirit. And if you read for yourself you may take note of many
numbers which contain a meaning deeper than appears on the surface. But to come to an
instance which is most useful to us on the present occasion, not that for these reasons or
others very similar or yet more divine, the Hebrews honour the Day of Pentecost, and we
also honour it; just as there are other rites of the Hebrews which we observe<gap reason="omitted"/>they were
typically observed by them, and by us they are sacramentally reinstated. And now having
said so much by way of preface about the Day, let us proceed to what we have to say further.</p>
<p>V. We are keeping the feast of Pentecost and of the Coming of the Spirit, and the appointed
time of the Promise, and the fulfilment of our hope. And how great, how august,
is the Mystery. The dispensations of the Body of Christ are ended; or rather, what belongs
to His Bodily Advent (for I hesitate to say the Dispensation of His Body, as long as no discourse
persuades me that it is better to have put off the body4236), and that of the Spirit is
beginning. And what were the things pertaining to the Christ? The Virgin, the Birth, the

Manger, the Swaddling, the Angels glorifying Him, the Shepherds running to Him, the
course of the Star, the Magi worshipping Him and bringing Gifts, Herod’s murder of the
children, the Flight of Jesus into Egypt, the Return from Egypt, the Circumcision, the Baptism,
the Witness from Heaven, the Temptation, the Stoning for our sake (because He had to be
given as an Example to us of enduring affliction for the Word), the Betrayal, the Nailing,
the Burial, the Resurrection, the Ascension; and of these even now He suffers many dishonours
at the hands of the enemies of Christ; and He bears them, for He is longsuffering. But
from those who love Him He receives all that is honourable. And He defers, as in the former
case His wrath, so in ours His kindness; in their case perhaps to give them the grace of repentance,
and in ours to test our love; whether we do not faint in our tribulations4237 and
conflicts for the true Religion, as was from of old the order of His Divine Economy, and of
his unsearchable judgments, with which He orders wisely all that concerns us. Such are the
mysteries of Christ. And what follows we shall see to be more glorious; and may we too be
seen. As to the things of the Spirit, may the Spirit be with me, and grant me speech as much
as I desire; or if not that, yet as is in due proportion to the season. Anyhow He will be with
me as my Lord; not in servile guise, nor awaiting a command, as some think.4238 For He
bloweth where He wills and on whom He wills, and to what extent He wills.4239 Thus we
are inspired both to think and to speak of the Spirit.</p>
<p>VI. They who reduce the Holy Spirit to the rank of a creature are blasphemers and
wicked servants, and worst of the wicked. For it is the part of wicked servants to despise
Lordship, and to rebel against dominion, and to make That which is free their fellow-servant.
But they who deem Him God are inspired by God4240 and are illustrious in their mind; and
they who go further and call Him so, if to well disposed hearers are exalted; if to the low,
are not reserved enough, for they commit pearls to clay, and the noise of thunder to weak

who had passed from extreme or Anomoean Arianism to Semi-Arianism, and was forcibly intruded
on the See by order of Constantius in 343, but was afterwards deposed. After his deposition he broached the
heresy known by his name, denying the Deity of the Holy Ghost; some of its adherents, with Macedonius himself,
maintaining Him to be a mere creature; others stopping short of this; and others calling Him a creature and
servant of the Son. The heresy was formally condemned in the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381.</note>

Attributes of Godhead, and should bear with those who, like himself, gave Him also the Name, as he prays that
they all may have grace to do (Bénoît).</note>

ears, and the sun to feeble eyes, and solid food to those who are still using milk;4241 whereas
they ought to lead them little by little up to what lies beyond them, and to bring them up to
the higher truth; adding light to light, and supplying truth upon truth. Therefore we will
leave the more mature discourse, for which the time has not yet come, and will speak with
them as follows.</p>
<p>VII. If, my friends, you will not acknowledge the Holy Spirit to be uncreated, nor yet
eternal; clearly such a state of mind is due to the contrary spirit—forgive me, if in my zeal
I speak somewhat over boldly. If, however, you are sound enough to escape this evident
impiety, and to place outside of slavery Him Who gives freedom to yourselves, then see for
yourselves with the help of the Holy Ghost and of us what follows. For I am persuaded that
you are to some extent partakers of Him, so that I will go into the question with you as
kindred souls. Either shew me some mean between lordship and servitude, that I may there
place the rank of the Spirit; or, if you shrink from imputing servitude to Him, there is no
doubt of the rank in which you must place the object of your search. But you are dissatisfied
with the syllables, and you stumble at the word, and it is to you a stone of stumbling and a
rock of offence;4242 for so is Christ to some minds. It is only human after all. Let us meet
one another in a spiritual manner; let us be full rather of brotherly than of self love. Grant
us the Power of the Godhead, and we will give up to you the use of the Name. Confess the
Nature in other words for which you have greater reverence, and we will heal you as infirm
people, filching from you some matters in which you delight. For it is shameful, yes,
shameful and utterly illogical, when you are sound in soul, to draw petty distinctions about
the sound, and to hide the Treasure, as if you envied it to others, or were afraid lest you
should sanctify your own tongue too. But it is even more shameful for us to be in the state
of which we accuse you, and, while condemning your petty distinctions of words to make
petty distinctions of letters.</p>
<p>VIII. Confess, my friends, the Trinity to be of One Godhead; or if you will, of One
Nature; and we will pray the Spirit to give you this word God. He will give it to you, I well
know, inasmuch as He has already granted you the first portion and the second;4243 and
especially if that about which we are contending is some spiritual cowardice, and not the
devil’s objection. Yet more clearly and concisely, let me say, do not you call us to account
for our loftier word (for envy has nothing to do with this ascent), and we will not find fault
with what you have been able to attain, until by another road you are brought up to the
same resting place. For we are not seeking victory, but to gain brethren, by whose separation

from us we are torn. This we concede to you in whom we do find something of vital truth,
who are sound as to the Son. We admire your life, but we do not altogether approve your
doctrine. Ye who have the things of the Spirit, receive Himself in addition, that ye may not
only strive, but strive lawfully,4244 which is the condition of your crown. May this reward
of your conversation be granted you, that you may confess the Spirit perfectly and proclaim
with us, aye and before us, all that is His due. Yes, and I will venture even more on your
behalf; I will even utter the Apostle’s wish. So much do I cling to you, and so much do I
revere your array, and the colour of your continence, and those sacred assemblies, and the
august Virginity, and purification, and the Psalmody that lasts all night4245 and your love
of the poor, and of the brethren, and of strangers, that I could consent to be Anathema from
Christ, and even to suffer something as one condemned, if only you might stand beside us,
and we might glorify the Trinity together. For of the others why should I speak, seeing they
are clearly dead (and it is the part of Christ alone to raise them, Who quickeneth the dead
by His own Power), and are unhappily separated in place as they are bound together by
their doctrine; and who quarrel among themselves as much as a pair of squinting eyes in
looking at the same object, and differ with one another, not in sight but in position—if indeed
we may charge them only with squinting, and not with utter blindness. And now that I
have to some extent laid down your position, come, let us return again to the subject of the
Spirit, and I think you will follow me now.</p>
<p>IX. The Holy Ghost, then, always existed, and exists, and always will exist. He neither
had a beginning, nor will He have an end; but He was everlastingly ranged with and
numbered with the Father and the Son. For it was not ever fitting that either the Son should
be wanting to the Father, or the Spirit to the Son. For then Deity would be shorn of Its Glory
in its greatest respect, for It would seem to have arrived at the consummation of perfection
as if by an afterthought. Therefore He was ever being partaken, but not partaking; perfecting,
not being perfected; sanctifying, not being sanctified; deifying, not being deified; Himself
ever the same with Himself, and with Those with Whom He is ranged; invisible, eternal,
incomprehensible, unchangeable, without quality, without quantity, without form, impalpable,
self-moving, eternally moving, with free-will, self-powerful, All-powerful (even though
all that is of the Spirit is referable to the First Cause, just as is all that is of the Only-begotten);
Life and Lifegiver; Light and Lightgiver; absolute Good, and Spring of Goodness; the Right,
the Princely Spirit; the Lord, the Sender, the Separator; Builder of His own Temple; leading,
working as He wills; distributing His own Gifts; the Spirit of Adoption, of Truth, of Wisdom,

of Understanding, of Knowledge, of Godliness, of Counsel, of Fear (which are ascribed to
Him4246) by Whom the Father is known and the Son is glorified; and by Whom alone He
is known; one class, one service, worship, power, perfection, sanctification. Why make a
long discourse of it? All that the Father hath the Son hath also, except the being Unbegotten;
and all that the Son hath the Spirit hath also, except the Generation. And these two matters
do not divide the Substance, as I understand it, but rather are divisions within the Substance.4247</p>
<p>X. Are you labouring to bring forth objections? Well, so am I to get on with my discourse.
Honour the Day of the Spirit; restrain your tongue if you can a little. It is the time
to speak of other tongues—reverence them or fear them, when you see that they are of fire.
To-day let us teach dogmatically; to-morrow we may discuss. To-day let us keep the feast;
to-morrow will be time enough to behave ourselves unseemly—the first mystically, the
second theatrically; the one in the Churches, the other in the marketplace; the one among
the sober, the other among the drunken; the one as befits those who vehemently desire, the
other, as among those who make a joke of the Spirit. Having then put an end to the element
that is foreign to us, let us now thoroughly furnish our own friends.</p>
<p>XI. He wrought first in the heavenly and angelic powers, and such as are first after God
and around God. For from no other source flows their perfection and their brightness, and
the difficulty or impossibility of moving them to sin, but from the Holy Ghost. And next,
in the Patriarchs and Prophets, of whom the former saw Visions of God, or knew Him, and
the latter also foreknew the future, having their master part moulded by the Spirit, and being
associated with events that were yet future as if present, for such is the power of the Spirit.
And next in the Disciples of Christ (for I omit to mention Christ Himself, in Whom He
dwelt, not as energizing, but as accompanying His Equal), and that in three ways, as they
were able to receive Him, and on three occasions; before Christ was glorified by the Passion,
and after He was glorified by the Resurrection; and after His Ascension, or Restoration, or
whatever we ought to call it, to Heaven. Now the first of these manifests Him—the healing
of the sick and casting out of evil spirits, which could not be apart from the Spirit; and so
does that breathing upon them after the Resurrection, which was clearly a divine inspiration;
and so too the present distribution of the fiery tongues, which we are now commemorating.
But the first manifested Him indistinctly, the second more expressly, this present one more
perfectly, since He is no longer present only in energy, but as we may say, substantially, associating
with us, and dwelling in us. For it was fitting that as the Son had lived with us in

bodily form—so the Spirit too should appear in bodily form; and that after Christ had returned
to His own place, He should have come down to us—Coming because He is the Lord;
Sent, because He is not a rival God. For such words no less manifest the Unanimity than
they mark the separate Individuality.</p>
<p>XII. And therefore He came after Christ, that a Comforter should not be lacking unto
us; but Another Comforter, that you might acknowledge His co-equality. For this word
Another marks an Alter Ego, a name of equal Lordship, not of inequality. For Another is
not said, I know, of different kinds, but of things consubstantial. And He came in the form
of Tongues because of His close relation to the Word. And they were of Fire, perhaps because
of His purifying Power (for our Scripture knows of a purifying fire, as any one who wishes
can find out), or else because of His Substance. For our God is a consuming Fire, and a
Fire4248 burning up the ungodly;4249 though you may again pick a quarrel over these words,
being brought into difficulty by the Consubstantiality. And the tongues were cloven, because
of the diversity of Gifts; and they sat to signify His Royalty and Rest among the Saints, and
because the Cherubim are the Throne of God. And it took place in an Upper Chamber (I
hope I am not seeming to any one over tedious), because those who should receive it were
to ascend and be raised above the earth; for also certain upper chambers4250 are covered
with Divine Waters,4251 by which the praise of God are sung. And Jesus Himself in an
Upper Chamber gave the Communion of the Sacrament to those who were being initiated
into the higher Mysteries, that thereby might be shewn on the one hand that God must
come down to us, as I know He did of old to Moses; and on the other that we must go up
to Him, and that so there should come to pass a Communion of God with men, by a coalescing
of the dignity. For as long as either remains on its own footing, the One in His Glory4252
the other in his lowliness, so long the Goodness of God cannot mingle with us, and His
lovingkindness is incommunicable, and there is a great gulf between, which cannot be
crossed; and which separates not only the Rich Man from Lazarus and Abraham’s Bosom
which he longs for, but also the created and changing natures from that which is eternal
and immutable.</p>

<p>XIII. This was proclaimed by the Prophets in such passages as the following:—The
Spirit of the Lord is upon me;4253 and, There shall rest upon Him Seven Spirits; and The
Spirit of the Lord descended and led them;4254 and The spirit of Knowledge filling Bezaleel,
4255 the Master-builder of the Tabernacle; and, The Spirit provoking to anger;4256 and
the Spirit carrying away Elias in a chariot,4257 and sought in double measure by Elissæus;
and David led and strengthened by the Good and Princely Spirit.4258 And He was promised
by the mouth of Joel first, who said, And it shall be in the last days that I will pour out of
My Spirit upon all flesh (that is, upon all that believe), and upon your sons and upon your
daughters,4259 and the rest; and then afterwards by Jesus, being glorified by Him, and giving
back glory to Him, as He was glorified by and glorified the Father.4260 And how abundant
was this Promise. He shall abide for ever, and shall remain with you, whether now with
those who in the sphere of time are worthy, or hereafter with those who are counted worthy
of that world, when we have kept Him altogether by our life here, and not rejected Him in
so far as we sin.</p>
<p>XIV. This Spirit shares with the Son in working both the Creation and the Resurrection,
as you may be shewn by this Scripture; By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made,
and all the power of them by the breath of His Mouth;4261 and this, The Spirit of God that
made me, and the Breath of the Almighty that teacheth me;4262 and again, Thou shalt send
forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.4263
And He is the Author of spiritual regeneration. Here is your proof:—None can see or enter
into the Kingdom, except he be born again of the Spirit,4264 and be cleansed from the first
birth, which is a mystery of the night, by a remoulding of the day and of the Light, by which
every one singly is created anew. This Spirit, for He is most wise and most loving,4265 if He
takes possession of a shepherd makes him a Psalmist, subduing evil spirits by his song,4266

and proclaims him King; if he possess a goatherd and scraper4267 of sycamore fruit,4268 He
makes him a Prophet. Call to mind David and Amos. If He possess a goodly youth, He
makes him a Judge of Elders,4269 even beyond his years, as Daniel testifies, who conquered
the lions in their den.4270 If He takes possession of Fishermen, He makes them catch the
whole world in the nets of Christ, taking them up in the meshes of the Word. Look at Peter
and Andrew and the Sons of Thunder, thundering the things of the Spirit. If of Publicans,
He makes gain of them for discipleship, and makes them merchants of souls; witness Matthew,
yesterday a Publican, today an Evangelist. If of zealous persecutors, He changes the
current of their zeal, and makes them Pauls instead of Sauls, and as full of piety as He found
them of wickedness. And He is the Spirit of Meekness, and yet is provoked by those who
sin. Let us therefore make proof of Him as gentle, not as wrathful, by confessing His Dignity;
and let us not desire to see Him implacably wrathful. He too it is who has made me today
a bold herald to you;—if without rest to myself, God be thanked; but if with risk, thanks to
Him nevertheless; in the one case, that He may spare those that hate us; in the other, that

<p>XV. They spoke with strange tongues, and not those of their native land; and the wonder
was great, a language spoken by those who had not learnt it. And the sign is to them that
believe not,4271 and not to them that believe, that it may be an accusation of the unbelievers,
as it is written, With other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people, and not even
so will they listen to Me4272 saith the Lord. But they heard. Here stop a little and raise a
question, how you are to divide the words. For the expression has an ambiguity, which is
to be determined by the punctuation. Did they each hear in their own dialect4273 so that if
I may so say, one sound was uttered, but many were heard; the air being thus beaten and,
so to speak, sounds being produced more clear than the original sound; or are we to put the
stop after “they Heard,” and then to add “them speaking in their own languages” to what
<note type="footnote">4267 The Hebrew word means “a cultivator of sycamores.” The LXX. rendering is due to the process of
maturing the fruit, which grows on the stem of the trunk, and is made to mature by puncturing it with an iron

follows, so that it would be speaking in languages their own to the hearers, which would be
foreign to the speakers? I prefer to put it this latter way; for on the other plan the miracle
would be rather of the hearers than of the speakers; whereas in this it would be on the
speakers’ side; and it was they who were reproached for drunkenness, evidently because
they by the Spirit wrought a miracle in the matter of the tongues.</p>
<p>XVI. But as the old Confusion of tongues was laudable, when men who were of one
language in wickedness and impiety, even as some now venture to be, were building the
Tower;4274 for by the confusion of their language the unity of their intention was broken
up, and their undertaking destroyed; so much more worthy of praise is the present miraculous
one. For being poured from One Spirit upon many men, it brings them again into harmony.
And there is a diversity of Gifts, which stands in need of yet another Gift to discern which
is the best, where all are praiseworthy. And that division also might be called noble of which
David says, Drown O Lord and divide their tongues.4275 Why? Because they loved all words
of drowning, the deceitful tongue.4276 Where he all but expressly arraigns the tongues of
the present day4277 which sever the Godhead. Thus much upon this point.</p>
<p>XVII. Next, since it was to inhabitants of Jerusalem, most devout Jews, Parthians, Medes,
and Elamites, Egyptians, and Libyans, Cretans too, and Arabians, and Mesopotamians, and
my own Cappadocians, that the tongues spake, and to Jews (if any one prefer so to understand
it), out of every nation under heaven thither collected; it is worth while to see who these
were and of what captivity. For the captivity in Egypt and Babylon was circumscribed, and
moreover had long since been brought to an end by the Return; and that under the Romans,
which was exacted for their audacity against our Saviour, was not yet come to pass, though
it was in the near future. It remains then to understand it of the captivity under Antiochus,
which happened not so very long before this time. But if any does not accept this explanation,
as being too elaborate, seeing that this captivity was neither ancient nor widespread over
the world, and is looking for a more reliable—perhaps the best way to take it would be as
follows. The nation was removed many times, as Esdras related; and some of the Tribes
were recovered, and some were left behind; of whom probably (dispersed as they were
among the nations) some would have been present and shared the miracle.</p>
<p>XVIII. These questions have been examined before by the studious, and perhaps not
without occasion; and whatever else any one may contribute at the present day, he will be
joined with us. But now it is our duty to dissolve this Assembly, for enough has been said.

<head>Oration XLII.</head>
<p>The Last Farewell in the Presence of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops.</p>
<p>ThisOration was delivered during the Second OEcumenical Council, held at Constantinople
a.d. 381. Historical as well as personal motives render the occasion of the deepest interest.
The audience consisted of the one hundred and fifty Bishops of the Eastern Church who took
part in the Council, and of the speaker’s own flock, the orthodox Christians of Constantinople.
He had by his own exertions gathered that flock together, after it had been ravaged by
heretical teachers. He had won the admiration and affection of its members, by his courageous
championship of the Faith, his lucid teaching, and his fatherly care for their spiritual needs.
He had been, against his will, enthroned with acclamation in the highest ecclesiastical position
in the Eastern Church, and called to preside over the Synod of its assembled Bishops. Finding
himself unable to guide the deliberations of the Council in regard to a question of the highest
importance, and perceiving that he himself and his position were made by some of the Bishops
a fresh cause of dissension, he felt bound to resign his high office, and endeavour by this personal
sacrifice to restore peace to the Church. His language is worthy of the occasion. Obliged
to deal with the topics which had caused dissension, he handles them with gentle and discriminating
tact; he speaks with great self-restraint in his own defence; he sets forth with tenderest
feeling the common experiences of himself and his flock; he gives with dignity and clearness
his last public exposition of the Faith; and finally, in language of exquisite beauty, spoken with
the quivering tones of an aged man, he bids a tender farewell to his flock, his cathedral, and
his throne, with all their affecting associations. It was an occasion whose pathos is unsurpassed
in history. Orator and audience were alike deeply moved, and the emotion has been renewed
in all those who have read his words, and realised the scene of their delivery.</p>
<p>1. What think ye of our affairs, dear shepherds and fellow-shepherds: whose feet are
beautiful, for you bring glad tidings of peace and of the good things4278 with which ye have
come; beautiful again in our eyes, to whom ye have come in season, not to convert a wandering
sheep,4279 but to converse with a pilgrim shepherd? What think ye of this our pilgrimage?
And of its fruit, or rather of that of the Spirit4280 within us,4281 by Whom we are
ever moved,4282 and specially have now been moved, desiring to have, and perhaps having,
nothing of our own? Do you of yourselves understand and perceive—and are you kindly

critics of our actions? Or must we, like those from whom a reckoning is demanded as to
their military command, or civil government, or administration of the exchequer, publicly
and in person submit to you the accounts of our administration? Not indeed that we are
ashamed of being judged, for we are ourselves judges in turn, and both with the same
charity. But the law is an ancient one: for even Paul communicated to the Apostles his
Gospel:4283 not for the sake of ostentation, for the Spirit is far removed from all ostentation,
but in order to establish his success and correct his failure, if indeed there were any such in
his words or actions, as he declares when writing of himself. Since even the Spirits of the
Prophets are subject to the prophets,4284 according to the order of the Spirit who regulates
and divides all things well. And do not wonder that, while he rendered his account privately
and to some, I do so publicly, and to all. For my need is greater than his, of being aided by
the freedom of my censors, if I am proved to have failed in my duty, lest I should run, or
have run, in vain.4285 And the only possible mode of self-defence is speech in the presence
of men who know the facts.</p>
<p>2. What then is my defence?4286 If it be false, you must convict me, but if true, you on
behalf of whom4287 and in whose presence I speak, must bear witness to it. For you are my
defence, my witnesses, and my crown of rejoicing,4288 if I also may venture to boast myself
a little in the Apostle’s language. This flock was, when it was small and poor, as far as appearances
went, nay, not even a flock, but a slight trace and relic of a flock, without order,
or shepherd, or bounds, with neither right to pasturage, nor the defence of a fold, wandering
upon the mountains and in caves and dens of the earth,4289 scattered and dispersed hither
and thither as each one could find shelter or pasture, or could gratefully secure its own
safety; like that flock which was harassed by lions, dispersed by tempest, or scattered in
darkness, the lamentation of prophets who compared it to the misfortunes of Israel,4290
given up to the Gentiles; over which we also lamented, so long as our lot was worthy of
lamentation. For in very deed we also were thrust out and cast off, and scattered upon every
mountain and hill, from the need of a shepherd:4291 and a dreadful storm fell upon the

without being ashamed of themselves, wield a greater power than the time should allow;
while a gloomy darkness, far more oppressive than the ninth plague of Egypt, the darkness
which might be felt,4292 enveloped and concealed everything, so that we could scarcely even
see one another.</p>
<p>3. To speak in a more feeling strain, trusting in Him Who then forsook me, as in a
Father, “Abraham has been ignorant of us, Israel has acknowledged us not, but Thou art
our Father, and unto Thee do we look;4293 beside Thee we know none else, we make mention
of Thy name.”4294 Therefore, says Jeremiah, I will plead with Thee, I will reason the cause
with Thee.4295 We are become as at the beginning, when Thou barest not rule4296 over us,
and Thou hast forgotten Thy holy covenant, and shut up Thy mercies from us. Therefore
we, the worshippers of the Trinity, the perfect suppliants of the perfect Deity, became a reproach
to Thy Beloved, neither daring to bring down to our own level any of the things
above us, nor in such wise to rise up against the godless tongues which fought against God,
as to make His Majesty a fellow servant with ourselves; but, as is plain, we were delivered
up on account of our other sins, and because our conduct had been unworthy of Thy commandments,
and we had walked after our own evil mind. For what other reason can there
be for our being delivered up to the most unrighteous and wicked men of all the dwellers
upon the earth? First Nebuchadnezzar4297 afflicted us,4298 possessed during the Christian
era with an anti-Christian rage, hating Christ just because he had through Him gained salvation,
and having bartered the sacred books for sacrifices to those who are no gods. He
devoured me, he tore me in pieces, a slight darkness enveloped me,4299 if I may even in my
lamentation keep to the language of Scripture. If the Lord had not helped me,4300 and
righteously delivered him to the hands of the lawless, by casting him off (such are the judgments
of God) to the Persians, by whom his blood was righteously shed for his unholy
sheddings of blood, since in this case alone justice could not afford even to be longsuffering,
my soul had shortly dwelt in the grave.4301 The second4302 no more kindly, if he were not

even more grievous still, for while he bore the name of Christ, he was a false Christ, and at
once a burden and a reproach to the Christians, for, while to obey him was ungodly, to
suffer at his hands was inglorious, since they did not even seem to be wronged, nor to gain
by their sufferings the glorious title of martyr, inasmuch as the truth was in this case perverted,
for while they suffered as Christians, they were supposed to be punished as heretics.
Alas! how rich we were in misfortunes, for the fire consumed the beauties of the world.4303
That which the palmerworm left did the locust eat, and that which the locust left did the
caterpillar eat: then came the cankerworm,4304 then, what next I know not, one evil
springing up after another. But for what purpose should I give a tragic description of the
evils of the time, and of the penalty exacted from us, or, if I must rather call it so, the testing
and refining we endured? At any rate, we went through fire and water,4305 and have attained
a place of refreshment by the good pleasure of God our Saviour.</p>
<p>4. To return to my original startingpoint. This was my field, when it was small and
poor, unworthy not only of God, Who has been, and is cultivating the whole world with the
fair seeds and doctrines of piety, but, apparently, even of any poor and needy man of slender
means. Nay it did not deserve to be called a field, requiring neither barn nor threshingfloor,
and not even worthy of the sickle; with neither heap nor sheaves, or small and untimely
sheaves, like those on the housetop, which do not fill the hand of the reaper, nor call forth
a blessing from them which go by.4306 Such was my field, such my harvest; great and welleared
and fat in the eyes of Him Who beholdeth hidden things, and becoming such a husbandman,
its abundance springing from the valleys of souls well tilled with the Word: unrecognized
however in public, and not collected together, but gathered in fragments, as an
ear gleaned in the stubble,4307 as gleaning-grapes in the vintage, where there is no cluster
left. I think I may add, only too appropriately, I found Israel like a figtree in the wilderness,
4308 and like one or two ripe grapes in an unripe cluster, preserved as a blessing from
the Lord,4309 and a consecrated firstfruit, though small as yet and scanty, and not filling the
mouth of the eater: and as an ensign on a hill,4310 and as a beacon on a mountain, or any
other solitary thing visible only to few. Such was its former poverty and dejection.</p>

Who maketh and transformeth all things; Who turneth night into day,4312 winter into
spring, storm into calm, drought into abundance of rain; and often for the sake of the
prayers4313 of one righteous man4314 sorely persecuted; Who lifteth up the meek on high,
and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground;4315 since God said to Himself, I have surely
seen the affliction of Israel;4316 and they shall no longer be further vexed with clay and brickmaking;
and when He spake He visited, and in His visitation He saved, and led forth His
people with a mighty hand and outstretched arm,4317 by the hand of Moses and Aaron,4318
His chosen—what is the result, and what wonders have been wrought? Those which books
and monuments contain. For besides all the wonders by the way, and that mighty roar, to
speak most concisely, Joseph came into Egypt alone,4319 and soon after six hundred thousand
depart from Egypt.4320 What more marvellous than this? What greater proof of the generosity
of God, when from men without means He wills to supply the means for public affairs?
And the land of promise is distributed through one who was hated, and he who was sold4321
dispossesses nations, and is himself made a great nation, and that small offshoot becomes
a luxuriant vine,4322 so great that it reaches to the river, and is stretched out to the sea,4323
and spreads from border to border, and hides the mountains with the height of its glory
and is exalted above the cedars, even the cedars of God, whatever we are to take these
mountains and cedars to be.</p>

it be not yet in perfection, it is advancing towards it by constant increase, and I prophesy
that it will advance. This is foretold me by the Holy Spirit, if I have any prophetic instinct
and insight into the future. And from what has preceded I am able to be confident, and
recognize this by reasoning, being the nursling of reason. For it was much more improbable

that, from that condition, it should reach its present development, than that, as it now is, it
should attain to the height of renown. For ever since it began to be gathered together, by
Him Who quickeneth the dead,4324 bone to its bone, joint to joint, and the Spirit of life and
regeneration was given to it in their dryness,4325 its entire resurrection has been, I know
well, sure to be fulfilled: so that the rebellious should not exalt themselves,4326 and that
those who grasp at a shadow, or at a dream when one awaketh,4327 or at the dispersing

Howl, firtree, for the cedar is fallen!4329 Let them be instructed by the misfortunes of others,
and learn that the poor shall not alway be forgotten,4330 and that the Deity will not refrain,
as Habakkuk says, from striking through the heads of the mighty ones4331 in His fury—the
Deity, Who has been struck through and impiously divided into Ruler and Ruled, in order
to insult the Deity in the highest degree by degrading It, and oppress a creature by equality

move to jealousy them that move Me to jealousy. Behold this is sealed up with Me,4335 and
this is the indissoluble law of recompense. But thou didst surround thyself with walls and
tablets and richly set stones, and long porticos and galleries, and didst shine and sparkle

men with Gideon, who bravely lapped,4340 compare with the thousands who were put to

kings and the army of tens of thousands whom, few as they were, they overtook and defeated?

of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved?4342 And again, I have left me
seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal?4343 This is not the case; it is
not? God has not taken pleasure in numbers.</p>
<p>8. Thou countest tens of thousands, God counts those who are in a state of salvation;
thou countest the dust which is without number, I the vessels of election. For nothing is so
magnificent in God’s sight as pure doctrine, and a soul perfect in all the dogmas of the
truth.—For there is nothing worthy of Him Who made all things, of Him by Whom are all
things, and for Whom are all things,4344 so that it can be given or offered to God: not merely

things are small and unworthy of notice, I would fain learn what is greater and of more account.
For, if it be no great thing to have established and strengthened with wholesome
doctrines a city which is the eye of the universe, in its exceeding strength by sea and land,
which is, as it were, the link between the Eastern and Western shores, in which the extremities
of the world from every side meet together, and from which, as the common mart of the
faith, they take their rise, a city borne hither and thither on the eddying currents of so many
tongues, it will be long ere anything be considered great or worthy of esteem. But if it be
indeed a subject for praise, allow to us some glory on this account, since we have contributed
in some portion to these results which ye see.</p>
<p>11. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see,4365 thou critic of my words! See the crown
which has been platted in return for the hirelings of Ephraim4366 and the crown of insolence;
see the assembly of the presbyters, honoured for years and wisdom, the fair order of the
deacons, who are not far from the same Spirit, the good conduct of the readers, the people’s
eagerness for teaching, both of men and women, who are equally renowned for virtue: the
men, whether philosophers or simple folk, being alike wise in divine things, whether rulers
or ruled, being all in this respect duly under rule; whether soldiers or nobles, students or
men of letters, being all soldiers4367 of God, though in all other respects meek, ready to fight
for the Spirit, all reverencing the assembly above, to which we obtain an entrance, not by
the mere letter, but by the quickening Spirit, all in very deed being men of reason, and
worshippers of Him Who is in truth the Word: the women, if married, being united by a
Divine rather than by a carnal bond; if unwedded and free, being entirely dedicated to God;
whether young or old, some honourably advancing towards old age, others eagerly striving
to remain immortal, being renewed by the best of hopes.</p>
<p>12. To those who platted this crown—that which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord,4368
nevertheless I will say it—I also have given assistance. Some of them are the result of my
words, not of those which we have uttered at random, but of those which we have loved—nor
again of those which are meretricious, though the language and manners of the harlot have
been slanderously attributed to me, but of those which are most grave. Some of them are
the offspring and fruit of my Spirit, as the Spirit can beget those who rise superior to the
body. To this I have no doubt that those who are kindly among you, nay all of you, will
testify, since I have been the husbandman of all: and my sole reward is your confession.
For we neither have, nor have had, any other object. For virtue, that it may remain virtue,
is without reward, its eyes fixed alone on that which is good.</p>

<p>13. Would you have me say something still more venturesome? Do you see the tongues
of the enemy made gentle, and those who made war upon the Godhead against me tranquillised?
This also is the result of our Spirit, of our husbandry. For we are not undisciplined
in our exercise of discipline, nor do we hurl insults, as many do, who assail not the argument
but the speaker, and sometimes strive by their invective to hide the weakness of their reasoning;
as the cuttlefish are said to cast forth ink before them, in order to escape from their
pursuers, or themselves to hunt others when unperceived. But we show that our warfare is
in behalf of Christ by fighting as Christ, the peaceable and meek,4369 Who has borne our
infirmities, fought.4370 Though peaceable, we do not injure the word of truth, by yielding
a jot, to gain a reputation for reasonableness; for we do not pursue that which is good by
means of ill: and we are peaceable by the legitimate character of our warfare, confined as
it is to our own limits, and the rules of the Spirit. Upon these points, this is my decision,
and I lay down the law for all stewards of souls and dispensers of the Word: neither to exasperate
others by their harshness, nor to render them arrogant by submissiveness: but to
be of good words in treating of the Word, and in neither direction to overstep the mean.</p>
<p>14. But you are perhaps longing for me to give an exposition of the faith, in so far as I
am able. For I shall myself be sanctified by the effort of memory, and the people also will
be benefited, by its special delight in such discussions, and you will fully acknowledge
it—unless we are the objects of groundless envy, as the rivals, in the manifestation of the
truth, of those whom we do not excel. For as, of deep waters, some in the depths are utterly
hidden, some foam against any obstruction, and hesitate a while before breaking (as they
promise to our ears), some do actually break; so also, of those who are professors of the
Divine philosophy—setting aside the utterly misguided—some keep their piety entirely
secret and hidden within themselves, some are not far from the birth pangs, avoiding impiety,
yet not speaking out their piety, either from cautious reserve in their teaching, or under
pressure of fear, being themselves sound, as they say, in mind, but not making sound their
people, as if they had been entrusted with the government of their own souls, but not of
those of others; while there are some who make public their treasure, unable to restrain
themselves from giving birth to their piety, and not considering that to be salvation which
saves themselves alone, without bestowing upon others the overflow of their blessings.
Among these would I range myself, and all who by my side have nobly dared to confess the
truth.</p>
<p>15. One concise proclamation of our teaching, an inscription intelligible to all, is this
people, which so sincerely worships the Trinity, that it would sooner sever anyone from this
life, than sever one of the three from the Godhead: of one mind, of equal zeal, and united
<note type="footnote">4369 S. Matt. xi. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">4370 Ib. viii. 17; Isai. liii. 4.</note>

<pb n="777"/>
to one another, to us and to the Trinity by unity of doctrine. Briefly to run over its details:
That which is without beginning, and is the beginning, and is with the beginning, is one
God. For the nature of that which is without beginning does not consist in being without
beginning or being unbegotten, for the nature of anything lies, not in what it is not but in
what it is. It is the assertion of what is, not the denial of what is not. And the Beginning is
not, because it is a beginning, separated from that which has no beginning. For its beginning
is not its nature, any more than the being without beginning is the nature of the other. For
these are the accompaniments of the nature, not the nature itself. That again which is with
that which has no beginning, and with the beginning, is not anything else than what they
are. Now, the name of that which has no beginning is the Father, and of the Beginning the
Son, and of that which is with the Beginning, the Holy Ghost, and the three have one
Nature—God. And the union is the Father from Whom and to Whom the order of Persons
runs its course, not so as to be confounded, but so as to be possessed, without distinction
of time, of will, or of power. For these things in our case produce a plurality of individuals,
since each of them is separate both from every other quality, and from every other individual
possession of the same quality. But to Those who have a simple nature, and whose essence
is the same, the term One belongs in its highest sense.</p>
<p>16. Let us then bid farewell to all contentious shiftings and balancings of the truth on
either side, neither, like the Sabellians, assailing the Trinity in the interest of the Unity, and
so destroying the distinction by a wicked confusion; nor, like the Arians, assailing the Unity
in the interest of the Trinity, and by an impious distinction overthrowing the Oneness. For
our object is not to exchange one evil for another, but to ensure our attainment of that which
is good. These are the playthings of the Wicked One, who is ever swaying our fortunes towards
the evil. But we, walking along the royal road which lies between the two extremes,
which is the seat of the virtues, as the authorities say, believe in the Father, the Son and the
Holy Ghost, of one Substance and glory; in Whom also baptism has its perfection, both
nominally and really (thou knowest who hast been initiated!); being a denial of atheism and
a confession of Godhead; and thus we are regenerated, acknowledging the Unity in the Essence
and in the undivided worship, and the Trinity in the Hypostases or Persons (which
term some prefer.) And let not those who are contentious on these points utter their scandalous
taunts, as if our faith depended on terms and not on realities. For what do you mean
who assert the three Hypostases? Do you imply three Essences by the term? I am assured
that you would loudly shout against those who do so. For you teach that the Essence of the
Three is One and the same. What do you mean, who assert the Three Persons? Do you
imagine a single compound sort of being, with three faces,4371 or of an entirely human
<note type="footnote">4371 With three faces (or masks). A play upon the word πρόσωπον which is used in theology in the sense of Person.</note>

<pb n="778"/>
form? Perish the thought! You too will loudly reply that he who thinks thus, will never see
the face of God, whatever it may be. What is the meaning of the Hypostases of the one
party, of the Persons of the other, to ask this further question? That They are three, Who
are distinguished not by natures, but by properties.4372 Excellent. How could men agree
and harmonize better than you do, even if there be a difference between the syllables you
use? You see what a reconciler I am, bringing you back from the letter to the sense, as we
do with the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>17. But, to resume: let us speak of the Unbegotten, the Begotten, and the Proceeding,
if anyone likes to create names: for we shall have no fear of bodily conceptions attaching
to Those who are not embodied, as the calumniators of the Godhead think. For the creature
must be called God’s, and this is for us a great thing, but God never. Otherwise I shall admit
that God is a creature, if I become God, in the strict sense of the term. For this is the truth.
If God, He is not a creature; for the creature ranks with us who are not Gods. And if a
creature, he is not God, for he had a beginning in time. And there was a time when he who
had a beginning was not. And that of which non-existence was its prior condition, has not
being in the strict sense of the term. And how can that, which strictly has not being, be
God? Not one single one, then, of the Three is a creature, nor, what is worse, came into
being for my sake; for in that case he would be not only a creature, but inferior in honour
to us. For, if I am for the glory of God, and he is for my sake, as the tongs for the waggon,
the saw for the door, I am his superior in causality. For in whatever degree God is superior
to creatures, in the same degree is he, who came into being for my sake, inferior to me who
exist for God’s sake.</p>
<p>18. Moreover, the Moabites and Ammonites must not even be allowed to enter4373
into the Church of God, I mean those sophistical, mischievous arguments which enquire
curiously into the generation and inexpressible procession of God, and rashly set themselves
in array against the Godhead: as if it were necessary that those things which it is beyond
the power of language to set forth, must either be accessible to them alone, or else have no
existence because they have not comprehended them. We however, following the Divine
Scriptures, and removing out of the way of the blind the stumbling blocks contained in
them, will cling to salvation, daring any and every thing rather than arrogance against God.
As for the evidences, we leave them to others, since they have been set forth by many, and
by ourselves also with no little care. And indeed, it would be a very shameful thing for me
at this time to be gathering together proofs for what has all along been believed. For it is
not the best order of things, first to teach and then to learn, even in matters which are small
and of no consequence, and much more in those which are Divine and of such great import-
<note type="footnote">4372 Properties. Cf. xliii. 30, note.</note>

<pb n="779"/>
ance. Nor, again, is it proper to the present occasion to explain and disentangle the difficulties
of Scripture, a task requiring fuller and more careful consideration than our present purpose
will allow. Such then, to sum up, is our teaching. I have entered into these details, with no
intention of contending against the adversaries: for I have already often, even if it be imperfectly,
fought out the question with them: but in order that I might exhibit to you the
character of my teaching, that you might see whether I have not a share in the defence of
your own, and do not take my stand on the same side, and opposed to the same enemies as
yourselves.</p>
<p>19. You have now, my friends, heard the defence of my presence here: if it be deserving
of praise, thanks are due for it to God, and to you who called me; if it has fallen below your
expectation, I give thanks even on this behalf. For I am assured that it has not been altogether
deserving of censure, and am confident that you also admit this. Have we at all made a
gain4374 of this people? Have we consulted at all our own interests, as I see is most often
the case? Have we caused any vexation to the Church? To others possibly, with whose idea
that they had gained judgment against us by default, we have joined issue in our argument;
but in no wise, as far as I am aware, to you. I have taken no ox of yours,4375 says the great
Samuel, in his contention against Israel on the subject of the king, nor any propitiation for
your souls, the Lord is witness among you, nor this, nor that, proceeding at greater length,
that I may not count up every particular; but I have kept the priesthood pure and unalloyed.
And if I have loved power, or the height of a throne, or to tread Kings’ courts, may I never
possess any distinction, or if I gain it, may I be hurled from it.</p>
<p>20. What then do I mean? I am no proficient in virtue without reward, having not attained
to so high a degree of virtue. Give me the reward of my labours. What reward? Not
that which some, prone to any suspicion would suppose, but that which it is safe for me to
seek. Give me a respite from my long labours; give honour to my foreign service; elect another
in my place, the one who is being eagerly sought on your behalf, someone who is clean
of hands, someone who is not unskilled in voice, someone who is able to gratify you on all
points, and share with you the ecclesiastical cares; for this is especially the time for such.
But behold, I pray you, the condition of this body, so drained by time, by disease, by toil.
What need have you of a timid and unmanly old man, who is, so to speak, dying day by day,
not only in body, but even in powers of mind, who finds it difficult to enter into these details
before you? Disobey not the voice of your teacher: for indeed you have never yet disobeyed
it. I am weary of being charged with my gentleness. I am weary of being assailed in words
and in envy by enemies, and by our own. Some aim at my breast, and are less successful in
their effort, for an open enemy can be guarded against. Others lie in wait for my back, and

give greater pain, for the unsuspected blow is the more fatal. If again I have been a pilot, I
have been one of the most skilful; the sea has been boisterous around us, boiling about the
ship, and there has been considerable uproar among the passengers, who have always been
fighting about something or another, and roaring against one another and the waves. What
a struggle I have had, seated at the helm, contending alike with the sea and the passengers,
to bring the vessel safe to land through this double storm? Had they in every way supported
me, safety would have been hardly won, and when they were opposed to me, how has it
been possible to avoid making shipwreck?</p>
<p>21. What more need be said? But how can I bear this holy war? For there has been
said to be a holy, as well as a Persian, war.4376 How shall I unite and join together the hostile
occupants of sees, and hostile pastors, and the people broken up along with, and opposed
to them, as if by some chasms caused by earthquakes between neighbouring and adjoining
places; or as, in pestilential diseases, befalls servants and members of the family, when the
sickness readily attacks in succession one after another; and besides the very quarters of the
globe are affected by the spirit of faction, so that East and West are arrayed on opposite
sides, and bid fair to be severed in opinion no less than in position. How long are parties
to be mine and yours, the old and the new, the more rational and the more spiritual, the
more noble and the more ignoble, the more and the less numerous? I am ashamed of my
old age, when, after being saved by Christ, I am called by the name of others.</p>
<p>22.4377 I cannot bear your horse races and theatres, and this rage for rivalry in expense
and party spirit. We unharness, and harness ourselves on the other side, we neigh against
each other, we almost beat the air, as they do, and fling the dust towards heaven, like those
which are excited; and under other masks satisfy our own rivalry, and become evil arbiters
of emulation, and senseless judges of affairs. To-day sharing the same thrones and opinions,
if our leaders thus carry us along; to-morrow hostile alike in position and opinion, if the
wind blows in the contrary direction. Amid the variations of friendship and hatred, our
names also vary: and what is most terrible, we are not ashamed to set forth contrary doctrines
to the same audience; nor are we constant to the same objects, being rendered different at
different times by our contentiousness. They are like the ebb and flow of some narrow
strait.4378 For as when the children are at play in the midst of the market place, it would be
most disgraceful and unbecoming for us to leave our household business, and join them;
for children’s toys are not becoming for old age: so, when others are contending, even if I
am better informed than the majority, I could not allow myself to be one of them, rather

than, as I now do, enjoy the freedom of obscurity. For, besides all this, my feeling is that I
do not, on most points, agree with the majority, and cannot bear to walk in the same way.
Rash and stupid though it may be, such is my feeling. That which is pleasant to others causes
pain to me, and I am pleased with what is painful to others. So that I should not be surprised
if I were even imprisoned as a disagreeable man, and thought by most men to be out of my
senses, as is said to have been the case with one of the Greek philosophers, whose moderation
exposed him to the charge of madness, because he laughed at everything, since he saw that
the objects of the eager pursuit of the majority were ridiculous; or even be thought full of
new wine as were in later days the disciples of Christ, because they spoke with tongues,4379
since men knew not that it was the power of the Spirit, and not a distraction of mind.</p>
<p>23. Now, consider the charges laid against us. You have been ruler of the church, it is
said, for so long, and favoured by the course of time, and the influence of the sovereign, a
most important matter. What change have we been able to notice? How many men have
in days gone by used us outrageously? What sufferings have we failed to undergo? Ill-usage?
Threats? Banishment? Plunder? Confiscation? The burning4380 of priests at sea? The
desecration of temples by the blood of the saints, till, instead of temples, they became charnelhouses?
The public slaughter of aged Bishops, to speak more accurately, of Patriarchs? The
denial of access to every place in the case of the godly alone? In fact any kind of suffering
which could be mentioned? And for which of these have we requited the wrongdoers? For
the wheel of fortune gave us the power of rightly treating those who so treated us, and our
persecutors ought to have received a lesson. Apart from all other things, speaking only of
our experiences, not to mention your own, have we not been persecuted, maltreated, driven
from churches, houses, and, most terrible of all, even from the deserts? Have we not had
to endure an enraged people, insolent governors, the disregard of Emperors and their decrees?
What was the result? We became stronger, and our persecutors took to flight. That
was actually the case. The power to requite them seemed to me a sufficient vengeance on
those who had wronged us. These men thought otherwise; for they are exceedingly exact
and just in requiting: and accordingly they demand4381 what the state of things permits.
What governor, they say, has been fined? What populace chastised? What ringleaders of
the populace? What fear of ourselves have we been able to inspire for the future?</p>
<p>24. Perhaps4382 we may be reproached, as we have been before, with the exquisite
character of our table, the splendour of our apparel, the officers who precede us, our

<note type="footnote">4382 Perhaps, an ironical passage.</note>

haughtiness to those who meet us. I was not aware that we ought to rival the consuls, the
governors, the most illustrious generals, who have no opportunity of lavishing their incomes;
or that our belly ought to hunger for the enjoyment of the goods of the poor, and to expend
their necessaries on superfluities, and belch forth over the altars. I did not know that we
ought to ride on splendid horses, and drive in magnificent carriages, and be preceded by a
procession and surrounded by applause, and have everyone make way for us, as if we were
wild beasts, and open out a passage so that our approach might be seen afar. If these sufferings
have been endured, they have now passed away: Forgive me this wrong.4383 Elect another
who will please the majority: and give me my desert, my country life, and my God,
Whom alone I may have to please, and shall please by my simple life. It is a painful thing
to be deprived of speeches and conferences, and public gatherings, and applause like that
which now lends wings to my thoughts, and relatives, and friends and honours, and the
beauty and grandeur of the city, and its brilliancy which dazzles those who look at the surface
without investigating the inner nature of things; but yet not so painful as being clamoured
against and besmirched amid public disturbances and agitations, which trim their sails to
the popular breeze. For they seek not for priests, but for orators, not for stewards of souls,
but for treasurers of money, not for pure offerers of the sacrifice, but for powerful patrons.
I will say a word in their defence: we have thus trained them, by becoming all things to all
men,4384 whether to save or destroy all, I know not.</p>
<p>25. What say you? Are you persuaded, have you been overcome by my words? Or
must I use stronger terms in order to persuade you? Yea by the Trinity Itself, Whom you
and I alike worship, by our common hope, and for the sake of the unity of this people, grant
me this favour; dismiss me with your prayers; let this be the proclamation of my contest;
give me my certificate of retirement, as sovereigns do to their soldiers; and, if you will, with
a favourable testimony, that I may enjoy the honour of it; if not, just as you please; this will
make no difference to me, until God sees what my case really is. What successor then shall
we elect? God will provide Himself4385 a shepherd for the office, as He once provided a
lamb for a burnt-offering. I only make this further request,—let him be one who is the object
of envy, not the object of pity; not one who yields everything to all, but one who can on
some points offer resistance for the sake of what is best: for though the one is most pleasant,
the other is most profitable. So do you prepare for me your addresses of dismissal: I will
now bid you farewell.</p>

<head>Oration XLIII.</head>
<p>Funeral Oration on the Great S. Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia.</p>
<p>S. Basil died January 1, a.d. 379. A serious illness, in addition to other causes, prevented
S. Gregory from being present at his funeral (Epist. 79). Benoît holds that an expression
(Epitaph, cxix. 38) in which S. Gregory says that his “lips are fettered” proves that he was still
in retirement at Seleucia. This is an unwarranted deduction. In this Oration, § 2, the Saint,
alluding to his illness in disparaging terms, alleges his labours at Constantinople as a more
pressing reason for his absence: and says that he undertook the task according to the judgment
of S. Basil. This implies that S. Gregory went to Constantinople before the death of S. Basil,
or that he had then been influenced by his friend’s advice and was on the point of setting
out—more probably the former, as we may be sure that, if S. Gregory had been still at Seleucia,
no reason but physical incapacity would have kept him from his friend’s side. His pressing
duties at Constantinople and the difficulties of the long journey were the “other causes” of his
letter to S. Gregory of Nyssa: and we know that he suffered from serious illness at Constantinople
(Carm. xi. 887. Orat. xxiii. 1). S. Gregory left Constantinople in June, a.d. 381,
and Tillemont places the date of this Oration soon after his return to Nazianzus. Benoît thinks
that it was probably delivered on the anniversary of S. Basil’s death. The Oration, as all critics
are agreed, is one of great power and beauty. Its length (62 pages folio), the physical weakness
of the speaker, and the limits of the endurance of even an interested audience, incline us to
suppose that it was not spoken in its present form. We cannot well set aside expressions which
clearly point to actual delivery, but it may have been amplified later.</p>
<p>1. It has then been ordained that the great Basil, who used so constantly to furnish me
with subjects for my discourses, of which he was quite as proud as any other man of his
own, should himself now furnish me with the grandest subject which has ever fallen to the
lot of an orator. For I think that if anyone desired, in making trial of his powers of eloquence,
to test them by the standard of that one of all his subjects which he preferred (as painters
do with epoch-making pictures), he would choose that which stood first of all others, but
would set aside this as beyond the powers of human eloquence. So great a task is the praise
of such a man, not only to me, who have long ago laid aside all thought of emulation, but
even to those who live for eloquence, and whose sole object is the gaining of glory by subjects
like this. Such is my opinion, and, as I persuade myself, with perfect justice. But I know
not what subject I can treat with eloquence, if not this; or what greater favour I can do to
myself, to the admirers of virtue, or to eloquence itself, than express our admiration for this
man. To me it is the discharge of a most sacred debt. And our speech is a debt beyond all
others due to those who have been gifted, in particular, with powers of speech. To the ad-

<pb n="786"/>
mirers of virtue a discourse is at once a pleasure and an incentive to virtue. For when4397
I have learned the praises of men, I have a distinct idea of their progress: now, there is none
of us all, within whose power it is not to attain to any point whatsoever in that progress.
As for eloquence itself, in either case, all must go well with it. For, if the discourse be almost
worthy of its subject—eloquence will have given an exhibition of its power: if it fall far short
of it, as must be the case when the praises of Basil are being set forth, by an actual demonstration
of its incapacity, it will have declared the superiority of the excellences of its subject
to all expression in words.</p>
<p>2. These are the reasons which have urged me to speak, and to address myself to this
contest. And at my late appearance, long after his praises have been set forth by so many,
who have publicly and privately done him honour, let no one be surprised. Yea, may I be
pardoned by that divine soul, the object of my constant reverence! And as, when he was
amongst us, he constantly corrected me in many points, according to the rights of a friend
and the still higher law; for I am not ashamed to say this, for he was a standard of virtue to
us all; so now, looking down upon me from above, he will treat me with indulgence. I ask
pardon too of any here who are among his warmest admirers, if indeed anyone can be
warmer than another, and we are not all abreast in our zeal for his good fame. For it is not
contempt which has caused me to fall short of what might have been expected of me: nor
have I been so regardless of the claims of virtue or of friendship; nor have I thought that to
praise him befitted any other more than me. No! my first reason was, that I shrunk from
this task, for I will say the truth, as priests4398 do, who approach their sacred duties before
being cleansed both in voice and mind. In the second place, I remind you, though you know
it well, of the task4399 in which I was engaged on behalf of the true doctrine, which had been
properly forced upon me, and had carried me from home, according, as I suppose, to the
will of God, and certainly according to the judgment of our noble champion of the truth,
the breath of whose life was pious doctrine alone, such as promotes the salvation of the
whole world. As for my bodily health, I ought not, perhaps, to dare to mention it, when my
subject is a man so doughty in his conquest of the body, even before his removal hence, and
who maintained that no powers of the soul should suffer hindrance from this our fetter.4400
So much for my defence. I do not think I need labour it further, in speaking of him to you
who know so clearly my affairs. I must now proceed with my eulogy, commending myself
to his God, in order that my commendations may not prove an insult to the man, and that

I may not lag far behind all others; even though we all equally fall as far short of his due, as
those who look upon the heavens or the rays of the Sun.</p>
<p>3. Had I seen him to be proud of his birth, and the rights of birth, or any of those infinitely
little objects of those whose eyes are on the ground, we should have had to inspect a
new catalogue of the Heroes. What details as to his ancestors might I not have laid under
contribution! Nor would even history have had any advantage over me, since I claim this
advantage, that his celebrity depends, not upon fiction or legend, but upon actual facts attested
by many witnesses. On his father’s side Pontus offers to me many details, in no wise
inferior to its wonders of old time, of which all history and poesy are full;4401 there are many
others concerned with this my native land, of illustrious men of Cappadocia, renowned for
its youthful progeny,4402 no less than for its horses. Accordingly we match with his father’s
family that of his mother. What family owns more numerous, or more illustrious generals
and governors, or court officials, or again, men of wealth, and lofty thrones, and public
honours, and oratorical renown? If it were permitted me to wish to mention them, I would
make nothing of the Pelopidæ and Cecropidæ, the Alcmæonids, the Æacidæ, and Heracleidæ,
and other most noble families: inasmuch as they, in default of public merit in their house,
betake themselves to the region of uncertainty, claiming demigods and divinities, merely
mythical personages, as the glory of their ancestors, whose most vaunted details are incredible,
and those which we can believe are an infamy.</p>
<p>4. But since our subject is a man who has maintained that each man’s nobility is to be
judged of according to his own worth, and that, as forms and colours, and likewise our most
celebrated and most infamous horses, are tested by their own properties, so we too ought
not to be depicted in borrowed plumes; after mentioning one or two traits, which, though
inherited from his ancestors, he made his own by his life, and which are specially likely to
give pleasure to my hearers, I will then proceed to deal with the man himself. Different
families and individuals have different points of distinction and interest, great or small,
which, like a patrimony of longer or shorter descent, come down to posterity: the distinction
of his family on either side was piety, which I now proceed to display.</p>
<p>5. There was a persecution, the most frightful and severe of all; I mean, as you know,
the persecution of Maximinus, which, following closely upon those which immediately
preceded it, made them all seem gentle, by its excessive audacity, and by its eagerness to win
the crown of violence in impiety. It was overcome by many of our champions, who wrestled
with it to the death, or well-nigh to the death, with only life enough left in them to survive
their victory, and not pass away in the midst of the struggle; remaining to be trainers4403

in virtue, living witnesses, breathing trophies, silent exhortations, among whose numerous
ranks were found Basil’s paternal ancestors, upon whom, in their practice of every form of
piety, that period bestowed many a fair garland. So prepared and determined were they to
bear readily all those things on account of which Christ crowns those who have imitated
His struggle on our behalf.</p>
<p>6. But since their strife must needs be lawful, and the law of martyrdom alike forbids
us voluntarily to go to meet it (in consideration for the persecutors, and for the weak) or to
shrink from it if it comes upon us; for the former shows foolhardiness, the latter cowardice;
in this respect they paid due honour to the Lawgiver; but what was their device, or rather,
to what were they led by the Providence which guided them in all things? They betook
themselves to a thicket on the mountains of Pontus, of which there are many deep ones of
considerable extent, with very few comrades of their flight, or attendants upon their needs.
Let others marvel at the length of time, for their flight was exceedingly prolonged, to about
seven years, or a little more, and their mode of life, delicately nurtured as they were, was
straitened and unusual, as may be imagined, with the discomfort of its exposure to frost
and heat and rain: and the wilderness allowed no fellowship or converse with friends: a
great trial to men accustomed to the attendance and honour of a numerous retinue. But I
will proceed to speak of what is still greater and more extraordinary: nor will anyone fail
to credit it, save those who, in their feeble and dangerous judgment, think little of persecutions
and dangers for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p>7. These noble men, suffering from the lapse of time, and feeling a distaste for ordinary
food, felt a longing for something more appetising. They did not indeed speak as Israel
did,4404 for they were not murmurers4405 like them, in their afflictions in the desert, after
the escape from Egypt—that Egypt would have been better for them than the wilderness,
in the bountiful supply of its flesh-pots, and other dainties which they had left behind them
there, for the brickmaking and the clay seemed nothing to them then in their folly—but in
a more pious and faithful manner. For why, said they, is it incredible that the God of wonders,
who bountifully fed4406 in the wilderness his homeless and fugitive people, raining
bread upon them, and abounding in quails, nourishing them not only with necessaries, but
even with luxuries: that He, Who divided the sea,4407 and stayed the sun,4408 and parted
the river, with all the other things that He has done; for under such circumstances the mind
is wont to recur to history, and sing the praises of God’s many wonders: that He, they went

on, should feed us champions of piety with dainties to-day? Many animals which have escaped
the tables of the rich, have their lairs in these mountains, and many eatable birds fly
over our longing heads, any of which can surely be caught at the mere fiat of Thy will! At
these words, their quarry lay before them, with food come of its own accord, a complete
banquet prepared without effort, stags appearing all at once from some place in the hills.
How splendid they were! how fat! how ready for the slaughter! It might almost be imagined
that they were annoyed at not having been summoned earlier. Some of them made signs
to draw others after them, the rest followed their lead. Who pursued and drove them? No
one. What riders? What kind of dogs, what barking, or cry, or young men who had occupied
the exits according to the rules of the chase? They were the prisoners of prayer and righteous
petition. Who has known such a hunt among men of this, or any day?</p>
<p>8. O what a wonder! They were themselves stewards of the chase; what they would,
was caught by the mere will to do so; what was left, they sent away to the thickets, for another
meal. The cooks were extemporised, the dinner exquisite, the guests were grateful for this
wonderful foretaste of their hopes. And hence they grew more earnest in their struggle, in
return for which they had received this blessing. Such is my history. And do thou, my
persecutor, in thy admiration for legends, tell of thy huntresses,4409 and Orions, and Actæons,
those ill-fated hunters, and the hind substituted for the maiden,4410 if any such thing rouses
thee to emulation, and if we grant that this story is no legend. The sequel of the tale is too
disgraceful. For what is the benefit of the exchange, if a maiden is saved to be taught to
murder her guests, and learn to requite humanity with inhumanity? Let this one instance,
such as it is, chosen out of many, represent the rest, as far as I am concerned. I have not
related it to contribute to his reputation: for neither does the sea stand in need of the rivers
which flow into it, many and great though they be, nor does the present subject of my praises
need any contributions to his fair fame. No! my object is to exhibit the character of his ancestors,
and the example before his eyes, which he so far excelled. For if other men find it
a great additional advantage to receive somewhat of their honour from their forefathers, it
is a greater thing for him to have made such an addition to the original stock that the stream
seems to have run uphill.</p>
<p>9. The union of his parents, cemented as it was by a community of virtue, no less than
by cohabitation, was notable for many reasons, especially for generosity to the poor, for
hospitality, for purity of soul as the result of self-discipline, for the dedication to God of a
portion of their property, a matter not as yet so much cared for by most men, as it now has
grown to be, in consequence of such previous examples, as have given distinction to it, and
for all those other points, which have been published throughout Pontus and Cappadocia,

<pb n="790"/>
to the satisfaction of many: in my opinion, however, their greatest claim to distinction is
the excellence of their children. Legend indeed has its instances of men whose children
were many and beautiful, but it is practical experience which has presented to us these parents,
whose own character, apart from that of their children, was sufficient for their fair
fame, while the character of their children would have made them, even without their own
eminence in virtue, to surpass all men by the excellence of their children. For the attainment
of distinction by one or two of their offspring might be ascribed to their nature; but when
all are eminent, the honour is clearly due to those who brought them up. This is proved by
the blessed roll of priests and virgins, and of those who, when married, have allowed nothing
in their union to hinder them from attaining an equal repute, and so have made the distinction
between them to consist in the condition, rather than in the mode of their life.</p>
<p>10. Who has not known Basil, our archbishop’s father, a great name to everyone, who
attained a father’s prayer, if anyone, I will not say as no one, ever did? For he surpassed all
in virtue, and was only prevented by his son from gaining the first prize. Who has not
known Emmelia, whose name was a forecast of what she became, or else whose life was an
exemplification of her name? For she had a right to the name which implies gracefulness,
and occupied, to speak concisely, the same place among women, as her husband among
men. So that, when it was decided that he, in whose honour we are met, should be given to
men to submit to the bondage of nature, as anyone of old has been given by God for the
common advantage, it was neither fitting that he should be born of other parents, nor that
they should possess another son: and so the two things suitably concurred. I have now, in
obedience to the Divine law which bids us to pay all honour to parents, bestowed the firstfruits
of my praises upon those whom I have commemorated, and proceed to treat of Basil
himself, premising this, which I think will seem true to all who knew him, that we only need
his own voice to pronounce his eulogium. For he is at once a brilliant subject for praise,
and the only one whose powers of speech make him worthy of treating it. Beauty indeed
and strength and size, in which I see that most men rejoice, I concede to anyone who
will—not that even in these points he was inferior to any of those men of small minds who
busy themselves about the body, while he was still young, and had not yet reduced the flesh
by austerity—but that I may avoid the fate of unskilful athletes, who waste their strength in
vain efforts after minor objects, and so are worsted in the crucial struggle, whose results are
victory and the distinction of the crown. The praise, then, which I shall claim for him is
based upon grounds which no one, I think, will consider superfluous, or beyond the scope
of my oration.</p>
<p>11. I take it as admitted by men of sense, that the first of our advantages is education;
and not only this our more noble form of it, which disregards rhetorical ornaments and
glory, and holds to salvation, and beauty in the objects of our contemplation: but even that
external culture which many Christians ill-judgingly abhor, as treacherous and dangerous,

<pb n="791"/>
and keeping us afar from God. For as we ought not to neglect the heavens, and earth, and
air, and all such things, because some have wrongly seized upon them, and honour God’s
works instead of God: but to reap what advantage we can from them for our life and enjoyment,
while we avoid their dangers; not raising creation, as foolish men do, in revolt against
the Creator, but from the works of nature apprehending the Worker,4411 and, as the divine
apostle says, bringing into captivity every thought to Christ:4412 and again, as we know that
neither fire, nor food, nor iron, nor any other of the elements, is of itself most useful, or
most harmful, except according to the will of those who use it; and as we have compounded
healthful drugs from certain of the reptiles; so from secular literature we have received
principles of enquiry and speculation, while we have rejected their idolatry, terror, and pit
of destruction. Nay, even these have aided us in our religion, by our perception of the
contrast between what is worse and what is better, and by gaining strength for our doctrine
from the weakness of theirs. We must not then dishonour education, because some men
are pleased to do so, but rather suppose such men to be boorish and uneducated, desiring
all men to be as they themselves are, in order to hide themselves in the general, and escape
the detection of their want of culture. But come now, and, after this sketch of our subject
and these admissions, let us contemplate the life of Basil.</p>
<p>12. In his earliest years he was swathed and fashioned, in that best and purest fashioning
which the Divine David speaks of as proceeding day by day,4413 in contrast with that of the
night, under his great father, acknowledged in those days by Pontus, as its common teacher
of virtue. Under him then, as life and reason grew and rose together, our illustrious friend
was educated: not boasting of a Thessalian mountain cave, as the workshop of his virtue,
nor of some braggart Centaur,4414 the tutor of the heroes of his day: nor was he taught
under such tuition to shoot hares, and run down fawns, or hunt stags, or excel in war, or in
breaking colts, using the same person as teacher and horse at once; nor nourished on the
fabulous marrows of stags and lions, but he was trained in general education, and practised
in the worship of God, and, to speak concisely, led on by elementary instructions to his future
perfection. For those who are successful in life or in letters only, while deficient in the other,
seem to me to differ in nothing from one-eyed men, whose loss is great, but their deformity
greater, both in their own eyes, and in those of others. While those who attain eminence
in both alike, and are ambidextrous, both possess perfection, and pass their life with the
blessedness of heaven. This is what befell him, who had at home a model of virtue in welldoing,
the very sight of which made him excellent from the first. As we see foals and calves
<note type="footnote">4411 Rom. i. 20, 25.</note>

<note type="footnote">4413 Ps. cxxxix. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">4414 Centaur. Alluding to Chiron, the tutor of Achilles.</note>

<pb n="792"/>
skipping beside their mothers from their birth, so he too, running close beside his father in
foal-like wantonness, without being left far behind in his lofty impulses toward virtue, or,
if you will, sketching out and showing traces of the future beauty of his virtue, and drawing
the outlines of perfection before the time of perfection arrived.</p>
<p>13. When sufficiently trained at home, as he ought to fall short in no form of excellence,
and not be surpassed by the busy bee, which gathers what is most useful from every flower,
he set out for the city of Cæsarea,4415 to take his place in the schools there, I mean this illustrious
city of ours, for it was the guide and mistress of my studies, the metropolis of letters,
no less than of the cities which she excels and reigns over: and if any one were to deprive
her of her literary power, he would rob her of her fairest and special distinction. Other cities
take pride in other ornaments, of ancient or of recent date, that they may have something
to be described or to be seen. Letters form our distinction here, and are our badge, as if
upon the field of arms or on the stage. His subsequent life let those detail who trained him,
or enjoyed his training, as to what he was to his masters, what he was to his classmates,
equalling the former, surpassing the latter in every form of culture, what renown he won in
a short time from all, both of the common people, and of the leaders of the state; by showing
both a culture beyond his years, and a steadfastness of character beyond his culture. An
orator among orators, even before the chair of the rhetoricians,4416 a philosopher among
philosophers, even before the doctrines of philosophers: highest of all a priest among
Christians even before the priesthood. So much deference was paid to him in every respect
by all. Eloquence was his by-work, from which he culled enough to make it an assistance
to him in Christian philosophy, since power of this kind is needed to set forth the objects
of our contemplation. For a mind which cannot express itself is like the motion of a man
in a lethargy. His pursuit was philosophy, and breaking from the world, and fellowship
with God, by concerning himself, amid things below, with things above, and winning, where
all is unstable and fluctuating, the things which are stable and remain.</p>
<p>14. Thence to Byzantium, the imperial city of the East, for it was distinguished by the
eminence of its rhetorical and philosophic teachers, whose most valuable lessons he soon
assimilated by the quickness and force of his powers: thence he was sent by God, and by
his generous craving for culture, to Athens the home of letters. Athens, which has been to
me, if to any one, a city truly of gold, and the patroness of all that is good. For it brought
me to know Basil more perfectly, though he had not been unknown to me before; and in
my pursuit of letters, I attained to happiness; and in another fashion had the same experience
as Saul,4417 who, seeking his father’s asses, found a kingdom, and gained incidentally what
<note type="footnote">4415 Cæsarea, the Cappadocian city, as seems plain from the context. Yet Tillemont and Billius incline to
think Cæsarea in Palestine is meant.</note>

<note type="footnote">4417 1 Sam. ix. 3.</note>

<pb n="793"/>
was of more importance than the object which he had in view. Hitherto my course has been
clear, leading me in my encomiums along a level and easy, in fact, a king’s highway:
henceforth I know not how to speak or whither to turn: for my task is becoming arduous.
For here I am anxious, and seize this opportunity to add from my own experience somewhat
to my speech, and to dwell a little upon the recital of the causes and circumstances which
originated our friendship, or to speak more strictly, our unity of life and nature. For as our
eyes are not ready to turn from attractive objects, and, if we violently tear them away, are
wont to return to them again; so do we linger in our description of what is most sweet to
us. I am afraid of the difficulty of the undertaking. I will try, however, to use all possible
moderation. And if I am at all overpowered by my regret, pardon this most righteous of all
feelings, the absence of which would be a great loss, in the eyes of men of feeling.</p>
<p>15. We were contained by Athens, like two branches of some river-stream, for after
leaving the common fountain of our fatherland, we had been separated in our varying pursuit
of culture, and were now again united by the impulsion of God no less than by our own
agreement. I preceded him by a little, but he soon followed me, to be welcomed with great
and brilliant hope. For he was versed in many languages, before his arrival, and it was a
great thing for either of us to outstrip the other in the attainment of some object of our
study. And I may well add, as a seasoning to any speech, a short narrative, which will be a
reminder to those who know it, a source of information to those who do not. Most of the
young men at Athens in their folly are mad after rhetorical skill—not only those who are
ignobly born and unknown, but even the noble and illustrious, in the general mass of young
men difficult to keep under control. They are just like men devoted to horses and exhibitions,
as we see, at the horse-races; they leap,4418 they shout, raise clouds of dust, they drive in
their seats, they beat the air, (instead of the horses) with their fingers as whips, they yoke
and unyoke the horses, though they are none of theirs: they readily exchange with one another
drivers, horses, positions, leaders: and who are they who do this? Often poor and
needy fellows, without the means of support for a single day. This is just how the students
feel in regard to their own tutors, and their rivals, in their eagerness to increase their own
numbers and thereby enrich them. The matter is absolutely absurd and silly. Cities, roads,
harbours, mountain tops, coastlines, are seized upon—in short, every part of Attica, or of
the rest of Greece, with most of the inhabitants; for even these they have divided between
the rival parties.</p>
<p>16. Whenever any newcomer arrives, and falls into the hands of those who seize upon
him, either by force or willingly, they observe this Attic law, of combined jest and earnest.
He is first conducted to the house of one of those who were the first to receive him, or of
<note type="footnote">4418 They leap, etc. This passage refers to the spectators who unite in sympathy with, and imitate as far as
possible, in their excitement, the actions of, those who drive the chariots in the races.</note>

<pb n="794"/>
his friends, or kinsmen, or countrymen, or of those who are eminent in debating power,
and purveyors of arguments, and therefore especially honoured among them; and their reward
consists in the gain of adherents. He is next subjected to the raillery of any one who
will, with the intention I suppose, of checking the conceit of the newcomers, and reducing
them to subjection at once. The raillery is of a more insolent or argumentative kind, according
to the boorishness or refinement of the railer: and the performance, which seems very
fearful and brutal to those who do not know it, is to those who have experienced it very
pleasant and humane: for its threats are feigned rather than real. Next, he is conducted in
procession through the market place to the bath. The procession is formed by those who
are charged with it in the young man’s honour, who arrange themselves in two ranks separated
by an interval, and precede him to the bath. But when they have approached it, they
shout and leap wildly, as if possessed, shouting that they must not advance, but stay, since
the bath will not admit them; and at the same time frighten the youth by furiously knocking
at the doors: then allowing him to enter, they now present him with his freedom, and receive
him after the bath as an equal, and one of themselves. This they consider the most pleasant
part of the ceremony, as being a speedy exchange and relief from annoyances. On this occasion
I not only refused to put to shame my friend the great Basil, out of respect for the
gravity of his character, and the ripeness of his reasoning powers, but also persuaded all the
rest of the students to treat him likewise, who happened not to know him. For he was from
the first respected by most of them, his reputation having preceded him. The result was
that he was the only one to escape the general rule, and be accorded a greater honour than
belongs to a freshman’s position.</p>
<p>17. This was the prelude of our friendship. This was the kindling spark of our union:
thus we felt the wound of mutual love. Then something of this kind happened, for I think
it right not to omit even this. I find the Armenians to be not a simple race, but very crafty
and cunning. At this time some of his special comrades and friends, who had been intimate
with him even in the early days of his father’s instruction, for they were members of his
school, came up to him under the guise of friendship, but with envious, and not kindly intent,
and put to him questions of a disputations rather than rational kind, trying to overwhelm
him at the first onset, having known his original natural endowments, and unable to brook
the honour he had then received. For they thought it a strange thing that they who had put
on their gowns, and been exercised in shouting, should not get the better of one who was a
stranger and a novice. I also, in my vain love for Athens, and trusting to their professions
without perceiving their envy, when they were giving way, and turning their backs, since I
was indignant that in their persons the reputation of Athens should be destroyed, and so
speedily put to shame, supported the young men, and restored the argument; and by the
aid of my additional weight, for in such cases a small addition makes all the difference, and,

<pb n="795"/>
as the poet says, “made equal their heads in the fray.”4419 But, when I perceived the secret
motive of the dispute, which could no longer be kept under, and was at last clearly exposed,
I at once drew back, and retired from their ranks, to range myself on his side, and made the
victory decisive. He was at once delighted at what had happened, for his sagacity was remarkable,
and being filled with zeal, to describe him fully in Homer’s language, he pursued
in confusion4420 with argument those valiant youths, and, smiting them with syllogisms,
only ceased when they were utterly routed, and he had distinctly won the honours due to
his power. Thus was kindled again, no longer a spark, but a manifest and conspicuous blaze
of friendship.</p>
<p>18. Their efforts having thus proved fruitless, while they severely blamed their own
rashness, they cherished such annoyance against me that it broke out into open hostility,
and a charge of treachery, not only to them, but to Athens herself: inasmuch as they had
been confuted and put to shame at the first onset, by a single student, who had not even had
time to gain confidence. He moreover, according to that human feeling, which makes us,
when we have all at once attained to the high hopes which we have cherished, look upon
their results as inferior to our expectation, he, I say, was displeased and annoyed, and could
take no delight in his arrival. He was seeking for what he had expected, and called Athens
an empty happiness. I however tried to remove his annoyance, both by argumentative encounter,
and by the enchantments of reasoning; alleging, as is true, that the disposition of
a man cannot at once be detected, without a long time and more constant association, and
that culture likewise is not made known to those who make trial of her, after a few efforts
and in a short time. In this way I restored his cheerfulness, and by this mutual experience,
he was the more closely united to me.</p>
<p>19. And when, as time went on, we acknowledged our mutual affection, and that
philosophy4421 was our aim, we were all in all to one another, housemates, messmates, intimates,
with one object in life, or an affection for each other ever growing warmer and
stronger. Love for bodily attractions, since its objects are fleeting, is as fleeting as the flowers
of spring. For the flame cannot survive, when the fuel is exhausted, and departs along with
that which kindles it, nor does desire abide, when its incentive wastes away. But love which
is godly and under restraint, since its object is stable, not only is more lasting, but, the fuller
its vision of beauty grows, the more closely does it bind to itself and to one another the
hearts of those whose love has one and the same object. This is the law of our superhuman
love. I feel that I am being unduly borne away, and I know not how to enter upon this point,
yet I cannot restrain myself from describing it. For if I have omitted anything, it seems,

immediately afterwards, of pressing importance, and of more consequence than what I had
preferred to mention. And if any one would carry me tyrannically forward, I become like

share of force. If then you give me leave, I have my request, if not I must take it from myself.</p>
<p>20. Such were our feelings for each other, when we had thus supported, as Pindar4422
has it, our “well-built chamber with pillars of gold,” as we advanced under the united influences
of God’s grace and our own affection. Oh! how can I mention these things without
tears.</p>
<p>We were impelled by equal hopes, in a pursuit especially obnoxious to envy, that of
letters. Yet envy we knew not, and emulation was of service to us. We struggled, not each
to gain the first place for himself, but to yield it to the other; for we made each other’s
reputation to be our own. We seemed to have one soul, inhabiting two bodies. And if we
must not believe those whose doctrine is “All things4423 are in all;” yet in our case it was
worthy of belief, so did we live in and with each other. The sole business of both of us was
virtue, and living for the hopes to come, having retired from this world, before our actual
departure hence. With a view to this, were directed all our life and actions, under the
guidance of the commandment, as we sharpened upon each other our weapons of virtue;
and if this is not a great thing for me to say, being a rule and standard to each other, for the
distinction between what was right and what was not. Our associates were not the most
dissolute, but the most sober of our comrades; not the most pugnacious, but the most
peaceable, whose intimacy was most profitable: knowing that it is more easy to be tainted
with vice, than to impart virtue; just as we can more readily be infected with a disease, than
bestow health. Our most cherished studies were not the most pleasant, but the most excellent;
this being one means of forming young minds in a virtuous or vicious mould.</p>
<p>21. Two ways were known to us, the first of greater value, the second of smaller consequence:
the one leading to our sacred buildings and the teachers there, the other to secular
instructors. All others we left to those who would pursue them—to feasts, theatres, meetings,
banquets. For nothing is in my opinion of value, save that which leads to virtue and to the
improvement of its devotees. Different men have different names, derived from their fathers,
their families, their pursuits, their exploits: we had but one great business and name—to
be and to be called Christians of which we thought more than Gyges4424 of the turning of

his ring, if this is not a legend, on which depended his Lydian sovereignty: or than Midas4425
did of the gold through which he perished, in answer to his prayer that all he had might
turn to gold—another Phrygian legend. For why should I speak of the arrow of the Hyperborean
Abaris,4426 or of the Argive Pegasus,4427 to whom flight through the air was not of
such consequence as was to us our rising to God, through the help of, and with each other?
Hurtful as Athens was to others in spiritual things, and this is of no slight consequence to
the pious, for the city is richer in those evil riches—idols—than the rest of Greece, and it is
hard to avoid being carried along with their devotees and adherents, yet we, our minds being
closed up and fortified against this, suffered no injury. On the contrary, strange as it may
seem, we were thus the more confirmed in the faith, from our perception of their trickery
and unreality, which led us to despise these divinities in the very home of their worship.
And if there is, or is believed to be, a river4428 flowing with fresh water through the sea, or
an animal4429 which can dance in fire, the consumer of all things, such were we among all
our comrades.</p>
<p>22. And, best of all, we were surrounded by a far from ignoble band, under his instruction
and guidance, and delighting in the same objects, as we ran on foot beside that Lydian
car,4430 his own course and disposition: and so we became famous, not only among our
own teachers and comrades, but even throughout Greece, and especially in the eyes of its
most distinguished men. We even passed beyond its boundaries, as was made clear by the
evidence of many. For our instructors were known to all who knew Athens, and all who
knew them, knew us, as the subject of conversation, being actually looked upon, or heard
of by report, as an illustrious pair. Orestes and Pylades4431 were in their eyes nothing to
us, or the sons of Molione,4432 the wonders of the Homeric scroll, celebrated for their union
in misfortune, and their splendid driving, as they shared in reins and whip alike. But I have
been unawares betrayed into praising myself, in a manner I would not have allowed in another.
And it is no wonder that I gained here in some advantage from his friendship, and

that, as in life he aided me in virtue, so since his departure he has contributed to my renown.
But I must return to my proper course.</p>
<p>23. Who possessed such a degree of the prudence of old age, even before his hair was
gray? Since it is by this that Solomon defines old age.4433 Who was so respectful to both
old and young, not only of our contemporaries, but even of those who long preceded him?
Who, owing to his character, was less in need of education? Yet who, even with his character,
was so imbued with learning? What branch of learning did he not traverse; and that with
unexampled success, passing through all, as no one else passed through any one of them:
and attaining such eminence in each, as if it had been his sole study? The two great sources
of power in the arts and sciences, ability and application, were in him equally combined.
For, because of the pains he took, he had but little need of natural quickness, and his natural
quickness made it unnecessary for him to take pains; and such was the cooperation and
unity of both, that it was hard to see for which of the two he was more remarkable. Who
had such power in Rhetoric, which breathes4434 with the might of fire, different as his disposition
was from that of rhetoricians? Who in Grammar, which perfects our tongues in
Greek and compiles history, and presides over metres and legislates for poems? Who in
Philosophy, that really lofty and high reaching science, whether practical and speculative,
or in that part of it whose oppositions and struggles are concerned with logical demonstrations;
which is called Dialectic, and in which it was more difficult to elude his verbal toils,
if need required, than to escape from the Labyrinths?4435 Of Astronomy, Geometry, and
numerical proportion he had such a grasp, that he could not be baffled by those who are
clever in such sciences: excessive application to them he despised, as useless to those whose
desire is godliness: so that it is possible to admire what he chose more than what he neglected,
or what he neglected more than what he chose. Medicine, the result of philosophy and laboriousness,
was rendered necessary for him by his physical delicacy, and his care of the
sick. From these beginnings he attained to a mastery of the art, not only in its empirical
and practical branches, but also in its theory and principles. But what are these, illustrious
though they be, compared with the moral discipline of the man? To those who have had
experience of him, Minos and Rhadamanthus4436 were mere trifles, whom the Greeks
thought worthy of the meadows of Asphodel and the Elysian plains, which are their representations
of our Paradise, derived from those books of Moses which are also ours, for though
their terms are different, this is what they refer to under other names.</p>

<p>24. Such was the case, and his galleon was laden with all the learning attainable by the
nature of man; for beyond Cadiz4437 there is no passage. There was left no other need but
that of rising to a more perfect life, and grasping those hopes upon which we were agreed.
The day of our departure was at hand, with its attendant speeches of farewell, and of escort,
its invitations to return, its lamentations, embraces and tears. For there is nothing so painful
to any one, as is separation from Athens and one another, to those who have been comrades
there. On that occasion was seen a piteous spectacle, worthy of record. Around us were
grouped our fellow students and classmates and some of our teachers, protesting amid entreaties,
violence, and persuasion, that, whatever happened, they would not let us go; saying
and doing everything that men in distress could do. And here I will bring an accusation
against myself, and also, daring though it be, against that divine and irreproachable soul.
For he, by detailing the reasons of his anxiety to return home, was able to prevail over their
desire to retain him, and they were compelled, though with reluctance, to agree to his departure.
But I was left behind at Athens, partly, to say the truth, because I had been prevailed
on—partly because he had betrayed me, having been persuaded to forsake and hand over
to his captors one who refused to forsake him. A thing incredible, before it happened. For
it was like cutting one body into two, to the destruction of either part, or the severance of
two bullocks who have shared the same manger and the same yoke, amid pitiable bellowings
after one another in protest against the separation. However, my loss was not of long duration,
for I could not long bear to be seen in piteous plight, nor to have to account to every
one for our separation: so, after a brief stay at Athens, my longing desire made me, like the
horse in Homer, to burst the bonds of those who restrained me, and prancing o’er the plains,
rush to my mate.</p>
<p>25. Upon our return, after a slight indulgence to the world and the stage, sufficient to
gratify the general desire, not from any inclination to theatrical display, we soon became
independent, and, after being promoted from the rank of beardless boys to that of men,
made bold advances along the road of philosophy, for though no longer together, since envy
would not allow this, we were united by our eager desire. The city of Cæsarea took possession
of him, as a second founder and patron, but in course of time he was occasionally absent,
as a matter of necessity due to our separation, and with a view to our determined course of
philosophy. Dutiful attendance on my aged parents, and a succession of misfortunes kept
me apart from him, perhaps without right or justice, but so it was. And to this cause I am
inclined to ascribe all the inconsistency and difficulty which have befallen my life, and the
hindrances in the way of philosophy, which have been unworthy of my desire and purpose.
But as for my fate, let it lead whither God pleases, only may its course be the better for his
intercessions. As regards himself, the manifold love of God toward man,4438 and His

<pb n="800"/>
providential care for our race did, after shewing forth his merits under many intervening
circumstances with ever greater brilliancy, set him up as a conspicuous and celebrated light
for the Church, by advancing him to the holy thrones of the priesthood, to blaze forth,
through the single city of Cæsarea, to the whole world. And in what manner? Not by precipitate
advancement, nor by at once cleansing and making him wise, as is the wont of many
present candidates for preferment: but bestowing upon him the honour in the due order
of spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>26. For I do not praise the disorder and irregularity which sometimes exist among us,
even in those who preside over the sanctuary. I do not venture, nor is it just, to accuse them
all. I approve the nautical custom, which first gives the oar to the future steersman, and afterward
leads him to the stern, and entrusts him with the command, and seats him at the
helm, only after a long course of striking the sea and observing the winds. As is the case
again in military affairs: private, captain, general. This order is the best and most advantageous
for their subordinates. And if it were so in our case, it would be of great service.
But, as it is, there is a danger of the holiest of all offices being the most ridiculous among
us. For promotion depends not upon virtue, but upon villany; and the sacred thrones fall
not to the most Worthy, but to the most powerful. Samuel, the seer into futurity, is among
the prophets: but Saul, the rejected one, is also there. Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, is
among the kings, but so also is Jeroboam, the slave and apostate. And there is not a physician,
or a painter who has not first studied the nature of diseases, or mixed many colours, or
practised drawing: but a prelate is easily found, without laborious training, with a reputation
of recent date, being sown and springing up in a moment, as the legend4439 of the giants
goes. We manufacture those who are holy in a day, and bid those to be wise, who have had
no instruction, and have contributed nothing before to their dignity, except the will. So one
man is content with an inferior position, and abides in his low estate, who is worthy of a
lofty one, and has meditated much on the inspired words, and has reduced the flesh by many
laws into subjection to the spirit: while the other haughtily takes precedence, and raises his
eyebrow over his betters, and does not tremble at his position, nor is he appalled at the sight,
seeing the disciplined man beneath him; and wrongly supposes himself to be his superior
in wisdom as well as in rank, having lost his senses under the influence of his position.</p>
<p>27. Not so our great and illustrious Basil. In this grace, as in all others, he was a public
example. For he first read to the people the sacred books, while already able to expound
them, nor did he deem himself worthy of this rank4440 in the sanctuary, and thus proceeded
to praise the Lord in the seat of the Presbyters,4441 and next in that of the Bishops, attaining
<note type="footnote">4439 The legend, i.e., of Cadmus who sowed at Thebes the dragon’s teeth from which sprung giants.</note>

the office neither by stealth nor by violence, instead of seeking for the honour, being sought
for by it, and receiving it not as a human favour, but as from God and divine. The account
of his bishopric must be deferred: over his subordinate ministry let us linger a while, for
indeed it had almost escaped me, in the midst of my discourse.</p>
<p>28. There arose a disagreement between him and his predecessor4442 in the rule over
this Church: its source and character it is best to pass over in silence, yet it arose. He was
a man in other respects far from ignoble, and admirable for his piety, as was proved by the
persecution of that time, and the opposition to him, yet his feeling against Basil was one to
which men are liable. For Momus seizes not only upon the common herd, but on the best
of men, so that it belongs to God alone to be utterly uninfluenced by and proof against such
feelings. All the more eminent and wise portion of the Church was roused against him, if
those are wiser than the majority who have separated themselves from the world and consecrated
their life to God. I mean the Nazarites4443 of our day, and those who devote
themselves to such pursuits. They were annoyed that their chief4444 should be neglected,
insulted, and rejected, and they ventured upon a most dangerous proceeding. They determined
to revolt and break off from the body of the Church, which admits of no faction,
severing along with themselves no small fraction of the people, both of the lower ranks, and
of those of position. This was most easy, owing to three very strong reasons. In the first
place, the man was held in repute, beyond any other, I think, of the philosophers of our
time, and able, if he wished, to inspire with courage the conspirators. Next, his opponent4445
was suspected by the city, in consequence of the tumult which accompanied his institution,
of having obtained his preferment in an arbitrary manner, not according to the laws and
canons. Also there were present some of the bishops4446 of the West, drawing to themselves
all the orthodox members of the Church.</p>
<p>29. What then did our noble friend, the disciple of the Peaceable One? It was not his
habit to resist his traducers or partisans, nor was it his part to fight, or rend the body of the
Church, which was from other reasons the subject of attack, and hardly bestead, from the
great power of the heretics. With my advice and earnest encouragement on the point, he
set out from the place with me into Pontus, and presided over the abodes of contemplation
there. He himself too founded one4447 worthy of mention, as he welcomed the desert to-

gether with Elijah and John,4448 those professors of austerity; thinking this to be more
profitable for him than to form any design in reference to the present juncture unworthy
of his philosophy, and to ruin in a time of storm the straight course which he was making,
where the surges of disputation were lulled to a calm. Yet wonderfully philosophic though
his retirement was, we shall find his return still more wonderful. For thus it was.</p>
<p>30. While we were thus engaged, there suddenly arose a cloud full of hail, with destructive
roar, overwhelming every Church upon which it burst and seized: an Emperor,4449
most fond of gold and most hostile to Christ, infected with these two most serious diseases,
insatiate avarice and blasphemy; a persecutor in succession to the persecutor, and, in succession
to the apostate, not indeed an apostate, though no better to Christians, or rather, to
the more devout and pure party of Christians, who worship the Trinity, which I call the
only true devotion and saving doctrine. For we do not measure out the Godhead into portions,
nor banish from Itself by unnatural estrangements the one and unapproachable
Nature; nor cure one evil by another, destroying the godless confusion of Sabellius by a
more impious severance and division; which was the error of Arius, whose name declares
his madness,4450 the disturber and destroyer of a great part of the Church. For he did not
honour the Father, by dishonouring His offspring with his unequal degrees of Godhead.
But we recognize one glory4451 of the Father, the equality of the Only-begotten; and one
glory of the Son, that of the Spirit. And we hold that, to subordinate any of the Three, is to
destroy the whole. For we worship and acknowledge Them as Three in their properties,4452
but One in their Godhead. He however had no such idea, being unable to look up, but being
debased by those who led him, he dared to debase along with himself even the Nature of
the Godhead, and became a wicked creature reducing Majesty to bondage, and aligning
with creation the uncreated and timeless Nature.</p>
<p>31. Such was his mind, and with such impiety he took the field against us. For we must
consider it to be nothing else than a barbaric inroad which, instead of destroying walls, cities
and houses, and other things of little worth, made with hands and capable of restoration,

spent its ravages upon men’s souls. A worthy army joined in his assault, the evil rulers of
the Churches, the bitter governors of his world-wide Empire. Some of the Churches they
now held, some they were assaulting, others they hoped to gain by the already exercised
influence of the Emperor, and the violence which he threatened. But in their purpose of
perverting our own, their confidence was specially based on the smallness of mind of those
whom I have mentioned, the inexperience of our prelate, and the infirmities which prevailed
among us. The struggle would be fierce: the zeal of numerous troops was far from ignoble,
but their array was weak, from the want of a leader and strategist to contend for them with
the might of the Word and of the Spirit. What then did this noble and magnanimous and
truly Christ-loving soul? No need of many words to urge his presence and aid. At once
when he saw me on my mission, for the struggle on behalf of the faith was common to us
both, he yielded to my entreaty; and decided by a most excellent distinction, based on spiritual
reasons, that the time for punctiliousness (if indeed we may give way to such feelings
at all) is a time of security, but that forbearance is required in the hour of necessity. He
immediately returned with me from Pontus, and as a zealous volunteer took his place in
the fight for the endangered truth, and devoted himself to the service of his mother, the
Church.</p>
<p>32. Did then his actual efforts fall short of his preliminary zeal? Were they directed by
courage, but not by prudence, or by skill, while he shrank from danger? Or, in spite of their
unexampled perfection on all these points, was there left in him some trace of irritation?
Far from it. He was at once completely reconciled, and took part in every plan and effort.
He removed all the thorns and stumbling blocks which were in our way, upon which the
enemy relied in their attack upon us. He took hold of one, grasped another, thrust away a
third. He became to some a stout wall and rampart,4453 to others an axe breaking the rock
in pieces,4454 or a fire among the thorns,4455 as the divine Scripture says, easily destroying
those fagots who were insulting the Godhead. And if his Barnabas, who speaks and records
these things, was of service to Paul in the struggle, it is to Paul that thanks are due, for
choosing and making him his comrade in the strife.</p>
<p>33. Thus the enemy failed, and, base men as they were, for the first time were then
basely put to shame and worsted, learning not to be ready to despise the Cappadocians, of
all men in the world, whose special qualities are firmness in the faith, and loyal devotion to
the Trinity; to Whom is due their unity and strength, and from Whom they receive an even
greater and stronger assistance than they are able to give. Basil’s next business and purpose
was to conciliate the prelate, to allay suspicion, to persuade all men that the irritation which

<pb n="804"/>
had been felt was due to the temptation and effort of the Evil one, in his envy of virtuous
concord: carefully complying with the laws of obedience and spiritual order. Accordingly
he visited him, with instruction and advice. While obedient to his wishes, he was everything
to him, a good counsellor, a skilful assistant, an expounder of the Divine Will, a guide of
conduct, a staff for his old age, a support of the faith, most trusty of those within, most
practical of those without, in a word, as much inclined to goodwill, as he had been thought
to hostility. And so the power of the Church came into his hands almost, if not quite, to an
equal degree with the occupant of the see. For in return for his good-will, he was requited
with authority. And their harmony and combination of power was wonderful. The one
was the leader of the people, the other of their leader, like a lion-keeper, skilfully soothing
the possessor of power. For, having been recently installed in the see, and still somewhat
under the influence of the world, and not yet furnished with the things of the Spirit, in the
midst of the eddying tide of enemies assaulting the Church, he was in need of some one to
take him by the hand and support him. Accordingly he accepted the alliance, and imagined
himself the conqueror of one who had conquered him.</p>
<p>34. Of his care for and protection of the Church, there are many other tokens; his
boldness towards the governors and other most powerful men in the city: the decisions of
disputes, accepted without hesitation, and made effective by his simple word, his inclination
being held to be decisive: his support of the needy, most of them in spiritual, not a few also
in physical distress: for this also often influences the soul and reduces it to subjection by
its kindness; the support of the poor, the entertainment of strangers, the care of maidens;
legislation4456 written and unwritten for the monastic life: arrangements of prayers,4457
adornments of the sanctuary, and other ways in which the true man of God, working for
God, would benefit the people: one being especially important and noteworthy. There was
a famine, the most severe one ever recorded. The city was in distress, and there was no
source of assistance, or relief for the calamity. For maritime cities are able to bear such
times of need without difficulty, by an exchange of their own products for what is imported:
but an inland city like ours can neither turn its superfluity to profit, nor supply its need, by
either disposing of what we have, or importing what we have not: but the hardest part of
all such distress is, the insensibility and insatiability of those who possess supplies. For they
watch their opportunities, and turn the distress to profit, and thrive upon misfortune:
heeding not that he who shows mercy to the poor, lendeth to the Lord,4458 nor that he that
withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him:4459 nor any other of the promises to the

philanthropic, and threats against the inhuman. But they are too insatiate, in their ill-judged
policy; for while they shut up their bowels against their fellows, they shut up those of God
against themselves, forgetting that their need of Him is greater than others’ need of them.
Such are the buyers and sellers of corn, who neither respect their fellows, nor are thankful
to God, from Whom comes what they have, while others are straitened.</p>
<p>35. He indeed could neither rain bread from heaven by prayer,4460 to nourish an escaped
people in the wilderness,4461 nor supply fountains of food without cost from the depth of
vessels which are filled by being emptied,4462 and so, by an amazing return for her hospitality,
support one who supported him; nor feed thousands of men with five loaves whose very
fragments were a further supply for many tables.4463 These were the works of Moses and
Elijah, and my God, from Whom they too derived their power. Perhaps also they were
characteristic of their time and its circumstances: since signs are for unbelievers not for
those who believe.4464 But he did devise and execute with the same faith things which correspond
to them, and tend in the same direction. For by his word and advice he opened
the stores of those who possessed them, and so, according to the Scripture dealt food to the
hungry,4465 and satisfied the poor with bread,4466 and fed them in the time of dearth,4467
and filled the hungry souls with good things.4468 And in what way? for this is no slight addition
to his praise. He gathered together the victims of the famine with some who were
but slightly recovering from it, men and women, infants, old men, every age which was in
distress, and obtaining contributions of all sorts of food which can relieve famine, set before
them basins of soup and such meat as was found preserved among us, on which the poor
live. Then, imitating the ministry of Christ, Who, girded with a towel, did not disdain to
wash the disciples’ feet, using for this purpose the aid of his own servants, and also of his
fellow servants, he attended to the bodies and souls of those who needed it, combining
personal respect with the supply of their necessity, and so giving them a double relief.</p>
<p>36. Such was our young furnisher of corn, and second Joseph: though of him we can
say somewhat more. For the one made a gain from the famine, and bought up Egypt4469

in his philanthropy, by managing the time of plenty with a view to the time of famine,
turning to account the dreams of others for that purpose. But the other’s services were
gratuitous, and his succour of the famine gained no profit, having only one object, to win
kindly feelings by kindly treatment, and to gain by his rations of corn the heavenly blessings.
Further he provided the nourishment of the Word, and that more perfect bounty and distribution,
which is really heavenly and from on high—if the word be that bread of angels,4470
wherewith souls are fed and given to drink, who are a hungered for God,4471 and seek for
a food which does not pass away or fail, but abides forever. This food he, who was the
poorest and most needy man whom I have known, supplied in rich abundance to the relief
not of a famine of bread, nor of a thirst for water, but a longing for that Word4472 which is
really lifegiving and nourishing, and causes to grow to spiritual manhood him who is duly
fed thereon.</p>
<p>37. After these and similar actions—why need I stay to mention them all?—when the
prelate whose name4473 betokened his godliness had passed away, having sweetly breathed
his last in Basil’s arms, he was raised to the lofty throne of a Bishop, not without difficulty
or without the envious struggles of the prelates of his native land, on whose side were found
the greatest scoundrels of the city. But the Holy Spirit must needs win the day—and indeed
the victory was decisive. For He brought from a distance, to anoint him, men4474 illustrious
and zealous for godliness, and with them the new Abraham, our Patriarch, I mean my
father, in regard to whom an extraordinary thing happened. For, failing as he was from the
number of his years, and worn away almost to his last breath by disease, he ventured on the
journey to give assistance by his vote, relying on the aid of the Spirit. In brief, he was placed
in his litter, as a corpse is laid in its tomb, to return in the freshness and strength of youth,
with head erect, having been strengthened by the imposition of hands and unction, and, it
is not too much to say by the head of him who was anointed. This must be added to the
instances of old time, which prove that labour bestows health, zealous purpose raises the
dead, and old age leaps up when anointed by the Spirit.</p>
<p>38. Having thus been deemed worthy of the office of prelate, as it is seemly that men
should who have lived such a life, and won such favour and consideration, he did not disgrace,
by his subsequent conduct, either his own philosophy, or the hopes of those who had trusted
him. But he ever so far surpassed himself as he has been shown hitherto to have surpassed
others, his ideas on this point being most excellent and philosophic. For he held that, while

it is virtuous in a private individual to avoid vice, and be to some extent good, it is a vice in
a chief and ruler, especially in such an office, to fail to surpass by far the majority of men,
and by constant progress to make his virtue correspond to his dignity and throne: for it is
difficult for one in high position to attain the mean, and by his eminence in virtue raise up
his people to the golden mean. Or rather to treat this question more satisfactorily, I think
that the result is the same as I see in the case of our Saviour, and of every specially wise man,
I fancy, when He was with us in that form which surpassed us and yet is ours. For He also,
the gospel says, increased in wisdom and favour, as well as in stature,4475 not that these
qualities in Him were capable of growth: for how could that which was perfect from the
first become more perfect, but that they were gradually disclosed and displayed? So I think
that the virtue of Basil, without being itself increased, obtained at this time a wider exercise,
since his power provided him with more abundant material.</p>
<p>39. He first of all made it plain that his office had been bestowed upon him, not by human
favour, but by the gift of God. This will also be shown by my conduct. For in what
philosophic research did he not, about that time, join with me? So every one thought that
I should run to meet him after what had happened, and show my delight at it (as would,
perhaps, have been the case with any one else) and claim a share in his authority, rather
than rule beside him, according to the inferences they drew from our friendship. But, in
my exceeding anxiety to avoid the annoyance and jealousy of the time, and specially since
his position was still a painful and troubled one, I remained at home, and forcibly restrained
my eager desire, while, though he blamed me, Basil accepted my excuse. And when, on my
subsequent arrival, I refused, for the same reason the honour of this chair, and a dignified
position4476 among the Presbyters, he kindly refrained from blaming, nay he praised me,
preferring to be charged with pride by a small clique, in their ignorance of our policy, rather
than do anything contrary to reason and his own resolutions. And indeed, how could a
man have better shown his soul to be superior to all fawning and flattery, and his single
object to be the law of right, than by thus treating me, whom he acknowledged as among
the first of his friends and associates?</p>
<p>40. His next task was to appease, and allay by magnanimous treatment, the opposition
to himself: and that without any trace of flattery or servility, but in a most chivalrous and
magnanimous way; with a view, not merely to present exigencies, but also to the fostering
of future obedience. For, seeing that, while tenderness leads to laxity and slackness, severity

<pb n="808"/>
gives rise to stubbornness and self-will, he was able to avoid the dangers of each course by
a combination of both, blending his correction with consideration, and gentleness with
firmness, influencing men in most cases principally by his conduct rather than by argument:
not enslaving them by art, but winning them by good nature, and attracting them by the
sparing use, rather than by the constant exercise, of his power. And, most important of all,
they were brought to recognize the superiority of his intellect and the inaccessibility of his
virtue, to consider their only safety to consist in being on his side and under his command,
their sole danger to be in opposition to him, and to think that to differ from him involved
estrangement from God. Thus they willingly yielded and surrendered, submitting themselves,
as if in a thunder-clap, and hastening to anticipate each other with their excuses, and exchange
the intensity of their hostility for an equal intensity of goodwill, and advance in virtue,
which they found to be the one really effective defence. The few exceptions to this conduct
were passed by and neglected, because their ill-nature was incurable, and they expended
their powers in wearing out themselves, as rust consumes itself together with the iron on
which it feeds.</p>
<p>41. Affairs at home being now settled to his mind, in a way that faithless men who did
not know him would have thought impossible, his designs became greater and took a loftier
range. For, while all others had their eyes on the ground before them, and directed attention
to their own immediate concerns, and, if these were safe, troubled themselves no further,
being incapable of any great and chivalrous design or undertaking; he, moderate as he was
in all other respects, could not be moderate in this, but with head erect, casting his mental
eye about him, took in the whole world over which the word of salvation has made its way.
And when he saw the great heritage of God, purchased by His own words and laws and
sufferings, the holy nation, the royal priesthood,4477 in such evil plight that it was torn
asunder into ten thousand opinions and errors: and the vine brought out of Egypt and
transplanted,4478 the Egypt of impious and dark ignorance, which had grown to such beauty
and boundless size that the whole earth was covered with the shadow of it, while it overtopped
mountains and cedars, now being ravaged by that wicked wild boar, the devil, he could not
content himself with quietly lamenting the misfortune, and merely lifting up his hands to
God, and seeking from Him the dispersion of the pressing misfortunes, while he himself
was asleep, but felt bound to come to her aid at some expense to himself.</p>
<p>42. For what could be more distressing than this calamity, or call more loudly on one
whose eyes were raised aloft for exertions on behalf of the common weal? The good or ill
success of an individual is of no consequence to the community, but that of the community
involves of necessity the like condition of the individual. With this idea and purpose, he
<note type="footnote">4477 1 Pet. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">4478 Ps. lxxx. 9.</note>

<pb n="809"/>
who was the guardian and patron of the community (and, as Solomon says with truth, a
perceptive heart is a moth to the bones,4479 unsensitiveness is cheerily confident, while a
sympathetic disposition is a source of pain, and constant consideration wastes away the
heart), he, I say, was consequently in agony and distress from many wounds; like Jonah and
David, he wished in himself to die4480 and gave not sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his
eyelids,4481 he expended what was left of his flesh upon his reflections, until he discovered
a remedy for the evil: and sought for aid from God and man, to stay the general conflagration,
and dissipate the gloom which was lowering over us.</p>
<p>43. One of his devices was of the greatest service. After a period of such recollection
as was possible, and private spiritual conference, in which, after considering all human arguments,
and penetrating into all the deep things of the Scriptures, he drew up a sketch of
pious doctrine, and by wrestling with and attacking their opposition he beat off the daring
assaults of the heretics: overthrowing in hand to hand struggles by word of mouth those
who came to close quarters, and striking those at a distance by arrows winged with ink,
which is in no wise inferior to inscriptions on tablets; not giving directions for one small
nation only like that of the Jews, concerning meats and drinks, temporary sacrifices, and
purifications of the flesh;4482 but for every nation and part of the world, concerning the
Word of truth, the source of our salvation. Again, since unreasoning action and unpractical
reasoning are alike ineffectual, he added to his reasoning the succour which comes from
action; he paid visits, sent messages, gave interviews, instructed, reproved, rebuked,4483
threatened, reproached, undertook the defence of nations, cities and individuals, devising
every kind of succour, and procuring from every source specifics for disease: a second
Bezaleel, an architect of the Divine tabernacle,4484 applying every material and art to the
work, and combining all in a harmonious and surpassing beauty.</p>
<p>44. Why need I enter into further detail? We were assailed again by the Anti-Christian
Emperor,4485 that tyrant of the faith, with more abundant impiety and a hotter onset, inasmuch
as the dispute must be with a stronger antagonist, like that unclean and evil spirit,
who when sent forth upon his wanderings from man, returns to take up his abode in him
again with a greater number of spirits, as we have heard in the Gospels.4486 This spirit he

imitated, both in renewing the contest in which he had formerly been worsted, and in adding
to his original efforts. He thought that it was a strange and insufferable thing that he, who
ruled over so many nations and had won so much renown, and reduced under the power
of impiety all those round about him, and overcome every adversary, should be publicly
worsted by a single man, and a single city, and so incur the ridicule not only of those patrons
of ungodliness by whom he was led, but also, as he supposed, of all men.</p>
<p>45. It is said that the King4487 of Persia, on his expedition into Greece, was not only
urged to immoderate threats, by elation at the numbers of every race of men which in his
wrath and pride he was leading against them: but thought to terrify them the more, by
making them afraid of him, in consequence of his novel treatment of the elements. A strange
land and sea were heard of, the work of the new creator; and an army which sailed over the
dry land, and marched over the ocean, while islands were carried off, and the sea was
scourged, and all the other mad proceedings of that army and expedition, which, though
they struck terror into the ignoble, were ridiculous in the eyes of men of brave and steadfast
hearts. There was no need of anything of this kind in the expedition against us, but what
was still worse and more harmful, this was what the Emperor was reported to say and do.
He stretched forth his mouth unto heaven, speaking blasphemy against the most High, and
his tongue went through the world.4488 Excellently did the inspired David before our days
thus describe him who made heaven to stoop to earth, and reckoned with the creation that
supermundane nature, which the creation cannot even contain, even though in kindness
to man it did to some extent come among us, in order to draw to itself us who were lying
upon the ground.</p>
<p>46. Furious indeed were his first acts of wantonness, more furious still his final efforts
against us. What shall I speak of first? Exiles, banishments, confiscations, open and secret
plots, persuasion, where time allowed, violence, where persuasion was impossible. Those
who clung to the orthodox faith, as we did, were extruded from their churches; others were
intruded, who agreed with the Imperial soul-destroying doctrines, and begged for testimonials
of impiety, and subscribed to statements still harder than these. Burnings4489 of
Presbyters at sea, impious generals, not those who conquered the Persians, or subdued the
Scythians, or reduced any other barbaric nation, but those who assailed churches, and danced
in triumph upon altars, and defiled the unbloody sacrifices with the blood of man and victims,
and offered insult to the modesty of virgins. With what object? The extrusion of the Patriarch

<pb n="811"/>
Jacob,4490 and the intrusion in his place of Esau, who was hated,4491 even before his birth.
This is the description of his first acts of wantonness, the mere recollection and mention of
which even now, rouses the tears of most of us.</p>
<p>47. Accordingly, when, after passing through all quarters, he made his attack in order
to enslave this impregnable and formidable mother of the Churches, the only still remaining
unquenched spark of the truth, he discovered that he had been for the first time ill advised.
For he was driven back like a missile which strikes upon some stronger body, and recoiled
like a broken hawser. Such was the prelate of the Church that he met with, such was the
bulwark by which his efforts were broken and dissipated. Other particulars may be heard
from those who tell and recount them, from their own experience—and none of those who
recount them is destitute of this full experience. But all must be filled with admiration who
are aware of the struggles of that time, the assaults, the promises, the threats, the commissioners
sent before him to try to prevail upon us, men of judicial and military rank, men
from the harem, who are men among women, women among men, whose only manliness
consisted in their impiety, and being incapable of natural licentiousness, commit fornication
in the only way they can, with their tongues; the chief cook Nebuzaradan,4492 who threatened
us with the weapons of his art, and was despatched by his own fire. But what especially excites
my wonder, and what I could not, even if I would, pass by, I will describe as concisely as
possible.</p>
<p>48. Who has not heard of the prefect4493 of those days, who, for his own part, treated
us with such excessive arrogance, having himself been admitted, or perhaps committed, to
baptism by the other party; and strove by exceeding the letter of his instructions, and gratifying
his master in every particular, to guarantee and preserve his own possession of power.
Though he raged against the Church, and assumed a lion-like aspect, and roared like a lion
till most men dared not approach him, yet our noble prelate was brought into or rather
entered his court, as if bidden to a feast, instead of to a trial. How can I fully describe, either
the arrogance of the prefect or the prudence with which it was met by the Saint. “What is
the meaning, Sir Basil,” he said, addressing him by name, and not as yet deigning to term
him Bishop, “of your daring, as no other dares, to resist and oppose so great a potentate?”
“In what respect?” said our noble champion, “and in what does my rashness consist? For
this I have yet to learn.” “In refusing to respect the religion of your Sovereign, when all
others have yielded and submitted themselves?” “Because,” said he, “this is not the will of
my real Sovereign; nor can I, who am the creature of God, and bidden myself to be God,
<note type="footnote">4490 Jacob, i.e., Athanasius. Esau = George.</note>

<note type="footnote">4492 Nebuzaradan. Demosthenes, a creature of Valens, sent to persuade Basil to yield to the Emperor.</note>

<pb n="812"/>
submit to worship any creature.” “And what do we,” said the prefect, “seem to you to be?
Are we, who give you this injunction, nothing at all? What do you say to this? Is it not a
great thing to be ranged with us as your associates?” “You are, I will not deny it,” said he,
“a prefect, and an illustrious one, yet not of more honour than God. And to be associated
with you is a great thing, certainly; for you are yourself the creature of God; but so it is to
be associated with any other of my subjects. For faith, and not personal importance, is the
distinctive mark of Christianity.”</p>
<p>49. Then indeed the prefect became excited, and rose from his seat, boiling with rage,
and making use of harsher language. “What?” said he, “have you no fear of my authority?
“Fear of what?” said Basil, “How could it affect me?” “Of what? Of any one of the resources
of my power.” “What are these?” said Basil, “pray, inform me.” “Confiscation, banishment,
torture, death.” “Have you no other threat?” said he, “for none of these can reach me.”
“How indeed is that?” said the prefect. “Because,” he replied, “a man who has nothing, is
beyond the reach of confiscation; unless you demand my tattered rags, and the few books,
which are my only possessions. Banishment is impossible for me, who am confined by no
limit of place, counting my own neither the land where I now dwell, nor all of that into
which I may be hurled; or, rather, counting it all God’s, whose guest and dependent I am.
As for tortures, what hold can they have upon one whose body has ceased to be? Unless
you mean the first stroke, for this alone is in your power. Death is my benefactor, for it will
send me the sooner to God, for Whom I live, and exist, and have all but died, and to Whom
I have long been hastening.”</p>
<p>50. Amazed at this language, the prefect said, “No one has ever yet spoken thus, and
with such boldness, to Modestus.” “Why, perhaps,” said Basil, “you have not met with a
Bishop, or in his defence of such interests he would have used precisely the same language.
For we are modest in general, and submissive to every one, according to the precept of our
law. We may not treat with haughtiness even any ordinary person, to say nothing of so
great a potentate. But where the interests of God are at stake, we care for nothing else, and
make these our sole object. Fire and sword and wild beasts, and rakes which tear the flesh,
we revel in, and fear them not. You may further insult and threaten us, and do whatever
you will, to the full extent of your power. The Emperor himself may hear this—that neither
by violence nor persuasion will you bring us to make common cause with impiety, not even
though your threats become still more terrible.”</p>
<p>51. At the close of this colloquy, the prefect, having been convinced by the attitude of
Basil, that he was absolutely impervious to threats and influence, dismissed him from the
court, his former threatening manner being replaced by somewhat of respect and deference.
He himself with all speed obtained an audience of the Emperor, and said: “We have been
worsted, Sire, by the prelate of this Church. He is superior to threats, invincible in argument,
uninfluenced by persuasion. We must make trial of some more feeble character; and in this

<pb n="813"/>
case resort to open violence, or submit to the disregard of our threatenings.” Hereupon the
Emperor, forced by the praises of Basil to condemn his own conduct (for even an enemy
can admire a man’s excellence), would not allow violence to be used against him: and, like
iron, which is softened by fire, yet still remains iron, though turned from threatening to
admiration, would not enter into communion with him, being prevented by shame from
changing his course, but sought to justify his conduct by the most plausible excuse he could,
as the sequel will show.</p>
<p>52. For he entered the Church attended by the whole of his train; it was the festival of
the Epiphany, and the Church was crowded, and, by taking his place among the people, he
made a profession of unity. The occurrence is not to be lightly passed over. Upon his entrance
he was struck by the thundering roll of the Psalms, by the sea of heads of the congregation,
and by the angelic rather than human order which pervaded the sanctuary and its
precincts: while Basil presided over his people, standing erect, as the Scripture says of
Samuel,4494 with body and eyes and mind undisturbed, as if nothing new had happened,
but fixed upon God and the sanctuary, as if, so to say, he had been a statue, while his ministers
stood around him in fear and reverence. At this sight, and it was indeed a sight unparalleled,
overcome by human weakness, his eyes were affected with dimness and giddiness, his mind
with dread. This was as yet unnoticed by most people. But when he had to offer the gifts
at the Table of God, which he must needs do himself, since no one would, as usual, assist
him, because it was uncertain whether Basil would admit him, his feelings were revealed.
For he was staggering, and had not some one in the sanctuary reached out a hand to steady
his tottering steps, he would have sunk to the ground in a lamentable fall. So much for this.</p>
<p>53. As for the wisdom of his conference with the Emperor, who, in his quasi-communion
with us entered within the veil to see and speak to him, as he had long desired to do, what
else can I say but that they were inspired words, which were heard by the courtiers and by
us who had entered with them? This was the beginning and first establishment of the Emperor’s
kindly feeling towards us; the impression produced by this reception put an end to
the greater part of the persecution which assailed us like a river.</p>
<p>54. Another incident is not of less importance than those I have mentioned. The wicked
were victorious, and the decree for his banishment was signed, to the full satisfaction of
those who furthered it. The night had come, the chariot was ready, our haters were exultant,
the pious in despair, we surrounded the zealous traveller, to whose honourable disgrace
nothing was wanting. What next? It was undone by God. For He Who smote the firstborn
of Egypt,4495 for its harshness towards Israel, also struck the son of the Emperor with
disease. How great was the speed! There was the sentence of banishment, here the decree
<note type="footnote">4494 1 Sam. xix. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">4495 Exod. xii. 29.</note>

<pb n="814"/>
of sickness: the hand of the wicked scribe was restrained, and the saint was preserved, and
the man of piety presented to us, by the fever which brought to reason the arrogance of the
Emperor. What could be more just or more speedy than this? This was the series of events:
the Emperor’s child was sick and in bodily pain. The father was pained for it, for what can
the father do? On all sides he sought for aid in his distress, he summoned the best physicians,
he betook himself to intercessions with the greatest fervour, and flung himself upon the
ground. Affliction humbles even emperors, and no wonder, for the like sufferings of David
in the case of his child are recorded for us.4496 But as no cure for the evil could anywhere
be found, he applied to the faith of Basil, not personally summoning him, in shame for his
recent ill treatment, but entrusting the mission to others of his nearest and dearest friends.
On his arrival, without the delay or reluctance which any one else might have shown, at
once the disease relaxed, and the father cherished better hopes; and had he not blended salt
water with the fresh, by trusting to the heterodox at the same time that he summoned Basil,
the child would have recovered his health and been preserved for his father’s arms. This
indeed was the conviction of those who were present at the time, and shared in the distress.</p>
<p>55. The same mischance is said to have befallen the prefect. He also was obliged by
sickness to bow beneath the hands of the Saint, and, in reality, to men of sense a visitation
brings instruction, and affliction is often better than prosperity. He fell sick, was in tears,
and in pain, he sent for Basil, and entreated him, crying out, “I own that you were in the
right; only save me!” His request was granted, as he himself acknowledged, and convinced
many who had known nothing of it; for he never ceased to wonder at and describe the
powers of the prelate. Such was his conduct in these cases, such its result. Did he then treat
others in a different way, and engage in petty disputes about trifles, or fail to rise to the
heights of philosophy in a course of action which merits no praise and is best passed over
in silence? By no means. He who once stirred up the wicked Hadad against Israel,4497
stirred up against him the prefect4498 of the province of Pontus; nominally, from annoyance
connected with some poor creature of a woman, but in reality as a part of the struggle of
impiety against the truth. I pass by all his other insults against Basil, or, for it is the same
thing, against God; for it is against Him and on His behalf that the contest was waged. One
instance of it, however, which brought special disgrace upon the assailant, and exalted his
adversary, if philosophy and eminence for it be a great and lofty thing, I will describe at
length.</p>
<p>56. The assessor of a judge was attempting to force into a distasteful marriage a lady of
high birth whose husband was but recently dead. At a loss to escape from this high-handed

treatment, she resorted to a device no less prudent than daring. She fled to the holy table,
and placed herself under the protection of God against outrage. What, in the Name of the
Trinity Itself, if I may introduce into my panegyric somewhat of the forensic style, ought to
have been done, I do not say, by the great Basil, who laid down the law for us all in such
matters, but by any one who, though far inferior to him, was a priest? Ought he not to have
allowed her claim, to have taken charge of, and cared for, her; to have raised his hand in
defence of the kindness of God and the law which gives honour to the altar? Ought he not
to have been willing to do and suffer anything, rather than take part in any inhuman design
against her, and outrage at once the holy table, and the faith in which she had taken sanctuary?
No! said the baffled judge, all ought to yield to my authority, and Christians should
betray their own laws. The suppliant whom he demanded, was at all hazards retained. Accordingly,
in his rage, he at last sent some of the magistrates to search the saint’s bedchamber,
with the purpose of dishonouring him, rather than from any necessity. What! Search the
house of a man so free from passion, whom the angels revere, at whom women do not
venture even to look? And, not content with this, he summoned him, and put him on his
defence; and that, in no gentle or kindly manner, but as if he were a convict. Upon Basil’s
appearance, standing, like my Jesus, before the judgment seat of Pilate, he presided at the
trial, full of wrath and pride. Yet the thunderbolts did not fall, and the sword of God still
glittered, and waited, while His bow, though bent, was restrained. Such indeed is the custom
of God.</p>
<p>57. Consider another struggle between our champion and his persecutor. His ragged
pallium having been ordered to be torn away, “I will also, if you wish it, strip off my coat,”
said he. His fleshless form was threatened with blows, and he offered to submit to be torn
with combs, and he said, “By such laceration you will cure my liver, which, as you see, is
wearing me away.” Such was their argument. But when the city perceived the outrage and
the common danger of all—for each one considered this insolence a danger to himself, it
became all on fire with rage; and, like a hive roused by smoke, one after another was stirred
and arose, every race and every age, but especially the men from the small-arms factory and
from the imperial weaving-sheds. For men at work in these trades are specially hot-tempered
and daring, because of the liberty allowed them. Each man was armed with the tool he was
using, or with whatever else came to hand at the moment. Torch in hand, amid showers of
stones, with cudgel’s ready, all ran and shouted together in their united zeal. Anger makes
a terrible soldier or general. Nor were the women weaponless, when roused by such an occasion.
Their pins were their spears, and no longer remaining women, they were by the
strength of their eagerness endowed with masculine courage. It is a short story. They
thought that they would share among themselves the piety of destroying him, and held him
to be most pious who first laid hands on one who had dared such deeds. What then was
the conduct of this haughty and daring judge? He begged for mercy in a pitiable state of

<pb n="816"/>
distress, cringing before them to an unparalleled extent, until the arrival of the martyr
without bloodshed, who had won his crown without blows, and now restrained the people
by the force of his personal influence, and delivered the man who had insulted him and now
sought his protection. This was the doing of the God of Saints, Who worketh and changeth
all things for the best, who resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.4499 And
why should not He, Who divided the sea and stayed the river, and ruled the elements, and
by stretching out set up a trophy, to save His exiled people, why should not He have also
rescued this man from his perils?</p>
<p>58. This was the end and fortunate close, in the Providence of God, of the war with the
world, a close worthy of his faith. But here at once is the beginning of the war with the
Bishops, and their allies, which involved great disgrace, and still greater injury to their subjects.
For who could persuade others to be temperate, when such was the conduct of their
prelates? For a long time they had been unkindly disposed towards him, on three grounds.
They neither agreed with him in the matter of the faith, except in so far as they were absolutely
obliged to yield to the majority of the faithful. Nor had they altogether laid aside the
grudge they owed him for his election. And, what was most grievous of all to them, though
they would have been most ashamed to own it—he so far outshone them in reputation.
There was also a further cause of dissension which stirred up again the others. When our
country had been divided into two provinces and metropolitical sees, and a great part of
the former was being added to the new one, this again roused their factious spirit. The
one4500 thought it right that the ecclesiastical boundaries should be settled by the civil ones:
and therefore claimed those newly added, as belonging to him, and severed from their former
metropolitan. The other4501 clung to the ancient custom, and to the division which had
come down from our fathers. Many painful results either actually followed, or were struggling
in the womb of the future. Synods were wrongfully gathered by the new metropolitan, and
revenues seized upon. Some of the presbyters of the churches refused obedience, others
were won over. In consequence the affairs of the churches fell into a sad state of dissension
and division. Novelty indeed has a certain charm for men, and they readily turn events to
their own advantage, and it is easier to overthrow something which is already established,
than to restore it when overthrown. What however enraged him most was, that the revenues4502
of the Taurus, which passed along before his eyes, accrued to his rival, as also the
offerings at Saint Orestes’,4503 of which he was greatly desirous to reap the fruits. He even

<pb n="817"/>
went so far as, on one occasion when Basil was riding along his own road, to seize his mules
by the bridle and bar the passage with a robber band. And with how specious a pretext, the
care of his spiritual children and of the souls entrusted to him, and the defence of the
faith—pretexts which veiled that most common vice, insatiable avarice—and further, the
wrongfulness of paying dues to heretics, a heretic being any one who had displeased him.</p>
<p>59. The holy man of God however, metropolitan as he was of the true Jerusalem above,
was neither carried away with the failure of those who fell, nor allowed himself to overlook
this conduct, nor did he desire any inadequate remedy for the evil. Let us see how great and
wonderful it was, or, I would say, how worthy of his soul. He made of the dissension a cause
of increase to the Church, and the disaster, under his most able management, resulted in
the multiplication of the Bishops of the country. From this ensued three most desirable
consequences; a greater care for souls, the management by each city of its own affairs, and
the cessation of the war in this quarter. I am afraid that I myself was treated as an appendage
to this scheme. By no other term can I readily describe the position. Greatly as I admire
his whole conduct, to an extent indeed beyond my powers of expression, of this single particular
I find it impossible to approve, for I will acknowledge my feelings in regard to it,
though these are from other sources not unknown to most of you. I mean the change and
faithlessness of his treatment of myself, a cause of pain which even time has not obliterated.
For this is the source of all the inconsistency and tangle of my life; it has robbed me of the
practice, or at least the reputation, of philosophy; of small moment though the latter be.
The defence, which you will perhaps allow me to make for him, is this; his ideas were superhuman,
and having, before his death, become superior to worldly influences, his only interests
were those of the Spirit: while his regard for friendship was in no wise lessened by his
readiness then, and then only, to disregard its claims, when they were in conflict with his
paramount duty to God, and when the end he had in view was of greater importance than
the interests he was compelled to set aside.</p>
<p>60. I am afraid that, in avoiding the imputation of indifference at the hands of those
who desire to know all that can be said about him, I shall incur a charge of prolixity from
those whose ideal is the golden mean. For the latter Basil himself had the greatest respect,
being specially devoted to the adage “In all things the mean4504 is the best,” and acting upon
it throughout his life. Nevertheless, disregarding alike those who desire undue conciseness
or excessive prolixity, I proceed thus with my speech. Different men attain success in different
ways, some applying themselves to one alone of the many forms of excellence, but no
one, of those hitherto known to me, arriving at the highest eminence in all respects; he being
in my opinion the best, who has won his laurels on the widest field, or gained the highest
possible renown in some single particular. Such however was the height of Basil’s fame,
<note type="footnote">4504 The mean, etc. A saying of Cleobulus, one of the seven Sages.</note>

<pb n="818"/>
that he became the pride of human kind. Let us consider the matter thus. Is any one devoted
to poverty and a life devoid of property, and free from superfluity? What did he possess
besides his body, and the necessary coverings of the flesh? His wealth was the having
nothing, and he thought the cross, with which he lived, more precious than great riches.
For no one, however much he may wish, can obtain possession of all things, but any one
can learn to despise, and so prove himself superior to, all things. Such being his mind, and
such his life, he had no need of an altar and of vainglory, nor of such a public announcement
as “Crates4505 sets Crates the Theban free.” For his aim was ever to be, not to seem, most
excellent. Nor did he dwell in a tub,4506 and in the midst of the market-place, and so by
luxuriating in publicity turn his poverty into riches: but was poor and unkempt, yet without
ostentation: and taking cheerfully the casting overboard of all that he ever had, sailed lightly
across the sea of life.</p>
<p>61. A wondrous thing is temperance, and fewness of wants, and freedom from the
dominion of pleasures, and from the bondage of that cruel and degrading mistress, the
belly. Who was so independent of food, and, without exaggeration, more free from the
flesh? For he flung away all satiety and surfeit to creatures destitute of reason, whose life is
slavish and debasing. He paid little attention to such things as, next to the appetite, are of
equal rank, but, as far as possible, lived on the merest necessaries, his only luxury being to
prove himself not luxurious, and not, in consequence, to have greater needs: but he looked
to the lilies and the birds,4507 whose beauty is artless, and their food casual, according to
the important advice of my Christ, who made Himself poor4508 in the flesh for our sakes,
that we might enjoy the riches of His Godhead. Hence came his single coat and well worn
cloak, and his bed on the bare ground, his vigils, his unwashedness (such were his decorations)
and his most sweet food and relish, bread, and salt, his new dainty, and the sober and
plentiful drink, with which fountains supply those who are free from trouble. The result,
or the accompaniment, of these things were the attendance on the sick and practice of
medicine, our common intellectual pursuit. For, though inferior to him in all other respects,
I must needs be his equal in distress.</p>
<p>62. A great thing is virginity, and celibacy, and being ranked with the angels, and with
the single nature; for I shrink from calling it Christ’s, Who, though He willed to be born for
our sakes who are born, by being born of a Virgin, enacted4509 the law of virginity, to lead
us away from this life, and cut short the power of the world, or rather, to transmit one world

to another, the present to the future. Who then paid more honour to virginity, or had more
control of the flesh, not only by his personal example, but in those under his care? Whose
are the convents, and the written regulations, by which he subdued every sense, and regulated
every member, and won to the real practice of virginity, turning inward the view of beauty,
from the visible to the invisible; and by wasting away the external, and withdrawing fuel
from the flame, and revealing the secrets of the heart to God, Who is the only bridegroom
of pure souls, and takes in with himself the watchful souls, if they go to meet him with lamps
burning and a plentiful supply of oil?4510 Moreover he reconciled most excellently and
united the solitary and the community life. These had been in many respects at variance
and dissension, while neither of them was in absolute and unalloyed possession of good or
evil: the one being more calm and settled, tending to union with God, yet not free from
pride, inasmuch as its virtue lies beyond the means of testing or comparison; the other,
which is of more practical service, being not free from the tendency to turbulence. He
founded cells4511 for ascetics and hermits, but at no great distance from his cenobitic communities,
and, instead of distinguishing and separating the one from the other, as if by some
intervening wall, he brought them together and united them, in order that the contemplative
spirit might not be cut off from society, nor the active life be uninfluenced by the contemplative,
but that, like sea and land, by an interchange of their several gifts, they might unite
in promoting the one object, the glory of God.</p>
<p>63. What more? A noble thing is philanthropy, and the support of the poor, and the
assistance of human weakness. Go forth a little way from the city, and behold the new
city,4512 the storehouse of piety, the common treasury of the wealthy, in which the superfluities
of their wealth, aye, and even their necessaries, are stored, in consequence of his exhortations,
freed from the power of the moth,4513 no longer gladdening the eyes of the thief,
and escaping both the emulation of envy, and the corruption of time: where disease is regarded
in a religious light, and disaster is thought a blessing, and sympathy is put to the
test. Why should I compare with this work Thebes4514 of the seen portals, and the Egyptian
Thebes, and the walls of Babylon, and the Carian tomb of Mausolus, and the Pyramids, and
the bronze without weight of the Colossus, or the size and beauty of shrines that are no
more, and all the other objects of men’s wonder, and historic record, from which their

founders gained no advantage, except a slight meed of fame. My subject is the most wonderful
of all, the short road to salvation, the easiest ascent to heaven. There is no longer
before our eyes that terrible and piteous spectacle of men who are living corpses, the greater
part of whose limbs have mortified, driven away from their cities and homes and public
places and fountains, aye, and from their own dearest ones, recognizable by their names
rather than by their features: they are no longer brought before us at our gatherings and
meetings, in our common intercourse and union, no longer the objects of hatred, instead
of pity on account of their disease; composers of piteous songs, if any of them have their
voice still left to them. Why should I try to express in tragic style all our experiences, when
no language can be adequate to their hard lot? He however it was, who took the lead in
pressing upon those who were men, that they ought not to despise their fellowmen, nor to
dishonour Christ, the one Head of all, by their inhuman treatment of them; but to use the
misfortunes of others as an opportunity of firmly establishing their own lot, and to lend to
God that mercy of which they stand in need at His hands. He did not therefore disdain to
honour with his lips this disease, noble and of noble ancestry and brilliant reputation though
he was, but saluted them as brethren, not, as some might suppose, from vainglory, (for who
was so far removed from this feeling?) but taking the lead in approaching to tend them, as
a consequence of his philosophy, and so giving not only a speaking, but also a silent, instruction.
The effect produced is to be seen not only in the city, but in the country and beyond,
and even the leaders of society have vied with one another in their philanthropy and magnanimity
towards them. Others have had their cooks, and splendid tables, and the devices
and dainties of confectioners, and exquisite carriages, and soft, flowing robes; Basil’s care
was for the sick, and the relief of their wounds, and the imitation of Christ, by cleansing
leprosy, not by a word, but in deed.</p>
<p>64. As to all this, what will be said by those who charge him with pride and haughtiness?
Severe critics they are of such conduct, applying to him, whose life was a standard, those
who were not standards at all. Is it possible that he who kissed the lepers, and humiliated
himself to such a degree, could treat haughtily those who were in health: and, while wasting
his flesh by abstinence, puff out his soul with empty arrogance? Is it possible to condemn
the Pharisee, and expound the debasing effect of haughtiness, to know Christ, Who condescended
to the form of a slave, and ate with publicans, and washed the disciples’ feet, and
did not disdain the cross, in order to nail my sin to it: and, more incredible still, to see God
crucified, aye, along with robbers also, and derided by the passers by, impassible, and beyond
the reach of suffering as He is; and yet, as his slanderers imagine, soar himself above the
clouds, and think that nothing can be on an equality with him. Nay, what they term pride
is, I fancy, the firmness and steadfastness and stability of his character. Such persons would
readily, it seems to me, call bravery rashness, and the circumspect a coward, and the temperate
misanthropic, and the just illiberal. For indeed this philosophic axiom is excellent, which

<pb n="821"/>
says that the vices4515 are settled close to the virtues, and are, in some sense, their next-door
neighbours: and it is most easy, for those whose training in such subjects has been defective,
to mistake a man for what he is not. For who honoured virtue and castigated vice more
than he, or showed himself more kind to the upright, more severe to the wrong doers? His
very smile often amounted to praise, his silence to rebuke, racking the evil in the secret
conscience. And if a man have not been a chatterer, and jester, and gossip, nor a general
favourite, because of having pleased others by becoming all things to all men,4516 what of
that? Is he not in the eyes of sensible men worthy of praise rather than of blame? Unless it
is a fault in the lion that he is terrible and royal, and does not look like an ape, and that his
spring is noble, and is valued for its wonderfulness: while stage-players ought to win our
admiration for their pleasant and philanthropic characters, because they please the vulgar,
and raise a laugh by their sounding slaps in the face. And if this indeed be our object, who
was so pleasant when you met him, as I know, who have had the longest experience? Who
was more kindly in his stories, more refined in his wit, more tender in his rebukes? His reproofs
gave rise to no arrogance, his relaxation to no dissipation, but avoiding excess in
either, he made use of both in reason and season, according to the rules of Solomon, who
assigns to every business a season.4517</p>
<p>65. But what are these to his renown for eloquence, and his powers of instruction, which
have won the favour of the ends of the world? As yet we have been compassing the foot of
the mountain, to the neglect of its summit, as yet we have been crossing a strait, paying no
heed to the mighty and deep ocean. For I think that if any one ever has become, or can become,
a trumpet, in his far sounding resonance, or a voice of God, embracing the universe,
or an earthquake of the world, by some unheard of miracle, it is his voice and intellect which
deserve these titles, for surpassing and excelling all men as much as we surpass the irrational
creatures. Who, more than he, cleansed himself by the Spirit, and made himself worthy to
set forth divine things? Who was more enlightened by the light of knowledge, and had a
closer insight into the depths of the Spirit, and by the aid of God beheld the things of God?
Whose language could better express intellectual truth, without, as most men do, limping
on one foot, by either failing to express his ideas, or allowing his eloquence to outstrip his
reasoning powers? In both respects he won a like distinction, and showed himself to be his
own equal, and absolutely perfect. To search all things, yea, the deep things of God4518 is,
according to the testimony of S. Paul, the office of the Spirit, not because He is ignorant of
them, but because He takes delight in their contemplation. Now all the things of the Spirit

Basil had fully investigated, and hence he drew his instructions for every kind of character,
his lessons in the sublime, and his exhortations to quit things present, and adapt ourselves
to things to come.</p>
<p>66. The sun is extolled by David for its beauty, its greatness, its swift course, and its
power, splendid as a bridegroom, majestic as a giant;4519 while, from the extent of its circuit,
it has such power that it equally sheds its light from one end of heaven to the other, and the
heat thereof is in no wise lessened by distance. Basil’s beauty was virtue, his greatness
theology, his course the perpetual motion reaching even to God by its ascents, and his power
the sowing and distribution of the Word. So that I will not hesitate to say even this, his utterance
went out into all lands,4520 and the power of his words to the ends of the world: as
S. Paul says of the Apostles,4521 borrowing the words from David. What other charm is
there in any gathering to-day? What pleasure in banquets, in the courts, in the churches?
What delight in those in authority, and those beneath them? What in the hermits, or the
cenobites? What in the leisured classes, or those busied in affairs? What in profane schools
of philosophy or in our own? There is one, which runs through all, and is the greatest—his
writings and labours. Nor do writers require any supply of matter besides his teaching or
writings. All the laborious studies of old days in the Divine oracles are silent, while the new
ones are in everybody’s mouth, and he is the best teacher among us who has the deepest
acquaintance with his works, and speaks of them and explains them in our ears. For he
alone more than supplies the place of all others to those who are specially eager for instruction.</p>
<p>67. I will only say this of him. Whenever I handle his Hexaemeron, and take its words
on my lips, I am brought into the presence of the Creator, and understand the words of
creation, and admire the Creator more than before, using my teacher as my only means of
sight. Whenever I take up his polemical works, I see the fire of Sodom,4522 by which the
wicked and rebellious tongues are reduced to ashes, or the tower of Chalane,4523 impiously
built,4524 and righteously destroyed. Whenever I read his writings on the Spirit, I find the
God Whom I possess, and grow bold in my utterance of the truth, from the support of his
theology and contemplation. His other treatises, in which he gives explanations for those
who are shortsighted, by a threefold inscription on the solid tablets of his heart, lead me on
from a mere literal or symbolical interpretation to a still wider view, as I proceed from one

depth to another, calling upon deep4525 after deep, and finding light after light, until I attain
the highest pinnacle. When I study his panegyrics on our athletes, I despise the body, and
enjoy the society of those whom he is praising, and rouse myself to the struggle. His moral
and practical discourses purify soul and body, making me a temple fit for God, and an instrument
struck by the Spirit, to celebrate by its strains the glory and power of God. In fact,
he reduces me to harmony and order, and changes me by a Divine transformation.</p>
<p>68. Since I have mentioned theology, and his most sublime treatises in this science, I
will make this addition to what I have already said. For it is of great service to the community,
to save them from being injured by an unjustifiably low opinion of him. My remarks are
directed against those evil disposed persons who shelter their own vices under cover of their
calumnies against others. In his defence of orthodox teaching, and of the union and coequal
divinity of the Holy Trinity, to use terms which are, I think, as exact and clear as possible,
he would have eagerly welcomed as a gain, and not a danger, not only expulsion from his
see, in which he had originally no desire to be enthroned, but even exile, and death, and its
preliminary tortures. This is manifest from his actual conduct and sufferings. For when
he had been sentenced to banishment on behalf of the truth, the only notice which he took
of it was, to bid one of his servants to take his writing tablet and follow him. He held it necessary,
according to the divine David’s advice, to guide his words with discretion,4526 and
to endure for a while the time of war, and the ascendency of the heretics, until it should be
succeeded by a time of freedom and calm, which would admit of freedom of speech. The
enemy were on the watch for the unqualified statement “the Spirit is God;” which, although
it is true, they and the wicked patron of their impiety imagined to be impious; so that they
might banish him and his power of theological instruction from the city, and themselves be
able to seize upon the church, and make it the starting point and citadel, from which they
could overrun with their evil doctrine the rest of the world. Accordingly, by the use of
other terms, and by statements which unmistakably had the same meaning, and by arguments
necessarily leading to this conclusion, he so overpowered his antagonists, that they were
left without reply, and involved in their own admissions,—the greatest proof possible of
dialectical power and skill. His treatise on this subject makes it further manifest, being
evidently written by a pen borrowed from the Spirit’s store. He postponed for the time the
use of the exact term, begging as a favour from the Spirit Himself and his earnest champions,
that they would not be annoyed at his economy,4527 nor, by clinging to a single expression,
ruin the whole cause, from an uncompromising temper, at a crisis when religion was in

peril. He assured them that they would suffer no injury from a slight change in their expressions,
and from teaching the same truth in other terms. For our salvation is not so much a
matter of words as of actions; for we would not reject the Jews, if they desired to unite with
us, and yet for a while sought to use the term “Anointed” instead of “Christ:” while the
community would suffer a very serious injury, if the church were seized upon by the heretics.</p>
<p>69. That he, no less than any other, acknowledged that the Spirit is God, is plain from
his often having publicly preached this truth, whenever opportunity offered, and eagerly
confessed it when questioned in private. But he made it more clear in his conversations
with me, from whom he concealed nothing during our conferences upon this subject. Not
content with simply asserting it, he proceeded, as he had but very seldom done before, to
imprecate upon himself that most terrible fate of separation from the Spirit, if he did not
adore the Spirit as consubstantial and coequal with the Father and the Son. And if any one
would accept me as having been his fellow labourer in this cause, I will set forth one point
hitherto unknown to most men. Under the pressure of the difficulties of the period, he
himself undertook the economy, while allowing freedom of speech to me, whom no one
was likely to drag from obscurity to trial or banishment, in order that by our united efforts
our Gospel might be firmly established. I mention this, not to defend his reputation, for
the man is stronger than his assailants, if there are any such; but to prevent men from
thinking that the terms found in his writings are the utmost limit of the truth, and so have
their faith weakened, and consider that their own error is supported by his theology, which
was the joint result of the influences of the time and of the Spirit, instead of considering the
sense of his writings, and the object with which they were written, so as to be brought closer
to the truth, and enabled to silence the partisans of impiety. At any rate let his theology be
mine, and that of all dear to me! And so confident am I of his spotlessness in this respect,
that I take him for my partner in this, as in all else: and may what is mine be attributed to
him, what is his to me, both at the hands of God, and of the wisest of men! For we would
not say that the Evangelists are at variance with one another, because some are more occupied
with the human side of the Christ, and others pay attention to His Divinity; some having
commenced their history with what is within our own experience, others with what is above
us; and by thus sharing the substance of their message, they have procured the advantage
of those who receive it, and followed the impressions of the Spirit Who was within them.</p>
<p>70. Come then, there have been many men of old days illustrious for piety, as lawgivers,
generals, prophets, teachers, and men brave to the shedding of blood. Let us compare our
prelate with them, and thus recognize his merit. Adam was honoured by the hand of God,4528
and the delights of Paradise,4529 and the first legislation:4530 but, unless I slander the

reputation of our first parent, he kept not the command. Now Basil both received and observed
it, and received no injury from the tree of knowledge, and escaped the flaming sword,
and, as I am well assured, has attained to Paradise. Enos first ventured to call upon the
Lord.4531 Basil both called upon Him himself, and, what is far more excellent, preached
Him to others. Enoch was translated,4532 attaining to his translation as the reward of a little
piety (for the faith was still in shadow) and escaped the peril of the remainder of life, but
Basil’s whole life was a translation, and he was completely tested in a complete life. Noah
was entrusted with the ark,4533 and the seeds of a new world committed to a small house
of wood, in their preservation from the waters. Basil escaped the deluge of impiety and
made of his own city an ark of safety, which sailed lightly over the heretics, and afterwards
recovered the whole world.</p>
<p>71. Abraham was a great man, a patriarch, the offerer of the new sacrifice,4534 by
presenting to Him who had given it the promised seed, as a ready offering, eager for
slaughter. But Basil’s offering was no slight one, when he offered himself to God, without
any equivalent being given in his stead, (for how could that have been possible?) so that his
sacrifice was consummated. Isaac was promised even before his birth,4535 Basil promised
himself, and took for his spouse Rebekah, I mean the Church, not fetched from a distance
by the mission of a servant,4536 but bestowed upon and entrusted to him by God close at
home: nor was he outwitted in the preference of his children, but bestowed upon each what
was due to him, without any deception, according to the judgment of the Spirit. I extol the
ladder of Jacob,4537 and the pillar which he anointed to God, and his wrestling with Him,
whatever it was; and, in my opinion, it was the contrast and opposition of the human stature
to the height of God, resulting in the tokens of the defeat4538 of his race. I extol also his
clever devices and success in cattle-breeding, and his children, the twelve Patriarchs, and
the distribution of his blessings, with their glorious prophecy of the future. But I still more
extol Basil for the ladder which he did not merely see, but which he ascended by successive
steps towards excellence, and the pillar which he did not anoint, but which he erected to
God, by pillorying the teaching of the ungodly; and the wrestling with which he wrestled,
not with God, but, on behalf of God, to the overthrow of the heretics; and his pastoral care,

whereby he grew rich, through gaining for himself a number of marked sheep greater than
that of the unmarked, and his illustrious fruitfulness in spiritual children, and the blessing
with which he established many.</p>
<p>72. Joseph was a provider of corn,4539 but in Egypt only, and not frequently, and of
bodily food. Basil did so for all men, and at all times, and in spiritual food, and therefore,
in my opinion, his was the more honourable function. Like Job, the man of Uz,4540 he was
both tempted, and overcame, and at the close of his struggles gained splendid honour,
having been shaken by none of his many assailants, and having gained a decisive victory
over the efforts of the tempter, and put to silence the unreason of his friends, who knew not
the mysterious character of his affliction. “Moses and Aaron among His priests.”4541 Truly
was Moses great, who inflicted the plagues upon Egypt,4542 and delivered the people among
many signs and wonders, and entered within the cloud, and sanctioned the double law,
outward in the letter, and inward in the Spirit. Aaron was Moses’ brother,4543 both naturally
and spiritually, and offered sacrifices and prayers for the people, as the hierophant of the
great and holy tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.4544 Of both of them Basil
was a rival, for he tortured, not with bodily but with spiritual and mental plagues, the
Egyptian race of heretics, and led to the land of promise4545 the people of possession, zealous
of good works;4546 he inscribed laws, which are no longer obscure, but entirely spiritual,
on tables4547 which are not broken but are preserved; he entered the Holy of holies,4548 not
once a year, but often, I may say every day, and thence he revealed to us the Holy Trinity;
and cleansed the people, not with temporary sprinklings, but with eternal purifications:
What is the special excellence of Joshua?4549 His generalship, and the distribution of the
inheritance, and the taking possession of the Holy Land. And was not Basil an Exarch?4550

could use the words, “The lot is fallen unto me in pleasant places;4552 and “my fortunes are
in Thy hands,”4553 fortunes more precious than those which come to us on earth, and can
be snatched away.</p>
<p>73. Further, to run over the Judges, or the most illustrious of the Judges, there is “Samuel
among those that call upon His Name,”4554 who was given to God before his birth,4555 and
sanctified immediately after his birth, and the anointer with his horn of kings and priests.4556
But was not Basil as an infant consecrated to God from the womb, and offered with a coat4557
at the altar, and was he not a seer of heavenly things, and anointed of the Lord, and the
anointer of those who are perfected by the Spirit? Among the kings, David is celebrated,
whose victories and trophies4558 gained from the enemy are on record, but his most characteristic
trait was his gentleness,4559 and, before his kingly office, his power with the harp,
able to soothe even the evil spirit. Solomon asked of God and obtained breadth of heart,4560
making the furthest possible progress in wisdom and contemplation, so that he became the
most famous man of his time. Basil, in my opinion, was in no wise, or but little inferior, to
the one in gentleness, to the other in wisdom, so that he soothed the arrogance of infuriated
sovereigns; and did not merely bring the queen of the south from the ends of the earth, or
any other individual, to visit him because of his renown for wisdom, but made his wisdom
known in all the ends of the world. I pass over the rest of Solomon’s life. Even if we spare
it, it is evident to all.</p>

translation?4562 Or the fair inheritance of Elisha, the sheepskin mantle, accompanied by
the spirit of Elijah?4563 You must also praise the life of Basil, spent in the fire. I mean in
the multitude of temptations, and his escape through fire, which burnt, but did not consume,
the mystery of “the bush,”4564 and the fair cloak of skin from on high, his indifference to

prophet praying in the whale’s belly,4566 and coming forth from the creature, as from a
chamber; the just man in the den, restraining the lions’ rage,4567 and the struggle of the
seven Maccabees,4568 who were perfected with their father and mother in blood, and in all
kinds of tortures. Their endurance he rivalled, and won their glory.</p>
<p>75. I now turn to the New Testament, and comparing his life with those who are here
illustrious, I shall find in the teachers a source of honour for their disciple. Who was the
forerunner of Jesus?4569 John, the voice of the Word,4570 the lamp of the Light,4571 before
Whom he even leaped in the womb,4572 and Whom he preceded to Hades, whither he was
despatched by the rage of Herod,4573 to herald even there Him who was coming. And, if
my language seems audacious to anyone, let me assure him beforehand, that in making this
comparison, I neither prefer Basil, nor imply that he is equal to him who surpasses all who
are born of women,4574 but only show that he was stirred to emulation, and possessed to
some extent his striking features. For it is no slight thing for the earnest to imitate the
greatest of men, even in a slight degree. Is it not indeed manifest that Basil was a copy of
John’s asceticism? He also lived in the wilderness, and wore in nightly watchings a ragged
garb, during his shrinking retirement; he also loved a similar food, purifying himself for
God by abstinence; he also was thought worthy to be a herald, if not a forerunner, of Christ,
and there went out to him not only all the region round about,4575 but also that which was
beyond its borders; he also stood between the two covenants, abolishing the letter of the
one by administering the spirit of the other, and bringing about the fulfilment of the hidden
law through the dissolution of that which was apparent.</p>
<p>76. He emulated the zeal of Peter,4576 the intensity of Paul, the faith of both these men
of name and of surname, the lofty utterance of the sons of Zebedee, the frugality and simplicity
of all the disciples. Therefore he was also entrusted with the keys of the heavens,4577

and not only from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum,4578 but he embraces a wider
circle in the Gospel; he is not named, but becomes, a Son of thunder; and lying upon the
breast of Jesus, he draws thence the power of his word, and the depth of his thoughts. He
was prevented from becoming a Stephen,4579 eager though he was, since reverence stayed
the hands of those who would have stoned him. I am able to sum up still more concisely,
to avoid treating in detail on these points of each individual. In some respects he discovered,
in some he emulated, in others he surpassed the good. In his many-sided virtues he excelled
all men of this day. I have but one thing left to say, and in few words.</p>
<p>77. So great was his virtue, and the eminence of his fame, that many of his minor
characteristics, nay, even his physical defects, have been assumed by others with a view to
notoriety. For instance his paleness, his beard, his gait, his thoughtful, and generally meditative,
hesitation in speaking, which, in the ill-judged, inconsiderate imitation of many,
took the form of melancholy. And besides, the style of his dress, the shape of his bed, and
his manner of eating, none of which was to him a matter of consequence, but simply the
result of accident and chance. So you might see many Basils in outward semblance, among
these statues in outline, for it would be too much to call them his distant echo. For an echo,
though it is the dying away of a sound, at any rate represents it with great clearness, while
these men fall too far short of him to satisfy even their desire to approach him. Nor was it
a slight thing, but a matter with good reason held in the highest estimation, to chance to
have met him or done him some service, or to carry away the souvenir of something which
he had said or done in jest or in earnest: as I know that I have myself often taken pride in
doing; for his improvisations were much more precious and brilliant than the laboured efforts
of other men.</p>
<p>78. But when, after he had finished his course, and kept the faith,4580 he longed to depart,
and the time for his crown was approaching,4581 he did not hear the summons: “Get thee
up into the mountain and die,”4582 but “Die and come up to us.” And here again he wrought
a wonder in no wise inferior to those mentioned before. For when he was almost dead, and
breathless, and had lost the greater part of his powers; he grew stronger in his last words,
so as to depart with the utterances of religion, and, by ordaining the most excellent of his
attendants, bestowed upon them both his hand and the Spirit: so that his disciples, who
had aided him in his priestly office, might not be defrauded of the priesthood. The remainder
of my task I approach, but with reluctance, as it would fall more fully from the mouths of

others than from my own. For I cannot philosophise over my misfortune, even if I greatly
longed to do so, when I recollect that the loss is common to us all, and that the misfortune
has befallen the whole world.</p>
<p>79. He lay, drawing his last breath, and awaited by the choir on high, towards which
he had long directed his gaze. Around him poured the whole city, unable to bear his loss,
inveighing against his departure, as if it had been an oppression, and clinging to his soul,
as though it had been capable of restraint or compulsion at their hands or their prayers.
Their suffering had driven them distracted, all were eager, were it possible, to add to his life
a portion of their own. And when they failed, for it must needs be proved that he was a
man, and, with his last words “Into thy Hands I commend my spirit,”4583 he had joyfully
resigned his soul to the care of the angels who carried him away; not without having some
religious instructions and injunctions for the benefit of those who were present—then occurred
a wonder more remarkable than any which had happened before.</p>
<p>80. The saint was being carried out, lifted high by the hands of holy men, and everyone
was eager, some to seize the hem of his garment,4584 others only just to touch the shadow,4585
or the bier which bore his holy remains (for what could be more holy or pure than that
body), others to draw near to those who were carrying it, others only to enjoy the sight, as
if even this were beneficial. Market places, porticos, houses of two or three stories were
filled with people escorting, preceding, following, accompanying him, and trampling upon
each other; tens of thousands of every race and age, beyond all previous experience. The
psalmody was overborne by the lamentations, philosophic resignation sank beneath the
misfortune. Our own people vied with strangers, Jews, Greeks, and foreigners, and they
with us, for a greater share in the benefit, by means of a more abundant lamentation. To
close my story, the calamity ended in danger; many souls departed along with him, from
the violence of the pushing and confusion, who have been thought happy in their end, departing
together with him, “funeral victims,” perhaps some fervid orator might call them.
The body having at last escaped from those who would seize it, and made its way through
those who went before it, was consigned to the tomb of his fathers, the high priest being
added to the priests, the mighty voice which rings in my ears to the heralds, the martyr to
the martyrs. And now he is in heaven, where, if I mistake not, he is offering sacrifices for
us, and praying for the people, for though, he has left us, he has not entirely left us. While
I, Gregory, who am half dead, and, cleft in twain, torn away from our great union, and
dragging along a life of pain which runs not easily, as may be supposed, after separation
from him, know not what is to be my end now that I have lost my guidance. And even now

I am admonished and instructed in nightly visions, if ever I fall short of my duty. And my
present object is not so much to mingle lamentations with my praises, or to portray the
public life of the man, or publish a picture of virtue common to all time, and an example
salutary to all churches, and to all souls, which we may keep in view, as a living law, and so
rightly direct our lives as to counsel you, who have been completely initiated into his doctrine,
to fix your eyes upon him, as one who sees you and is seen by you, and thus to be perfected
by the Spirit.</p>
<p>81. Come hither then, and surround me, all ye members of his choir, both of the clergy
and the laity, both of our own country and from abroad; aid me in my eulogy, by each supplying
or demanding the account of some of his excellences. Regard, ye occupants of the
bench, the lawgiver; ye politicians, the statesman; ye men of the people, his orderliness; ye
men of letters, the instructor; ye virgins, the leader of the bride; ye who are yoked in marriage,
the restrainer; ye hermits, him who gave you wings; ye cenobites, the judge; ye simple men,
the guide; ye contemplatives, the divine; ye cheerful ones, the bridle; ye unfortunate men,
the consoler, the staff of hoar hairs, the guide of youth, the relief of poverty, the steward of
abundance. Widows also will, I imagine, praise their protector, orphans their father, poor
men their friend, strangers their entertainer, brothers the man of brotherly love, the sick
their physician, whatever be their sickness and the healing they need, the healthy the preserver
of health, and all men him who made himself all things to all that he might gain the
majority, if not all.</p>
<p>82. This is my offering to thee, Basil, uttered by the tongue which once was the sweetest
of all to thee, of him who was thy fellow in age and rank. If it have approached thy deserts,
thanks are due to thee, for it was from confidence in thee that I undertook to speak of thee.
But if it fall far short of thy expectations, what must be our feelings, who are worn out with
age and disease and regret for thee? Yet God is pleased, when we do what we can. Yet
mayest thou gaze upon us from above, thou divine and sacred person; either stay by thy
entreaties our thorn in the flesh,4586 given to us by God for our discipline, or prevail upon
us to bear it boldly, and guide all our life towards that which is most for our profit. And if
we be translated, do thou receive us there also in thine own tabernacle, that, as we dwell
together, and gaze together more clearly and more perfectly upon the holy and blessed
Trinity, of Which we have now in some degree received the image, our longing may at last
be satisfied, by gaining this recompense for all the battles we have fought and the assaults
we have endured. Such are our words on thy behalf: who will there be to praise us, since
we leave this life after thee, even if we offer any topic worthy of words or praise in Christ
Jesus our Lord, to Whom be glory forever? Amen.</p>

<head>Oration XLV.</head>
<p>The Second Oration on Easter.</p>
<p>ThisOration was not, as its title would perhaps lead us to suppose, delivered immediately
after the first; but an interval of many years elapsed between them, and the two have no connection
with each other. Chronologically they are the first and last of S. Gregory’s Sermons.
The Second was delivered in the Church of Arianzus, a village near Nazianzus, where he had
inherited some property, to which he withdrew after resigning the Archbishopric of Constantinople,
and then, finding the administration even of the little Bishopric of Nazianzus too
much for his advancing years and declining strength, he retired to Arianzus about the end of
a.d. 383, dying there in 389 or 390. “The exordium of this discourse is quite in the style of the
Bible; the Orator here describes and puts words into the mouth of the Angel of the Resurrection.
His object is to show the importance of the day’s solemnities, and to explain allegorically all
the circumstances of the ancient Passover, applying them to Christ and the Christian life.
Two passages are borrowed verbatim from the discourse on the Nativity, preached at Constantinople”
(Benoît).</p>
<p>The Benedictine Editors profess themselves unable to determine whether this repetition
is due to S. Gregory himself—or to the carelessness of some amanuensis.</p>
<p>I. I will stand upon my watch,4587 saith the venerable Habakkuk; and I will take my
post beside him today on the authority and observation which was given me of the Spirit;
and I will look forth, and will observe what shall be said to me. Well, I have taken my stand,
and looked forth; and behold a man riding on the clouds and he is very high, and his
countenance is as the countenance of Angel,4588 and his vesture as the brightness of piercing
lightning; and he lifts his hand toward the East, and cries with a loud voice. His voice is like
the voice of a trumpet; and round about Him is as it were a multitude of the Heavenly Host;
and he saith, Today is salvation come unto the world, to that which is visible, and to that
which is invisible. Christ is risen from the dead, rise ye with Him. Christ is returned again
to Himself, return ye. Christ is freed from the tomb, be ye freed from the bond of sin. The
gates of hell are opened, and death is destroyed, and the old Adam is put aside, and the New
is fulfilled; if any man be in Christ he is a new creature;4589 be ye renewed. Thus he speaks;
and the rest sing out, as they did before when Christ was manifested to us by His birth on
earth, their glory to God in the highest, on earth, peace, goodwill among men.4590 And

<p>II. The Lord’s Passover, the Passover, and again I say the Passover to the honour of the
Trinity. This is to us a Feast of feasts and a Solemnity of solemnities4591 as far exalted above
all others (not only those which are merely human and creep on the ground, but even those
which are of Christ Himself, and are celebrated in His honour) as the Sun is above the stars.
Beautiful indeed yesterday was our splendid array, and our illumination, in which both in
public and private we associated ourselves, every kind of men, and almost every rank, illuminating
the night with our crowded fires, formed after the fashion of that great light, both
that with which the heaven above us lights its beacon fires, and that which is above the
heavens, amid the angels (the first luminous nature, next to the first nature of all, because
springing directly from it), and that which is in the Trinity, from which all light derives its
being, parted from the undivided light and honoured. But today’s is more beautiful and
more illustrious; inasmuch as yesterday’s light was a forerunner of the rising of the Great
Light, and as it were a kind of rejoicing in preparation for the Festival; but today we are
celebrating the Resurrection itself, no longer as an object of expectation, but as having
already come to pass, and gathering the whole world unto itself. Let then different persons
bring forth different fruits and offer different offerings at this season, smaller or greater…such
spiritual offerings as are dear to God…as each may have power. For scarcely Angels themselves
could offer gifts worthy of its rank, those first and intellectual and pure beings, who
are also eye-witnesses of the Glory That is on high; if even these can attain the full strain of
praise. We will for our part offer a discourse, the best and most precious thing we
have—especially as we are praising the Word for the blessing which He hath bestowed on
the reasoning creation. I will begin from this point. For I cannot endure, when I am engaged
in offering the sacrifice of the lips concerning the Great Sacrifice and the greatest of days,
to fail to recur to God, and to take my beginning from Him. Therefore I pray you, cleanse
your mind and ears and thoughts, all you who delight in such subjects, since the discourse
will be concerning God, and will be divine; that you may depart filled with delights of a sort

<p>III. God4592 always was and always is, and always will be; or rather, God always Is.4593
For Was and Will Be are fragments of our time, and of changeable nature. But He is
Eternal Being; and this is the Name He gives Himself when giving the Oracles to Moses in
the Mount. For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having neither beginning
in the past nor end in the future<gap reason="omitted"/>like some great Sea of Being, limitless and unbounded,
transcending all conception of time and nature, only adumbrated by the mind, and that
very dimly and scantily<gap reason="omitted"/>not by His Essentials but by His Environment,4594 one image being
got from one source and another from another, and combined into some sort of presentation
of the truth, which escapes us before we have caught it, and which takes to flight before we
have conceived it, blazing forth upon our master-part, even when that is cleansed, as the
lightning flash which will not stay its course does upon our sight<gap reason="omitted"/>in order, as I conceive,
by that part of it which we can comprehend to draw us to itself (for that which is altogether
incomprehensible is outside the bounds of hope, and not within the compass of endeavour);
and by that part of It which we cannot comprehend to move our wonder; and as an object
of wonder to become more an object of desire; and being desired, to purify; and purifying
to make us like God; so that, when we have become like Himself, God may, to use a bold
expression, hold converse with us as God; being united to us, and known by us; and that
perhaps to the same extent as He already knows those who are known to Him.4595 The
Divine Nature, then, is boundless and hard to understand, and all that we can comprehend
of Him is His boundlessness; even though one may conceive that because He is of a simple
Nature He is therefore either wholly incomprehensible or perfectly comprehensible. For
let us farther enquire what is implied by “is of a simple Nature?” For it is quite certain that
this simplicity is not itself its nature, just as composition is not by itself the essence of compound
beings.</p>
<p>IV. And when Infinity is considered from two points of view, beginning and end (for
that which is beyond these and not limited by them is Infinity), when the mind looks into
the depths above, not having where to stand, and leans upon phænomena to form an idea
of God it calls the Infinite and Unapproachable which it finds there by the name of Unori-

ginate. And when it looks into the depth below and at the future, it calls Him Undying and
Imperishable. And when it draws a conclusion from the whole, it calls Him Eternal. For
Eternity is neither time nor part of time; for it cannot be measured. But what time measured
by the course of the sun is to us, that Eternity is to the Everlasting; namely a sort of timelike
movement and interval, coextensive with Their Existence. This however is all that I must
now say of God; for the present is not a suitable time, as my present subject is not the doctrine
of God, but that of the Incarnation. And when I say God, I mean Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; for Godhead is neither diffused beyond These, so as to introduce a mob of gods, nor
yet bounded by a smaller compass than These, so as to condemn us for a poverty stricken
conception of Deity, either Judaizing to save the Monarchia, or falling into heathenism by
the multitude of our gods. For the evil on either side is the same, though found in contrary
directions. Thus then is the Holy of Holies, Which is hidden even from the Seraphim, and
is glorified with a thrice-repeated Holy meeting in one ascription of the title Lord and God,
as one of our predecessors has most beautifully and loftily reasoned out.</p>
<p>V. But since this movement of Self-contemplation alone could not satisfy Goodness,
but Good must be poured out and go forth beyond Itself, to multiply the objects of Its beneficence
(for this was essential to the highest Goodness), He first conceived the Angelic and
Heavenly Powers. And this conception was a work fulfilled by His Word and perfected by
His Spirit. And so the Secondary Splendours came into being, as the ministers of the Primary
Splendour (whether we are to conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or as Fire of an immaterial
and incorporeal kind, or as some other nature approaching this as near as may be).
I should like to say that they are incapable of movement in the direction of evil, and susceptible
only of the movement of good, as being about God and illuminated with the first Rays
from God (for earthly beings have but the second illumination), but I am obliged to stop
short of saying that they are immovable, and to conceive and speak of them as only difficult
to move, because of him who for His Splendour was called Lucifer, but became and is called
Darkness through his pride; and the Apostate Hosts who are subject to him, creators of evil
by their revolt against good, and our inciters.</p>
<p>VI. Thus then and for these reasons, He gave being to the world of thought, as far as I
can reason on these matters, and estimate great things in my own poor language. Then,
when His first Creation was in good order, He conceives a second world, material and visible;
and this a system of earth and sky and all that is in the midst of them; an admirable creation
indeed when we look at the fair form of every part, but yet more worthy of admiration when
we consider the harmony and unison of the whole, and how each part fits in with every
other in fair order, and all with the whole, tending to the perfect completion of the world
as a Unit. This was to shew that He could call into being not only a nature akin to Himself,
but also one altogether alien to Him. For akin to Deity are those natures which are intellectual,
and only to be comprehended by mind; but all of which sense can take cognizance are

<pb n="836"/>
utterly alien to It; and of these the furthest removed from it are all those which are entirely
destitute of soul and power of motion.</p>
<p>VII. Mind then and sense, thus distinguished from each other, had remained within
their own boundaries, and bore in themselves the magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent
praisers and thrilling heralds of His mighty work. Not yet was there any mingling of both,
nor any mixture of these opposites, tokens of a greater wisdom and generosity in the creation
of natures; nor as yet were the whole riches of goodness made known. Now the Creator-
Word, determining to exhibit this, and to produce a single living being out of both (the invisible
and the visible creation, I mean) fashions Man; and taking a body from already existing
matter, and placing in it a Breath taken from Himself (which the Word knew to be an intelligent
soul, and the image of God), as a sort of second world, great in littleness, He placed
him on the earth, a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully initiated into the visible creation,
but only partially into the intellectual; king of all upon earth, but subject to the King above;
earthly and heavenly; temporal and yet immortal; visible and yet intellectual; halfway between
greatness and lowliness; in one person combining spirit and flesh; spirit because of the favour
bestowed on him, flesh on account of the height to which he had been raised; the one that
he might continue to live and glorify his benefactor, the other that he might suffer, and by
suffering be put in remembrance, and be corrected if he became proud in his greatness; a
living creature, trained here and then moved elsewhere; and to complete the mystery, deified
by its inclination to God<gap reason="omitted"/>for to this, I think, tends that light of Truth which here we possess
but in measure; that we should both see and experience the Splendour of God, which is
worthy of Him Who made us, and will dissolve us, and remake us after a loftier fashion.</p>
<p>VIII. This being He placed in paradise—whatever that paradise may have been (having
honoured him with the gift of free will, in order that good might belong to him as the result
of his choice, no less than to Him Who had implanted the seeds of it)—to till the immortal
plants, by which is perhaps meant the Divine conceptions, both the simpler and the more
perfect; naked in his simplicity and inartificial life; and without any covering or screen; for
it was fitting that he who was from the beginning should be such. And He gave Him a Law,
as material for his free will to act upon. This Law was a commandment as to what plants
he might partake of, and which one he might not touch. This latter was the Tree of Knowledge;
not, however, because it was evil from the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden
because God grudged it to men—let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that direction,
or imitate the serpent. But it would have been good if partaken of at the proper time;
for the Tree was, according to my theory, Contemplation, which it is only safe for those
who have reached maturity of habit to enter upon; but which is not good for those who are
still somewhat simple and greedy; just as neither is solid food good for those who are yet
tender and have need of milk. But when through the devil’s malice and the woman’s

<pb n="837"/>
caprice,4596 to which she succumbed as the more tender, and which she brought to bear
upon the man, as she was the more apt to persuade—alas for my weakness, for that of my
first father was mine; he forgot the commandment which had been given him, and yielded
to the baleful fruit; and for his sin was banished at once from the tree of life, and from
paradise, and from God; and put on the coats of skins, that is, perhaps, the coarser flesh,
both mortal and contradictory. And this was the first thing which he learnt—his own
shame—and he hid himself from God. Yet here too he makes a gain, namely death and the
cutting off of sin, in order that evil may not be immortal. Thus, his punishment is changed
into a mercy, for it is in mercy, I am persuaded, that God inflicts punishment.</p>
<p>IX. And having first been chastened by many means because his sins were many, whose
root of evil sprang up through divers causes and sundry times, by word, by law, by prophets,
by benefits, by threats, by plagues, by waters, by fires, by wars, by victories, by defeats, by
signs in heaven, and signs in the air, and in the earth, and in the sea; by unexpected changes
of men, of cities, of nations (the object of which was the destruction of wickedness) at last
he needed a stronger remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual slaughters,
adulteries, perjuries, unnatural crimes, and that first and last of all evils, idolatry, and the
transfer of worship from the Creator to the creatures. As these required a greater aid, so
they also obtained a greater. And that was that the Word of God Himself, Who is before
all worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, the Beginning of beginning,
the Light of Light, the Source of Life and Immortality, the Image of the Archetype, the Immovable
Seal, the Unchangeable Image, the Father’s Definition and Word, came to His own
Image, and took on Him Flesh for the sake of our flesh, and mingled Himself with an intelligent
soul for my soul’s sake, purifying like by like; and in all points except sin was made
Man; conceived by the Virgin, who first in body and soul was purified by the Holy Ghost,
for it was needful both That Child-bearing should be honoured and that Virginity should
receive a higher honour. He came forth then, as God, with That which He had assumed;
one Person in two natures, flesh and Spirit, of which the latter deified the former. O new
commingling; O strange conjunction! the Self-existent comes into Being, the Uncreated is
created, That which cannot be contained is contained by the intervention of an intellectual
soul mediating between the Deity and the corporeity of the flesh. And He who gives riches
becomes poor; for He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume the riches of His
Godhead. He that is full empties Himself; for He empties Himself of His Glory for a short
while, that I may have a share in His Fulness. What is the riches of His Goodness? What
is this mystery that is around me? I had a share in the Image and I did not keep it; He partakes
of my flesh that He may both save the Image and make the flesh immortal. He communicates
a Second Communion, far more marvellous than the first, inasmuch as then He
<note type="footnote">4596 Wisd. ii. 24.</note>

<pb n="838"/>
imparted the better nature, but now He Himself assumes the worse. This is more godlike
than the former action; this is loftier in the eyes of all men of understanding.</p>
<p>X. But perhaps some one of those who are too impetuous and festive may say, “What
has all this to do with us? Spur on your horse to the goal; talk to us about the Festival and
the reasons for our being here to-day.” Yes, this is what I am about to do, although I have
begun at a somewhat previous point, being compelled to do so by the needs of my argument.
There will be no harm in the eyes of scholars and lovers of the beautiful if we say a few words
about the word Pascha itself, for such an addition will not be useless in their ears. This great
and venerable Pascha is called Phaska by the Hebrews in their own language; and the word
means Passing Over. Historically, from their flight and migration from Egypt into the Land
of Canaan; spiritually, from the progress and ascent from things below to things above and
to the Land of Promise. And we observe that a thing which we often find to have happened
in Scripture, the change of certain nouns from an uncertain to a clearer sense, or from a
coarser to a more refined, has taken place in this instance. For some people, supposing this
to be a name of the Sacred Passion, and in consequence Grecizing the word by changing
Phi and Kappa into Pi and Chi, called the Day Pascha.4597 And custom took it up and
confirmed the word, with the help of the ears of most people, to whom it had a more pious
sound.</p>
<p>XI. But before our time the Holy Apostle declared that the Law was but a shadow of
things to come,4598 which are conceived by thought. And God too, who in still older times
gave oracles to Moses, said when giving laws concerning these things, See thou make all
things according to the pattern shewed thee in the Mount,4599 when He shewed him the
visible things as an adumbration of and design for the things that are invisible. And I am
persuaded that none of these things has been ordered in vain, none without a reason, none
in a grovelling manner or unworthy of the legislation of God and the ministry of Moses,
even though it be difficult in each type to find a theory descending to the most delicate details,
to every point about the Tabernacle itself, and its measures and materials, and the Levites
and Priests who carried them, and all the particulars which were enacted about the Sacrifices
and the purifications and the Offerings;4600 and though these are only to be understood by
<note type="footnote">4597 Pascha represents the Hebrew PHSKH. Throughout 2 Chron. the LXX. represents the word by Phasek,
which like Pascha is a transliteration of the Hebrew word. The form which the transliteration takes is due to
the fact that the Greek language does not tolerate these two aspirates in juxtapostion. S. Gregory is correct in
remarking that Pascha has no real connection with πάσχω (to suffer), though it might appear to unlearned ears
that it has.</note>

those who rank with Moses in virtue, or have made the nearest approach to his learning.
For in that Mount itself God is seen by men; on the one hand through His own descent from
His lofty abode, on the other through His drawing us up from our abasement on earth, that
the Incomprehensible may be in some degree, and as far as is safe, comprehended by a
mortal nature. For in no other way is it possible for the denseness of a material body and
an imprisoned mind to come into consciousness of God, except by His assistance. Then
therefore all men do not seem to have been deemed worthy of the same rank and position;
but one of one place and one of another, each, I think, according to the measure of his own
purification. Some have even been altogether driven away, and only permitted to hear the
Voice from on high, namely those whose dispositions are altogether like wild beasts, and
who are unworthy of divine mysteries.</p>
<p>XII. But we, standing midway between those whose minds are utterly dense on the one
side, and on the other those who are very contemplative and exalted, that we may neither
remain quite idle and immovable, nor yet be more busy than we ought, and fall short of and
be estranged from our purpose—for the former course is Jewish and very low, and the latter
is only fit for the dream-soothsayer, and both alike are to be condemned—let us say our say
upon these matters, so far as is within our reach, and not very absurd, or exposed to the ridicule
of the multitude. Our belief is that since it was needful that we, who had fallen in
consequence of the original sin, and had been led away by pleasure, even as far as idolatry
and unlawful bloodshed, should be recalled and raised up again to our original position
through the tender mercy of God our Father, Who could not endure that such a noble work
of His own hands as Man should be lost to Him; the method of our new creation, and of
what should be done, was this:—that all violent remedies were disapproved, as not likely to
persuade us, and as quite possibly tending to add to the plague, through our chronic pride;
but that God disposed things to our restoration by a gentle and kindly method of cure. For
a crooked sapling will not bear a sudden bending the other way, or violence from the hand
that would straighten it, but will be more quickly broken than straightened; and a horse of
a hot temper and above a certain age will not endure the tyranny of the bit without some
coaxing and encouragement. Therefore the Law is given to us as an assistance, like a
boundary wall between God and idols, drawing us away from one and to the Other. And
it concedes a little at first, that it may receive that which is greater. It concedes the Sacrifices
for a time, that it may establish God in us, and then when the fitting time shall come may
abolish the Sacrifices also; thus wisely changing our minds by gradual removals, and
bringing us over to the Gospel when we have already been trained to a prompt obedience.</p>
<note type="footnote">also quotes Zonaras’ definition, “Quod offertur ἀφαίρεμα dicitur, quod a toto mactatæ animantis corpore abstractum
sit.” Balsamon, according to the same authority, makes it the portion which was severed from the
carcase of the victim and set apart for the Priest (i.e., the heave-offering, Lev. vii. 14, 32).</note>

<pb n="840"/>
<p>XIII. Thus then and for this cause the written Law came in, gathering us into Christ;
and this is the account of the Sacrifices as I account for them. And that you may not be ignorant
of the depth of His Wisdom and the riches of His unsearchable judgments,4601 He
did not leave even these unhallowed altogether, or useless, or with nothing in them but mere
blood.4602 But that great, and if I may say so, in Its first nature unsacrificeable Victim, was
intermingled with the Sacrifices of the Law, and was a purification, not for a part of the
world, nor for a short time, but for the whole world and for all time. For this reason a Lamb
was chosen for its innocence, and its clothing of the original nakedness. For such is the
Victim, That was offered for us, Who is both in Name and fact the Garment of incorruption.
And He was a perfect Victim not only on account of His Godhead, than which nothing is
more perfect; but also on account of that which He assumed having been anointed with
Deity, and having become one with That which anointed It, and I am bold to say, made
equal with God. A Male, because offered for Adam; or rather the Stronger for the strong,
when the first Man had fallen under sin; and chiefly because there is in Him nothing feminine,
nothing unmanly; but He burst from the bonds of the Virgin-Mother’s womb with much
power, and a Male was brought forth by the Prophetess,4603 as Isaiah declares the good
tidings. And of a year old, because He is the Sun of Righteousness4604 setting out from
heaven, and circumscribed by His visible Nature, and returning unto Himself.4605 And
“The blessed crown of Goodness,”—being on every side equal to Himself and alike; and not
only this, but also as giving life to all the circle of the virtues, gently commingled and inter-
<note type="footnote">4601 Rom. xi. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">4602 The Jewish Sacrifices had a deep inner meaning and mystery. In a limited sense they may be called
Sacraments of the future Atonement, which they prefigured and appealed to. But only in a limited sense can
they be so called, because they did not convey grace to the soul, but only appealed to the grace to come; and so
the Sin-offerings of the Law are only said to cover, not to take away sin. They removed the spiritual disqualification
for worship; but they did not restore full Spiritual Communion with God. Still they were not altogether
unhallowed or useless like those of the heathen, inasmuch as they did point forward and plead the merits of the
One true Sacrifice.</note>

<note type="footnote">4605 The Greek here is very obscure. The meaning seems to be that which Nicetas suggests, viz.:—that our
Lord in coming to earth and becoming Incarnate did not in His Divine Nature leave Heaven, but was, while still
here on earth in His own words, “The Son of Man Which is in Heaven.”</note>

<pb n="841"/>
mixed with each other, according to the Law of Love and Order.4606 And Immaculate and
guileless, as being the Healer of faults, and of the defects and taints that come from sin. For
though He both took on Him our sins and bare our diseases,4607 yet He did not Himself
suffer aught that needed healing. For He was tempted in all points like as we are yet without
sin.4608 For he that persecuted the Light that shineth in darkness could not overtake Him.</p>
<p>XIV. What more? The First Month is introduced, or rather the beginning of months,
whether it was so among the Hebrews from the beginning, or was made so later on this account,
and became the first in consequence of the Mystery; and the tenth of the Month, for
this is the most complete number, of units the first perfect unit, and the parent of perfection.
And it is kept until the fifth day, perhaps because the Victim, of Whom I am speaking,
purifies the five senses, from which comes falling into sin, and around which the war rages,
inasmuch as they are open to the incitements to sin. And it was chosen, not only out of the
lambs, but also out of the inferior species, which are placed on the left hand4609—the kids;
because He is sacrificed not only for the righteous, but also for sinners; and perhaps even
more for these, inasmuch as we have greater need of His mercy. And we need not be surprised
that a lamb for a house should be required as the best course, but if that could not
be, then one might be obtained by contributions (owing to poverty) for the houses of a
family; because it is clearly best that each individual should suffice for his own perfecting,
and should offer his own living sacrifice holy unto God Who called him, being consecrated
at all times and in every respect. But if that cannot be, then that those who are akin in virtue
and of like disposition should be made use of as helpers. For I think this provision means
that we should communicate of the Sacrifice to those who are nearest, if there be need.</p>
<note type="footnote">4606 Christ is “a blessed crown of goodness” according to the saying of David, Thou shalt bless the crown of
the year with Thy goodness (Ps. lxv. 11). The idea of a year is taken from the Sun; that of the crown from the
year (for the year is a circle guarded with four seasons), and from the circle again equality. Therefore the crown
is Christ, as adorning and beautifying the minds of believers. But the year of Goodness was that time when
Christ moved by goodness was declaring the Gospel, as Isaiah saith of Him, “He hath sent Me to preach the
Gospel to the poor, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord” (Isa. lxi. 1, 2). Thus the Crown is on every side
equal. For if one draw a line from the upper side to the lower, and the same in a transverse direction, all the
intervals will be equal. And the Crown is like itself, because its figure is seen alike on every side, for on every
side it is seen as a round. Therefore Christ as to His Humanity is called a Crown of Righteousness, as composed
of all the virtues, and having no end of His goodness and righteousness; and of that righteousness one quality
is equality, that is, it allows neither excess nor defect. For excess and defect do not arise from virtue and righteousness,
but from fault and unrighteousness (Nicetas).</note>

<p>XV. Then comes the Sacred Night, the Anniversary of the confused darkness of the
present life, into which the primæval darkness is dissolved, and all things come into life and
rank and form, and that which was chaos is reduced to order. Then we flee from Egypt,
that is from sullen persecuting sin; and from Pharaoh the unseen tyrant, and the bitter
taskmasters, changing our quarters to the world above; and are delivered from the clay and
the brickmaking, and from the husks and dangers of this fleshly condition, which for most
men is only not overpowered by mere husklike calculations. Then the Lamb is slain, and
act and word are sealed with the Precious Blood; that is, habit and action, the sideposts of
our doors; I mean, of course, of the movements of mind and opinion, which are rightly
opened and closed by contemplation, since there is a limit even to thoughts. Then the last
and gravest plague upon the persecutors, truly worthy of the night; and Egypt mourns the
first-born of her own reasonings and actions which are also called in the Scripture the Seed
of the Chaldeans4610 removed, and the children of Babylon dashed against the rocks and
destroyed;4611 and the whole air is full of the cry and clamour of the Egyptians; and then
the Destroyer of them shall withdraw from us in reverence of the Unction. Then the removal
of leaven; that is, of the old and sour wickedness, not of that which is quickening and makes
bread; for seven days, a number which is of all the most mystical,4612 and is co-ordinate
with this present world, that we may not lay in provision of any Egyptian dough, or relic of
Pharisaic or ungodly teaching.</p>
<p>XVI. Well, let them lament; we will feed on the Lamb toward evening—for Christ’s
Passion was in the completion of the ages; because too He communicated His Disciples in
the evening with His Sacrament, destroying the darkness of sin; and not sodden, but
roast—that our word may have in it nothing that is unconsidered or watery, or easily made
away with; but may be entirely consistent and solid, and free from all that is impure and
from all vanity. And let us be aided by the good coals,4613 kindling and purifying our minds

The number Seven Days signifies the passing of time which revolves in weeks. And this number is mystical,
because it is virgin and signifies virginity and the angelic life; for it alone, as arithmeticians teach, of all the
numbers within the decade, is neither a multiple nor a measure, and also contains in itself the Four and the
Three. For there are four elements of the world, and the Trinity is their Creator. He calls it co-ordinate with
the world, because the world was made in seven days, and again because when seven thousand years are completed
the end of the world is to come (Nicetas). S. Augustine (Civ. Dei. c. ii. 31) says that the number Seven often
stands for the Universe, because it is made up of Four which is altogether even (2 and 2 the sum of two even
numbers) and Three which is altogether uneven (1 and 1 and 1).</note>

from Him That cometh to send fire on the earth,4614 that shall destroy all evil habits, and
to hasten its kindling. Whatsoever then there be, of solid and nourishing in the Word, shall
be eaten with the inward parts and hidden things of the mind, and shall be consumed and
given up to spiritual digestion; aye, from head to foot, that is, from the first contemplations
of Godhead to the very last thoughts about the Incarnation. Neither let us carry aught of it
abroad, nor leave it till the morning; because most of our Mysteries may not be carried out
to them that are outside, nor is there beyond this night any further purification; and procrastination
is not creditable to those who have a share in the Word. For just as it is good and
well-pleasing to God not to let anger last through the day,4615 but to get rid of it before
sunset, whether you take this of time or in a mystical sense, for it is not safe for us that the
Sun of Righteousness should go down upon our wrath; so too we ought not to let such Food
remain all night, nor to put it off till to-morrow. But whatever is of bony nature and not fit
for food and hard for us even to understand, this must not be broken; that is, badly divined
and misconceived (I need not say that in the history not a bone of Jesus was broken, even
though His death was hastened by His crucifiers on account of the Sabbath);4616 nor must
it be stripped off and thrown away, lest that which is holy should be given to the dogs,4617
that is, to the evil hearers of the Word; just as the glorious pearl of the Word is not to be
cast before swine; but it shall be consumed with the fire with which the burnt offerings also
are consumed, being refined and preserved by the Spirit That searcheth and knoweth all
things, not destroyed in the waters, nor scattered abroad as the calf’s head which was hastily
made by Israel was by Moses,4618 for a reproach for their hardness of heart.</p>
<p>XVII. Nor would it be right for us to pass over the manner of this eating either, for the
Law does not do so, but carries its mystical labour even to this point in the literal enactment.
Let us consume the Victim in haste, eating It with unleavened bread, with bitter herbs, and
with our loins girded, and our shoes on our feet, and leaning on staves like old men; with
haste, that we fall not into that fault which was forbidden to Lot4619 by the commandment,
that we look not around, nor stay in all that neighbourhood, but that we escape to the

broke their legs; but our Lord, much to their astonishment was dead already, so this course was not taken with

pillar of salt in consequence of our turning back to wickedness; for this is the result of delay.
With bitter herbs, for a life according to the Will of God is bitter and arduous, especially to
beginners, and higher than pleasures. For although the new yoke is easy and the burden
light,4620 as you are told, yet this is on account of the hope and the reward, which is far more
abundant than the hardships of this life. If it were not so, who would not say that the Gospel
is more full of toil and trouble than the enactments of the Law? For, while the Law prohibits
only the completed acts of sin, we are condemned for the causes also, almost as if they were
acts. The Law says, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but you may not even desire, kindling
passion by curious and earnest looks. Thou shalt not kill, says the Law; but you are not even
to return a blow, but on the contrary are to offer yourself to the smiter. How much more
ascetic is the Gospel than the Law! Thou shalt not forswear thyself is the Law; but you are
not to swear at all, either a greater or a lesser oath, for an oath is the parent of perjury. Thou
shalt not join house to house, nor field to field, oppressing the poor;4621 but you are to set
aside willingly even your just possessions, and to be stripped for the poor, that without encumbrance
you may take up the Cross4622 and be enriched with the unseen riches.</p>
<p>XVIII. And let the loins of the unreasoning animals be unbound and loose, for they
have not the gift of reason which can overcome pleasure (it is not needful to say that even
they know the limit of natural movement). But let that part of your being which is the seat
of passion, and which neighs,4623 as Holy Scripture calls it, when sweeping away this
shameful passion, be restrained by a girdle of continence, so that you may eat the Passover
purely, having mortified your members which are upon the earth,4624 and copying the
girdle4625 of John, the Hermit and Forerunner and great Herald of the Truth. Another
girdle I know, the soldierly and manly one, I mean, from which the Euzoni of Syria and
certain Monozoni4626 take their name. And it is in respect of this too that God saith in an
oracle to Job, “Nay, but gird up thy loins like a man, and give a manly answer.”4627 With

this also holy David boasts that he is girded with strength from God,4628 and speaks of God
Himself as clothed with strength4629 and girded about with power—against the ungodly of
course—though perhaps some may prefer to see in this a declaration of the abundance of
His power, and, as it were, its restraint, just as also He clothes Himself with Light as with a
garment.4630 For who shall endure His unrestrained power and light? Do I enquire what
there is common to the loins and to truth? What then is the meaning to S. Paul of the expression,
“Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth?”4631 Is it perhaps that
contemplation is to restrain concupiscence, and not to allow it to be carried in another direction?
For that which is disposed to love in a particular direction will not have the same
power towards other pleasures.</p>
<p>XIX. And as to shoes, let him who is about to touch the Holy Land which the feet of
God have trodden, put them off, as Moses did upon the Mount,4632 that he may bring there
nothing dead; nothing to come between Man and God. So too if any disciple is sent to
preach the Gospel, let him go in a spirit of philosophy and without excess, inasmuch as he
must, besides being without money and without staff and with but one coat, also be barefooted,
4633 that the feet of those who preach the Gospel of Peace and every other good may
appear beautiful.4634 But he who would flee from Egypt and the things of Egypt must put
on shoes for safety’s sake, especially in regard to the scorpions and snakes in which Egypt
so abounds, so as not to be injured by those which watch the heel4635 which also we are
bidden to tread under foot.4636 And concerning the staff and the signification of it, my belief
is as follows. There is one I know to lean upon, and another which belongs to Pastors and
Teachers, and which corrects human sheep. Now the Law prescribes to you the staff to lean
upon, that you may not break down in your mind when you hear of God’s Blood, and His
Passion, and His death; and that you may not be carried away to heresy in your defence of
God; but without shame and without doubt may eat the Flesh and drink the Blood, if you
are desirous of true life, neither disbelieving His words about His Flesh, nor offended at
those about His Passion. Lean upon this, and stand firm and strong, in nothing shaken by
the adversaries nor carried away by the plausibility of their arguments. Stand upon thy

<p>XX. What sayest thou? Thus it hath pleased Him that thou shouldest come forth4638
out of Egypt, the iron furnace; that thou shouldest leave behind the idolatry of that country,
and be led by Moses and his lawgiving and martial rule. I give thee a piece of advice which
is not my own, or rather which is very much my own, if thou consider the matter spiritually.
Borrow from the Egyptians vessels of gold and silver;4639 with these take thy journey; supply
thyself for the road with the goods of strangers, or rather with thine own. There is money
owing to thee, the wages of thy bondage and of thy brickmaking; be clever on thy side too
in asking retribution; be an honest robber. Thou didst suffer wrong there whilst thou wast
fighting with the clay (that is, this troublesome and filthy body) and wast building cities
foreign and unsafe, whose memorial perishes with a cry.4640 What then? Dost thou come
out for nothing and without wages? But why wilt thou leave to the Egyptians and to the
powers of thine adversaries that which they have gained by wickedness, and will spend with
yet greater wickedness? It does not belong to them: they have ravished it, and have sacrilegiously
taken it as plunder from Him who saith, The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,4641
and I give it to whom I will. Yesterday it was theirs, for it was permitted to be so; to-day
the Master takes it and gives it to thee,4642 that thou mayest make a good and saving use of
it. Let us make to ourselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness,4643 that when we
fail, they may receive us in the time of judgment.</p>
<p>XXI. If you are a Rachel or a Leah, a patriarchal and great soul, steal whatever idols of
your father you can find;4644 not, however, that you may keep them, but that you may destroy
them; and if you are a wise Israelite remove them to the Land of the Promise, and let the
persecutor grieve over the loss of them, and learn through being outwitted that it was vain
for him to tyrannize over and keep in bondage better men than himself. If thou doest this,
and comest out of Egypt thus, I know well that thou shalt be guided by the pillar of fire and

for Israel, and to hold the Gentiles in check;4653 and all the other events which are told in
the history after these and with these (not to make a long story) shall be given thee of God.
Such is the feast thou art keeping to-day; and in this manner I would have thee celebrate
both the Birthday and the Burial of Him Who was born for thee and suffered for thee. Such
is the Mystery of the Passover; such are the mysteries sketched by the Law and fulfilled by
Christ, the Abolisher of the letter, the Perfecter of the Spirit, who by His Passion taught us
how to suffer, and by His glorification grants us to be glorified with Him.</p>
<p>XXII.4654 Now we are to examine another fact and dogma, neglected by most people,
but in my judgment well worth enquiring into. To Whom was that Blood offered that was
shed for us, and why was It shed? I mean the precious and famous Blood of our God and
High priest and Sacrifice. We were detained in bondage by the Evil One, sold under sin,
and receiving pleasure in exchange for wickedness. Now, since a ransom belongs only to
him who holds in bondage, I ask to whom was this offered, and for what cause? If to the
Evil One, fie upon the outrage! If the robber receives ransom, not only from God, but a
ransom which consists of God Himself, and has such an illustrious payment for his tyranny,
a payment for whose sake it would have been right for him to have left us alone altogether.
But if to the Father, I ask first, how? For it was not by Him that we were being oppressed;
and next, On what principle did the Blood of His Only begotten Son delight the Father,
Who would not receive even Isaac, when he was being offered by his Father, but changed
the sacrifice, putting a ram in the place of the human victim?4655 Is it not evident that the

Father accepts Him, but neither asked for Him nor demanded Him; but on account of the
Incarnation, and because Humanity must be sanctified by the Humanity of God,4656 that
He might deliver us Himself, and overcome the tyrant, and draw us to Himself by the mediation
of His Son, Who also arranged this to the honour of the Father, Whom it is manifest
that He obeys in all things? So much we have said of Christ; the greater part of what we
might say shall be reverenced with silence. But that brazen serpent4657 was hung up as a
remedy for the biting serpents, not as a type of Him that suffered for us, but as a contrast;
and it saved those that looked upon it, not because they believed it to live, but because it
was killed, and killed with it the powers that were subject to it, being destroyed as it deserved.
And what is the fitting epitaph for it from us? “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where
is thy victory?”4658 Thou art overthrown by the Cross; thou art slain by Him who is the
Giver of life; thou art without breath, dead, without motion, even though thou keepest the
form of a serpent lifted up on high on a pole.</p>
<p>XXIII. Now we will partake of a Passover which is still typical; though it is plainer than
the old one. For that is ever new which is now becoming known. It is ours to learn what is
that drinking and that enjoyment, and His to teach and communicate the Word to His disciples.
For teaching is food, even to the Giver of food. Come hither then, and let us partake
of the Law, but in a Gospel manner, not a literal one; perfectly, not imperfectly; eternally,
not temporarily. Let us make our Head, not the earthly Jerusalem, but the heavenly City;4659
not that which is now trodden under foot by armies,4660 but that which is glorified by Angels.
Let us sacrifice not young calves, nor lambs that put forth horns and hoofs,4661 in which
many parts are destitute of life and feeling; but let us sacrifice to God the sacrifice of praise
upon the heavenly Altar, with the heavenly dances; let us hold aside the first veil; let us approach
the second, and look into the Holy of Holies.4662 Shall I say that which is a greater
thing yet? Let us sacrifice ourselves to God; or rather let us go on sacrificing throughout
every day and at every moment. Let us accept anything for the Word’s sake. By sufferings
let us imitate His Passion: by our blood let us reverence His Blood: let us gladly mount

with Him as a robber,4664 acknowledge God as a penitent robber. If even He was
numbered among the transgressors4665 for you and your sin, do you become law-abiding
for His sake. Worship Him Who was hanged for you, even if you yourself are hanging;
make some gain even from your wickedness; purchase salvation by your death; enter with
Jesus into Paradise,4666 so that you may learn from what you have fallen.4667 Contemplate
the glories that are there; let the murderer die outside with his blasphemies; and if you be a
Joseph of Arimathæa,4668 beg the Body from him that crucified Him, make thine own that
which cleanses the world.4669 If you be a Nicodemus, the worshipper of God by night, bury
Him with spices.4670 If you be a Mary, or another Mary, or a Salome, or a Joanna, weep in
the early morning. Be first to see the stone taken away,4671 and perhaps you will see the
Angels and Jesus Himself. Say something; hear His Voice. If He say to you, Touch Me
not,4672 stand afar off; reverence the Word, but grieve not; for He knoweth those to whom
He appeareth first. Keep the feast of the Resurrection; come to the aid of Eve who was first
to fall, of Her who first embraced the Christ, and made Him known to the disciples. Be a
Peter or a John; hasten to the Sepulchre, running together, running against one another,
vying in the noble race.4673 And even if you be beaten in speed, win the victory of zeal; not
Looking into the tomb, but Going in. And if, like a Thomas, you were left out when the
disciples were assembled to whom Christ shews Himself, when you do see Him be not
faithless;4674 and if you do not believe, then believe those who tell you; and if you cannot
believe them either, then have confidence in the print of the nails. If He descend into

who escort Him, or one of those who receive Him. Bid the gates be lifted up,4677 or be made

doubt because He bears up with Him His body and the tokens of His Passion, which He
had not when He came down, and who therefore inquire, “Who is this King of Glory?” that
it is the Lord strong and mighty, as in all things that He hath done from time to time and
does, so now in His battle and triumph for the sake of Mankind. And give to the doubting
of the question the twofold answer. And if they marvel and say as in Isaiah’s drama Who
is this that cometh from Edom and from the things of earth? Or How are the garments red
of Him that is without blood or body, as of one that treads in the full wine-press?4678 set

this account, that He humbled Himself for your sake, and because to seek for that which
had wandered the Good Shepherd, He who layeth down His life for the sheep,4680 came
upon the mountains and hills upon which you used to sacrifice,4681 and found the wandering
one; and having found it, took it upon His shoulders,4682 on which He also bore the wood;

friend,4685 that prepared for the Lord a peculiar people4686 and cleansed them by the water4687
in preparation for the Spirit? Do you Reproach God with this? Do you conceive of
Him as less because He girds Himself with a towel and washes His disciples,4688 and shows
that humiliation is the best road to exaltation;4689 because He humbles Himself for the sake
of the soul that is bent down to the ground,4690 that He may even exalt with Himself that
which is bent double under a weight of sin? How comes it that you do not also charge it
upon Him as a crime that He eateth with Publicans4691 and at Publicans’ tables, and makes
disciples of Publicans4692 that He too may make some gain. And what gain? The salvation
of sinners. If so, one must blame the physician for stooping over suffering and putting up
with evil smells in order to give health to the sick; and him also who leans over the ditch,
that he may, according to the Law, save the beast that has fallen into it.</p>
<p>XXVII. He was sent, but sent according to His Manhood (for He was of two Natures),
since He was hungry and thirsty and weary, and was distressed and wept, according to the
Laws of human nature. But even if He were sent also as God, what of that? Consider the
Mission to be the good pleasure of the Father, to which He refers all that concerns Himself,
both that He may honour the Eternal Principle, and that He may avoid the appearance of
being a rival God. For He is said on the one hand to have been betrayed, and on the other
it is written that He gave Himself up; and so too that He was raised and taken up by the
Father, and also that of His own power He rose and ascended. The former belongs to the
Good Pleasure, the latter to His own Authority; but you dwell upon all that diminishes Him,
while you ignore all that exalts Him. For instance, you score that He suffered, but you do
not add “of His own Will.” Ah, what things has the Word even now to suffer! By some He
is honoured as God but confused with the Father; by others He is dishonoured as Flesh, and
is severed from God. With whom shall He be most angry—or rather which shall He forgive—
those who falsely contract Him, or those who divide Him? For the former ought to
have made a distinction, and the latter to have made a Union, the one in number, the other
in Godhead. Do you stumble at His Flesh? So did the Jews. Do you call Him a Samaritan,4693

than demons, and more stupid than Jews. The Jews recognized the title Son as expressing
equal rank; and the demons knew that He who drove them out was God, for they were
persuaded by their own experience. But you will not either admit the equality or confess
the Godhead. It would have been better for you to have been circumcised and a demoniac—
to reduce the matter to an absurdity—than in uncircumcision and robust health to be
thus ill and ungodly disposed. But for our war with such men, let it be brought to an end
by their returning, however late, to a sound mind, if they will; or else if they will not, let it
be postponed to another occasion, if they continue as they are. Anyhow, we will have no
fear when contending for the Trinity with the help of the Trinity.</p>
<p>XXVIII. It is now needful for us to sum up our discourse as follows: We were created
that we might be made happy. We were made happy when we were created. We were entrusted
with Paradise that we might enjoy life. We received a Commandment that we might
obtain a good repute by keeping it; not that God did not know what would take place, but
because He had laid down the law of Free Will. We were deceived because we were the
objects of envy. We were cast out because we transgressed. We fasted because we refused
to fast, being overpowered by the Tree of Knowledge. For the Commandment was ancient,
coeval with ourselves, and was a kind of education of our souls and curb of luxury, to which
we were reasonably made subject, in order that we might recover by keeping it that which
we had lost by not keeping it. We needed an Incarnate God, a God put to death, that we
might live. We were put to death together with Him, that we might be cleansed; we rose
again with Him because we were put to death with Him; we were glorified with Him, because
we rose again with Him.</p>
<p>XXIX. Many indeed are the miracles of that time: God crucified; the sun darkened and

rent; the Blood and Water shed from His Side; the one as from a man, the other as above
man; the rocks rent for the Rock’s sake; the dead raised for a pledge of the final Resurrection
of all men; the Signs at the Sepulchre and after the Sepulchre, which none can worthily celebrate;
and yet none of these equal to the Miracle of my salvation. A few drops of Blood
recreate the whole world, and become to all men what rennet is to milk, drawing us together

<head>A Selection from the Letters of Saint Gregory Nazianzen,
Sometime Archbishop of Constantinople.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<head>Division I.</head>
<head>Letters on the Apollinarian Controversy.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The circumstances which called forth the two letters to Cledonius have already been
described in the first section of the General Prolegomena, and it will not be necessary here
to add much to what was there said. In the letter to Nectarius, his own successor on the
throne of Constantinople, written about a.d. 383, and sometimes reckoned as Orat. XLVI.,
S. Gregory gives extracts from a work of Apollinarius himself, but without mentioning the
title of the book. In this treatise the fundamental errors of the heresy (see Proleg. c. 1, p.
172) are laid down. Apollinarius, according to S. Gregory, declares that the Son of God was
from all eternity clothed with a human body, and not from the time of His conception only
by the Blessed Virgin; but that this humanity of God is without human mind, the place of
which was supplied by the Godhead of the Only-begotten. And he goes even further and
ascribes passibility and mortality to the very Godhead of Christ. Therefore S. Gregory
earnestly protests against any toleration being granted to these heretics, or even permission
to hold their assemblies; for, he says, toleration or permission would certainly be regarded
by them as a condonation of their doctrinal position, and a condemnation of that of the
Church. Dr. Ullman, however, thinks that while S. Gregory was certainly speaking the truth
in saying that he had in his hands a pamphlet by Apollinarius, yet that he, perhaps unconsciously,
exaggerated the heretical character of its contents, pushing its statements to consequences
which Apollinarius would have repudiated. The one purpose of the latter was,
in Dr. Ullman’s view, to safeguard the doctrine of the Unity of Christ; and he thought that
the orthodox expression of Two Whole and Perfect Natures tended to a Nestorian division
of the Person of Christ; and so he used language which certainly seemed to confound the
natures, or at any rate to make the Incarnation imperfect, inasmuch as a Christ in Whom
the human mind is absent, and its place filled up by the Godhead of the Son, cannot be said
to be perfect Man. But while Epiphanius mentions these extravagances of the heresy, and
does so with a lingering feeling of regret for the lapse of so good a man whose services in
the past had been of so much value to the Church, yet, in the spirit common to Ecclesiastical

<pb n="856"/>
authorities of the time, he would rather ascribe them to an expansion of Apollinarius’
teaching by his younger disciples who did not really understand what Apollinarius himself
meant.</p>
<p>Olympius, to whom the last of this series is addressed, was Governor of Cappadocia
Secunda in a.d. 382. He was a man for whom S. Gregory had a very high esteem, and with
whom he was upon terms of close friendship, as will be seen from other letters of Gregory
to him in another division of this Selection. The occasion of the present letter was the necessity
to appeal to the secular power for aid to punish a sect of Apollinarians at Nazianzus,
who had ventured to take advantage of S. Gregory’s absence at the Baths of Xanxaris to
procure the consecration of a Bishop of their own way of thinking. Technically the See was
vacant, but the administration had been committed to Gregory by the Bishops of the
Province, and though he, foreseeing some such attempt on the part of the heretics, had been
very earnest in pressing upon the Metropolitan and his Comprovincials the necessity of
filling this throne by a canonical election, yet he was by no means prepared to hand over
the authority, with which he had been invested, to an irregularly elected and uncanonically
consecrated heretic.</p>

<head>To Nectarius, Bishop of Constantinople. (Ep. CCII.)</head>
<p>The Care of God, which throughout the time before us guarded the Churches, seems
to have utterly forsaken this present life. And my soul is immersed to such a degree by
calamities that the private sufferings of my own life hardly seem to be worth reckoning
among evils (though they are so numerous and great, that if they befel anyone else I should
think them unbearable); but I can only look at the common sufferings of the Churches; for
if at the present crisis some pains be not taken to find a remedy for them, things will
gradually get into an altogether desperate condition. Those who follow the heresy of Arius
or Eudoxius (I cannot say who stirred them up to this folly) are making a display of their
disease, as if they had attained some degree of confidence by collecting congregations as if
by permission. And they of the Macedonian party have reached such a pitch of folly that
they are arrogating to themselves the name of Bishops, and are wandering about our districts
babbling of Eleusius4694 as to their ordinations. Our bosom evil, Eunomius, is no longer
content with merely existing; but unless he can draw away everyone with him to his ruinous
heresy, he thinks himself an injured man. All this, however, is endurable. The most grievous
item of all in the woes of the Church is the boldness of the Apollinarians, whom your
Holiness has overlooked, I know not how, when providing themselves with authority to
hold meetings on an equality with myself. However, you being, as you are, thoroughly instructed
by the grace of God in the Divine Mysteries on all points, are well informed, not
only as to the advocacy of the true faith, but also as to all those arguments which have been
devised by the heretics against the sound faith; and yet perhaps it will not be unseasonable
that your Excellency should hear from my littleness that a pamphlet by Apollinarius has
come into my hands, the contents of which surpass all heretical pravity. For he asserts that
the Flesh which the Only-begotten Son assumed in the Incarnation for the remodelling of
our nature was no new acquisition, but that that carnal nature was in the Son from the beginning.
And he puts forward as a witness to this monstrous assertion a garbled quotation
from the Gospels, namely, No man hath Ascended up into Heaven save He which came
down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven.4695 As though even before
He came down He was the Son of Man, and when He came down He brought with Him
that Flesh, which it appears He had in Heaven, as though it had existed before the ages, and
been joined with His Essence. For he alleges another saying of an Apostle, which he cuts
<note type="footnote">4694 Eleusius was Bishop of Cyzicus, a prominent leader of the Semi-Arian party. He bore a very high character
for personal holiness, and approached more nearly to orthodoxy than most of his associates, men like Basil
of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste, etc. He obstinately maintained, however, Macedonian views on the Deity of
the Holy Ghost, even after their condemnation by the Council of Constantinople.</note>
<note type="footnote">4695 John iii. 13.</note>

<pb n="858"/>
off from the whole body of its context, that The Second Man is the Lord from Heaven.4696
Then he assumes that that Man who came down from above is without a mind, but that the
Godhead of the Only-begotten fulfils the function of mind, and is the third part of this human
composite, inasmuch as soul and body are in it on its human side, but not mind, the place
of which is taken by God the Word. This is not yet the most serious part of it; that which
is most terrible of all is that he declares that the Only-begotten God, the Judge of all, the
Prince of Life, the Destroyer of Death, is mortal, and underwent the Passion in His proper
Godhead; and that in the three days’ death of His body, His Godhead also was put to death
with His body, and thus was raised again from the dead by the Father. It would be tedious
to go through all the other propositions which he adds to these monstrous absurdities.
Now, if they who hold such views have authority to meet, your Wisdom approved in Christ
must see that, inasmuch as we do not approve their views, any permission of assembly
granted to them is nothing less than a declaration that their view is thought more true than
ours. For if they are permitted to teach their view as godly men, and with all confidence to
preach their doctrine, it is manifest that the doctrine of the Church has been condemned,
as though the truth were on their side. For nature does not admit of two contrary doctrines
on the same subject being both true. How then could your noble and lofty mind submit to
suspend your usual courage in regard to the correction of so great an evil? But even though
there is no precedent for such a course, let your inimitable perfection in virtue stand up at
a crisis like the present, and teach our most pious Emperor, that no gain will come from his
zeal for the Church on other points if he allows such an evil to gain strength from freedom
of speech for the subversion of sound faith.</p>

<head>To Cledonius the Priest Against Apollinarius. (Ep. CI.)</head>
<p>To our most reverend and God-beloved brother and fellow-priest Cledonius, Gregory, greeting
in the Lord.</p>
<p>I desire to learn what is this fashion of innovation in things Concerning the Church,
which allows anyone who likes, or the passerby,4697 as the Bible says, to tear asunder the
flock that has been well led, and to plunder it by larcenous attacks, or rather by piratical and
fallacious teachings. For if our present assailants had any ground for condemning us in regard
of the faith, it would not have been right for them, even in that case, to have ventured
on such a course without giving us notice. They ought rather to have first persuaded us, or
to have been willing to be persuaded by us (if at least any account is to be taken of us as
fearing God, labouring for the faith, and helping the Church), and then, if at all, to innovate;
but then perhaps there would be an excuse for their outrageous conduct. But since our faith
has been proclaimed, both in writing and without writing, here and in distant parts, in times
of danger and of safety, how comes it that some make such attempts, and that others keep
silence?</p>
<p>The most grievous part of it is not (though this too is shocking) that the men instil their
own heresy into simpler souls by means of those who are worse; but that they also tell lies
about us and say that we share their opinions and sentiments; thus baiting their hooks, and
by this cloak villainously fulfilling their will, and making our simplicity, which looked upon
them as brothers and not as foes, into a support of their wickedness. And not only so, but
they also assert, as I am told, that they have been received by the Western Synod, by which
they were formerly condemned, as is well known to everyone. If, however, those who hold
the views of Apollinarius have either now or formerly been received, let them prove it and
we will be content. For it is evident that they can only have been so received as assenting
to the Orthodox Faith, for this were an impossibility on any other terms. And they can
surely prove it, either by the minutes of the Synod, or by Letters of Communion, for this is
the regular custom of Synods. But if it is mere words, and an invention of their own, devised
for the sake of appearances and to give them weight with the multitude through the credit
of the persons, teach them to hold their tongues, and confute them; for we believe that such
a task is well suited to your manner of life and orthodoxy. Do not let the men deceive
themselves and others with the assertion that the “Man of the Lord,” as they call Him, Who
is rather our Lord and God, is without human mind. For we do not sever the Man from
the Godhead, but we lay down as a dogma the Unity and Identity of Person, Who of old
was not Man but God, and the Only Son before all ages, unmingled with body or anything
corporeal; but Who in these last days has assumed Manhood also for our salvation; passible
<note type="footnote">4697 Ps. lxxx. 12.</note>

<pb n="860"/>
in His Flesh, impassible in His Godhead; circumscript in the body, uncircumscript in the
Spirit; at once earthly and heavenly, tangible and intangible, comprehensible and incomprehensible;
that by One and the Same Person, Who was perfect Man and also God, the entire
humanity fallen through sin might be created anew.</p>
<p>If anyone does not believe that Holy Mary is the Mother of God, he is severed from the
Godhead. If anyone should assert that He passed through the Virgin as through a channel,
and was not at once divinely and humanly formed in her (divinely, because without the intervention
of a man; humanly, because in accordance with the laws of gestation), he is in
like manner godless. If any assert that the Manhood was formed and afterward was clothed
with the Godhead, he too is to be condemned. For this were not a Generation of God, but
a shirking of generation. If any introduce the notion of Two Sons, one of God the Father,
the other of the Mother, and discredits the Unity and Identity, may he lose his part in the
adoption promised to those who believe aright. For God and Man are two natures, as also
soul and body are; but there are not two Sons or two Gods. For neither in this life are there
two manhoods; though Paul speaks in some such language of the inner and outer man.
And (if I am to speak concisely) the Saviour is made of elements which are distinct from
one another (for the invisible is not the same with the visible, nor the timeless with that
which is subject to time), yet He is not two Persons. God forbid! For both natures are one
by the combination, the Deity being made Man, and the Manhood deified or however one
should express it. And I say different Elements, because it is the reverse of what is the case
in the Trinity; for There we acknowledge different Persons so as not to confound the persons;
but not different Elements, for the Three are One and the same in Godhead.</p>
<p>If any should say that it wrought in Him by grace as in a Prophet, but was not and is
not united with Him in Essence—let him be empty of the Higher Energy, or rather full of
the opposite. If any worship not the Crucified, let him be Anathema and be numbered
among the Deicides. If any assert that He was made perfect by works, or that after His
Baptism, or after His Resurrection from the dead, He was counted worthy of an adoptive
Sonship, like those whom the Greeks interpolate as added to the ranks of the gods, let him
be anathema. For that which has a beginning or a progress or is made perfect, is not God,
although the expressions may be used of His gradual manifestation. If any assert that He
has now put off His holy flesh, and that His Godhead is stripped of the body, and deny that
He is now with His body and will come again with it, let him not see the glory of His Coming.
For where is His body now, if not with Him Who assumed it? For it is not laid by in the
sun, according to the babble of the Manichæans, that it should be honoured by a dishonour;
nor was it poured forth into the air and dissolved, as is the nature of a voice or the flow of
an odour, or the course of a lightning flash that never stands. Where in that case were His
being handled after the Resurrection, or His being seen hereafter by them that pierced Him,
for Godhead is in its nature invisible. Nay; He will come with His body—so I have

<pb n="861"/>
learnt—such as He was seen by His Disciples in the Mount, or as he shewed Himself for a
moment, when his Godhead overpowered the carnality. And as we say this to disarm suspicion,
so we write the other to correct the novel teaching. If anyone assert that His flesh
came down from heaven, and is not from hence, nor of us though above us, let him be
anathema. For the words, The Second Man is the Lord from Heaven;4698 and, As is the
Heavenly, such are they that are Heavenly; and, No man hath ascended up into Heaven save
He which came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in Heaven;4699 and the
like, are to be understood as said on account of the Union with the heavenly; just as that All
Things were made by Christ,4700 and that Christ dwelleth in your hearts4701 is said, not of
the visible nature which belongs to God, but of what is perceived by the mind, the names
being mingled like the natures, and flowing into one another, according to the law of their
intimate union.</p>
<p>If anyone has put his trust in Him as a Man without a human mind, he is really bereft
of mind, and quite unworthy of salvation. For that which He has not assumed He has not
healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then
that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it
must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.
Let them not, then, begrudge us our complete salvation, or clothe the Saviour only with
bones and nerves and the portraiture of humanity. For if His Manhood is without soul,
even the Arians admit this, that they may attribute His Passion to the Godhead, as that
which gives motion to the body is also that which suffers. But if He has a soul, and yet is
without a mind, how is He man, for man is not a mindless animal? And this would necessarily
involve that while His form and tabernacle was human, His soul should be that of a
horse or an ox, or some other of the brute creation. This, then, would be what He saves;
and I have been deceived by the Truth, and led to boast of an honour which had been bestowed
upon another. But if His Manhood is intellectual and nor without mind, let them
cease to be thus really mindless. But, says such an one, the Godhead took the place of the
human intellect. How does this touch me? For Godhead joined to flesh alone is not man,
nor to soul alone, nor to both apart from intellect, which is the most essential part of man.
Keep then the whole man, and mingle Godhead therewith, that you may benefit me in my
completeness. But, he asserts, He could not contain Two perfect Natures. Not if you only
look at Him in a bodily fashion. For a bushel measure will not hold two bushels, nor will
the space of one body hold two or more bodies. But if you will look at what is mental and

<note type="footnote">4700 John i. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">4701 Ephes. iii. 17.</note>

<pb n="862"/>
incorporeal, remember that I in my one personality can contain soul and reason and mind
and the Holy Spirit; and before me this world, by which I mean the system of things visible
and invisible, contained Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For such is the nature of intellectual
Existences, that they can mingle with one another and with bodies, incorporeally and invisibly.
For many sounds are comprehended by one ear; and the eyes of many are occupied
by the same visible objects, and the smell by odours; nor are the senses narrowed by each
other, or crowded out, nor the objects of sense diminished by the multitude of the perceptions.
But where is there mind of man or angel so perfect in comparison of the Godhead
that the presence of the greater must crowd out the other? The light is nothing compared
with the sun, nor a little damp compared with a river, that we must first do away with the
lesser, and take the light from a house, or the moisture from the earth, to enable it to contain
the greater and more perfect. For how shall one thing contain two completenesses, either
the house, the sunbeam and the sun, or the earth, the moisture and the river? Here is matter
for inquiry; for indeed the question is worthy of much consideration. Do they not know,
then, that what is perfect by comparison with one thing may be imperfect by comparison
with another, as a hill compared with a mountain, or a grain of mustard seed with a bean
or any other of the larger seeds, although it may be called larger than any of the same kind?
Or, if you like, an Angel compared with God, or a man with an Angel. So our mind is perfect
and commanding, but only in respect of soul and body; not absolutely perfect; and a servant
and a subject of God, not a sharer of His Princedom and honour. So Moses was a God to
Pharaoh,4702 but a servant of God,4703 as it is written; and the stars which illumine the night
are hidden by the Sun, so much that you could not even know of their existence by daylight;
and a little torch brought near a great blaze is neither destroyed, nor seen, nor extinguished;
but is all one blaze, the bigger one prevailing over the other.</p>
<p>But, it may be said, our mind is subject to condemnation. What then of our flesh? Is
that not subject to condemnation? You must therefore either set aside the latter on account
of sin, or admit the former on account of salvation. If He assumed the worse that He might
sanctify it by His incarnation, may He not assume the better that it may be sanctified by His
becoming Man? If the clay was leavened and has become a new lump, O ye wise men, shall
not the Image be leavened and mingled with God, being deified by His Godhead? And I
will add this also: If the mind was utterly rejected, as prone to sin and subject to damnation,
and for this reason He assumed a body but left out the mind, then there is an excuse for
them who sin with the mind; for the witness of God—according to you—has shewn the
impossibility of healing it. Let me state the greater results. You, my good sir, dishonour
<note type="footnote">4702 Exod. vii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">4703 Num. xii. 7.</note>

<pb n="863"/>
my mind (you a Sarcolater, if I am an Anthropolater4704) that you may tie God down to the
Flesh, since He cannot be otherwise tied; and therefore you take away the wall of partition.
But what is my theory, who am but an ignorant man, and no Philosopher. Mind is mingled
with mind, as nearer and more closely related, and through it with flesh, being a Mediator
between God and carnality.</p>
<p>Further let us see what is their account of the assumption of Manhood, or the assumption
of Flesh, as they call it. If it was in order that God, otherwise incomprehensible, might be
comprehended, and might converse with men through His Flesh as through a veil, their
mask and the drama which they represent is a pretty one, not to say that it was open to Him
to converse with us in other ways, as of old, in the burning bush4705 and in the appearance
of a man.4706 But if it was that He might destroy the condemnation by sanctifying like by
like, then as He needed flesh for the sake of the flesh which had incurred condemnation,
and soul for the sake of our soul, so, too, He needed mind for the sake of mind, which not
only fell in Adam, but was the first to be affected, as the doctors say of illnesses. For that
which received the command was that which failed to keep the command, and that which
failed to keep it was that also which dared to transgress; and that which transgressed was
that which stood most in need of salvation; and that which needed salvation was that which
also He took upon Him. Therefore, Mind was taken upon Him. This has now been
demonstrated, whether they like it or no, by, to use their own expression, geometrical and
necessary proofs. But you are acting as if, when a man’s eye had been injured and his foot
had been injured in consequence, you were to attend to the foot and leave the eye uncared
for; or as if, when a painter had drawn something badly, you were to alter the picture, but
to pass over the artist as if he had succeeded. But if they, overwhelmed by these arguments,
take refuge in the proposition that it is possible for God to save man even apart from mind,
why, I suppose that it would be possible for Him to do so also apart from flesh by a mere
act of will, just as He works all other things, and has wrought them without body. Take
away, then, the flesh as well as the mind, that your monstrous folly may be complete. But
they are deceived by the latter, and, therefore, they run to the flesh, because they do not
know the custom of Scripture. We will teach them this also. For what need is there even
to mention to those who know it, the fact that everywhere in Scripture he is called Man, and
the Son of Man?</p>
<note type="footnote">4704 The Apollinarians seem to have charged the Orthodox with being Anthropolaters, or worshippers of a
mere Man. S. Gregory retorts upon them that if so, they are worse themselves, being actually Sarcolaters, or
worshippers of mere flesh, denying Mind to Him whom they adore as Lord and Saviour.</note>

<pb n="864"/>
<p>If, however, they rely on the passage, The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us,4707
and because of this erase the noblest part of Man (as cobblers do the thicker part of skins)
that they may join together God and Flesh, it is time for them to say that God is God only
of flesh, and not of souls, because it is written, “As Thou hast given Him power over all
Flesh,”4708 and “Unto Thee shall all Flesh come;”4709 and “Let all Flesh bless His holy
Name,”4710 meaning every Man. Or, again, they must suppose that our fathers went down
into Egypt without bodies and invisible, and that only the Soul of Joseph was imprisoned
by Pharaoh, because it is written, “They went down into Egypt with threescore and fifteen
Souls,”4711 and “The iron entered into his Soul,”4712 a thing which could not be bound.
They who argue thus do not know that such expressions are used by Synecdoche, declaring
the whole by the part, as when Scripture says that the young ravens call upon God,4713 to
indicate the whole feathered race; or Pleiades, Hesperus, and Arcturus4714 are mentioned,
instead of all the Stars and His Providence over them.</p>
<p>Moreover, in no other way was it possible for the Love of God toward us to be manifested
than by making mention of our flesh, and that for our sake He descended even to our lower
part. For that flesh is less precious than soul, everyone who has a spark of sense will acknowledge.
And so the passage, The Word was made Flesh, seems to me to be equivalent to that
in which it is said that He was made sin,4715 or a curse4716 for us; not that the Lord was
transformed into either of these, how could He be? But because by taking them upon Him
He took away our sins and bore our iniquities.4717 This, then, is sufficient to say at the
present time for the sake of clearness and of being understood by the many. And I write it,
not with any desire to compose a treatise, but only to check the progress of deceit; and if it
is thought well, I will give a fuller account of these matters at greater length.</p>
<p>But there is a matter which is graver than these, a special point which it is necessary
that I should not pass over. I would they were even cut off that trouble you,4718 and would

For if this be done, what hinders Christ also being born again to set them aside, and again

<p>But since, puffed up by their theory of the Trinity, they falsely accuse us of being unsound
in the Faith and entice the multitude, it is necessary that people should know that Apollinarius,
while granting the Name of Godhead to the Holy Ghost, did not preserve the Power
of the Godhead. For to make the Trinity consist of Great, Greater, and Greatest, as of Light,
Ray, and Sun, the Spirit and the Son and the Father (as is clearly stated in his writings), is a
ladder of Godhead not leading to Heaven, but down from Heaven. But we recognize God
the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and these not as bare titles, dividing inequalities
of ranks or of power, but as there is one and the same title, so there is one nature and one
substance in the Godhead.</p>
<p>But if anyone who thinks we have spoken rightly on this subject reproaches us with
holding communion with heretics, let him prove that we are open to this charge, and we
will either convince him or retire. But it is not safe to make any innovation before judgment
is given, especially in a matter of such importance, and connected with so great issues. We
have protested and continue to protest this before God and men. And not even now, be
well assured, should we have written this, if we had not seen that the Church was being torn
asunder and divided, among their other tricks, by their present synagogue of vanity.4719
But if anyone when we say and protest this, either from some advantage they will thus gain,
or through fear of men, or monstrous littleness of mind, or through some neglect of pastors
and governors, or through love of novelty and proneness to innovations, rejects us as unworthy
of credit, and attaches himself to such men, and divides the noble body of the Church,
he shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be,4720 and shall give account to God in the
day of judgment.4721 But if their long books, and their new Psalters, contrary to that of
David, and the grace of their metres, are taken for a third Testament, we too will compose
Psalms, and will write much in metre. For we also think we have the spirit of God,4722 if
indeed this is a gift of the Spirit, and not a human novelty. This I will that thou declare

<head>Against Apollinarius; The Second Letter to Cledonius. (Ep. CII.)</head>
<p>Forasmuch as many persons have come to your Reverence seeking confirmation of their
faith, and therefore you have affectionately asked me to put forth a brief definition and rule
of my opinion, I therefore write to your Reverence, what indeed you knew before, that I
never have and never can honour anything above the Nicene Faith, that of the Holy Fathers
who met there to destroy the Arian heresy; but am, and by God’s help ever will be, of that
faith; completing in detail that which was incompletely said by them concerning the Holy
Ghost; for that question had not then been mooted, namely, that we are to believe that the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of one Godhead, thus confessing the Spirit also to be God.
Receive then to communion those who think and teach thus, as I also do; but those who are
otherwise minded refuse, and hold them as strangers to God and the Catholic Church. And
since a question has also been mooted concerning the Divine Assumption of humanity, or
Incarnation, state this also clearly to all concerning me, that I join in One the Son, who was
begotten of the Father, and afterward of the Virgin Mary, and that I do not call Him two
Sons, but worship Him as One and the same in undivided Godhead and honour. But if
anyone does not assent to this statement, either now or hereafter, he shall give account to
God at the day of judgment.</p>
<p>Now, what we object and oppose to their mindless opinion about His Mind is this, to
put it shortly; for they are almost alone in the condition which they lay down, as it is through
want of mind that they mutilate His mind. But, that they may not accuse us of having once
accepted but of now repudiating the faith of their beloved Vitalius4723 which he handed in
in writing at the request of the blessed Bishop Damasus of Rome, I will give a short explanation
on this point also. For these men, when they are theologizing among their genuine
disciples, and those who are initiated into their secrets, like the Manichæans among those
whom they call the “Elect,” expose the full extent of their disease, and scarcely allow flesh
at all to the Saviour. But when they are refuted and pressed with the common answers about
the Incarnation which the Scripture presents, they confess indeed the orthodox words, but
<note type="footnote">4723 Vitalius or Vitalis was one of the principal followers of Apollinarius, and by him was consecrated
schismatical Bishop of Antioch, where, while yet orthodox, he had been ordained a priest by Meletius. But he
quarrelled with his Bishop through jealousy of another priest, and then fell under the influence of Apollinarius.
He was summoned to Rome to clear himself of the charge of heresy; and by a clever manipulation of language
he produced a confession which the Pope, Damasus, accepted as orthodox; but the Pope remitted the whole
case to Paulinus, who was at that time recognized by the Western Church as rightful Bishop. Vitalius, however,
was unable to accept the test required, and seceded. On his return from Rome he had visited Nazianzus, where
S. Gregory received him as a brother in the faith, though further acquaintance compelled him to withdraw from​​ this position. Vitalius, while admitting that our Lord had both a human body and a human soul, denied Him
a human mind; whose place, according to his teaching, was supplied by Divinity.</note>

<pb n="868"/>
they do violence to the sense; for they acknowledge the Manhood to be neither without soul
nor without reason nor without mind, nor imperfect, but they bring in the Godhead to
supply the soul and reason and mind, as though It had mingled Itself only with His flesh,
and not with the other properties belonging to us men; although His sinlessness was far
above us, and was the cleansing of our passions.</p>
<p>Thus, then, they interpret wrongly the words, But we have the Mind of Christ,4724 and
very absurdly, when they say that His Godhead is the mind of Christ, and not understanding
the passage as we do, namely, that they who have purified their mind by the imitation of
the mind which the Saviour took of us, and, as far as may be, have attained conformity with
it, are said to have the mind of Christ; just as they might be testified to have the flesh of
Christ who have trained their flesh, and in this respect have become of the same body and
partakers of Christ; and so he says “As we have borne the image of the earth4725 we shall
also bear the image of the heavenly.” And so they declare that the Perfect Man is not He
who was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin;4726 but the mixture of God and
Flesh. For what, say they, can be more perfect than this?</p>
<p>They play the same trick with the word that describes the Incarnation, viz.: He was
made Man, explaining it to mean, not, He was in the human nature with which He surrounded
Himself, according to the Scripture, He knew what was in man;4727 but teaching that
it means, He consorted and conversed with men, and taking refuge in the expression which
says that He was seen on Earth and conversed with Men.4728 And what can anyone contend
further? They who take away the Humanity and the Interior Image cleanse by their newly
invented mask only our outside,4729 and that which is seen; so far in conflict with themselves
that at one time, for the sake of the flesh, they explain all the rest in a gross and carnal
manner (for it is from hence that they have derived their second Judaism and their silly
thousand years delight in paradise, and almost the idea that we shall resume again the same
conditions after these same thousand years); and at another time they bring in His flesh as
a phantom rather than a reality, as not having been subjected to any of our experiences, not
even such as are free from sin; and use for this purpose the apostolic expression, understood
and spoken in a sense which is not apostolic, that our Saviour was made in the likeness of
Men and found in fashion as a Man,4730 as though by these words was expressed, not the
human form, but some delusive phantom and appearance.</p>

<pb n="869"/>
<p>Since then these expressions, rightly understood, make for orthodoxy, but wrongly interpreted
are heretical, what is there to be surprised at if we received the words of Vitalius
in the more orthodox sense; our desire that they should be so meant persuading us, though
others are angry at the intention of his writings? This is, I think, the reason why Damasus
himself, having been subsequently better informed, and at the same time learning that they
hold by their former explanations, excommunicated them and overturned their written
confession of faith with an Anathema; as well as because he was vexed at the deceit which
he had suffered from them through simplicity.</p>
<p>Since, then, they have been openly convicted of this, let them not be angry, but let them
be ashamed of themselves; and let them not slander us, but abase themselves and wipe off
from their portals that great and marvellous proclamation and boast of their orthodoxy,
meeting all who go in at once with the question and distinction that we must worship, not
a God-bearing Man, but a flesh-bearing God. What could be more unreasonable than this,
though these new heralds of truth think a great deal of the title? For though it has a certain
sophistical grace through the quickness of its antithesis, and a sort of juggling quackery
grateful to the uninstructed, yet it is the most absurd of absurdities and the most foolish of
follies. For if one were to change the word Man or Flesh into God (the first would please
us, the second them), and then were to use this wonderful antithesis, so divinely recognized,
what conclusion should we arrive at? That we must worship, not a God-bearing Flesh, but
a Man-bearing God. O monstrous absurdity! They proclaim to us to-day a wisdom hidden
ever since the time of Christ—a thing worthy of our tears. For if the faith began thirty years
ago, when nearly four hundred years had passed since Christ was manifested, vain all that
time will have been our Gospel, and vain our faith; in vain will the Martyrs have borne their
witness, and in vain have so many and so great Prelates presided over the people; and Grace
is a matter of metres and not of the faith.</p>
<p>And who will not marvel at their learning, in that on their own authority they divide
the things of Christ, and assign to His Manhood such sayings as He was born, He was
tempted, He was hungry, He was thirsty, He was wearied, He was asleep; but reckon to His
Divinity such as these: He was glorified by Angels, He overcame the Tempter, He fed the
people in the wilderness, and He fed them in such a manner, and He walked upon the sea;
and say on the one hand that the “Where have ye laid Lazarus?”4731 belongs to us, but the
loud voice “Lazarus, Come Forth”4732 and the raising him that had been four days dead, is
above our nature; and that while the “He was in an Agony, He was crucified, He was buried,”
belongs to the Veil, on the other hand, “He was confident, He rose again, He ascended,”
belong to the Inner Treasure; and then they accuse us of introducing two natures, separate
<note type="footnote">4731 John xi. 34.</note>
<note type="footnote">4732 Ib. xi. 43.</note>

or conflicting, and of dividing the supernatural and wondrous Union. They ought, either
not to do that of which they accuse us, or not to accuse us of that which they do; so at least
if they are resolved to be consistent and not to propound at once their own and their oppon-
ents’ principles. Such is their want of reason; it conflicts both with itself and with the truth
to such an extent that they are neither conscious nor ashamed of it when they fall out with
themselves. Now, if anyone thinks that we write all this willingly and not upon compulsion,
and that we are dissuading from unity, and not doing our utmost to promote it, let him
know that he is very much mistaken, and has not made at all a good guess at our desires,
for nothing is or ever has been more valuable in our eyes than peace, as the facts themselves
prove; though their actions and brawlings against us altogether exclude unanimity.</p>

<p>Even hoar hairs have something to learn; and old age, it would seem, cannot in all respects
be trusted for wisdom. I at any rate, knowing better than anyone, as I did, the thoughts
and the heresy of the Apollinarians, and seeing that their folly was intolerable; yet thinking
that I could tame them by patience and soften them by degrees, I let my hopes make me
eager to attain this object. But, as it seems, I overlooked the fact that I was making them
worse, and injuring the Church by my untimely philosophy. For gentleness does not put
bad men out of countenance. And now if it had been possible for me to teach you this myself,
I should not have hesitated, you may be sure, even to undertake a journey beyond my
strength to throw myself at the feet of your Excellency. But since my illness has brought
me too far, and it has become necessary for me to try the hot baths of Xanxaris at the advice
of my medical men, I send a letter to represent me. These wicked and utterly abandoned
men have dared, in addition to all their other misdeeds, either to summon, or to make a
bad use of the passage (I am not prepared to say precisely which) of certain Bishops, deprived
by the whole Synod of the Eastern and Western Church; and, in violation of all Imperial
Ordinances, and of your commands, to confer the name of Bishop on a certain individual
of their own misbelieving and deceitful crew; encouraged to do so, as I believe, by nothing
so much as my great infirmity; for I must mention this. If this is to be tolerated, your Excellency
will tolerate it, and I too will bear it, as I have often before. But if it is serious, and not
to be endured by our most august Emperors, pray punish what has been done—though
more mildly than such madness merits.</p>

Everything that comes from you is pleasant to me, no matter what it may be, and how it

but all your life is one long night, and a real shadow of death, to use a Scripture phrase. And
admire your strait and narrow road, leading<gap reason=" omitted"/>I know not if it be to the Kingdom, or to

what is your wish? Am I falsely to call it Eden, and the fountain divided into four heads, by
which the world is watered, or the dry and waterless wilderness (only what Moses will come
to tame it, bringing water out of the rock with his staff)? For all of it which has escaped the
rocks is full of gullies; and that which is not a gully is a thicket of thorns; and whatever is
above the thorns is a precipice; and the road above that is precipitous, and slopes both ways,
exercising the mind of travellers, and calling for gymnastic exercises for safety. And the
river rushes roaring down, which to you is a Strymon of Amphipolis for quietness, and there
are not so many fishes in it as stones, nor does it flow into a lake, but it dashes into abysses,
O my grandiloquent friend and inventor of new names. For it is great and terrible, and
overwhelms the psalmody of those who live above it; like the Cataracts and Catadoupa of
the Nile, so does it roar you down day and night. It is rough and fordless; and it has only
this morsel of kindness about it, that it does not sweep away your dwelling when the torrents
and winter storms make it mad. This then is what I think of those Fortunate Islands and
of you happy people. And you are not to admire the crescent-shaped curves which strangle

than involuntary delight. O that one would give me back those psalmodies and vigils and
those sojournings with God in prayer, and that immaterial, so to speak, and unbodied life.
O for the intimacy and one-souledness of the brethren who were by you divinized and exalted:
O for the contest and incitement of virtue which we secured by written Rules and
Canons; O for the loving labour in the Divine Oracles, and the light we found in them by
the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Or, if I may speak of lesser and slighter matters, O for the
daily courses and experiences; O for the gatherings of wood, and the cutting of stone; O for
the golden plane-tree, more precious than that of Xerxes, under which sat, not a King enfeebled

your honourable self) watered;4734 but God gave the increase to our honour, that a memorial
might remain among you of my diligence, as in the Ark we read and believe, did Aaron’s
rod that budded.4735 To long for all this is very easy, but it is not easy to attain it. But do
you come to me, and conspire with me in virtue, and co-operate with me, and aid me by
your prayers to keep the profit which we used to get together, that I may not perish by little

<p>It is a time for prudence and endurance, and that we should not let anyone appear to
be of higher courage than ourselves, or let all our labours and toils be in an instant brought
to nothing. Why do I write this, and wherefore? Our Bishop Eusebius, very dear to God
(for so we must for the future both think and write of him), is very much disposed to
agreement and friendship with us; and as fire softens iron, so has time softened him; and I
think a letter of appeal and invitation will come to you from him, as he intimated to me,
and as many persons who are well acquainted with his affairs assure me. Let us be beforehand
with him then, either by going to him, or by writing to him; or rather by first writing and
then going; in order that we may not by and by be put to shame by being defeated when it
was in our power to secure a victory by being honourably and philosophically beaten, which
so many are asking from us. Be persuaded by me then, and come; both on this account and
on account of the bad times; for a conspiracy of heretics is assailing the Church; some of
them are here now, and are troubling us; and others, rumour says, are coming; and there is
reason to fear lest the Word of Truth should be swept away, unless there be stirred up very

<p>Since I am addressing a man who does not love falsehood, and who is the keenest man
I know at detecting it in another, however it may be twined in skilful and varied labyrinths;
and, moreover, on my own part I will say it, though against the grain I do not like artifice,
either, both from my natural constitution, and because God’s Word has formed me so.
Therefore I write what presents itself to my mind; and I beg you to excuse my plain speaking,
or you will wrong the truth by depriving me of my liberty, and forcing me to restrain within
myself the pain of my grief, like some secret and malignant disease. I rejoice that I have
your respect (for I am a man, as some one has said before), and that I am summoned to
Synods and spiritual conferences. But I am troubled at the slight which has been inflicted
on my most Reverend brother Basil, and is still inflicted on him by Your Reverence; for I
chose him as the companion of my life and words and highest philosophy, and he is so still;
and I never had reason to regret my judgment of him. It is more temperate to speak thus
of him, that I may not seem to be praising myself in admiring him. You, however, I think,
by honouring me and dishonouring him, seem to be acting like a man who should with one

up the foundations of a house should paint the walls and decorate the exterior. If then you
will listen to me, this is what you will do, and I claim to be listened to, for this is justice. If
you will pay due attention to him, he will do the like by you. And I will follow him as a
shadow does the body, being of little worth and inclined to peace. For I am not so mean as
to be willing in other respects to philosophize, and to be of the better part, but to overlook
a matter which is the end of all our teaching, namely love; especially in regard to a Priest,
and one of so high a character, and one whom I know of all my acquaintances to be the best
both in life and doctrine and conduct. For my pain shall not obscure the truth.</p>

<p>I did not write in an insolent spirit, as you complain of my letter, but rather in a spiritual
and philosophical one, and as was fitting, unless this too wrongs “your most eloquent
Gregory.” For though you are my Superior in rank, yet you will grant me something of
liberty and just freedom of speech. Therefore be kinder to me. But if you regard my letter
as coming from a servant, and from one who has not the right even to look you in the face,
I will in this instance accept your stripes and not even shed a tear. Will you blame me for
this also? That would befit anyone rather than your Reverence. For it is the part of a highsouled
man to accept more readily the freedom of a friend than the flattery of an enemy.</p>

<p>I was never meanly disposed towards your Reverence; do not find me guilty. But after
allowing myself a little liberty and boldness, just to relieve and heal my grief, I at once bowed
and submitted, and willingly subjected myself to the Canon. What else could I have done,
knowing both you and the Law of the Spirit? But if I had been ever so mean and ignoble in
my sentiments, yet the present time would not allow such feelings, nor the wild beasts which
are rushing on the Church, nor your own courage and manliness, so purely and genuinely
fighting for the Church. I will come then, if you wish it, and take part with you in prayers
and in conflict, and will serve you, and like cheering boys will stir up the noble athlete by
my exhortations.</p>

<head>Ep. XL. To the Great Basil.</head>
<p>(About the middle of the year 370. On the death of Eusebius Basil seems to have formed
a desire that his friend Gregory should succeed to the vacant Metropolitanate; and so he
wrote to him, without mentioning the death of the Archbishop, to come to him at Cæsarea,
representing himself as dangerously ill. Gregory, deeply grieved at the news, set off at once,
but had not proceeded far on his way when he learned that Basil was in his usual health,
and that the Bishops of the Province were assembling at Cæsarea for the Election of a Metropolitan.
He saw through the artifice at once; and thinking that Basil had wished to secure
his presence at the Metropolis in order that his influence might bring about his own (Basil’s)
Election, he wrote him the following indignant letter. Nevertheless both he and his father
felt that no one was so well fitted to succeed to the vacant throne; and so Gregory wrote in
his father’s name the three letters which we have placed next, addressed respectively to the
people of Cæsarea, to the Bishops attending the Synod, and to Eusebius Bishop of Samosata.)</p>
<p>Do not be surprized if I say something strange, which has not been said before by anyone.
I think you have the reputation of being a steady safe and strong-minded man, but also of
being more simple than safe in much that you plan and do. For that which is free from evil
is also in proportion slow to suspect evil, as is shewn by what has just occurred. You have
summoned me to the Metropolis at the moment when a council has been called for the
election of a Bishop, and your pretext is very seemly and plausible. You pretend to be very
ill, indeed at your last breath, and to long to see me and to bid me a last farewell; I do not
know with what object, even what my presence can effect in the matter. I started in great
grief at what had happened; for what could be of higher value to me than your life, or more
distressing than your departure? And I shed a fountain of tears; and I wailed aloud; and I
felt myself now for the first time unphilosophically disposed. What did I leave unperformed
of all that befits a funeral? But as soon as I found that the Bishops were assembling at the
City, at once I stopped short in my course; and I wondered first that you had not perceived
what was proper, or guarded against people’s tongues, which are so given to slander the
guileless; and secondly that you did not think the same course to be fitting for me as for
yourself, though our life and our rule and everything is common to us both, who have been
so closely associated by God from the first. Thirdly, for I must say this also, I wondered
whether you remembered that such nominations are worthy of the more religious, not of
the more powerful, nor of those most in favour with the multitude. For these reasons then
I backed water, and held back. Now, if you think as I do, come to this determination, to
avoid these public turmoils and evil suspicions. I shall see your Reverence when the matters
are settled and time allows, and I shall have more and graver reproaches to address to you.</p>

<head>Ep. XLI. To the People of Cæsarea, in His Father’s Name.</head>
<p>I am a little shepherd, and preside over a tiny flock, and I am among the least of the
servants of the Spirit. But Grace is not narrow, or circumscribed by place. Wherefore let
freedom of speech be given even to the small,—especially when the subject matter is of such
great importance, and one in which all are interested—even to deliberate with men of hoary
hairs, who speak with perhaps greater wisdom than the ordinary run of men. You are deliberating
on no ordinary or unimportant matter, but on one by which the common interest
must necessarily be promoted or injured according to the decision at which you arrive. For
our subject matter is the Church, for which Christ died, and the guide who is to present it
and lead it to God. For the light of the body is the eye,4737 as we have heard; not only the
bodily eye which sees and is seen, but that which contemplates and is contemplated spiritually.
But the light of the Church is the Bishop, as is evident to you even without our writing
it. As then the straightness or crookedness of the course of the body depends upon the
clearness or dulness of the eye, so must the Church necessarily share the peril or safety incurred
by the conduct of its Chief. You must then take thought for the whole Church as
the Body of Christ, but more especially for your own, which was from the beginning and is
now the Mother of almost all the Churches, to which all the Commonwealth looks, like a
circle described round a centre, not only because of its orthodoxy proclaimed of old to all,
but also because of the grace of unanimity so evidently bestowed upon it by God. You then
have summoned us also to your discussion of this matter, and so are acting rightly and canonically.
But we are oppressed by age and infirmity, and if we by the strength given us by
the Holy Ghost could be present (nothing is incredible to them that believe), this would be
best for the common welfare and most pleasant to ourselves, that we might confer something
on you, and ourselves have a part of the blessing; but if I should be kept away through
weakness, I will give at any rate whatever can be given by one who is absent.</p>
<p>I believe that there are others among you worthy of the Primacy, both because of the
greatness of your city, and because it has been governed in times past so excellently and by
such great men; but there is one man among you to whom I cannot prefer any, our son well
beloved of God, Basil the Priest (I speak before God as my witness); a man of pure life and
word, and alone, or almost alone, of all qualified in both respects to stand against the present
times, and the prevailing wordiness of the heretics. I write this to men of the priestly and
monastic Orders, and also to the dignitaries and councillors, and to the whole people. If
you should approve it, and my vote should prevail, being so just and right, and given with
God’s aid, I am and will be with you in spirit; or rather I have already set my hand to the
<note type="footnote">4737 Matt. vi. 22.</note>

<pb n="885"/>
work and am bold in the Spirit. But if you should not agree with me, but determine something
else, and if the matter is to be settled by cliques and relationships, and if the hand of
the mob is again to disturb the sincerity of your vote, do what pleases you—I shall stay at
home.</p>

<head>Ep. XLIII. To the Bishops.</head>
<p>(The comprovincial Bishops had notified the elder Gregory of their Synod, but without
mentioning its date or purpose or inviting him to take part in it—probably because they
knew how strongly he would support the election of Basil, to which they were unfavourable.
S. Gregory therefore wrote the following letter in his father’s name.)</p>
<p>How sweet and kind you are, and how full of love. You have invited me to the Metropolis,
because, as I imagine, you are going to take some counsel about a Bishop. So much
I learn from you, though you have not told me either that I am to be present, or why, or
when, but have merely announced to me suddenly that you were setting out, as though resolved
not to respect me, and as not desirous that I should share your counsels, but rather
putting a hindrance in the way of my coming, that you may not meet me even against my
will. This is your way of action, and I will put up with the insult, but I will set before you
my view and how I feel. Various people will put forward various candidates, each according
to his own inclinations and interests, as is usually the case at such times. But I cannot prefer
anyone, for my conscience would not allow it, to my dear son and fellow priest Basil. For
whom of all my acquaintance do I find more approved in his life, or more powerful in his
word, or more furnished altogether with the beauty of virtue? But if you allege weak health
against him, I reply that we are choosing not an athlete but a teacher. And at the same time
is seen in this case the power of Him that strengthens and supports the weak, if such they
be. If you accept this vote I will come and take part, either in spirit or in body. But if you
are marching to a foregone conclusion, and faction is to overrule justice, I shall rejoice to
have been overlooked. The work must be yours; but pray for me.4738</p>

a better sense; “Ours is to pray for you.”</note>

<head>Ep. XLII. To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.</head>
<p>(There still seemed a probability that intrigues and party spirit would carry the day, and
so the two Gregories determined to call in the aid of Eusebius of Samosata, though he did
not belong to the Province. He had been a conspicuous champion of orthodoxy against the
Arian Emperor Valens, and the Gregories hoped much from his presence at the Synod. He
responded to their appeal, and undertook the three hundred miles of very difficult travelling
to throw in his influence with the cause which they had at heart. He saw, however, that it
was necessary that the aged Bishop of Nazianzus, notwithstanding his years and infirmities,
should make the effort, and he persuaded him to go. The result was all that could be desired;
for Basil was elected by a unanimous vote. The letter, which S. Gregory wrote in his own
name to thank him, will be found later on.)</p>
<p>O that I had the wings of a dove, or that my old age could be renewed, that I might be
able to go to your charity, and to satisfy the longings that I have to see you, and to tell you
the troubles of my soul, and in you to find some comfort for my afflictions. For since the
death of the blessed Bishop Eusebius I am not a little afraid lest they who on a former occasion
set traps for our Metropolis, and wanted to fill it with heretical tares, should now seize the
opportunity, and uproot by their evil teaching the piety which has with so much labour
been sown in the hearts of men, and should tear asunder its unity, as they have done in
many Churches. As soon as I received letters from the Clergy asking me not to forget them
in their present circumstances, I looked round about me, and remembered your love and
your right faith and the zeal with which you are ever possessed for the Churches of God;
and therefore I sent my beloved Eustathius, my Deacon and helper, to warn your Reverence,
and to entreat you, in addition to all your toils for the Churches, to meet me, and both to
refresh my old age by your coming, and to establish in the Orthodox Church that piety
which is so famous, by giving her with us (if we may be deemed worthy to have a share with
you in the good work) a Shepherd according to the will of the Lord, who shall be able to
rule His people. For we have a man before our eyes, and you are not unacquainted with
him; and if we are permitted to obtain him I know that we shall acquire great boldness towards
God, and shall confer a very great benefit upon the people who have called upon our
aid. I beg you again and again to put away all delay, and to come to us before the bad
weather of the winter sets in.</p>

<head>Ep. XLV. To Basil.</head>
<p>(After the Consecration every one thought that Gregory would at once join his friend;
and Basil himself much wished for his assistance. But Gregory thought it better to restrain
his desire to see his friend until jealousies had time to calm down. So he wrote the following
letter to explain the reasons for his staying away at this juncture.)</p>
<p>When I learnt that you had been placed on the lofty throne, and that the Spirit had
prevailed to publish the candle upon the candlestick, which even before shone with no dim
light, I was glad, I confess. Why should I not be, seeing as I did that the commonwealth of
the Church was in sorry plight, and needed such a guiding hand? Yet I did not run to you
off hand, nor shall I run to you, not even if you ask me yourself. First, in order that I may
be careful of your dignity, and that you may not seem to be collecting partisans under the
influence of bad taste and hot temper, as your calumniators would say; and secondly that I
may make for myself a reputation for stability, and above illwill. When then will you come,
perhaps you will ask, and how long will you put it off? As long as God shall bid me, and
until the shadow of the present enmity and slander shall have passed away. For the lepers,
I well know, will not hold out very long to keep our David out of Jerusalem.</p>

<head>Ep. XLVI. To Basil.</head>
<p>(The new Archbishop seems not to have been satisfied with the reasons given in Gregory’s
last letter; so the latter writes again.)</p>
<p>How can any affairs of yours be mere grape-gleanings to me, O dear and sacred friend?</p>
<p>“What a word has escaped the fence of your teeth,” or how could you dare to say such
a thing, if I too may be somewhat daring? How could your mind set it going, or your ink
write it, or your paper receive it, O lectures and Athens and virtues and literary labours!
You almost make me write a tragedy by what you have written. Do you not know me or
yourself, you eye of the world, and great voice and trumpet and palace of learning? Your
affairs trifles to Gregory? What then on earth could any one admire, if Gregory admire not
you? There is one spring among the seasons, one sun among the stars, and one heaven that
embraces all things; and so your voice is unique among all things, if I am capable of judging
such things, and not deceived by my affection—and this I do not think to be the case. But
if it is because I do not value you according to your worth that you blame me, you must also
blame all mankind; for no one else has or will sufficiently admire you, unless it be yourself,
and your own eloquence, at least if it were possible to praise oneself, and if such were the
custom of our speech. But if you are accusing me of despising you, why not rather of being
mad? Or are you vexed because I am acting like a philosopher? Give me leave to say that
this and this alone is higher than even your conversation.</p>

<head>Ep. XLVII. To Basil.</head>
<p>(The division of the civil Province of Cappadocia into two Provinces in the year 372
was followed by ecclesiastical troubles. Anthimus, the Bishop of Tyana, the civil metropolis
of the new division of Cappadocia Secunda, maintained that the Ecclesiastical divisions
must necessarily follow the civil, and by consequence claimed for himself that the purely
civil action of the State had ipso facto elevated him to the dignity of Metropolitan of the new
Province; and this pretension was supported by the Bishops of that district, who were as a
rule not well disposed towards the great Archbishop. The next three letters are connected
with this dispute.)</p>
<p>I hear that you are being troubled by this fresh innovation, and are being worried by
some sophistical and not unusual officiousness on the part of those in power; and it is not
to be wondered at. For I was not ignorant of their envy, or of the fact that many of those
around you are making use of you to further their own interests, and are kindling the spark
of meanness. I have no fear of seeing you unphilosophically affected by your troubles, or
in any way unworthy of yourself and me. Nay, I think that it is now above all that my Basil
will be known, and that the philosophy which all your life you have been collecting will shew
itself, and will overcome the abuse as with a high wave; and that you will remain unshaken
while others are being troubled. If you think it well, I will come myself and perhaps shall
be able to give you some assistance by my counsel (if the sea needs water, you do counsel!);
but in any case I shall derive benefit, and shall learn philosophy by bearing my part of the
abuse.</p>

<head>Ep. XLVIII. To Basil.</head>
<p>(Shortly after the events described above, Basil determined to strengthen his own hands
by creating a number of new Bishoprics in the disputed Province, to one of which, Sasima,
he consecrated Gregory, very much against the will of the latter, who felt that he had been
hardly used, and did not attempt to disguise his reluctance. See Gen. Prolegg. p. 195.)</p>
<p>Do leave off speaking of me as an ill-educated and uncouth and unfriendly man, not
even worthy to live, because I have ventured to be conscious of the way in which I have been
treated. You yourself would admit that I have not done wrong in any other respect, and
my own conscience does not reproach me with having been unkind to you in either great
or small matters; and I hope it never may. I only know that I saw that I had been deceived—
too late indeed, but I saw it—and I throw the blame on your throne, as having on
a sudden lifted you above yourself; and I am weary of being blamed for faults of yours, and
of having to make excuses for them to people who know both our former and our present
relations. For of all that I have to endure this is the most ridiculous or most pitiable thing,
that the same person should have both to suffer the wrong and to bear the blame, and this
is my present case. Different people blame me for different things according to the tastes
of each, or each man’s disposition, or the measure of their ill feeling on my account; but the
kindest reproach me with contempt and disdain, and they throw me on one side after
making use of me, like the most valueless vessels, or those frames upon which arches are
built, which after the building is complete are taken down and cast aside. We will let them
be and say what they please; no one shall curb their freedom of speech. And do you, as my
reward, pay off those blessed and empty hopes, which you devised against the evil speakers,
who accused you of insulting me on pretence of honouring me, as though I were lightminded
and easily taken in by such treatment. Now I will plainly speak out the state of my mind,
and you must not be angry with me. For I will tell you just what I said at the moment of
the suffering, not in a fit of anger or so much in the sense of astonishment at what had
happened as to lose my reason or not to know what I said. I will not take up arms, nor will
I learn tactics which I did not learn in former times, when the occasion seemed more suitable,
as every one was arming and in frenzy (you know the illness of the weak), nor will I face the
martial Anthimus, though he be an untimely warrior, being myself unarmed and unwarlike,
and thus the more exposed to wounds. Fight with him yourself if you wish (for necessity
often makes warriors even of the weak), or look out for some one to fight when he seizes
your mules, keeping guard over a defile, and like Amalek of old, barring the way against
Israel. Give me before all things quiet. Why should I fight for sucking pigs and fowls, and
those not my own, as though for souls and canons? Why should I deprive the Metropolis
of the celebrated Sasima, or lay bare and unveil the secret of your mind, when I ought to
join in concealing it? Do you then play the man and be strong and draw all parties to your

own conclusion, as the rivers do the winter torrents, without regard for friendship or intimacy
in good, or for the reputation which such a course will bring you. Give yourself up to the
Spirit alone. I shall gain this only from your friendship, that I shall learn not to trust in
friends, or to esteem anything more valuable than God.</p>

And to give you an idea of one of my good points, so much do I value freedom from business,

<head>Ep. L. To Basil.</head>
<p>(At the request of Anthimus it would appear that S. Gregory wrote to S. Basil a letter,
not now extant, proposing a conference between the rival Metropolitans. Basil took umbrage
at the well-meant proposal, and wrote a stiff letter to S. Gregory, to which the following is
the reply.)</p>
<p>How hotly and like a colt you skip in your letters. Nor do I wonder that when you have
just become the property of glory you should wish to shew me what you find glory to be, so
that you may make yourself more majestic, like those painters who picture the seasons. But,
to explain the whole matter about the Bishops, and the letter by which you were annoyed;
what was my starting point, and how far I went, and where I stopped, appears to me to be
too long a matter for a letter, and to be a subject not so much for an apology as for a history.
To explain it to you concisely:—the most noble Anthimus came to us with certain Bishops,
whether to visit my Father (this at least was the pretext), or to act as he did act. He sounded
me in many ways and on many subjects; dioceses, the marshes of Sasima, my ordination,…flattering,
questioning, threatening, pleading, blaming, praising, drawing circles round himself,
as though I ought only to look at him and his new Metropolis, as being the greater. Why,
I said, do you draw your line to include our city, for we too deem our Church to be really a
Mother of Churches, and that too from ancient times? In the end he went away without
having gained his object, much out of breath, and reproaching me with Basilism, as if it
were a kind of Philipism. Do you think I did you wrong in this? And now look at the letter
from me, who, you say, insulted you. They fashioned a Synodal summons to me; and when
I declined it and said that the thing was an insult, they then asked as an alternative that
through me you should be invited to deliberate upon these matters. This I promised, in
order to prevent their first plan being carried out; placing the whole matter in your hands,
if you choose to call them together, and where and when. And if I have not injured you in
this, tell me where there is room for injury. If you have to learn this from me, I will read
you the letter which Anthimus sent me, after invading the marshes, notwithstanding my
prohibitions and threats, insulting and reviling me, and as it were singing a song of triumph
over my defeat. And what reason is there that I should offend him for your sake and at the
same time displease you, as though I were currying favour with him? You ought to have
learnt this first, my dear friend; and even if it had been so, you should not have insulted
me,—if only because I am a Priest. But if you are very much disposed to ostentation and
quarrelsomeness, and speak as my Superior—as the Metropolitan to an insignificant Suffragan,
or even as to a Bishop without a See—I too have a little pride to set against yours.
That is very easy to anybody, and is perhaps the most suitable course.</p>

<head>Ep. LVIII. To Basil.</head>
<p>(An attack had been made in Gregory’s presence on the orthodoxy of Basil in respect
of the Deity of God the Holy Ghost; and in this letter he gives his friend an account of the
way in which he had defended him. Unfortunately Basil was not pleased with the letter,
taking it as intended to convey reproach under the guise of friendly sympathy.)</p>
<p>From the first I have taken you, and I take you still, for my guide of life and my teacher
of the faith, and for every thing honourable that can be said; and if any one else praises your
merits, he is altogether with me, or even behind me, so far am I surpassed by your piety,
and so thoroughly am I yours. And no wonder; for the longer the intimacy the greater the
experience; and where the experience is more abundant the testimony is more perfect. And
if I get any profit in life it is from your friendship and company. This is my disposition in
regard to these matters, and I hope always will be. What I now write I write unwillingly,
but still I write it. Do not be angry with me, or I shall be very angry myself, if you do not
give me credit for both saying and writing it out of goodwill to you.</p>
<p>Many people have condemned us as not firm in our faith; those, I mean, who think and
think rightly that we thoroughly agree. Some openly charge us with heresy, others with
cowardice; with heresy, those who believe that our language is not sound; with cowardice,
they who blame our reserve. I need not report what other people say; I will tell you what
has recently happened.</p>
<p>There was a party here at which a great many distinguished friends of ours were present,
and amongst them was a man who wore the name and dress which betoken piety (i.e. a
Monk). They had not yet begun to drink, but were talking about us, as often happens at
such parties, and made us rather than anything else the subject of their conversation. They
admired everything connected with you, and they brought me in as professing the same
philosophy; and they spoke of our friendship, and of Athens, and of our conformity of views
and feelings on all points. Our Philosopher was annoyed by this. “What is this, gentlemen?”
he said, with a very mighty shout, “what liars and flatterers you are. You may praise these
men for other reasons if you like, and I will not contradict you; but I cannot concede to you
the most important point, their orthodoxy. Basil and Gregory are falsely praised; the former,
because his words are a betrayal of the faith, the latter, because his toleration aids the treason.”</p>
<p>What is this, said I, O vain man and new Dathan and Abiram in folly? Where do you
come from to lay down the law for us? How do you set yourself up as a judge of such great
matters? “I have just come,” he replied, “from the festival of the Martyr Eupsychius4739,
(and so it really was), and there I heard the great Basil speak most beautifully and perfectly
upon the Godhead of the Father and the Son, as hardly anyone else could speak; but he
<note type="footnote">4739 He suffered under the Emperor Hadrian. The Festival was Sept. 7.</note>

<pb n="896"/>
slurred over the Spirit.” And he added a sort of illustration from rivers, which pass by rocks
and hollow out sand. “As for you my good sir,” he said, looking at me, “you do now express
yourself openly on the Godhead of the Spirit,” and he referred to some remarks of mine in
speaking of God at a largely attended Synod, as having added in respect of the Spirit that
expression which has made a noise, (how long shall we hide the candle under the bushel?)
“but the other man hints obscurely, and as it were, merely suggests the doctrine, but does
not openly speak out the truth; flooding people’s ears with more policy than piety, and
hiding his duplicity by the power of his eloquence.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I said, “because I (living as I do in a corner, and unknown to most men who do
not know what I say, and hardly that I speak at all) can philosophize without danger; but
his word is of greater weight, because he is better known, both on his own account and on
that of his Church. And everything that he says is public, and the war around him is great,
as the heretics try to snatch every naked word from Basil’s lips, to get him expelled from the
Church; because he is almost the only spark of truth left and the vital force, all else around
having been destroyed; so that evil may be rooted in the city, and may spread over the whole
world as from a centre in that Church. Surely then it is better to use some reserve in the
truth, and ourselves to give way a little to circumstances as to a cloud, rather than by the
openness of the proclamation to risk its destruction. For no harm will come to us if we recognize
the Spirit as God from other phrases which lead to this conclusion (for the truth
consists not so much in sound as in sense), but a very great injury would be done to the
Church if the truth were driven away in the person of one man.” The company present
would not receive my economy, as out of date and mocking them; but they shouted me
down as practising it rather from cowardice than for reason. It would be much better, they
said, to protect our own people by the truth, than by your so-called Economy to weaken
them while failing to win over the others. It would be a long business and perhaps unnecessary
to tell you all the details of what I said, and of what I heard, and how vexed I was with
the opponents, perhaps immoderately and contrary to my own usual temper. But, in fine,
I sent them away in the same fashion. But do you O divine and sacred head, instruct me
how far I ought to go in setting forth the Deity of the Spirit; and what words I ought to use,
and how far to use reserve; that I may be furnished against opponents. For if I, who more
than any one else know both you and your opinions, and have often both given and received
assurance on this point, still need to be taught the truth of this matter, I shall be of all men
the most ignorant and miserable.</p>

<p>(The reply to Basil’s somewhat angry answer to the last.)</p>
<p>This was a case which any wiser man would have foreseen; but I who am very simple
and foolish did not fear it in writing to you. My letter grieved you; but in my opinion neither
rightly nor justly, but quite unreasonably. And whilst you did not acknowledge that you
were hurt, neither did you conceal it, or if you did it was with great skill, as with a mask,
hiding your vexation under an appearance of respect. But as to myself if I acted in this deceitfully
or maliciously, I shall be punished not more by your vexation than by the truth itself;
but if in simplicity and with my accustomed goodwill, I will lay the blame on my own sins
rather than on your temper. But it would have been better to have set this matter straight,
rather than to be angry with those who offer you counsel. But you must see to your own
affairs, inasmuch as you are quite capable of giving the same advice to others. You may
look upon me as very ready, if God will, both to come to you, and to join you in the conflict,
and to contribute all that I can. For who would flinch, who would not rather take courage
in speaking and contending for the truth under you and by your side?</p>

<p>The Carrying Out of your bidding depends partly on me; but partly, and I venture to

<head>§1. Letters to His Brother Cæsarius.</head>
<head>Ep. VII.</head>
<p>(On the death of the Emperor Constantius the undisputed succession devolved on his
cousin Julian the Apostate, who at once began to employ all the power of the Empire to
discourage, while not absolutely persecuting, Christianity, and to restore the supremacy of
the ancient Paganism. One of his first acts was to dismiss all the men who had held high
dignities under his predecessor. S. Cæsarius, Gregory’s brother, was however to be excepted;
Julian, who had perhaps known and esteemed him at Athens, did all that he could to keep
him at Court, and to attach him to himself. This caused much anxiety to Gregory and other
friends of Cæsarius, who foresaw that Julian would do his utmost to shake the young man’s
faith, and could not feel sure that he would have courage to resist such assaults. In his
trouble Gregory wrote him the following letter. Shortly afterwards the expected attempt
was made. S. Cæsarius bravely held his ground against the Emperor, and after declaring
his unalterable determination to hold firm to his faith, resigned his office at Court and
withdrew to Nazianzus.)</p>
<p>I have had enough to blush for in you; that I was grieved, it is hardly necessary to say
to him who of all men knows me best. But, not to speak of my own feelings, or of the distress
with which the rumour about you filled me (and let me say also the fear), I should have liked
you, had it been possible, to have heard what was said by others, both relations and outsiders,
who are any way acquainted with us (Christians I mean, of course,) about you and me; and
not only some of them, but everyone in turn alike; for men are always more ready to philosophize
about strangers than about their own relations. Such speeches as the following have
become a sort of exercise among them: Now a Bishop’s son takes service in the army; now
he covets exterior power and fame; now he is a slave of money, when the fire is being rekindled
for all, and men are running the race for life; and he does not deem the one only
glory and safety and wealth to be to stand nobly against the times, and to place himself as
far as possible out of reach of every abomination and defilement. How then can the Bishop
exhort others not to be carried along with the times, or to be mixed up with idols? How
can he rebuke those who do wrong in other ways, seeing his own home takes away his right
to speak freely? We have every day to hear this, and even more severe things, some of the
speakers perhaps saying them from a motive of friendship, and others with unfriendly
feelings. How do you think we feel, and what is the state of mind with which we, men professing
to serve God, and to deem the only good to be to look forward to the hopes of the

<pb n="900"/>
future, hear such things as these? Our venerable Father is very much distressed by all that
he hears, which even disgusts him with life. I console and comfort him as best I can, by
making myself surety for your mind, and assuring him that you will not continue thus to
grieve us. But if our dear Mother were to hear about you (so far we have kept her in the
dark by various devices), I think she would be altogether inconsolable; being, as a woman,
of a weak mind, and besides unable, through her great piety, to control her feelings on such
matters. If then you care at all for yourself and us, try some better and safer course. Our
means are certainly enough for an independent life, at least for a man of moderate desires,
who is not insatiable in his lust for more. Moreover, I do not see what occasion for your
settling down we are to wait for, if we let this one pass. But if you cling to the same opinion,
and every thing seems to you of small account in comparison with your own desires, I do
not wish to say anything else that may vex you, but this I foretell and protest, that one of
two things must happen; either you, remaining a genuine Christian, will be ranked among
the lowest, and will be in a position unworthy of yourself and your hopes; or in grasping at
honours you will injure yourself in what is more important, and will have a share in the
smoke, if not actually in the fire.</p>

<p>(Under the Emperor Valens Cæsarius returned to public life and was made Quæstor of
Bithynia. While he was in this office the following letters were written to him by his
brother on behalf of two cousins, Eulalius, who afterwards succeeded Gregory in the Bishopric
of Nazianzus, and with whom Gregory was on terms of intimate friendship, and
Amphilochius, who, through the roguery of a partner, had got into some trouble at Constantinople
about money matters, and for whom he asks aid and advice. Some however
think that this letter is not addressed to his brother (who may have been at Constantinople
at the time), but to some other officer of high rank at the Imperial Court. Amphilochius
soon after retired from the world, and by a.d. 347 was already bishop of the important See
of Iconium. Gregory’s letters to him are given later in this division.)</p>
<p>Do a kindness to yourself and to me, of a kind that you will not often have an opportunity
of doing, because opportunities for such kindnesses do not often occur. Undertake a most
righteous protection of my dear cousins, who are worried more than enough about a property
which they bought as suitable for retirement, and capable of providing them with some
means of living; but after having completed the purchase they have fallen into many troubles,
partly through finding the vendors dishonest, and partly through being plundered and
robbed by their neighbours, so that it would be a gain to them to get rid of their acquisition
for the price they gave for it, plus the not small sum they have spent on it besides. If, then,
you would like to transfer the business to yourself, after examining the contract to see how
it may be best and most securely done, this course would be most acceptable both to them
and me; but if you would rather not, the next best course would be to oppose yourself to
the officiousness and dishonesty of the man, that he may not succeed in gaining one advantage
over their want of business habits, either by wronging them if they retain their property,
or by inflicting loss upon them if they part with it. I am really ashamed to write to you on
such a subject. All the same, since we owe it to them, on account both of their relationship
and of their profession (for of whom would one rather take care than of such, or what would
one be more ashamed of than of being unwilling to confer such a benefit?) do you either
for your own sake, or for mine, or for the sake of the men themselves, or for all these sakes
put together, by all means do them this kindness.</p>

<head>Ep. XXIII.</head>
<p>Do not be surprized if I ask of you a great favour; for it is from a great man that I am
asking it, and the request must be measured by him of whom it is made; for it is equally
absurd to ask great things from a small man, and small things from a great man, the one
being unseasonable, and the other mean. I therefore present to you with my own hand my
most precious son Amphilochius, a man so famous (even beyond his years) for his gentlemanly
bearing, that I myself, though an old man, and a Priest, and your friend, would be
quite content to be as much esteemed. What wonder is it if he was cheated by a man’s pretended
friendship, and did not suspect the swindle? For not being himself a rogue, he did
not suspect roguery, but thought that correction of language rather than of character was
what was wanted, and therefore entered into partnership with him in business. What blame
can attach to him for this with honest men? Do not then allow wickedness to get the better
of virtue; and do not dishonour my grey hairs, but do honour to my testimony, and add
your kindness to my benedictions, which are perhaps of some account with God before
Whom we stand.</p>

<head>Ep. XX.</head>
<p>(In a.d. 368 the City of Nicæa in Bithynia was almost entirely destroyed by a terrible
earthquake. Cæsarius lost his house, and his personal escape was almost miraculous.
Gregory writes (as also did Basil) to congratulate him on his escape, and profits by the occasion
to urge upon him retirement from his secular avocations. Cæsarius soon resolved to
follow this advice, and was taking steps to carry this resolution into effect, when he died
suddenly, early in a.d. 369, aged only 40. He left the whole of his large property to the poor,
but it fell for a time into the hands of designing persons, and Gregory, who was his brother’s
executor, had much difficulty in recovering it for the purpose for which it had been intended.
(See the letter to Sophronius, Prefect of Constantinople on this subject.) He was buried at
Nazianzus in the Church of the Martyrs, in a vault which his parents had prepared for
themselves. Gregory preached the funeral sermon, which is given in the former part of this
volume. These four are the only letters known to have passed between the brothers.)</p>
<p>Even frights are not without use to the wise; or, as I should say, they are very valuable
and salutary. For, although we pray that they may not happen, yet when they do they instruct
us. For the afflicted soul, as Peter4740 somewhere admirably says, is near to God; and every
man who escapes a danger is brought into nearer relation to Him Who preserved him. Let
us not then be vexed that we had a share in the calamity, but let us give thanks that we were
delivered. And let us not shew ourselves one thing to God in the time of peril, and another
when the danger is over, but let us resolve, whether at home or abroad, whether in private
life or in public office (for I must say this and may not omit it), to follow Him Who has
preserved us, and to attach ourselves to His side, thinking little of the little concerns of earth;
and let us furnish a tale to those who come after us, great for our glory and the benefit of
our soul, and at the same time a very useful lesson to all, that danger is better than security,
and that misfortune is preferable to success, at least if before our fears we belonged to the
world, but after them we belong to God. Perhaps I seem to you somewhat of a bore, by
writing to you so often on the same subject, and you will think my letter a piece not of exhortation
but of ostentation, so enough of this. You will know that I desire and wish especially
that I might be with you and share your joy at your preservation, and to talk over these
matters later on. But since that cannot be, I hope to receive you here as soon as may be,
and to celebrate our thanksgiving together.</p>

<p>§2. To S. Gregory of Nyssa.</p>
<p>(Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, was a younger brother of Basil the Great. Ordained a
Reader at an early age he grew tired of his vocation, and became a professor of Rhetoric.
This gave scandal in the Church and occasioned much grief to his friends. Gregory of
Nazianzus, wrote him the following letter of remonstrance, which was not without effect,
for shortly afterwards he gave up his secular avocation, and retired to the Monastery which
his brother Basil had founded in Pontus. Here he spent several years in the study of Holy
Scripture and the best Commentators.)</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">    
<head>Ep. I.</head>
<p>There is one good point in my character, and I will boast myself of one point out of
many. I am equally vexed with myself and my friends over a bad plan. Since, then, all are
friends and kinsfolk who live according to God, and walk by the same Gospel, why should
you not hear from me in plain words what all men are saying in whispers? They do not
approve your inglorious glory (to borrow a phrase from your own art), and your gradual
descent to the lower life, and your ambition, the worst of demons, according to Euripides.4741
For what has happened to you, O wisest of men, and for what do you condemn yourself,
that you have cast away the sacred and delightful books which you used once to read to the
people (do not be ashamed to hear this), or have hung them up over the chimney, as men
do in winter with rudders and hoes, and have applied yourself to salt and bitter ones, and
preferred to be called a Professor of Rhetoric rather than of Christianity? I, thank God,
would rather be the latter than the former. Do not, my dear friend, do not let this be longer
the case, but, though it is full late, become sober again, and come to yourself once more,
and make your apology to the faithful, and to God, and to His Altars and Sacraments, from
which you have withdrawn yourself. And do not say to me in proud rhetorical style, What,
was I not a Christian when I practised rhetoric? Was I not a believer when I was engaged
among the boys? And perhaps you will call God to witness. No, my friend, not as thoroughly
as you ought to have been, even if I grant it you in part. What of the offence to others given
by your present employment—to others who are prone naturally to evil—and of the oppor-
tunity afforded them both to think and to speak the worst of you? Falsely, I grant, but where
was the necessity? For a man lives not for himself alone but also for his neighbour; nor is
it enough to persuade yourself, you must persuade others also. If you were to practise boxing
in public, or to give and receive blows in the theatre, or to writhe and twist yourself shamefully,
would you speak of yourself as having a temperate soul? Such an argument does not
befit a wise man; it is frivolous to accept it. If you make a change I shall rejoice even now,

said one of the Pythagorean philosophers, lamenting the fall of a friend; but, he wrote, if
not you are dead to me. But I will not yet say this for your sake. Being a friend, he became
an enemy, yet still a friend, as the Tragedy says. But I shall be grieved (to speak gently), if
you do neither yourself see what is right, which is the highest method of all, nor will follow
the advice of others, which is the next. Thus far my counsel. Forgive me that my friendship
for you makes me grieve, and kindles me both on your behalf and on behalf of the whole
priestly Order, and I may add on that of all Christians. And if I may pray with you or for
you, may God who quickeneth the dead aid your weakness.</p>

<p>(When S. Gregory was consecrated Bishop of Nyssa the Imperial Throne was occupied
by Valens, an ardent Arian, whose mind was bent on the destruction of the Nicene Faith.
He appointed, with this object, one Demosthenes, a former clerk of the Imperial Kitchen,
to be Vicar of the civil Diocese of Pontus. An old quarrel with Basil had made this man
unfriendly to Gregory, and after persecuting him in various small ways for some time he
procured, a.d. 275, the summoning of a Synod to enquire into some allegations of irregularity
in his consecration, and to try Gregory on some frivolous charges of malversation of Church
funds. Gregory was unable to attend this Synod, which met at Ancyra, on account of an
attack of pleurisy; and another was summoned to meet at Nyssa itself. Gregory however
refused to appear, and was deposed as contumacious. Thereupon Valens banished him,
and he seems to have fallen into very low spirits, almost into despondency at the apparent
triumph of the heretical party. The three letters which follow throw some light upon his
state at this time. They were written in answer to letters of his now lost, and their object
was to comfort him in his trouble and to encourage him to take heart again in the hope of
a good day coming. This more cheerful tone was justified by the event, for on the death of
Valens, a.d. 378, the exiled Bishops were restored by Gratian, and Gregory was replaced in
his Episcopal Throne, to the great joy of the faithful of his Diocese.)</p>
<p>Do not let your troubles distress you too much. For the less we grieve over things, the
less grievous they are. It is nothing strange that the heretics have thawed, and are taking
courage from the springtime, and creeping out of their holes, as you write. They will hiss
for a short time, I know, and then will hide themselves again, overcome both by the truth
and the times, and all the more so the more we commit the whole matter to God.</p>

This, then, was also reserved for my sad life, to hear of the death of Basil, and the depar-

though you have many friends and will receive many words of condolence, yet will not derive
comfort so much from any as from yourself and your memory of him; for you two were a
pattern to all of philosophy, a kind of spiritual standard, both of discipline in prosperity,

vacant, until the vacancy should be filled. The Bishops of the Province wished him to retain
it altogether, and therefore were in no hurry to proceed to election. At length however they
yielded to the continually expressed wishes of Gregory and chose his cousin Eulalius. Soon
however Gregory’s enemies spread abroad a report that this election had been made against
his wishes, and with the intention of unfairly ousting him from the administration of that
Church. The following letter was written in consequence of this slander.)</p>

being in great need, owing to my feeble health, and fearing the responsibility of a Church
neglected, I asked this favour of them, which was not opposed to the Canon Law, and was

prayers, a man worthy of your piety, and I now place him in your hands, the most reverend

<head>Ep. CXCVII. A Letter of Condolence on the Death of His Sister Theosebia.</head>
<p>(The writer of the article on Gregory Nyssen in the Dict. Biogr. supposes her to have
been his wife, but produces no evidence of this beyond the ambiguous expression in this
letter which speaks of her as “the true consort of a priest,” but on the other hand she is expressly
called his Sister in the same letter. Some writers have imagined that she was the wife
of Gregory Nazianzen himself, but there is no evidence to show that he was ever married.
The date of her death is uncertain, but it was probably subsequent to a.d. 381. It would
seem that the term Consort might have a general application to those who shared in the
same work, and consequently the Benedictine Editors regard Theosebia as a Deaconess of
the Church of Nyssa.)</p>
<p>I had started in all haste to go to you, and had got as far as Euphemias, when I was
delayed by the festival which you are celebrating in honour of the Holy Martyrs; partly because
I could not take part in it, owing to my bad health, partly because my coming at so
unsuitable a time might be inconvenient to you. I had started partly for the sake of seeing
you after so long, and partly that I might admire your patience and philosophy (for I had
heard of it) at the departure of your holy and blessed sister, as a good and perfect man, a
minister of God, who knows better than any the things both of God and man; and who regards
as a very light thing that which to others would be most heavy, namely to have lived
with such a soul, and to send her away and store her up in the safe garners, like a shock of
the threshingfloor gathered in due season,4742 to use the words of Holy Scripture; and that
in such time that she, having tasted the joys of life, escaped its sorrows through the shortness
of her life; and before she had to wear mourning for you, was honoured by you with that
fair funeral honour which is due to such as she. I too, believe me, long to depart, if not as
you do, which were much to say, yet only less than you. But what must we feel in presence
of a long prevailing law of God which has now taken my Theosebia (for I call her mine because
she lived a godly life; for spiritual kindred is better than bodily), Theosebia, the glory
of the church, the adornment of Christ, the helper of our generation, the hope of woman;
Theosebia, the most beautiful and glorious among all the beauty of the Brethren; Theosebia,
truly sacred, truly consort of a priest, and of equal honour and worthy of the Great Sacraments,
4743 Theosebia, whom all future time shall receive, resting on immortal pillars, that
is, on the souls of all who have known her now, and of all who shall be hereafter. And do
not wonder that I often invoke her name. For I rejoice even in the remembrance of the
blessed one. Let this, a great deal in few words, be her epitaph from me, and my word of

<head>§3. To Eusebius Bishop of Samosata.</head>

<head>Ep. XLIV.</head>
<p>(Eusebius, having in response to the appeal referred to above, betaken himself to Cæsarea,
the Elder Gregory, though in very feeble health, resolved to attend the Synod in person, that
Basil’s Election might be secured by their joint exertions, Gregory the Younger sent the
following letter by his father to explain to his friend the reason why he had not come too.
The date is about September of the year 379.)</p>
<p>Whence shall I begin your praises, and by what name shall I give you your right appellation?
The pillar and ground of the church, or a light in the world, using the very words
of the apostle, or a crown of glory to the remaining portion of christendom;4744 or a gift of
God, or the bulwark of your country, or the standard of faith, or the ambassador of truth,
or all these at once, and more than all? And these excessive praises I will prove by what we
shall see. What rain ever came so seasonably to a thirsty land, what water flowing out of
the rock to those in the wilderness? What such Bread of Angels did ever man eat? When
did Jesus the common Lord ever so seasonably present Himself to His drowning disciples,
and tame the sea, and save the perishing, as you have shewn yourself to us in our weariness
and distress, and in our immediate danger as it were of shipwreck? I need not speak of
other points, with what courage and joy you filled the souls of the orthodox, and how many
you delivered from despair.</p>
<p>But our mother church, Cæsarea I mean, is now really putting off the garments of her
widowhood at the sight of you, and putting on again her robe of cheerfulness, and will be
yet more resplendent when she receives a pastor worthy of herself and of her former Bishops
and of your hands. For you yourself see what is the state of our affairs, and what a miracle
your zeal has wrought, and your toil, and your godly plainness of speech. Age is renewed,
disease is conquered,4745 they leap who were in their beds, and the weak are girded with
power. By all this I guess that our matters too will turn out as we desire. You have my
father, moreover, representing both himself and me, to put a glorious close to his whole life
and to his venerable age by this present struggle on behalf of the Church. And I shall receive
him back, I am well assured, strengthened by your prayers, and with youth renewed, for
one must confidently commit all in faith to them. But if he should end his life in this anxiety,
it would be no calamity to attain to such an end in such a cause. Pardon me, I beg of you,
if I give way a little to the tongues of evil men, and delay a little to come and embrace you,
and to complete in person what I now pass over of the praises due to you.</p>

<head>Ep. LXIV.</head>
<p>(In the year 374 Eusebius and other orthodox Bishops of the East were banished by
Valens and their thrones filled with Arian intruders. Eusebius was ordered to retire to
Thrace, and his journey lay through Cappadocia, where he saw Basil, but Gregory to his
great grief was too unwell to leave his house and go to meet him. Instead he sent the following
letter.)</p>
<p>When Your Reverence was passing through our country I was so ill as not to be able
even to look out of my house. And I was grieved not so much on account of the illness,
though it brought about the fear of the worst, as by the inability to meet your holiness and
goodness. My longing to see your venerable face was like that which a man would naturally
feel who needed healing of spiritual wounds, and expected to receive it from you. But though
at that time the effect of my sins was that I missed the meeting with you, it is now by your
goodness possible for me to find a remedy for my trouble, for if you will deign to remember
me in your acceptable prayers, this will be to me a store of every blessing from God, both
in this my life and in the age to come. For that such a man, such a combatant for the Faith
of the Gospel, one who has endured such persecutions, and won for himself such confidence
before the all-righteous God by his patience in tribulation—that such a man should deign
to be my patron also in his prayers will gain for me, I am persuaded, as much strength as I
should have gained through one of the holy martyrs. Therefore let me entreat you to remember
your Gregory without ceasing in all the matters in which I desi</p>

<p>(Eusebius having replied to the former letter Gregory wrote again, having an opportunity
of communicating with his friend through one Eupraxius, a disciple of Eusebius, who passed
through Cappadocia on his way to visit his master. This letter is sometimes attributed to
Basil.)</p>
<p>Our reverend brother Eupraxius has always been dear to me and a true friend, but he
has shewn himself dearer and truer through his affections for you, inasmuch as even at the
present time he has hurried to your reverence, like, to use David’s words, a hart to quench
his great and unendurable thirst4746 with a sweet and pure spring at your patience in
tribulations. Deign then to be his patron and mine.</p>
<p>Happy indeed are they who are permitted to come near you, and happier still is he who
can place upon his sufferings for Christ’s sake and upon his labours for the truth, a crown
such as few of those who fear God have obtained. For it is not an untested virtue that you
have shown, nor is it only, in a time of calm that you have sailed aright and steered the souls
of others, but you have shone in the difficulties of temptations, and have been greater than
your persecutors, having nobly departed from the land of your birth. Others possess the
threshold of their fathers,—we the heavenly City; others perhaps hold our throne, but we
Christ. O what a profitable exchange! How little we give up, to receive how much! We
went through fire and water, and I believe that we shall also come out into a place of refreshment.
For God will not forsake us for ever, or abandon the true faith to persecution, but
according to the multitude of our pains His comforts shall make us glad. This at any rate
we believe and desire. But do you, I beg, pray for our humility. And as often as occasion
shall present itself bless us without hesitation by a letter, and cheer us up by news of yourself,
as you have just been good enough to do.</p>

<p>You give me pleasure both by writing and remembering me, and a much greater pleasure
by sending me your blessing in your letter. But if I were worthy of your sufferings and of
your conflicts for Christ and through Christ I should have been counted worthy also to
come to you, to embrace Your Piety, and to take example by your patience in your sufferings.
But since I am not worthy of this, being troubled with many afflictions and hindrances I do
what is next best. I address Your Perfection, and I beg you not to be weary of remembering
me. For to be deemed worthy of your letters is not only profitable to me, but is also a matter
to boast of to many people, and is an honour, because I am considered by a man of so great
virtue, and such near relations with God, that he can bring others also by word and example
into relation to Him.</p>

<p>§4. To Sophronius, Prefect of Constantinople.</p>
<p>(Sophronius, a native of the Cappadocian Cæsarea, was an early friend and fellow-student
of Gregory and Basil. He entered the Civil Service, and soon rose to high office. In a.d. 365
he was appointed Prefect of Constantinople, as a reward for timely intimation which he
gave to the Emperor Valens of the usurpation attempted by Procopius. He is chiefly known
to us by the letters of Gregory and Basil, invoking his good offices for various persons. Ep.
21 was written in a.d. 369 to commend to him Nicobulus, Gregory’s nephew by marriage,
the husband of Alypiana, daughter of his sister Gorgonia. This Nicobulus was a man of
great wealth and ability, but much disinclined for public life. Gregory constantly writes to
one and another high official to get him excused from appointments which had been thrust
upon him.)</p>

<p>Gold is changed and transformed into various forms at various times, being fashioned

and it is not the substance but the form which admits of change. So also, believing that your
kindness will remain unchanged for your friends, although you are ever climbing higher, I
have ventured to send you this request, because I do not more reverence your high rank
than I trust your kind disposition. I entreat you to be favourable to my most respectable
son Nicobulus, who is in all respects allied with me, both by kindred and by intimacy, and,
which is more important, by disposition. In what matters, and to what extent? In whatever
he may ask your aid, and as far as may seem to you to befit your Magnanimity. I on my

as that which we have placed second of the letters to Cæsarius.)</p>
<p>As we know gold and stones by their look, so too we may distinguish good men from
bad in the same way, and do not need a very long trial. For I should not have needed many
words in pleading for my most honourable son Amphilochius with Your Magnanimity. I
should rather have expected some strange and incredible thing to happen than that he would
do anything dishonourable, or think of such a thing, in a matter of money; such a universal
reputation has he as a gentleman, and as wiser than his years. But what must he suffer?
Nothing escapes envy, for some word of blame has touched even him, a man who has fallen
under accusation of crime through simplicity rather than depravity of disposition. But do
not allow it to be tolerable to you to overlook him in his vexations and trouble. Not so, I
entreat your sacred and great mind, but honour your country4747 and aid his virtue, and
have a respect for me who have attained to glory by and through you; and be everything to
this man, adding the will to the power, for I know that there is nothing of equal power with
Your Excellency.</p>

<head>Ep. XXIX.</head>
<p>(Of the same year. Here Cæsarius had bequeathed all his property to the poor; but his
house had been looted by his servants, and his friends could only find a comparatively small
sum. Besides this a number of persons, shortly afterwards, presented themselves as creditors
of his estate, and their claims, though incapable of proof, were paid. Then others kept
coming forward, until at last the family refused to admit any more. Then a lawsuit was
threatened. Gregory intensely disliking all this, and dreading moreover the scandal which
might be caused by legal proceedings, writes as follows to the Prefect.)</p>
<p>You see how matters stand with me, and how the circle of human affairs goes round,
now some now others flourishing or the reverse, and neither prosperity nor adversity remaining
constant with us, as the saying is, but ever changing and altering, so that one might
trust the breezes, or letters written in the waters, rather than human prosperity. For what
reason is this? I think it is in order that by the contemplation of the uncertainty and anomaly
of all these things we may learn the rather to have recourse to God and to the future, giving
scanty thoughts to shadows and dreams. But what has produced this talk, for it is not without
a cause that </p>
<p>Cæsarius was once one of your not least distinguished friends; indeed, unless my
brotherly affection deceives me, he was one of your most distinguished, for he was remarkably
well informed, and for gentlemanly conduct was above the average, and was celebrated for
the number of his friends; among the very first of these, as he always thought and as he
persuaded me, Your Excellency held the first place. These are old stories, and you will add
to them of your own accord in rendering honours to his memory; for it is human nature to
add something to the praises of the departed. But now (that you may not pass over this
story without a tear, or that you may weep to some good and useful purpose), he lies dead,
friendless, solitary, pitiable, deemed worthy of a little myrrh (if even of so much), and of
the last small coverings, and it is much that he has found even thus much compassion. But
his enemies, as I hear, have fallen upon his estate, and from all quarters with great violence
are plundering it, or are about to do so. O cruelty! O savagery! And there is no one to
hinder them; but even the kindest of his friends only calls upon the laws as his utmost favour.
If I may put it concisely, I am become a mere drama, who once was wont to be happy. Do
not let this seem to you to be tolerable, but help me by sympathy and by sharing my indignation,
and do right by the dead Cæsarius. Yes, in the name of friendship herself; yes, by
all that you hold dearest; by your hope (which may you make secure by shewing yourself
faithful and true to the departed), I pray you do this kindness to the living, and make them
of good hope. Do you think that I am grieved about the money? It would have been a more
intolerable disgrace to me if Cæsarius alone, who thought he had so many friends, turned
out to have none. Such is my request, and from such a cause does it arise, for perhaps my

between us), I thought I might return him one favour for all,—in your friendship and protection.
For in a short time he shewed proof of an extensive education, both of the kind
which I used once to be very zealous for, when I was shortsighted, and of that for which I
am zealous in its place since I have been able to contemplate the summit of virtue. Whether
I in my turn have appeared to him to be worth anything in respect of virtue is his affair. At
any rate I shewed him the best things I have, namely, my friends to him as my friend. Of
these I reckon you as the first and truest, and want you to shew yourself so to him—as your
common Country demands, and my desire and promise begs; for I promised him your

heard of the convocation of this Synod he wrote to several of his influential friends at Court,
to beg them to do their utmost for the promotion of peace.)</p>
<p>I am philosophizing at leisure. That is the injury my enemies have done me, and I
should be glad if they would do more of the same sort, that I might look upon them still
more as benefactors. For it often happens that those who are wronged get a benefit, while
they, whom we would treat well, suffer injury. That is the state of my affairs. But if I cannot
make every one believe this, I am very anxious, that at all events you, for them all, to whom
I most willingly give an account of my affairs, should know, or rather I feel certain that you
do know it, and can persuade those who do not. You, however, I beg to give all diligence,

To succeed in doing this would earn you a reward; and my retirement would have

The collector at Nazianzus tried to do this in the case of a Deacon named Euthalius, in whose
behalf Gregory wrote the following letter to Amphilochius, who was at the time one of the
principal magistrates of the province. The date of the letter is given as a.d. 372, the year of

yourself a notable palace, and shew yourself in it with a good fame. But how will you do
this? By honouring God and the things of God, than Whom there can be nothing greater
in your eyes. But how, and by what act can you honour Him? By this one act, by protecting
the servants of God and ministers of the altar. One of these is our fellow deacon Euthalius,
on whom, I know not how, the officers of the Prefecture are trying to impose a payment of
gold after his promotion to the higher rank. Pray do not allow this. Reach a hand to this
deacon and to the whole clergy, and above all to me, for whom you care; for otherwise he
would have to endure a grievous wrong, alone of men deprived of the kindness of the time

at an early age, leaving his widow, Alypiana, with a large family to bring up in very reduced
circumstances. Her troubles and the education of her children were matters of much concern

again! Then I for my part do not blame you, nor do I ask you for due condolence, knowing
as I do that private troubles allow no leisure for those of strangers; for no man is so friendly
and so philosophical as to be above his own suffering and to comfort another when needing
comfort himself. But you on the contrary heap blow on blow, when you blame me, as I hear
you do, and think that your son and my brother is neglected by us, or even betrayed by us,
which is a still heavier charge; or that we do not recognize the loss which all his friends and
relatives have suffered, and I more than all, because I had placed in him my hopes of life,
and looked upon him as the only bulwark, the only good counsellor, and the only sharer of
my piety. And yet, on what grounds do you form this opinion? If on the first, be assured
that I came over to you on purpose, and because I was troubled by the rumour, and I was
ready to share your deliberations while it was still time for consultation about the matter;
and you imparted anything to me rather than this, whether because you were in the same
distress, or with some other purpose, I know not what. But if the last, I was prevented from
meeting you again by my grief, and the honour I owed my father, and his funeral, over which
I could not give anything precedence, and that when my sorrow was fresh, and it would not
only have been wrong but also quite improper to be unseasonably philosophical, and above
human nature. Moreover, I thought that I was previously engaged by the circumstances,
especially as his had come to such a conclusion as seemed good to Him who governs all our
affairs. So much concerning this matter. Now I beg you to put aside your grief, which is
most unreasonable I am sure; and if you have any further grievance, bring it forward that
you may not grieve both me in part and yourself, and put yourself in a position unworthy
of your nobility, blaming me instead of others, though I have done you no wrong, but, if I
must say the truth, have been equally tyrannized over by our common friend, although you
used to think me your only benefactor.</p>

<p>Scarcely yet delivered from the pains of my illness, I hasten to you, the guardian of my
cure. For the tongue of a priest meditating of the Lord raises the sick. Do then the greater
thing in your priestly ministration, and loose the great mass of my sins when you lay hold
of the Sacrifice of Resurrection. For your affairs are a care to me waking or sleeping, and
you are to me a good plectrum, and have made a welltuned lyre to dwell within my soul,
because by your numerous letters you have trained my soul to science. But, most reverend

prominent part in the election and consecration of Eulalius to the See of Nazianzus, was
accused of heresy by Helladius Archbishop of Cæsarea, and a Council met at Parnassus to
try him, a.d. 383. Gregory, not being able personally to attend this Synod, writes to Amphilochius,
to beg him to undertake the defence of the accused. The letter is lost, but
Gregory’s friend carried out his mission with success, and the following letter is to thank
him for his kindness.)</p>
<p>The Lord fulfil all thy petitions (do not despise a father’s prayer), for you have abundantly
refreshed my age, both by having gone to Parnassus, as you were invited to do, and by having
refuted the calumny against the most Reverend and God-beloved Bishop. For evil men love
to set down their own faults to those who convict them. For the age of this man is stronger
than all the accusations, and so is his life, and we too who have often heard from him and
taught others, and those whom he has recovered from error and added to the common body
of the church; but yet the present evil times called for more accurate proof on account of
the slanderers and evil-disposed; and this you have supplied us with, or rather you have
supplied it to those who are of fickler mind and easily led away by such men. But if you will
undertake a longer journey, and will personally give testimony, and settle the matter with

to the Archbishop to point out what a serious infringement of the rights of the Church this
would be. Probably the attitude which Nectarius took up at the suggestion of Gregory was
the occasion of the Edict which Theodosius addressed in February, a.d. 384 or 5, to the
Augustal Prefect, withdrawing all clerics from the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals, and
placing them under the exclusive control of the episcopal courts.)</p>
<p>Whenever different people praise different points in you, and all are pushing forward

most intimately. The controversy about the dioceses you will no doubt yourself resolve according
to the grace of the Spirit which is in you, and to the order of the canons. But I hope
Your Reverence will see that it is not to be endured that our affairs are to be posted up in
the secular courts. For even if they who are judges of such courts are Christians, as by the
mercy of God they are, what is there in common between the Sword and the Spirit? And
even if we yield this point, how or where can it be just that a dispute concerning the faith
should be interwoven with the other questions? Is our God-beloved Bishop Bosporius today
a heretic? Is it to-day that his hoar hair is set in the balance, who has brought back so
many from their error, and has given so great proof of his orthodoxy, and is a teacher of us
all? No, I entreat you, do not give place to such slanders; but if possible reconcile the opposing
parties and add this to your praises; but if this may not be, at all events do not allow us
all, (with whom he has lived, and with whom he has grown old,) to be outraged by such insolence,—
us whom you know to be accurate preachers of the Gospel, both when to be so
was dangerous, and when it is free from risk; and to be unable to endure any detraction
from the One Unapproachable Godhead. And I beg you to pray for me who am suffering

<head>§7. To Theodore, Bishop of Tyana.</head>
<p>(Theodore, a native of Arianzus, and an intimate friend of Gregory, accompanied him
to Constantinople a.d. 379, and shared his persecution by the Arians, who broke into their
church during the celebration of the divine liturgy, and pelted the clergy with stones.
Theodore could not bring himself to put up with this, and declared his intention of prosecuting
the aggressors. Gregory wrote the following letter to dissuade him from this course,
by shewing him how much more noble it is to forgive than to revenge.)</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">    
<head>Ep. LXXVII.</head>
<p>I hear that you are indignant at the outrages which have been committed on us by the
Monks and the Mendicants. And it is no wonder, seeing that you never yet had felt a blow,
and were without experience of the evils we have to endure, that you did feel angry at such
a thing. But we as experienced in many sorts of evil, and as having had our share of insult,
may be considered worthy of belief when we exhort Your Reverence, as old age teaches and
as reason suggests. Certainly what has happened was dreadful, and more than dreadful,—no
one will deny it: that our altars were insulted, our mysteries disturbed, and that we ourselves
had to stand between the communicants and those who would stone them, and to make
our intercessions a cure for stonings; that the reverence due to virgins was forgotten, and
the good order of monks, and the calamity of the poor, who lost even their pity through ferocity.
But perhaps it would be better to be patient, and to give an example of patience to
many by our sufferings. For argument is not so persuasive of the world in general as is
practice, that silent exhortation.</p>
<p>We think it an important matter to obtain penalties from those who have wronged us:
an important matter, I say, (for even this is sometimes useful for the correction of others)—
but it is far greater and more Godlike, to bear with injuries. For the former course
curbs wickedness, but the latter makes men good, which is much better and more perfect
than merely being not wicked. Let us consider that the great pursuit of mercifulness is set
before us, and let us forgive the wrongs done to us that we also may obtain forgiveness, and
let us by kindness lay up a store of kindness.</p>
<p>Phineas was called Zelotes because he ran through the Midianitish woman with the
man who was committing fornication with her,4752 and because he took away the reproach
from the children of Israel: but he was more praised because he prayed for the people when
they had transgressed.4753 Let us then also stand and make propitiation, and let the plague
be stayed, and let this be counted unto us for righteousness. Moses also was praised because

<pb n="944"/>
he slew the Egyptian that oppressed the Israelite;4754 but he was more admirable because
he healed by his prayer his sister Miriam when she was made leprous for her murmuring.4755
Look also at what follows. The people of Nineve are threatened with an overthrow, but by
their tears they redeem their sin.4756 Manasses was the most lawless of Kings,4757 but is
the most conspicuous among those who have attained salvation through mourning.</p>
<p>O Ephraim what shall I do unto thee,4758 saith God. What anger is here expressed—and
yet protection is added. What is swifter than Mercy? The Disciples ask for flames of Sodom
upon those who drive Jesus away, but He deprecates revenge.4759 Peter cuts off the ear of
Malchus, one of those who outraged Him, but Jesus restores it.4760 And what of him who
asks whether he must seven times forgive a brother if he has trespassed, is he not condemned
for his niggardliness, for to the seven is added seventy times seven?4761 What of the debtor
in the Gospel who will not forgive as he has been forgiven?4762 Is it not more bitterly exacted
of him for this? And what saith the pattern of prayer? Does it not desire that forgiveness
may be earned by forgiveness?</p>
<p>Having so many examples let us imitate the mercy of God, and not desire to learn from
ourselves how great an evil is requital of sin. You see the sequence of goodness. First it
makes laws, then it commands, threatens, reproaches, holds out warnings, restrains, threatens
again, and only when forced to do so strikes the blow, but this little by little, opening the
way to amendment. Let us then not strike suddenly (for it is not safe to do so), but being
self-restrained in our fear let us conquer by mercy, and make them our debtors by our
kindness, tormenting them by their conscience rather than by anger. Let us not dry up a
fig tree which may yet bear fruit,4763 nor condemn it as useless and cumbering the ground,
when possibly the care and diligence of a skilful gardener may yet heal it. And do not let
us so quickly destroy so great and glorious a work through what is perhaps the spite and
malice of the devil; but let us choose to shew ourselves merciful rather than severe, and
lovers of the poor rather than of abstract justice; and let us not make more account of those
who would enkindle us to this than of those who would restrain us, considering, if nothing

charge of the Diocese of Nazianzus; but he very soon found that his health was not equal to
so great a task, and that he could not fulfil its calls upon him. He struggled on for some

<p>It is time for me to use these words of Scripture, To whom shall I cry when I am
wronged?4769 Who will stretch out a hand to me when I am oppressed? To whom shall
the burden of this Church pass, in its present evil and paralysed condition? I protest before
God and the Elect Angels that the Flock of God is being unrighteously dealt with in being
left without a Shepherd or a Bishop, through my being laid on the shelf. For I am a prisoner
to my ill health and have been very quickly removed thereby from the Church, and made
quite useless to everybody, every day breathing my last, and getting more and more crushed
by my duties. If the Province had any other head, it would have been my duty to cry out
and protest to it continually. But since Your Reverence is the Superior, it is to you I must
look. For, to leave out everything else, you shall learn from my fellow-priests, Eulalius the
Chorepiscopus4770 and Celeusius, whom I have specially sent to Your Reverence, what these
robbers4771 who have now got the upper hand, are both doing and threatening. To repress
them is not in the power of my weakness, but belongs to your skill and strength; since to
you, with His other gifts God has given that of strength also for the protection of His Church.
If in saying and writing this I cannot get a hearing, I shall take the only course remaining
to me, that of publicly proclaiming and making known that this Church needs a Bishop, in
order that it may not be injured by my feeble health. What is to follow is matter for your
consideration.</p>

<p>(George a layman of Paspasus, was sent by Theodore of Tyana to Saint Gregory that
the latter might convince him of his error and sin in repudiating an oath which he had taken,
on the ground that it was taken in writing and not viva voce. Gregory seems to have brought
him to a better mind, and sent him back to the Metropolitan with the following letter, requesting
that due penance be imposed upon him, and have its length regulated by his contrition.
This letter was read to the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, by Euphrantes,
a successor of Theodore in the See of Tyana, and was accepted by the Fathers, wherefore it
is regarded as having almost the force of a Canon of the Church Universal.)</p>
<p>God grant you to the Churches, both for our glory, and for the benefit of many, being
as you are so circumspect and cautious in spiritual matters as to make us also more cautious
who are considered to have some advantage over you in years. Since, however, you have
wished to take us as partners in your spiritual inquiry (I mean about the oath which George
of Paspasus appears to have sworn), we will declare to Your Reverence what presents itself
to our mind. Very many people, as it seems to me, delude themselves by considering oaths
which are taken with the sanction of spoken imprecations to be real oaths, but those which
are written and not verbally uttered, to be mere matter of form, and no oaths at all. For
how can we suppose that while a written schedule of debts is more binding than a verbal
acknowledgment, yet a written oath is something other than an oath? Or to speak concisely,
we hold an oath to be the assurance given to one who asked for and obtained it. Nor is it
sufficient to say that he suffered violence (for the violence was the Law by which he bound
himself), nor that afterwards he won the cause in the Law Court—for the very fact that he
went to law was a breach of his oath. I have persuaded our brother George of this, not to
pretend excuses for his sin, and not to seek out arguments to defend his transgression, but
to recognize the writing as an oath, and to bewail his sin before God and Your Reverence,
even though he formerly deceived himself and took a different view of it. This is what we
have personally argued with him; and it is evident that if you will discourse with him more
carefully, you will deepen his contrition, since you are a great healer of souls, and having
treated him according to the Canon for as long a time as shall seem right, you will afterwards
be able to confer indulgence upon him in the matter of time. And the measure of the time
must be the measure of his compunction.</p>

<p>(Helladius, Archbishop of Cæsarea, contested the validity of the election of Eulalius to
the Bishopric of Nazianzus, and accused Bosporius of heresy. S. Gregory here throws the
whole weight of his authority into the other scale. It is however manifest from the very
terms of the letter that the person addressed is not Theodore of Tyana. It was conjectured
by Clémencet that perhaps he was Theodore of Mopsuestia.)</p>
<p>Envy, which no one easily escapes, has got some foothold amongst us. See, even we
Cappadocians are in a state of faction, so to speak—a calamity never heard of before, and
not to be believed—so that no flesh may glory4773 in the sight of God, but that we may be
careful, since we are all human, not to condemn each other rashly. For myself, there is some
gain even from the misfortune (if I may speak somewhat paradoxically), and I really gather
a rose out of thorns, as the proverb has it. Hitherto I have never met Your Reverence face
to face, nor conversed with you by letter, but have only been illuminated by your reputation;
but now I am of necessity compelled to approach you by letter, and I am very grateful to
him who has procured me this privilege. I omit to write to the other Bishops about whom
you wrote to me, as the opportunity has not yet arisen. Moreover my weak health makes
me less active in this matter; but what I write to you I write to them also through you. My
Lord the God-beloved Bishop Helladius4774 must cease to waste his labour on our concerns.
For it is not through spiritual earnestness, but through party zeal, that he is seeking this;
and not for the sake of accurate compliance with the canons, but for the satisfaction of anger,
as is evident by the time he has chosen, and because many have moved with him unreasonably,
for I must say this, and not trouble myself about it. If I were physically in a condition
to govern the Church of Nazianzus, to which I was originally appointed, and not to Sasima
as some would falsely persuade you, I should not have been so cowardly or so ignorant of
the Divine Constitutions as either to despise that Church, or to seek for an easy life in preference
to the prizes which are in store for those who labour according to God’s will, and
work with the talent committed to their care. For what profit should I have from my many
labours and my great hopes, if I were ill advised in the most important matters? But since
my bodily health is bad, as everyone can plainly see, and I have not any responsibility to
fear on account of this withdrawal, for the reason I have mentioned, and I saw that the
Church through cleaving to me was suffering in its best interests and almost being destroyed
through my illness, I prayed both before and now again my Lords the God-beloved Bishops
(I mean those of our own Province) to give the Church a head, which they have done by
God’s Grace, worthy both of my desire and of your prayers. This I would have you both

know yourself, most honourable Lord, and also inform the rest of the Bishops, that they
may receive him and support him by their votes, and not bear heavily on my old age by believing
the slander. Let me add this to any letter. If your examination finds my Lord the
God-beloved Priest Bosporius guilty concerning the faith—a thing which it is not lawful
even to suggest—(I pass over his age and my personal testimony) judge him so yourselves.
But if the discussion about the dioceses is the cause of this evil report and this novel accusation,
do not be led away by the slander, and do not give to falsehoods a greater strength
than to the truth, I beg you, lest you should cast into despair those who desire to do what
is right. May you be granted good health and spirits and courage and continual progress
in the things of God to us and to the Church, whose common boast you are.</p>

Your Reverence to know the dishonour which I have suffered at the hands of my Lords the

excluded us. I will not lay the blame on Your Reverence, because you have but recently
come to preside over our affairs, and are, as is to be expected, for the most part unacquainted
with our history. This is quite enough: for I have no mind to trouble you further, that I
may not seem burdensome at the very beginning of our friendship. But I will tell you what
suggests itself to me in taking counsel with God. I retired from the Church at Nazianzus,
not as either despising God, or looking down on the littleness of the flock (God forbid that
a philosophic4776 soul should be so disposed); but first because I am not bound by any such
appointment: and secondly because I am broken down by my ill health, and do not think
myself equal to such anxieties. And since you too have been heavy on me, in reproaching
me with my resignation, and I myself could not endure the clamours against me, and since
the times are hard, threatening us with an inroad of enemies to the injury of the commonwealth
of the whole Church, I finally made up my mind to suffer a defeat which is painful
to my body, but perhaps not bad for my soul. I make over this miserable body to the Church
for as long as it may be possible, thinking it better to suffer any distress to the flesh rather
than to incur a spiritual injury myself or to inflict it upon others, who have thought the
worst of us, judging from their own experience. Knowing this, do pray for me, and approve
my resolution: and perhaps it is not out of place to say, mould yourself to piety.</p>

<p>(An answer to a request made by Nicobulus for a treatise on the art of writing letters.
Benoît thinks this and the following ones were written to the Younger Nicobulus.)</p>
<p>Of those who write letters, since this is what you ask, some write at too great a length,
and others err on the side of deficiency; and both miss the mean, like archers shooting at a
mark and sending some shafts short of it and others beyond it; for the missing is the same
though on opposite sides. Now the measure of letters is their usefulness: and we must
neither write at very great length when there is little to say, nor very briefly when there is a
great deal. What? Are we to measure our wisdom by the Persian Schoene, or by the cubits
of a child, and to write so imperfectly as not to write at all but to copy the midday shadows,
or lines which meet right in front of you, whose lengths are foreshortened and which show
themselves in glimpses rather than plainly, being recognized only by certain of their extremities?
We must in both respects avoid the want of moderation and hit off the moderate. This
is my opinion as to brevity; as to perspicuity it is clear that one should avoid the oratorical
form as much as possible and lean rather to the chatty: and, to speak concisely, that is the
best and most beautiful letter which can convince either an unlearned or an educated
reader; the one, as being within the reach of the many; the other, as above the many; and it
should be intelligible in itself. It is equally disagreeable to think out a riddle and to have to
interpret a letter. The third point about a letter is grace: and this we shall safeguard if we
do not write in any way that is dry and unpleasing or unadorned and badly arranged and
untrimmed, as they call it; as for instance a style destitute of maxims and proverbs and pithy
sayings, or even jokes and enigmas, by which language is sweetened. Yet we must not seem
to abuse these things by an excessive employment of them. Their entire omission shews
rusticity, but the abuse of them shews insatiability. We may use them about as much as
purple is used in woven stuffs. Figures of speech we shall admit, but few and modest. Antitheses
and balanced clauses and nicely divided sentences, we shall leave to the sophists, or
if we do sometimes admit them, we shall do so rather in play than in earnest. My final remark
shall be one which I heard a clever man make about the eagle, that when the birds were
electing a king, and came with various adornment, the most beautiful point about him was
that he did not think himself beautiful. This point is to be especially attended to in letter-
writing, to be without adventitious ornament and as natural as possible. So much about
letters I send you by a letter; but perhaps you had better not apply it to myself, who am
busied about more important matters. The rest you will work out for yourself, as you are
quick at learning, and those who are clever in these matters will teach you.</p>

labour that you are imposing on me, but rather one which is very agreeable and quiet, to

so successfully as to induce Olympius to pardon the outbreak.)</p>
<p>Again an opportunity for kindness: and again I am bold enough to commit to a letter
my entreaty about so important a matter. My illness makes me thus bold, for it does not

then is my Embassy? Pray receive it from me gently and kindly. The death of a single man,
who to-day is and to-morrow will not be and will not return to us is of course a dreadful
thing. But it is much more dreadful for a City to die, which Kings founded, and time compacted,
and a long series of years has preserved. I speak of Diocæsarea, once a City, a City
no longer, unless you grant it mercy. Think that this place now falls at your feet by me: let
it have a voice, and be clothed in mourning and cut off its hair as in a tragedy, and let it
speak to you in such words as these:</p>
<p>Give a hand to me that lie in the dust: help the strengthless: do not add the weight of
your hand to time, nor destroy what the Persians have left me. It is more honourable to
you to raise up cities than to destroy those that are distressed. Be my founder, either by
adding to what I possess, or by preserving me as I am. Do not suffer that up to the time of
your administration I should be a City, and after you should be so no longer: do not give
occasion to after times to speak evil of you, that you received me numbered among cities,
and left me an uninhabited spot, which was once a city, only recognizable by mountains
and precipices and woods.</p>
<p>This let the City of my imagination do and say to your mercy. But deign to receive an
exhortation from me as your friend: certainly chastise those who have rebelled against the
Edict of your authority. On this behalf I am not bold to say anything, although this piece
of audacity was not, they say, of universal design, but was only the unreasoning anger of a
few young men. But dismiss the greater part of your anger, and use a larger reasoning.
They were grieved for their Mother’s being put to death; they could not endure to be called
citizens, and yet to be without political rights: they were mad: they committed an offence
against the law: they threw away their own safety: the unexpectedness of the calamity deprived
them of reason. Is it really necessary that for this the city should cease to be a city?
Surely not. Most excellent, do not write the order for this to be done. Rather respect the
supplication of all citizens and statesmen and men of rank—for remember the calamity will

<pb n="972"/>
touch all alike—even if the greatness of your authority keeps them silent, sighing as it were
in secret. Respect also my gray hair: for it would be dreadful to me, after having had a great
city, now to have none at all, and that after your government the Temple which we have
raised to God, and our love for its adornment, is to become a dwelling for beasts. It is not
a terrible thing if some statues were thrown down—though in itself it would be so—but I
would not have you think that I am speaking of this, when all my care is for more important
things: but it is dreadful if an ancient city is to be destroyed with them—one which has
splendidly endured, as I, who am honoured by you, and am supposed to have some influence,
have lived to see. But this is enough upon such a subject, for I shall not, if I speak at greater
length, find anything stronger than your own reasons, by which this nation is governed—and
may more and greater ones be governed by them too, and that in greater commands. This
however it was needful that Your Magnanimity should know about those who have fallen
before your feet, that they are altogether wretched and despairing, and have not shared in
any disorder with those who have broken the law, as I am certified by many who were then
present. Therefore deliberate what you may think expedient, both for your own reputation
in this world, and your hopes in the next. We will bear what you determine—not indeed
without grief—but we will bear it: for what else can we do? If the worse determination
prevail, we shall be indignant, and shall shed a tear over our City that has ceased to be.</p>

<p>Though my desire to meet you is warm, and the need of your petitioners is great, yet
my illness is invincible. Therefore I am bold to commit my intercession to writing. Have
respect to our gray hair, which you have already often reverenced by good actions. Have
respect also to my infirmity, to which my labours for God have in part contributed, if I may
swagger a little. For this cause spare the citizens who look to me because I use some freedom
of speech with you. And spare also the others who are under my care. For public affairs
will suffer no damage through mercy, since you can do more by fear than others by punishment.
May you, as your reward for this, obtain such a Judge as you shew yourself to your
petitioners and to me their intercessor.</p>

<head>Ep. CXLIII.</head>
<p>What does much experience, and experience of good do for men? It teaches kindness,
and inclines them to those who entreat them. There is no such education in pity as the
previous reception of goodness. This has happened to myself among others. I have learned
compassion by the things which I have suffered. And do you see my greatness of soul when
I myself need your gentleness in my own affairs? I intercede for others, and do not fear lest
I should exhaust all your kindness on other men’s concerns. I am writing thus on behalf of
the Presbyter Leontius—or, if I may so describe him, the ex-Presbyter. If he has suffered
sufficiently for what he has done, let us stop there, lest excess become injustice. And if there
is still any balance of punishment due, and the consequences of his crime have not yet
equalled his offence, yet remit it for our sake and God’s, and that of the sanctuary, and the
general assembly of the priests, among whom he was once numbered, even though he has
now shewn himself unworthy of them, both by what he has done and by what he has suffered.
If I can prevail with you it will be best; but if not, I will bring to you a more powerful intercessor,
her who is the partner both of your rule and of your good fame.</p>

<head>Ep. CXLIV.</head>
<p>(Verianus, a citizen of Nazianzus, had been offended by his son-in-law, and on this account
wished his daughter to sue for a divorce. Olympius referred the matter to the Episcopal
arbitration of S. Gregory, who refused to countenance the proceeding, and writes the two
following letters, the first to the Prefect, the second to Verianus himself.)</p>
<p>Haste is not always praiseworthy. For this reason I have deferred my answer until now
about the daughter of the most honorable Verianus, both to allow for time setting matters
right, and also because I conjecture that Your Goodness does not approve of the divorce,
inasmuch as you entrusted the enquiry to me, whom you knew to be neither hasty nor uncircumspect
in such matters. Therefore I have refrained myself till now, and, I venture to
think, not without reason. But since we have come nearly to the end of the allotted time,
and it is necessary that you should be informed of the result of the examination I will inform
you. The young lady seems to me to be of two minds, divided between reverence for her
parents and affection for her husband. Her words are on their side, but her mind, I rather
think, is with her husband, as is shewn by her tears. You will do what commends itself to
your justice, and to God who directs you in all things. I should most willingly have given
my opinion to my son Verianus that he should pass over much of what is in question, with
a view not to confirm the divorce, which is entirely contrary to our law,4781 though the
Roman law may determine otherwise. For it is necessary that justice be observed—which
I pray you may ever both say and do.</p>

<head>Ep. CXLV. To Verianus.</head>
<p>Public executioners commit no crime, for they are the servants of the laws: nor is the
sword unlawful with which we punish criminals. But nevertheless, the public executioner
is not a laudable character, nor is the death-bearing sword received joyfully. Just so neither
can I endure to become hated by confirming the divorce by my hand and tongue. It is far
better to be the means of union and of friendship than of division and parting of life. I
suppose it was with this in his mind that our admirable Governor entrusted me with the
enquiry about your daughter, as one who could not proceed to divorce abruptly or unfeelingly.
For he proposed me not as Judge, but as Bishop, and placed me as a mediator in your
unhappy circumstances. I beg you therefore, to make some allowance for my timidity, and
if the better prevail, to use me as a servant of your desire: I rejoice in receiving such commands.
But if the worse and more cruel course is to be taken, seek for some one more
suitable to your purpose. I have not time, for the sake of favouring your friendship (though
in all respects I have the highest regard for you), to offend against God, to Whom I have to
give account of every action and thought. I will believe your daughter (for the truth shall
be told) when she can lay aside her awe of you, and boldly declare the truth. At present her
condition is pitiable—for she assigns her words to you, and her tears to her husband.</p>

<head>To Olympius. Ep. CXLVI.</head>
<p>This is what I said as if by a sort of prophecy, when I found you favourable to every request,
and was making insatiable use of your gentleness, that I fear I shall exhaust your
kindness upon the affairs of others. For see, a contest of my own has come (if that is mine
which concerns my own relations), and I cannot speak with the same freedom. First, because
it is my own. For to entreat for myself, though it may be more useful, is more humiliating.
And next, I am afraid of excess as destroying pleasure, and opposing all that is good. So
matters stand, and I conjecture only too rightly. Nevertheless with confidence in God before
Whom I stand, and in your magnanimity in doing good, I am bold to present this petition.</p>
<p>Suppose Nicobulus to be the worst of men:—though his only crime is that through me
he is an object of envy, and more free than he ought to be. And suppose that my present
opponent is the most just of men. For I am ashamed to accuse before Your Uprightness
one whom yesterday I was supporting: but I do not know if it will seem to you just that
punishment should be demanded for one man’s crimes from another, though these were
quite strange to him, and had not even his consent; from the man who has so stirred his
household and been so upset as to have surrendered to his accuser more readily than the
latter wished. Must Nicobulus or his children be reduced to slavery as his persecutors desire?
I am ashamed both of the ground of the persecution and of the time, if this is to be done
while both you are in power and I have influence with you. Not so, most admirable friend,
let not this be suggested to Your Integrity. But recognizing by the winged swiftness of your
mind the malice from which this proceeds, and having respect to me your admirer, shew
yourself a merciful judge to those who are being disturbed—for to-day you are not merely
judging between man and man, but between virtue and vice; and to this more consideration
than by an ordinary man must be given by those who are like you in virtue and are skilful
governors. And in return for this you shall have from me not only the matter of my prayers,
which I know you do not, like so many men, despise; but also that I will make your government
famous with all to whom I am known.</p>
</div>

<head>Ep. CLIV.</head>
<p>To me you are Prefect even after the expiry of your term of office—for I judge things
differently from the run of men—because you embrace in yourself every prefectoral virtue.
For many of those who sit on lofty thrones are to me base, all those whose hand makes them
base and slaves of their subjects.4782 But many are high and lofty though they stand low,
whom virtue places on high and makes worthy of greater government. But what have I to
do with this? No longer is the great Olympius with us, nor does he bear our rudder-lines.
We are undone, we are betrayed, we have become again the Second Cappadocia, after having
been made the First by you. Of other men’s matters why should I speak? but who will
cherish the old age of your Gregory, and administer to his weakness the enchantment of
honours, and make him more honourable because he obtains kindness for many from you?
Now then depart on your journey with escort and greater pomp, leaving behind for us many
tears, and carrying with you much wealth, and that of a kind which few Prefects do, good
fame, and the being inscribed on all hearts, pillars not easily moved. If you preside over us
again with greater and more illustrious rule, (this is what our longing augurs), we shall offer
to God more perfect thanks.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. This volume contains selected works
of St. Basil the Great. St. Basil is well-known for his care for the poor and his important
impact upon the communal practices of the monastic life. The Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating
texts from some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually
enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive
and fruitful even today!

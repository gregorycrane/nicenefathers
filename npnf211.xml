<head>NPNF-211. Sulpitius Severus, Vincent of Lerins,
John Cassian</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.The Nicene and Post-
Nicene Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide
keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from
some of the great theologians of the Christian church.These
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over
a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even
today!

<p>Book I. 1402</p>
<p>Chapter I. The heresy compared to the hydra of the poets. 1403</p>
<p>Chapter II. Description of the different heretical monsters which spring from Chapter III. He describes the pestilent error of the Pelagian. 1407</p>
<p>Chapter IV. Leporius together with some others recants his Pelagianism. 1408</p>

<pb n="xlix"/>
<p>Chapter V. By the case of Leporius he establishes the fact that an open sin ought to be expiated by an open confession; and also teaches from his words
what is the right view to be held on the Incarnation.1409</p>
<p>Chapter VI. The united doctrine of the Catholics is to be received as the orthodox faith.1412</p>
<p>Book II. 1413</p>
<p>Chapter I. How the errors of later heretics have been condemned and refuted in the persons of their authors and originators.1414</p>
<p>Chapter II. Proof that the Virgin Mother of God was not only Christotocos but also Theotocos, and that Christ is truly God.1415</p>
<p>Chapter III. Follows up the same argument with passages from the Old Testament.1418</p>
<p>Chapter IV. He produces testimonies to the same doctrine from the Apostle Paul.1421</p>
<p>Chapter V. From the gifts of Divine grace which we receive through Christ he infers that He is truly God.1424</p>
<p>Chapter VI. That the power of bestowing Divine grace did not come to Christ in the course of time, but was innate in Him from His very birth.1425</p>
<p>Chapter VII. How in Christ the Divinity, Majesty, Might and Power have existed in perfection from eternity, and will continue.1428</p>
<p>Book III. 1429</p>
<p>Chapter I. That Christ, who is God and man in the unity of Person, sprang from Israel and the Virgin Mary according to the flesh.1430</p>
<p>Chapter II. The title of God is given in one sense to Christ, and in another to men.1431</p>
<p>Chapter III. He explains the apostle's saying: “If from henceforth we know no man according to the flesh,” etc.1432</p>
<p>Chapter IV. From the Epistle to the Galatians he brings forward a passage to show that the weakness of the flesh in Christ was absorbed by His Divinity.1434</p>
<p>Chapter V. As it is blasphemy to pare away the Divinity of Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that He is true man.1435</p>
<p>Chapter VI. He shows from the appearance of Christ vouchsafed to the Apostle when persecuting the Church, the existence of both natures in Him.1436</p>
<p>Chapter VII. He shows once more by other passages of the Apostle that Christ is God.1438</p>

<pb n="l"/>
<p>Chapter VIII. When confessing the Divinity of Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of the cross.1440</p>
<p>Chapter IX. How the Apostle's preaching was rejected by Jews and Gentiles because it confessed that the crucified Christ was God.1441</p>
<p>Chapter X. How the apostle maintains that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.1442</p>
<p>Chapter XI. He supports the same doctrine by proofs from the gospel. 1444</p>
<p>Chapter XII. He proves from the renowned confession of the blessed Peter that Christ is God.1445</p>
<p>Chapter XIII. The confession of the blessed Peter receives a testimony to its truth from Christ Himself.1447</p>
<p>Chapter XIV. How the confession of the blessed Peter is the faith of the whole Church.1448</p>
<p>Chapter XV. St. Thomas also confessed the same faith as Peter after the Lord's resurrection.1449</p>
<p>Chapter XVI. He brings forward the witness of God the Father to the Divinity of the Son.1451</p>
<p>Book IV. 1454</p>
<p>Chapter I. That Christ was before the Incarnation God from everlasting. 1455</p>
<p>Chapter II. He infers from what he has said that the Virgin Mary gave birth to a Son who had pre-existed and was greater than she herself was.1456</p>
<p>Chapter III. He proves from the Epistle to the Romans the eternal Divinity of Christ.1457</p>
<p>Chapter IV. He brings forward other testimonies to the same view. 1459</p>
<p>Chapter V. How in virtue of the hypostatic union of the two natures in Christ the Word is rightly termed the Saviour, or incarnate man, and the Son of God.1460</p>
<p>Chapter VI. That there is in Christ but one Hypostasis (i.e., Personal self). 1461</p>
<p>Chapter VII. He returns to the former subject, in order to show against the Nestorians that those things are said of the man, which belong to the Divine
nature as it were of a Person of Divine nature, and conversely that those things are said of God, which belong to the human nature as it were of a Person of human nature, because there is in Christ but one and a single Personal self.1463</p>
<p>Chapter VIII. How this interchange of titles does not interfere with His Divine power.1465</p>
<p>Chapter IX. He corroborates this statement by the authority of the old prophets.1466</p>

<pb n="li"/>
<p>Chapter X. He proves Christ's Divinity from the blasphemy of Judaizing Jews as well as from the confession of converts to the faith of Christ.1469</p>
<p>Chapter XI. He returns to the prophecy of Isaiah. 1470</p>
<p>Chapter XII. How the title of Saviour is given to Christ in one sense, and to men in another.1471</p>
<p>Chapter XIII. He explains who are those in whose person the Prophet Isaiah says: “Thou art our God, and we knew Thee not.”1472</p>
<p>Book V. 1474</p>
<p>Chapter I. He vehemently inveighs against the error of the Pelagians, who declared that Christ was a mere man.1475</p>
<p>Chapter II. That the doctrine of Nestorius is closely connected with the error of the Pelagians.1477</p>
<p>Chapter III. How this participation in Divinity which the Pelagians and Nestorians attribute to Christ, is common to all holy men.1478</p>
<p>Chapter IV. What the difference is between Christ and the saints. 1479</p>
<p>Chapter V. That before His birth in time Christ was always called God by the prophets.1481</p>
<p>Chapter VI. He illustrates the same doctrine by passages from the New Testament.1483</p>
<p>Chapter VII. He shows again from the union in Christ of two natures in one Person that what belongs to the Divine nature may rightly be ascribed to man,
and what belongs to the human nature to God.1485</p>
<p>Chapter VIII. He confirms the judgment of the Apostle by the authority of the Lord.1488</p>
<p>Chapter IX. Since those marvellous works which from the days of Moses were shown to the children of Israel are attributed to Christ, it follows that He must
have existed long before His birth in time.1489</p>
<p>Chapter X. He explains what it means to confess, and what it means to dissolve Jesus.1491</p>
<p>Chapter XI. The mystery of the Lord's Incarnation clearly implies the Divinity of Christ.1493</p>
<p>Chapter XII. He explains more fully what the mystery is which is signified under the name of the man and wife.1495</p>
<p>Chapter XIII. Of the longing with which the old patriarchs desired to see the revelation of that mystery.1497</p>

<pb n="lii"/>
<p>Chapter XIV. He refutes the wicked and blasphemous notion of the heretics who said that God dwelt and spoke in Christ as in an instrument or a statue.1498</p>
<p>Chapter XV. What the prayers of the saints for the coming of Messiah contained; and what was the nature of that longing of theirs.1499</p>
<p>Book VI. 1500</p>
<p>Chapter I. From the miracle of the feeding of the multitude from five barley loaves and two fishes he shows the majesty of Divine Power.1501</p>
<p>Chapter II. The author adapts the mystery of the number seven (made up of the five loaves and two fishes) to his own work.1502</p>
<p>Chapter III. He refutes his opponent by the testimony of the Council of Antioch.1504</p>
<p>Chapter IV. How the Creed has authority Divine as well as human. 1507</p>
<p>Chapter V. He proceeds against his opponent with the choicest arguments, and shows that we ought to hold fast to the religion which we have received
from our fathers.1508</p>
<p>Chapter VI. Once more he challenges him to the profession of the Creed of Antioch.1510</p>
<p>Chapter VII. He continues the same line of argument drawn from the Creed of Antioch.1512</p>
<p>Chapter VIII. How it can be said that Christ came and was born of a Virgin. 1513</p>
<p>Chapter IX. Again he convicts his opponent of deadly heresy by his own confession.1514</p>
<p>Chapter X. He inveighs against him because though he has forsaken the Catholic religion, he nevertheless presumes to teach in the Church, to sacrifice,
and to give decisions.1515</p>
<p>Chapter XI. He removes the silent objection of heretics who want to recant the profession of their faith made in childhood.1517</p>
<p>Chapter XII. Christ crucified is an offence and foolishness to those who declare that He was a mere man.1518</p>
<p>Chapter XIII. He replies to the objection in which they say that the child born ought to be of one substance with the mother.1519</p>
<p>Chapter XIV. He compares this erroneous view with the teaching of the Pelagians.1520</p>
<p>Chapter XV. He shows that those who patronize this false teaching acknowledge two Christs.1521</p>

<pb n="liii"/>
<p>Chapter XVI. He shows further that this teaching is destructive of the confession of the Trinity.1522</p>
<p>Chapter XVII. Those who are under an error in one point of the Catholic religion, lose the whole faith, and all the value of the faith.1523</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII. He directs his discourse upon his antagonist with whom he is disputing, and begs him to return to his senses. The sacrament of
reconciliation is necessary for the lapsed for their salvation.1524</p>
<p>Chapter XIX. That the birth of Christ in time diminished nothing of the glory and power of His Deity.1525</p>
<p>Chapter XX. He shows from what has been said that we do not mean that God was mortal or of flesh before the worlds, although Christ, who is God
from eternity and was made man in time, is but one Person.1527</p>
<p>Chapter XXI. The authority of Holy Scripture teaches that Christ existed from all eternity.1528</p>
<p>Chapter XXII. The hypostatic union enables us to ascribe to God what belongs to the flesh in Christ.1529</p>
<p>Chapter XXIII. That the figure Synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, is very familiar to the Holy Scripture.1531</p>
<p>Book VII. 1533</p>
<p>Chapter I. As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a prayer to be used by those who undertake
to dispute with heretics.1534</p>
<p>Chapter II. He meets the objection taken from these words: No one gave birth to one who had existed before her.1536</p>
<p>Chapter III. He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears.1538</p>
<p>Chapter IV. How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as well as in everything else.1540</p>
<p>Chapter V. He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz., that the one born ought to be of one substance
with the one who bears, fails to hold good in many cases.1542</p>
<p>Chapter VI. He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried to make out that Christ was like Adam in every point.1544</p>
<p>Chapter VII. Heretics usually cover their doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.1546</p>

<pb n="liv"/>
<p>Chapter VIII. The heretics attribute to Christ only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped together with God but not as God.1547</p>
<p>Chapter IX. How those are wrong who say that the birth of Christ was a secret, since it was clearly shown even to the patriarch Jacob.1548</p>
<p>Chapter X. He collects more witnesses of the same fact. 1550</p>
<p>Chapter XI. How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that Christ was God.1551</p>
<p>Chapter XII. He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows that this
last is worse and more blasphemous than the former.1552</p>
<p>Chapter XIII. How the devil always retained this notion of Christ's Divinity (because of His secret working which he experienced) even up to His Cross
and Death.1553</p>
<p>Chapter XIV. He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying to the argument drawn from the Apostle's words, “Without father, without
mother,” etc.: Heb. vii.1554</p>
<p>Chapter XV. How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without genealogy. 1556</p>
<p>Chapter XVI. He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.1557</p>
<p>Chapter XVII. That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds from Christ Himself,
as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was another's and proceeded from
another source.1558</p>
<p>Chapter XVIII. How we are to understand the Apostle's words: “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,” etc.1560</p>
<p>Chapter XIX. That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.1561</p>
<p>Chapter XX. He tries by stronger and weightier arguments to destroy that notion.1563</p>
<p>Chapter XXI. That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy Ghost that His flesh and Humanity became the temple of God.1564</p>
<p>Chapter XXII. That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.1565</p>
<p>Chapter XXIII. He continues the same argument to show that Christ had no need of another's glory as He had a glory of His own.1566</p>

<pb n="lv"/>
<p>Chapter XXIV. He supports this doctrine by the authority of the blessed Hilary.1567</p>
<p>Chapter XXV. He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary. 1568</p>
<p>Chapter XXVI. He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome. 1569</p>
<p>Chapter XXVII. To the foregoing he adds Rufinus and the blessed Augustine. 1570</p>
<p>Chapter XXVIII. As he is going to produce the testimony of Greek or Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the first place S. Gregory Nazianzen.1571</p>
<p>Chapter XXIX. In the next place he puts the authority of S. Athanasius. 1572</p>
<p>Chapter XXX. He adds also S. John Chrysostom. 1573</p>
<p>Chapter XXXI. He bemoans the unhappy lot of Constantinople, owing to the misfortune which has overtaken it from that heretic; and at the same time he
urges the citizens to stand fast in the ancient Catholic and ancestral faith.1575</p>

<head>LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SULPITIUS SEVERUS.</head>
<p>Sulpitius (or Sulpicius) Severus was born in Aquitania about a.d. 363, and died, as is
generally supposed, in a.d. 420. He was thus a contemporary of the two great Fathers of the
Church, St. Jerome and St. Augustine. The former refers to him in his Commentary on the
36th chapter of Ezekiel as “our friend Severus.” St. Augustine, again, having occasion to allude
to him in his 205th letter, describes him as “a man excelling in learning and wisdom.” Sulpitius
belonged to an illustrious family. He was very carefully educated, and devoted himself
in his early years to the practice of oratory. He acquired a high reputation at the bar; but,
while yet in the prime of life, he resolved to leave it, and seek, in company with some pious
friends, contentment and peace in a life of retirement and religious exercises. The immediate
occasion of this resolution was the premature death of his wife, whom he had married at
an early age, and to whom he was deeply attached. His abandonment of the pleasures and
pursuits of the world took place about a.d. 392; and, notwithstanding all the entreaties and
expostulations of his father, he continued, from that date to his death, to lead a life of the
strictest seclusion. Becoming a Presbyter of the Church, he attached himself to St. Martin
of Tours, for whom he ever afterwards cherished the profoundest admiration and affection,
and whose extraordinary career he has traced with a loving pen in by far the most interesting
of his works.</p>
<p>It is stated by some ancient writers that Sulpitius ultimately incurred the charge of
heresy, having, to some extent, embraced Pelagian opinions. And there have not been
wanting those in modern times who thought they could detect traces of such errors in his
works. But it seems to us that there is no ground for any such conclusion. Sulpitius constantly
presents himself to us as a most strenuous upholder of “catholic” or “orthodox” doctrines.
It is evident that his whole heart was engaged in the love and maintenance of these doctrines:
he counts as his “friends” those only who consistently adhered to them; and, while by no
means in favor of bitterly prosecuting or severely punishing “heretics,” he shrunk with abhorrence
from all thought of communion with them. Perhaps the most striking impression
we receive from a perusal of his writings is his sincerity. We may often feel that he is overcredulous
in his acceptance of the miraculous; and we may lament his narrowness in clinging
so tenaciously to mere ecclesiastical formulæ; but we are always impressed with the genuineness
of his convictions, and with his fervent desire to bring what he believed to be truth
under the attention of his readers.</p>
<p>The style of Sulpitius is, upon the whole, marked by a considerable degree of classical
purity and clearness. He has been called “the Christian Sallust,” and there are not a few obvious
resemblances between the two writers. But some passages occur in Sulpitius which
are almost, if not entirely, unintelligible. This is owing partly to the uncertainty of the text,
and partly to the use of terms which had sprung up since classical times, and the exact import

<pb n="4"/>
of which it is impossible to determine. In executing our version of this author (now for the
first time, we believe, translated into English), we have had constantly before us the editions
of Sigonius (1609), of Hornius (1664), of Vorstius (1709), and of Halm (1866). We have
also consulted a very old French translation of the Historia Sacra, published at Rouen in
1580.</p>
<p>The order in which we have arranged the writings of Sulpitius is as follows:—
<lg>
<l>1. Life of St. Martin.</l>
<l>2. Letters (undoubted).</l>
<l>3. Dialogues.</l>
<l>4. Letters (doubtful).</l>
<l>5. Sacred History.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>By far the most attractive of these works are those bearing on the life and achievements
of St. Martin. Sulpitius delights to return again and again to this wonderful man, and cannot
find language sufficiently strong in which to extol his merits. Hence, not only in the professed
Life, but also in the Letters and Dialogues, we have him brought very fully before us. The
reader will find near the beginning of the Vita as translated by us, a note bearing upon the
solemn asseverations of Sulpitius as to the reality of the miracles which Martin performed.</p>
<p>Most of the Letters here given are deemed spurious by Halm, the latest editor of our
author. He has, nevertheless, included the whole of them in his edition, and we have thought
it desirable to follow his example in our translation.</p>
<p>The Sacred History of Sulpitius has for its object to present a compendious history of
the world from the Creation down to the year a.d. 400. The first and longer portion of the
work is simply an abridgment of the Scripture narrative. The latter part is more interesting
and valuable, as it deals with events lying outside of Scripture, and respecting which we are
glad to obtain information from all available sources. Unfortunately, however, Sulpitius is
not always a trustworthy authority. His inaccuracies in the first part of his work are very
numerous, and will be found pointed out in our version.</p>
<p>The following are some of the Estimates which have been formed of our author.</p>
<p>Paulinus, a contemporary of Sulpitius, and bishop of Nola, addressed to him about fifty
letters, in the fifth of which he thus writes: “It certainly would not have been given to thee
to draw up an account of Martin, unless by a pure heart thou hadst rendered thy mouth
worthy of uttering his sacred praises. Thou art blessed, therefore, of the Lord, inasmuch as
thou hast been able, in worthy style, and with proper feeling, to complete the history of so
great a priest, and so illustrious a confessor. Blessed, too, is he, in accordance with his merits,
who has obtained a historian worthy of his faith and of his life; and who has become consecrated
to the Divine glory by his own virtues, and to human memory by thy narrative regarding
him.”</p>

<pb n="5"/>
<p>Gennadius (died a.d. 496), in his “Catalogue of illustrious men,” says: “The Presbyter
Severus, whose cognomen was Sulpitius, belonged to the province of Aquitania. He was a
man distinguished both for his family and learning, and was remarkable for his love of
poverty and humility. He was also a great friend of some holy men, such as Martin, bishop
of Tours, and Paulinus, bishop of Nola; and his works are by no means to be neglected.”</p>
<p>In modern times, J. J. Scaliger has said of Sulpitius, “He is the purest of all the ecclesiastical
writers.” And Vossius, referring to some remarks of Baronius on Sulpitius, says: “I differ
from him (Baronius) in this, that, without sufficient care, he calls Gennadius the contemporary
of Severus, since Gennadius flourished seventy years, more or less, after Severus. For
he dedicated his book ‘On Faith’ (as he himself tells us) to Pope Gelasius, who became
bishop of Rome in a.d. 492. But he greatly extols the holiness of Sulpitius; and in the Roman
martyrology his memory (i.e. of Sulpitius) is celebrated on the 29th of January.”</p>
<p>Archdeacon Farrar has recently remarked concerning Martin and Sulpitius, “Owing
partly to the eloquent and facile style of his (Martin’s) biographer, Sulpicius Severus, his
name was known from Armenia to Egypt more widely than that of any other monk or
bishop of his day.”—Lives of the Fathers, i. 628.</p>

ON THE LIFE OF ST. MARTIN.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="7"/>
<head>PREFACE TO DESIDERIUS.</head>
<p>Severus to his dearest brother Desiderius sendeth greeting. I had determined, my likeminded
brother, to keep private, and confine within the walls of my own house, the little
treatise which I had written concerning the life of St. Martin. I did so, as I am not gifted
with much talent, and shrank from the criticisms of the world, lest (as I think will be the
case) my somewhat unpolished style should displease my readers, and I should be deemed
highly worthy of general reprehension for having too boldly laid hold of a subject which
ought to have been reserved for truly eloquent writers. But I have not been able to refuse
your request again and again presented. For what could there be which I would not grant
in deference to your love, even at the expense of my own modesty? However, I have submitted
the work to you on the sure understanding that you will reveal it to no other, having received
your promise to that effect. Nevertheless, I have my fears that you will become the means
of its publication to the world; and I well know that, once issued, it can never1 be recalled.
If this shall happen, and you come to know that it is read by some others, you will, I trust,
kindly ask the readers to attend to the facts related, rather than the language in which they
are set forth. You will beg them not to be offended if the style chances unpleasantly to affect
their ears, because the kingdom of God consists not of eloquence, but faith. Let them also
bear in mind that salvation was preached to the world, not by orators, but by fishermen,
although God could certainly have adopted the other course, had it been advantageous. For
my part, indeed, when I first applied my mind to writing what follows, because I thought it
disgraceful that the excellences of so great a man should remain concealed, I resolved with
myself not to feel ashamed on account of solecisms of language. This I did because I had
never attained to any great knowledge of such things; or, if I had formerly some taste of
studies of the kind, I had lost the whole of that, through having neglected these matters for
so long a course of time. But, after all, that I may not have in future to adopt such an irksome
mode of self-defense, the best way will be that the book should be published, if you think
right, with the author’s name suppressed. In order that this may be done, kindly erase the
title which the book bears on its front, so that the page may be silent; and (what is quite
enough) let the book proclaim its subject-matter, while it tells nothing of the author.</p>

<head>Reasons for writing the Life of St. Martin.</head>
<p>Most men being vainly devoted to the pursuit of worldly glory, have, as they imagined,
acquired a memorial of their own names from this source; viz. devoting their pens to the
embellishment of the lives of famous men. This course, although it did not secure for them
a lasting reputation, still has undoubtedly brought them some fulfilment of the hope they
cherished. It has done so, both by preserving their own memory, though to no purpose, and
because, through their having presented to the world the examples of great men, no small
emulation has been excited in the bosoms of their readers. Yet, notwithstanding these things,
their labors have in no degree borne upon the blessed and never-ending life to which we
look forward. For what has a glory, destined to perish with the world, profited those men
themselves who have written on mere secular matters? Or what benefit has posterity derived
from reading of Hector as a warrior, or Socrates as an expounder of philosophy? There can
be no profit in such things, since it is not only folly to imitate the persons referred to, but
absolute madness not to assail them with the utmost severity. For, in truth, those persons
who estimate human life only by present actions, have consigned their hopes to fables, and
their souls to the tomb. In fact, they gave themselves up to be perpetuated simply in the
memory of mortals, whereas it is the duty of man rather to seek after eternal life than an
eternal memorial and that, not by writing, or fighting, or philosophizing, but by living a
pious, holy, and religious life. This erroneous conduct of mankind, being enshrined in literature,
has prevailed to such an extent that it has found many who have been emulous either
of the vain philosophy or the foolish excellence which has been celebrated. For this reason,
I think I will accomplish something well worth the necessary pains, if I write the life of a
most holy man, which shall serve in future as an example to others; by which, indeed, the
readers shall be roused to the pursuit of true knowledge, and heavenly warfare, and divine
virtue. In so doing, we have regard also to our own advantage, so that we may look for, not
a vain remembrance among men, but an eternal reward from God. For, although we ourselves
have not lived in such a manner that we can serve for an example to others, nevertheless,
we have made it our endeavor that he should not remain unknown who was a man worthy
of imitation. I shall therefore set about writing the life of St. Martin, and shall narrate both
what he did previous to his episcopate, and what he performed as a bishop. At the same
time, I cannot hope to set forth all that he was or did. Those excellences of which he alone
was conscious are completely unknown, because, as he did not seek for honor from men,
he desired, as much as he could accomplish it, that his virtues should be concealed. And
even of those which had become known to us, we have omitted a great number, because we
have judged it enough if only the more striking and eminent should be recorded. At the
same time, I had in the interests of readers to see to it that, no undue amount of instances

<pb n="9"/>
being set before them should make them weary of the subject. But I implore those who are
to read what follows to give full faith to the things narrated, and to believe that I have written
nothing of which I had not certain knowledge and evidence. I should, in fact, have preferred
to be silent rather than to narrate things which are false.2</p>
<note type="footnote">2 This is a remarkable asseveration in view of the many miraculous accounts which follow. When we remember,
on the one hand, how intimate Sulpitius was with St. Martin, and how strongly, as in this passage, he avouches
the truth of all he narrates, it is extremely difficult to decide as to the real value of his narrative. It has been said (Smith’s Dict. II. 967) that Sulpitius’ Life of St. Martinus is “filled with the most puerile fables,” and undoubtedly
many of the stories recorded are of that character. But whether, considering the close relation in which the two
men stood to each other, all the miraculous accounts are to be discredited, must be left to the judgment of the reader. The following valuable remarks may be quoted on this interesting question. “Some forty years ago,” writes Dr. Cazenove, “an audience in Oxford was listening to a professor of modern history (Dr. Arnold of
Rugby), who discussed this subject. After pointing out the difference between the Gospel miracles and those
recorded by ecclesiastical historians, the lecturer proceeded as follows: ‘Some appear to be unable to conceive of belief or unbelief, except as having some ulterior object: “We believe this because we love it: we disbelieve it
because we wish it to be disproved.” There is, however, in minds more healthfully constituted a belief and a
disbelief, founded solely upon the evidence of the case, arising neither out of partiality, nor out of prejudice against the supposed conclusions, which may result from its truth or falsehood. And in such a spirit the historical
student will consider the case of Bede’s and other historians’ miracles. He will, I think, as a general rule, disbelieve them, for the immense multitude which he finds recorded, and which, I suppose, no credulity could believe in, shows sufficiently that on this point there was a total want of judgment and a blindness of belief generally existing which make the testimony wholly insufficient; and, while the external evidence in favor of these alleged miracles is so unsatisfactory, there are, for the most part, strong internal evidence against them.
But with regard to some miracles, he will see that there is no strong a priori improbability in their occurence, but rather the contrary; as, for instance, when the first missionaries of the Gospel in a barbarous country are
said to have been assisted by a manifestation of the spirit of power; and, if the evidence appears to warrant his
belief, he will readily and gladly yield it. And in doing so he will have the countenance of a great man (Burke)
who in his fragment of English history has not hesitated to express the same sentiments. Nor will he be unwilling,
but most thankful, to find sufficient grounds for believing that not only at the beginning of the Gospel, but in
ages long afterwards, believing prayer has received extraordinary answers; that it has been heard even in more
than it might have dared to ask for. Yet, again, if the gift of faith—the gift as distinguished from the grace—of
the faith which removes mountains, has been given to any in later times in remarkable measure the mighty
works which such faith may have wrought cannot be incredible in themselves to those who remember our Lord’s
promise, and if it appears from satisfactory evidence that they were wrought actually, we shall believe them,—and
believe with joy. Only as it is in most cases impossible to admit the trustworthiness of the evidence, our minds
must remain at the most in a state of suspense; and I do not know why it is necessary to come to any positive
decision.’”—“The Fathers for English Readers”: St. Hilary of Poitiers and St. Martin of Tours, p. 191. On this
subject it has lately been said: “Most, if not all, of the so-called miracles which were supposed to surround</note>

<head>Military Service of St. Martin.</head>
<p>Martin, then, was born at Sabaria3 in Pannonia, but was brought up at Ticinum,4 which
is situated in Italy. His parents were, according to the judgment of the world, of no mean
rank, but were heathens. His father was at first simply a soldier, but afterwards a military
tribune. He himself in his youth following military pursuits was enrolled in the imperial
guard, first under king Constantine, and then under Julian Cæsar. This, however, was not
done of his own free will, for, almost from his earliest years, the holy infancy of the illustrious
boy aspired rather to the service of God.5 For, when he was of the age of ten years, he betook
himself, against the wish of his parents, to the Church, and begged that he might become a
catechumen. Soon afterwards, becoming in a wonderful manner completely devoted to the
service of God, when he was twelve years old, he desired to enter on the life of a hermit; and
he would have followed up that desire with the necessary vows, had not his as yet too
youthful age prevented. His mind, however, being always engaged on matters pertaining to
the monasteries or the Church, already meditated in his boyish years what he afterwards,
as a professed servant of Christ, fulfilled. But when an edict was issued by the ruling powers6
in the state, that the sons of veterans should be enrolled for military service, and he, on the
information furnished by his father, (who looked with an evil eye on his blessed actions)
having been seized and put in chains, when he was fifteen years old, was compelled to take
the military oath, then showed himself content with only one servant as his attendant. And
even to him, changing places as it were, he often acted as though, while really master, he
had been inferior; to such a degree that, for the most part, he drew off his [servant’s] boots
and cleaned them with his own hand; while they took their meals together, the real master,
however, generally acting the part of servant. During nearly three years before his baptism,
he was engaged in the profession of arms, but he kept completely free from those vices in
which that class of men become too frequently involved. He showed exceeding kindness

towards his fellow-soldiers, and held them in wonderful affection; while his patience and
humility surpassed what seemed possible to human nature. There is no need to praise the
self-denial which he displayed: it was so great that, even at that date, he was regarded not
so much as being a soldier as a monk. By all these qualities he had so endeared himself to
the whole body of his comrades, that they esteemed him while they marvelously loved him.
Although not yet made a new creature7 in Christ, he, by his good works, acted the part of
a candidate for baptism. This he did, for instance, by aiding those who were in trouble, by
furnishing assistance to the wretched, by supporting the needy, by clothing the naked, while
he reserved nothing for himself from his military pay except what was necessary for his daily
sustenance. Even then, far from being a senseless hearer of the Gospel, he so far complied
with its precepts as to take no thought about the morrow.</p>
<note type="footnote">7 Sulpitius manifestly refers to baptism in these words. However mistakenly, several others of the early Fathers
held that regeneration does not take place before baptism, and that baptism is, in fact, absolutely necessary to
regeneration. St. Ambrose has the following strong statement on the subject: “Credit catechumenus; sed nisi
baptizetur, remissionem peccatorum non potest obtinere.”—Libri de his, qui initiantur mysteriis, chap. 4.</note>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Christ appears to St. Martin.</head>
<p>Accordingly, at a certain period, when he had nothing except his arms and his simple
military dress, in the middle of winter, a winter which had shown itself more severe than
ordinary, so that the extreme cold was proving fatal to many, he happened to meet at the
gate of the city of Amiens8 a poor man destitute of clothing. He was entreating those that
passed by to have compassion upon him, but all passed the wretched man without notice,
when Martin, that man full of God, recognized that a being to whom others showed no pity,
was, in that respect, left to him. Yet, what should he do? He had nothing except the cloak
in which he was clad, for he had already parted with the rest of his garments for similar
purposes. Taking, therefore, his sword with which he was girt, he divided his cloak into two
equal parts, and gave one part to the poor man, while he again clothed himself with the remainder.
Upon this, some of the by-standers laughed, because he was now an unsightly
object, and stood out as but partly dressed. Many, however, who were of sounder understanding,
groaned deeply because they themselves had done nothing similar. They especially
felt this, because, being possessed of more than Martin, they could have clothed the poor
man without reducing themselves to nakedness. In the following night, when Martin had
resigned himself to sleep, he had a vision of Christ arrayed in that part of his cloak with
which he had clothed the poor man. He contemplated the Lord with the greatest attention,
and was told to own as his the robe which he had given. Ere long, he heard Jesus saying with
a clear voice to the multitude of angels standing round—“Martin, who is still but a catechumen,
clothed9 me with this robe.” The Lord, truly mindful of his own words (who had said
when on earth—“Inasmuch10 as ye have done these things to one of the least of these, ye
have done them unto me), declared that he himself had been clothed in that poor man; and
to confirm the testimony he bore to so good a deed, he condescended to show him himself
in that very dress which the poor man had received. After this vision the sainted man was
not puffed up with human glory, but, acknowledging the goodness of God in what had been
done, and being now of the age of twenty years, he hastened to receive baptism. He did not,
however, all at once, retire from military service, yielding to the entreaties of his tribune,
whom he admitted to be his familiar tent-companion.11 For the tribune promised that, after

the period of his office had expired, he too would retire from the world. Martin, kept back
by the expectation of this event, continued, although but in name, to act the part of a soldier,
for nearly two years after he had received baptism.</p>

<head>Martin retires from Military Service.</head>
<p>In the meantime, as the barbarians were rushing within the two divisions of Gaul, Julian
Cæsar,12 bringing an army together at the city13 of the Vaugiones, began to distribute a
donative to the soldiers. As was the custom in such a case, they were called forward, one
by one, until it came to the turn of Martin. Then, indeed, judging it a suitable opportunity
for seeking his discharge—for he did not think it would be proper for him, if he were not
to continue in the service, to receive a donative—he said to Cæsar, “Hitherto I have served
you as a soldier: allow me now to become a soldier to God: let the man who is to serve thee
receive thy donative: I am the soldier of Christ: it is not lawful for me to fight.” Then truly
the tyrant stormed on hearing such words, declaring that, from fear of the battle, which was
to take place on the morrow, and not from any religious feeling, Martin withdrew from the
service. But Martin, full of courage, yea all the more resolute from the danger that had been
set before him, exclaims, “If this conduct of mine is ascribed to cowardice, and not to faith,
I will take my stand unarmed before the line of battle tomorrow, and in the name of the
Lord Jesus, protected by the sign of the cross, and not by shield or helmet, I will safely penetrate
the ranks of the enemy.” He is ordered, therefore, to be thrust back into prison, determined
on proving his words true by exposing himself unarmed to the barbarians. But,
on the following day, the enemy sent ambassadors to treat about peace and surrendered
both themselves and all their possessions. In these circumstances who can doubt that this
victory was due to the saintly man? It was granted him that he should not be sent unarmed
to the fight. And although the good Lord could have preserved his own soldier, even amid
the swords and darts of the enemy, yet that his blessed eyes might not be pained by witnessing
the death of others, he removed all necessity for fighting. For Christ did not require to secure
any other victory in behalf of his own soldier, than that, the enemy being subdued without
bloodshed, no one should suffer death.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Martin converts a Robber to the Faith.</head>
<p>From that time quitting military service, Martin earnestly sought after the society of
Hilarius, bishop of the city Pictava,14 whose faith in the things of God was then regarded
as of high renown, and in universal esteem. For some time Martin made his abode with
him. Now, this same Hilarius, having instituted him in the office of the diaconate, endeavored
still more closely to attach him to himself, and to bind him by leading him to take part in
Divine service. But when he constantly refused, crying out that he was unworthy, Hilarius,
as being a man of deep penetration, perceived that he could only be constrained in this way,
if he should lay that sort of office upon him, in discharging which there should seem to be
a kind of injury done him. He therefore appointed him to be an exorcist. Martin did not
refuse this appointment, from the fear that he might seem to have looked down upon it as
somewhat humble. Not long after this, he was warned in a dream that he should visit his
native land, and more particularly his parents, who were still involved in heathenism, with
a regard for their religious interests. He set forth in accordance with the expressed wish of
the holy Hilarius, and, after being adjured by him with many prayers and tears, that he
would in due time return. According to report Martin entered on that journey in a melancholy
frame of mind, after calling the brethren to witness that many sufferings lay before
him. The result fully justified this prediction. For, first of all, having followed some devious
paths among the Alps, he fell into the hands of robbers. And when one of them lifted up his
axe and poised it above Martin’s head, another of them met with his right hand the blow as
it fell; nevertheless, having had his hands bound behind his back, he was handed over to
one of them to be guarded and stripped. The robber, having led him to a private place apart
from the rest, began to enquire of him who he was. Upon this, Martin replied that he was
a Christian. The robber next asked him whether he was afraid. Then indeed Martin most
courageously replied that he never before had felt so safe, because he knew that the mercy
of the Lord would be especially present with him in the midst of trials. He added that he
grieved rather for the man in whose hands he was, because, by living a life of robbery, he
was showing himself unworthy of the mercy of Christ. And then entering on a discourse
concerning Evangelical truth, he preached the word of God to the robber. Why should I
delay stating the result? The robber believed; and, after expressing his respect for Martin,
he restored him to the way, entreating him to pray the Lord for him. That same robber was

afterwards seen leading a religious life; so that, in fact, the narrative I have given above is
based upon an account furnished by himself.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>The Devil throws himself in the Way of Martin.</p>
<p>Martin, then, having gone on from thence, after he had passed Milan, the devil met him
in the way, having assumed the form of a man. The devil first asked him to what place he
was going. Martin having answered him to the effect that he was minded to go whithersoever
the Lord called him, the devil said to him, “Wherever you go, or whatever you attempt, the
devil will resist you.” Then Martin, replying to him in the prophetical word, said, “The Lord
is my helper; I will not fear what man can do unto me.”15 Upon this, his enemy immediately
vanished out of his sight; and thus, as he had intended in his heart and mind, he set free his
mother from the errors of heathenism, though his father continued to cleave to its evils.
However, he saved many by his example.</p>
<p>After this, when the Arian heresy had spread through the whole world, and was especially
powerful in Illyria, and when he, almost single-handed, was fighting most strenuously against
the treachery of the priests, and had been subjected to many punishments (for he was publicly
scourged, and at last was compelled to leave the city), again betaking himself to Italy, and
having found the Church in the two divisions of Gaul in a distracted condition through the
departure also of the holy Hilarius, whom the violence of the heretics had driven into exile,
he established a monastery for himself at Milan. There, too, Auxentius, the originator and
leader of the Arians, bitterly persecuted him; and, after he had assailed him with many injuries,
violently expelled him from the city. Thinking, therefore, that it was necessary to
yield to circumstances, he withdrew to the island Gallinaria,16 with a certain presbyter as
his companion, a man of distinguished excellences. Here he subsisted for some time on the
roots of plants; and, while doing so, he took for food hellebore, which is, as people say, a
poisonous kind of grass. But when he perceived the strength of the poison increasing within
him, and death now nearly at hand, he warded off the imminent danger by means of prayer,
and immediately all his pains were put to flight. And not long after having discovered that,
through penitence on the part of the king, permission to return had been granted to holy
Hilarius, he made an effort to meet him at Rome, and, with this view, set out for that city.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Martin restores a Catechumen to Life.</head>
<p>As Hilarius had already gone away, so Martin followed in his footsteps; and having been
most joyously welcomed by him, he established for himself a monastery not far from the
town. At this time a certain catechumen joined him, being desirous of becoming instructed
in the doctrines17 and habits of the most holy man. But, after the lapse only of a few days,
the catechumen, seized with a languor, began to suffer from a violent fever. It so happened
that Martin had then left home, and having remained away three days, he found on his return
that life had departed from the catechumen; and so suddenly had death occurred, that he
had left this world without receiving baptism. The body being laid out in public was being
honored by the last sad offices on the part of the mourning brethren, when Martin hurries
up to them with tears and lamentations. But then laying hold, as it were, of the Holy Spirit,
with the whole powers of his mind, he orders the others to quit the cell in which the body
was lying; and bolting the door, he stretches himself at full length on the dead limbs of the
departed brother. Having given himself for some time to earnest prayer, and perceiving by
means of the Spirit of God that power was present,18 he then rose up for a little, and gazing
on the countenance of the deceased, he waited without misgiving for the result of his prayer
and of the mercy of the Lord. And scarcely had the space of two hours elapsed, when he saw
the dead man begin to move a little in all his members, and to tremble with his eyes opened
for the practice of sight. Then indeed, turning to the Lord with a loud voice and giving
thanks, he filled the cell with his ejaculations. Hearing the noise, those who had been
standing at the door immediately rush inside. And truly a marvelous spectacle met them,
for they beheld the man alive whom they had formerly left dead. Thus being restored to life,
and having immediately obtained baptism, he lived for many years afterwards; and he was
the first who offered himself to us both as a subject that had experienced the virtues19 of
Martin, and as a witness to their existence. The same man was wont to relate that, when he
left the body, he was brought before the tribunal of the Judge, and being assigned to gloomy
regions and vulgar crowds, he received a severe20 sentence. Then, however, he added, it was
suggested by two angels of the Judge that he was the man for whom Martin was praying;
and that, on this account, he was ordered to be led back by the same angels, and given up
to Martin, and restored to his former life. From this time forward, the name of the sainted

<head>Martin restores one that had been strangled.</head>
<p>Not long after these events, while Martin was passing by the estate of a certain man
named Lupicinus, who was held in high esteem according to the judgment of the world, he
was received with shouting and the lamentations of a wailing crowd. Having, in an anxious
state of mind gone up to that multitude, and enquired what such weeping meant, he was
told that one of the slaves of the family had put an end to his life by hanging. Hearing this,
Martin entered the cell in which the body was lying, and, excluding all the multitude, he
stretched himself upon the body, and spent some little time in prayer. Ere long, the deceased,
with life beaming in his countenance, and with his drooping eyes fixed on Martin’s face, is
aroused; and with a gentle effort attempting to rise, he laid hold of the right hand of the
saintly man, and by this means stood upon his feet. In this manner, while the whole multitude
looked on, he walked along with Martin to the porch of the house.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>High Esteem in which Martin was held.</head>
<p>Nearly about the same time, Martin was called upon to undertake the episcopate of the
church at Tours;21 but when he could not easily be drawn forth from his monastery, a certain
Ruricius, one of the citizens, pretending that his wife was ill, and casting himself down at
his knees, prevailed on him to go forth. Multitudes of the citizens having previously been
posted by the road on which he traveled, he is thus under a kind of guard escorted to the
city. An incredible number of people not only from that town, but also from the neighboring
cities, had, in a wonderful manner, assembled to give their votes.22 There was but one wish
among all, there were the same prayers, and there was the same fixed opinion to the effect
that Martin was most worthy of the episcopate, and that the church would be happy with
such a priest. A few persons, however, and among these some of the bishops, who had been
summoned to appoint a chief priest, were impiously offering resistance, asserting forsooth
that Martin’s person was contemptible, that he was unworthy of the episcopate, that he was
a man despicable in countenance, that his clothing was mean, and his hair disgusting. This
madness of theirs was ridiculed by the people of sounder judgment, inasmuch as such objectors
only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man, while they sought to slander
him. Nor truly was it allowed them to do anything else, than what the people, following the
Divine will, desired23 to be accomplished. Among the bishops, however, who had been
present, a certain one of the name Defensor is said to have specially offered opposition; and
on this account it was observed that he was at the time severely censured in the reading
from the prophets. For when it so happened that the reader, whose duty it was to read in
public that day, being blocked out by the people, failed to appear, the officials falling into
confusion, while they waited for him who never came, one of those standing by, laying hold
of the Psalter, seized upon the first verse which presented itself to him. Now, the Psalm ran
thus: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise because of thine
enemies, that thou mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger.”24 On these words being
read, a shout was raised by the people, and the opposite party were confounded. It was believed
that this Psalm had been chosen by Divine ordination, that Defensor25 might hear a

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Martin as Bishop of Tours.</head>
<p>And now having entered on the episcopal office, it is beyond my power fully to set forth
how Martin distinguished himself in the discharge of its duties. For he remained with the
utmost constancy, the same as he had been before. There was the same humility in his heart,
and the same homeliness in his garments. Full alike of dignity and courtesy, he kept up the
position of a bishop properly, yet in such a way as not to lay aside the objects and virtues of
a monk. Accordingly he made use, for some time, of the cell connected with the church;
but afterwards, when he felt it impossible to tolerate the disturbance caused by the numbers
of those visiting it, he established a monastery for himself about two miles outside the city.
This spot was so secret and retired that he enjoyed in it the solitude of a hermit. For, on one
side, it was surrounded by a precipitous rock of a lofty mountain, while the river Loire had
shut in the rest of the plain by a bay extending back for a little distance; and the place could
be approached only by one, and that a very narrow passage. Here, then, he possessed a cell
constructed of wood. Many also of the brethren had, in the same manner, fashioned retreats
for themselves, but most of them had formed these out of the rock of the overhanging
mountain, hollowed into caves. There were altogether eighty disciples, who were being
disciplined after the example of the saintly master. No one there had anything which was
called his own; all things were possessed in common. It was not allowed either to buy or to
sell anything, as is the custom among most monks. No art was practiced there, except that
of transcribers, and even this was assigned to the brethren of younger years, while the elders
spent their time in prayer. Rarely did any one of them go beyond the cell, unless when they
assembled at the place of prayer. They all took their food together, after the hour of fasting
was past. No one used wine, except when illness compelled them to do so. Most of them
were clothed in garments of camels’ hair.26 Any dress approaching to softness27 was there
deemed criminal, and this must be thought the more remarkable, because many among
them were such as are deemed of noble rank. These, though far differently brought up, had
forced themselves down to this degree of humility and patient endurance, and we have seen
numbers of these afterwards made bishops. For what city or church would there be that
would not desire to have its priests from among those in the monastery of Martin?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Martin demolishes an Altar consecrated to a Robber.</head>
<p>But let me proceed to a description of other excellences which Martin displayed as a
bishop. There was, not far from the town, a place very close to the monastery, which a false
human opinion had consecrated, on the supposition that some martyrs had been buried
together there. For it was also believed that an altar had been placed there by former bishops.
But Martin, not inclined to give a hasty belief to things uncertain, often asked from those
who were his elders, whether among the presbyters or clerics, that the name of the martyr,
or the time when he suffered, should be made known to him. He did so, he said, because he
had great scruples on these points, inasmuch as no steady tradition respecting them had
come down from antiquity. Having, therefore, for a time kept away from the place, by no
means wishing to lessen the religious veneration with which it was regarded, because he
was as yet uncertain, but, at the same time not lending his authority to the opinion of the
multitude, lest a mere superstition should obtain a firmer footing, he one day went out to
the place, taking a few brethren with him as companions. There standing above the very
sepulchre, Martin prayed to the Lord that he would reveal, who the man in question was,
and what was his character or desert. Next turning to the left-hand side, he sees standing
very near a shade of a mean and cruel appearance. Martin commands him to tell his name
and character. Upon this, he declares his name, and confesses his guilt. He says that he had
been a robber, and that he was beheaded on account of his crimes; that he had been honored
simply by an error of the multitude; that he had nothing in common with the martyrs, since
glory was their portion, while punishment exacted its penalties from him. Those who stood
by heard, in a wonderful way, the voice of the speaker, but they beheld no person. Then
Martin made known what he had seen, and ordered the altar which had been there to be
removed, and thus he delivered the people from the error of that superstition.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Martin causes the Bearers of a Dead Body to stop.</head>
<p>Now, it came to pass some time after the above, that while Martin was going a journey,
he met the body of a certain heathen, which was being carried to the tomb with superstitious
funeral rites. Perceiving from a distance the crowd that was approaching, and being ignorant
as to what was going on, he stood still for a little while. For there was a distance of nearly
half a mile between him and the crowd, so that it was difficult to discover what the spectacle
he beheld really was. Nevertheless, because he saw it was a rustic gathering, and when the
linen clothes spread over the body were blown about by the action of the wind, he believed
that some profane rites of sacrifice were being performed. This thought occurred to him,
because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through
the fields the images of demons veiled with a white covering. Lifting up, therefore, the sign
of the cross opposite to them, he commanded the crowd not to move from the place in
which they were, and to set down the burden. Upon this, the miserable creatures might have
been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavored, with every possible
effort, to move forward, but were not able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves
about in the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight,
they set down the dead body. Thunderstruck, and gazing in bewilderment at each other as
not knowing what had happened to them they remained sunk in silent thought. But when
the saintly man discovered that they were simply a band of peasants celebrating funeral
rites, and not sacrifices to the gods, again raising his hand, he gave them the power of going
away, and of lifting up the body. Thus he both compelled them to stand when he pleased,
and permitted them to depart when he thought good.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Martin escapes from a Falling Pine-tree.</head>
<p>Again, when in a certain village he had demolished a very ancient temple, and had set
about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the temple, the chief priest of that
place, and a crowd of other heathens began to oppose him. And these people, though, under
the influence of the Lord, they had been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, could
not patiently allow the tree to be cut down. Martin carefully instructed them that there was
nothing sacred in the trunk of a tree, and urged them rather to honor God whom he himself
served. He added that there was a moral necessity why that tree should be cut down, because
it had been dedicated to a demon. Then one of them who was bolder than the others says,
“If you have any trust in thy God, whom you say you worship, we ourselves will cut down
this tree, and be it your part to receive it when falling; for if, as you declare, your Lord is
with you, you will escape all injury.” Then Martin, courageously trusting in the Lord,
promises that he would do what had been asked. Upon this, all that crowd of heathen agreed
to the condition named; for they held the loss of their tree a small matter, if only they got
the enemy of their religion buried beneath its fall. Accordingly, since that pine-tree was
hanging over in one direction, so that there was no doubt to what side it would fall on being
cut, Martin, having been bound, is, in accordance with the decision of these pagans, placed
in that spot where, as no one doubted, the tree was about to fall. They began, therefore, to
cut down their own tree, with great glee and joyfulness, while there was at some distance a
great multitude of wondering spectators. And now the pine-tree began to totter, and to
threaten its28 own ruin by falling. The monks at a distance grew pale, and, terrified by the
danger ever coming nearer, had lost all hope and confidence, expecting only the death of
Martin. But he, trusting in the Lord, and waiting courageously, when now the falling pine
had uttered its expiring crash, while it was now falling, while it was just rushing upon him,
simply holding up his hand against it, he put in its way the sign of salvation. Then, indeed,
after the manner of a spinning-top (one might have thought it driven29 back), it swept round
to the opposite side, to such a degree that it almost crushed the rustics, who had taken their
places there in what was deemed a safe spot. Then truly, a shout being raised to heaven, the
heathen were amazed by the miracle, while the monks wept for joy; and the name of Christ
was in common extolled by all. The well-known result was that on that day salvation came
to that region. For there was hardly one of that immense multitude of heathens who did
<note type="footnote">28 Perhaps “suam” here stands for “ejus,” as in other passages of our author. The meaning will then be, “and
to threaten his (Martin’s) destruction by falling.”</note>

<pb n="27"/>
not express a desire for the imposition of hands, and abandoning his impious errors, made
a profession of faith in the Lord Jesus. Certainly, before the times of Martin, very few, nay,
almost none, in those regions had received the name of Christ; but through his virtues and
example that name has prevailed to such an extent, that now there is no place thereabouts
which is not filled either with very crowded churches or monasteries. For wherever he destroyed
heathen temples, there he used immediately to build either churches or monasteries.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="28"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Martin destroys Heathen Temples and Altars.</head>
<p>Nor did he show less eminence, much about the same time, in other transactions of a
like kind. For, having in a certain village set fire to a very ancient and celebrated temple, the
circle of flames was carried by the action of the wind upon a house which was very close to,
yea, connected with, the temple. When Martin perceived this, he climbed by rapid ascent
to the roof of the house, presenting himself in front of the advancing flames. Then indeed
might the fire have been seen thrust back in a wonderful manner against the force of the
wind, so that there appeared a sort of conflict of the two elements fighting together. Thus,
by the influence of Martin, the fire only acted in the place where it was ordered to do so.
But in a village which was named Leprosum, when he too wished to overthrow a temple
which had acquired great wealth through the superstitious ideas entertained of its sanctity,
a multitude of the heathen resisted him to such a degree that he was driven back not without
bodily injury. He, therefore, withdrew to a place in the vicinity, and there for three days,
clothed in sackcloth30 and ashes fasting and praying the whole time, he besought the Lord,
that, as he had not been able to overthrow that temple by human effort, Divine power might
be exerted to destroy it. Then two angels, with spears and shields after the manner of heavenly
warriors, suddenly presented themselves to him, saying that they were sent by the Lord to
put to flight the rustic multitude, and to furnish protection to Martin, lest, while the temple
was being destroyed, any one should offer resistance. They told him therefore to return,
and complete the blessed work which he had begun. Accordingly Martin returned to the
village; and while the crowds of heathen looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan
temple even to the foundations, he also reduced all the altars and images to dust. At this
sight the rustics, when they perceived that they had been so astounded and terrified by an
intervention of the Divine will, that they might not be found fighting against the bishop,
almost all believed in the Lord Jesus. They then began to cry out openly and to confess that
the God of Martin ought to be worshiped, and that the idols should be despised, which were
not able to help them.</p>

<head>Martin offers his Neck to an Assassin.</head>
<p>I shall also relate what took place in the village of the Ædui. When Martin was there
overthrowing a temple, a multitude of rustic heathen rushed upon him in a frenzy of rage.
And when one of them, bolder than the rest, made an attack upon him with a drawn sword,
Martin, throwing back his cloak, offered his bare neck to the assassin. Nor did the heathen
delay to strike, but in the very act of lifting up his right arm, he fell to the ground on his
back, and being overwhelmed by the fear of God, he entreated for pardon. Not unlike this
was that other event which happened to Martin, that when a certain man had resolved to
wound him with a knife as he was destroying some idols, at the very moment of fetching
the blow, the weapon was struck out of his hands and disappeared. Very frequently, too,
when the pagans were addressing him to the effect that he would not overthrow their temples,
he so soothed and conciliated the minds of the heathen by his holy discourse that, the light
of truth having been revealed to them, they themselves overthrew their own temples.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>Cures effected by St. Martin.</head>
<p>Moreover, the gift31 of accomplishing cures was so largely possessed by Martin, that
scarcely any sick person came to him for assistance without being at once restored to health.
This will clearly appear from the following example. A certain girl at Treves32 was so completely
prostrated by a terrible paralysis that for a long time she had been quite unable to
make use of her body for any purpose, and being, as it were, already dead, only the smallest
breath of life seemed still to remain in her. Her afflicted relatives were standing by, expecting
nothing but her death, when it was suddenly announced that Martin had come to that city.
When the father of the girl found that such was the case, he ran to make a request in behalf
of his all but lifeless child. It happened that Martin had already entered the church. There,
while the people were looking on, and in the presence of many other bishops, the old man,
uttering a cry of grief, embraced the saint’s knees and said: “My daughter is dying of a
miserable kind of infirmity; and, what is more dreadful than death itself, she is now alive
only in the spirit, her flesh being already dead before the time. I beseech thee to go to her,
and give her thy blessing; for I believe that through you she will be restored to health.”
Martin, troubled by such an address, was bewildered, and shrank back, saying that this was
a matter not in his own hands; that the old man was mistaken in the judgment he had
formed; and that he was not worthy to be the instrument through whom the Lord should
make a display of his power. The father, in tears, persevered in still more earnestly pressing
the case, and entreated Martin to visit the dying girl. At last, constrained by the bishops
standing by to go as requested, he went down to the home of the girl. An immense crowd
was waiting at the doors, to see what the servant of the Lord would do. And first, betaking
himself to his familiar arms in affairs of that kind, he cast himself down on the ground and
prayed. Then gazing earnestly upon the ailing girl, he requests that oil should be given him.
After he had received and blessed this, he poured the powerful sacred liquid into the mouth
of the girl, and immediately her voice returned to her. Then gradually, through contact with
him, her limbs began, one by one, to recover life, till, at last, in the presence of the people,
she arose with firm steps.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Martin casts out Several Devils.</head>
<p>At the same time the servant of one Tetradius, a man of proconsular rank, having been
laid hold of by a demon, was tormented with the most miserable results. Martin, therefore,
having been asked to lay his hands on him, ordered the servant to be brought to him; but
the evil spirit could, in no way, be brought forth from the cell in which he was: he showed
himself so fearful, with ferocious teeth, to those who attempted to draw near. Then Tetradius
throws himself at the feet of the saintly man, imploring that he himself would go down to
the house in which the possessed of the devil was kept. But Martin then declared that he
could not visit the house of an unconverted heathen. For Tetradius, at that time, was still
involved in the errors of heathenism. He, therefore, pledges his word that if the demon were
driven out of the boy, he would become a Christian. Martin, then, laying his hand upon the
boy, cast the evil spirit out of him. On seeing this, Tetradius believed in the Lord Jesus, and
immediately became a catechumen, while, not long after, he was baptized; and he always
regarded Martin with extraordinary affection, as having been the author of his salvation.
About the same time, having entered the dwelling of a certain householder in the same
town, he stopped short at the very threshold, and said, that he perceived a horrible demon
in the courtyard of the house. When Martin ordered it to depart, it laid hold of a certain
member of the family, who was staying in the inner part of the house; and the poor wretch
began at once to rage with his teeth, and to lacerate whomsoever he met. The house was
thrown into disorder; the family was in confusion; and the people present took to flight.
Martin threw himself in the way of the frenzied creature, and first of all commanded him
to stand still. But when he continued to gnash with his teeth, and, with gaping mouth, was
threatening to bite, Martin inserted his fingers into his mouth, and said, “If you possess any
power, devour these.” But then, as if red-hot iron had entered his jaws, drawing his teeth
far away he took care not to touch the fingers of the saintly man; and when he was compelled
by punishments and tortures, to flee out of the possessed body, while he had no power of
escaping by the mouth, he was cast out by means of a defluxion of the belly, leaving disgusting
traces behind him.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>Martin performs Various Miracles.</head>
<p>In the meanwhile, as a sudden report had troubled the city as to the movement and inroad
of the barbarians, Martin orders a possessed person to be set before him, and commanded
him to declare whether this message was true or not. Then he confessed that there
were sixteen demons who had spread this report among the people, in order that by the fear
thus excited, Martin might have to flee from the city, but that, in fact, nothing was less in
the minds of the barbarians than to make any inroad. When the unclean spirit thus acknowledged
these things in the midst of the church, the city was set free from the fear and tumult
which had at the time been felt.</p>
<p>At Paris, again, when Martin was entering the gate of the city, with large crowds attending
him, he gave a kiss to a leper, of miserable appearance, while all shuddered at seeing him
do so; and Martin blessed him, with the result that he was instantly cleansed from all his
misery. On the following day, the man appearing in the church with a healthy skin, gave
thanks for the soundness of body which he had recovered. This fact, too, ought not to be
passed over in silence, that threads from Martin’s garment, or such as had been plucked
from the sackcloth which he wore, wrought frequent miracles upon those who were sick.
For, by either being tied round the fingers or placed about the neck, they very often drove
away diseases from the afflicted.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>A Letter of Martin effects a Cure, with Other Miracles.</head>
<p>Further, Arborius, an ex-prefect, and a man of a very holy and faithful character, while
his daughter was in agony from the burning fever of a quartan ague, inserted in the bosom
of the girl, at the very paroxysm of the heat, a letter of Martin which happened to have been
brought to him, and immediately the fever was dispelled. This event had such an influence
upon Arborius, that he at once consecrated the girl to God, and devoted her to perpetual
virginity. Then, proceeding to Martin, he presented the girl to him, as an obvious living
example of his power of working miracles, inasmuch as she had been cured by him though
absent; and he would not suffer her to be consecrated by any other than Martin, through
his placing upon her the dress characteristic of virginity.</p>
<p>Paulinus, too, a man who was afterwards to furnish a striking example of the age, having
begun to suffer grievously in one of his eyes, and when a pretty thick skin33 having grown
over it had already covered up its pupil, Martin touched his eye with a painter’s brush, and,
all pain being removed, thus restored it to its former soundness. He himself also, when, by
a certain accident, he had fallen out of an upper room, and tumbling down a broken, uneven
stair, had received many wounds, as he lay in his cell at the point of death, and was tortured
with grievous sufferings, saw in the night an angel appear to him, who washed his wounds,
and applied healing ointment to the bruised members of his body. As the effect of this, he
found himself on the morrow restored to soundness of health, so that he was not thought
to have suffered any harm. But because it would be tedious to go through everything of this
kind, let these examples suffice, as a few out of a multitude; and let it be enough that we do
not in striking cases [of miraculous interposition] detract from the truth, while, having so
many to choose from, we avoid exciting weariness in the reader.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>How Martin acted towards the Emperor Maximus.</head>
<p>And here to insert some smaller matters among things so great (although such is the
nature of our times in which all things have fallen into decay and corruption, it is almost a
pre-eminent virtue for priestly firmness not to have yielded to royal flattery), when a number
of bishops from various parts had assembled to the Emperor Maximus, a man of fierce
character, and at that time elated with the victory he had won in the civil wars, and when
the disgraceful flattery of all around the emperor was generally remarked, while the priestly
dignity had, with degenerate submissiveness, taken a second place to the royal retinue, in
Martin alone, apostolic authority continued to assert itself. For even if he had to make suit
to the sovereign for some things, he commanded rather than entreated him; and although
often invited, he kept away from his entertainments, saying that he could not take a place
at the table of one who, out of two emperors, had deprived one of his kingdom, and the
other of his life. At last, when Maximus maintained that he had not of his own accord assumed
the sovereignty, but that he had simply defended by arms the necessary requirements34
of the empire, regard to which had been imposed upon him by the soldiers, according to
the Divine appointment, and that the favor of God did not seem wanting to him who, by
an event seemingly so incredible, had secured the victory, adding to that the statement that
none of his adversaries had been slain except in the open field of battle, at length, Martin,
overcome either by his reasoning or his entreaties, came to the royal banquet. The king was
wonderfully pleased because he had gained this point. Moreover, there were guests present
who had been invited as if to a festival; men of the highest and most illustrious rank,—the
prefect, who was also consul, named Evodius, one of the most righteous men that ever lived;
two courtiers possessed of the greatest power, the brother and uncle of the king, while
between these two, the presbyter of Martin had taken his place; but he himself occupied a
seat which was set quite close to the king. About the middle of the banquet, according to
custom, one of the servants presented a goblet to the king. He orders it rather to be given
to the very holy bishop, expecting and hoping that he should then receive the cup from his
right hand. But Martin, when he had drunk, handed the goblet to his own presbyter, as
thinking no one worthier to drink next to himself, and holding that it would not be right
for him to prefer either the king himself, or those who were next the king, to the presbyter.
And the emperor, as well as all those who were then present, admired this conduct so much,
that this very thing, by which they had been undervalued, gave them pleasure. The report
then ran through the whole palace that Martin had done, at the king’s dinner, what no
<note type="footnote">34 “Regni necessitatem”—an awkward expression.</note>

<pb n="35"/>
bishop had dared to do at the banquets of the lowest judges. And Martin predicted to the
same Maximus long before, that if he went into Italy to which he then desired to go, waging
war, against the Emperor Valentinianus, it would come to pass that he should know he
would35 indeed be victorious in the first attack, but would perish a short time afterwards.
And we have seen that this did in fact take place. For, on his first arrival Valentinianus had
to betake himself to flight but recovering his strength about a year afterwards, Maximus
was taken and slain by him within the walls of Aquileia.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Martin has to do both with Angels and Devils.</head>
<p>It is also well known that angels were very often seen by him, so that they spoke in turns
with him in set speech. As to the devil, Martin held him so visible and ever under the power
of his eyes, that whether he kept himself in his proper form, or changed himself into different
shapes of spiritual wickedness, he was perceived by Martin, under whatever guise he appeared.
The devil knew well that he could not escape discovery, and therefore frequently heaped
insults upon Martin, being unable to beguile him by trickery. On one occasion the devil,
holding in his hand the bloody horn of an ox, rushed into Martin’s cell with great noise,
and holding out to him his bloody right hand, while at the same time he exulted in the crime
he had committed, said: “Where, O Martin, is thy power? I have just slain one of your
people.” Then Martin assembled the brethren, and related to them what the devil had disclosed,
while he ordered them carefully to search the several cells in order to discover who
had been visited with this calamity. They report that no one of the monks was missing, but
that one peasant, hired by them, had gone to the forest to bring home wood in his wagon.
Upon hearing this, Martin instructs some of them to go and meet him. On their doing so,
the man was found almost dead at no great distance from the monastery. Nevertheless, although
just drawing his last breath, he made known to the brethren the cause of his wound
and death. He said that, while he was drawing tighter the thongs which had got loose on
the oxen yoked together, one of the oxen, throwing his head free, had wounded him with
his horn in the groin. And not long after the man expired. You36 see with what judgment
of the Lord this power was given to the devil. This was a marvelous feature in Martin that
not only on this occasion to which I have specially referred, but on many occasions of the
same kind, in fact as often as such things occurred, he perceived them long beforehand,
and37 disclosed the things which had been revealed to him to the brethren.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>Martin preaches Repentance even to the Devil.</head>
<p>Now, the devil, while he tried to impose upon the holy man by a thousand injurious
arts, often thrust himself upon him in a visible form, but in very various shapes. For sometimes
he presented himself to his view changed into the person of Jupiter, often into that of
Mercury and Minerva. Often, too, were heard words of reproach, in which the crowd of
demons assailed Martin with scurrilous expressions. But knowing that all were false and
groundless, he was not affected by the charges brought against him. Moreover, some of the
brethren bore witness that they had heard a demon reproaching Martin in abusive terms,
and asking why he had taken back, on their subsequent repentance, certain of the brethren
who had, some time previously, lost their baptism by falling into various errors. The demon
set forth the crimes of each of them; but they added that Martin, resisting the devil firmly,
answered him, that by-past sins are cleansed away by the leading of a better life, and that
through the mercy of God, those are to be absolved from their sins who have given up their
evil ways. The devil saying in opposition to this that such guilty men as those referred to
did not come within the pale of pardon, and that no mercy was extended by the Lord to
those who had once fallen away, Martin is said to have cried out in words to the following
effect: “If thou, thyself, wretched being, wouldst but desist from attacking mankind, and
even, at this period, when the day of judgment is at hand, wouldst only repent of your deeds,
I, with a true confidence in the Lord, would promise you the mercy of Christ.”38 O what a
holy boldness with respect to the loving-kindness of the Lord, in which, although he could
not assert authority, he nevertheless showed the feelings dwelling within him! And since
our discourse has here sprung up concerning the devil and his devices, it does not seem
away from the point, although the matter does not bear immediately upon Martin, to relate
what took place; both because the virtues of Martin do, to some extent, appear in the
transaction, and the incident, which was worthy of a miracle, will properly be put on record,
with the view of furnishing a caution, should anything of a similar character subsequently
occur.</p>
<note type="footnote">38 This is a truly noteworthy passage. It anticipates a well-known sentiment of Burns, the national bard of
Scotland. In his Address to the Deil, Burns has said that if the great enemy would only “tak a thocht an’ men’,”
he might still have a chance of safety, and this idea seems very much in accordance with the opinion of St.
Martin as expressed above. Hornius, however, is very indignant on account of it, and exclaims: “Intolerabilis
hic Martini error. Nec Sulpicius excusatione sua demit, sed auget. Origenes primus ejus erroris author.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>A Case of Diabolic Deception.</head>
<p>There was a certain man, Clarus by name, a most noble youth, who afterwards became
a presbyter, and who is now, through his happy departure from this world, numbered among
the saints. He, leaving all others, betook himself to Martin, and in a short time became distinguished
for the most exalted faith, and for all sorts of excellence. Now, it came to pass
that, when he had erected an abode for himself not far from the monastery of the bishop,
and many brethren were staying with him, a certain youth, Anatolius by name, having, under
the profession of a monk, falsely assumed every appearance of humility and innocence,
came to him, and lived for some time on the common store along with the rest. Then, as
time went on, he began to affirm that angels were in the habit of talking with him. As no
one gave any credit to his words, he urged a number of the brethren to believe by certain
signs. At length he went to such a length as to declare that angels passed between him and
God; and now he wished that he should be regarded as one of the prophets. Clarus, however,
could by no means be induced to believe. He then began to threaten Clarus with the anger
of God and present afflictions, because he did not believe one of the saints. At the last, he
is related to have burst forth with the following declaration: “Behold, the Lord will this night
give me a white robe out of heaven, clothed in which, I will dwell in the midst of you; and
that will be to you a sign that I am the Power of God, inasmuch as I have been presented
with the garment of God.” Then truly the expectation of all was highly raised by this profession.
Accordingly, about the middle of the night, it was seen, by the noise of people moving
eagerly about, that the whole monastery in the place was excited. It might be seen, too, that
the cell in which the young man referred to lived was glittering with numerous lights; and
the whisperings of those moving about in it, as well as a kind of murmur of many voices,
could be heard. Then, on silence being secured, the youth coming forth calls one of the
brethren, Sabatius by name, to himself, and shows him the robe in which he had been
clothed. He again, filled with amazement, gathers the rest together, and Clarus himself also
runs up; and a light being obtained, they all carefully inspect the garment. Now, it was of
the utmost softness, of marvelous brightness, and of glittering purple, and yet no one could
discover what was its nature, or of what sort of fleece it had been formed. However, when
it was more minutely examined by the eyes or fingers, it seemed nothing else than a garment.
In the meantime, Clarus urges upon the brethren to be earnest in prayer, that the Lord
would show them more clearly what it really was. Accordingly, the rest of the night was
spent in singing hymns and psalms. But when day broke, Clarus wished to take the young
man by the hand, and bring him to Martin, being well aware that he could not be deceived
by any arts of the devil. Then, indeed, the miserable man began to resist and refuse, and affirmed
that he had been forbidden to show himself to Martin. And when they compelled

<pb n="39"/>
him to go against his will, the garment vanished from among the hands of those who were
conducting him. Wherefore, who can doubt that this, too, was an illustration of the power
of Martin, so that the devil could no longer dissemble or conceal his own deception, when
it was to be submitted to the eyes of Martin?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>Martin is tempted by the Wiles of the Devil.</head>
<p>It was found, again, that about the same time there was a young man in Spain, who,
having by many signs obtained for himself authority among the people, was puffed up to
such a pitch that he gave himself out as being Elias. And when multitudes had too readily
believed this, he went on to say that he was actually Christ; and he succeeded so well even
in this delusion that a certain bishop named Rufus worshiped him as being the Lord. For
so doing, we have seen this bishop at a later date deprived of his office. Many of the brethren
have also informed me that at the same time one arose in the East, who boasted that he was
John. We may infer from this, since false prophets of such a kind have appeared, that the
coming of Antichrist is at hand; for he is already practicing in these persons the mystery of
iniquity. And truly I think this point should not be passed over, with what arts the devil
about this very time tempted Martin. For, on a certain day, prayer39 having been previously
offered, and the fiend himself being surrounded by a purple light, in order that he might
the more easily deceive people by the brilliance of the splendor assumed, clothed also in a
royal robe, and with a crown of precious stones and gold encircling his head, his shoes too
being inlaid with gold, while he presented a tranquil countenance, and a generally rejoicing
aspect, so that no such thought as that he was the devil might be entertained—he stood by
the side of Martin as he was praying in his cell. The saint being dazzled by his first appearance,
both preserved a long and deep silence. This was first broken by the devil, who said: “Acknowledge,
Martin, who it is that you behold. I am Christ; and being just about to descend
to earth, I wished first to manifest myself to thee.” When Martin kept silence on hearing
these words, and gave no answer whatever, the devil dared to repeat his audacious declaration:
“Martin, why do you hesitate to believe, when you see? I am Christ.” Then Martin, the
Spirit revealing the truth to him, that he might understand it was the devil, and not God,
replied as follows: “The Lord Jesus did not predict that he would come clothed in purple,
and with a glittering crown upon his head. I will not believe that Christ has come, unless he
appears with that appearance and form in which he suffered, and openly displaying the
marks of his wounds upon the cross.” On hearing these words, the devil vanished like smoke,
and filled the cell with such a disgusting smell, that he left unmistakable evidences of his
real character. This event, as I have just related, took place in the way which I have stated,
and my information regarding it was derived from the lips of Martin himself; therefore let
no one regard it as fabulous.40</p>
<note type="footnote">39 “Prece” for the usual reading “prae se.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Intercourse of Sulpitius with Martin.</head>
<p>For since I, having long heard accounts of his faith, life and virtues, burned with a desire
of knowing him, I undertook what was to me a pleasant journey for the purpose of seeing
him. At the same time, because already my mind was inflamed with the desire of writing
his life, I obtained my information partly from himself, in so far as I could venture to question
him, and partly from those who had lived with him, or well knew the facts of the case. And
at this time it is scarcely credible with what humility and with what kindness he received
me; while he cordially wished me joy, and rejoiced in the Lord that he had been held in such
high estimation by me that I had undertaken a journey owing to my desire of seeing him.
Unworthy me! (in fact, I hardly dare acknowledge it), that he should have deigned to admit
me to fellowship with him! He went so far as in person to present me with water to wash
my hands, and at eventide he himself washed my feet; nor had I sufficient courage to resist
or oppose his doing so. In fact, I felt so overcome by the authority he unconsciously exerted,
that I deemed it unlawful to do anything but acquiesce in his arrangements. His conversation
with me was all directed to such points as the following: that the allurements of this world
and secular burdens were to be abandoned in order that we might be free and unencumbered
in following the Lord Jesus; and he pressed upon me as an admirable example in present
circumstances the conduct of that distinguished man Paulinus, of whom I have made
mention above. Martin declared of him that, by parting with his great possessions and following
Christ, as he did, he showed himself almost the only one who in these times had
fully obeyed the precepts of the Gospel. He insisted strongly that that was the man who
should be made the object of our imitation, adding that the present age was fortunate in
possessing such a model of faith and virtue. For Paulinus, being rich and having many
possessions, by selling them all and giving them to the poor according to the expressed will
of the Lord, had, he said, made possible by actual proof what appeared impossible of accomplishment.
What power and dignity there were in Martin’s words and conversation! How
active he was, how practical, and how prompt and ready in solving questions connected
with Scripture! And because I know that many are incredulous on this point,—for indeed
I have met with persons who did not believe me when I related such things,—I call to witness
Jesus, and our common hope as Christians, that I never heard from any other lips than those
of Martin such exhibitions of knowledge and genius, or such specimens of good and pure
speech. But yet, how insignificant is all such praise when compared with the virtues which
he possessed! Still, it is remarkable that in a man who had no claim to be called learned,
even this attribute [of high intelligence] was not wanting.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>Words cannot describe the Excellences of Martin.</head>
<p>But now my book must be brought to an end, and my discourse finished. This is not
because all that was worthy of being said concerning Martin is now exhausted, but because
I, just as sluggish poets grow less careful towards the end of their work, give over, being
baffled by the immensity of the matter. For, although his outward deeds could in some sort
of way be set forth in words, no language, I truly own, can ever be capable of describing his
inner life and daily conduct, and his mind always bent upon the things of heaven. No one
can adequately make known his perseverance and self-mastery in abstinence and fastings,
or his power in watchings and prayers, along with the nights, as well as days, which were
spent by him, while not a moment was separated from the service of God, either for indulging
in ease, or engaging in business. But, in fact, he did not indulge either in food or sleep, except
in so far as the necessities of nature required. I freely confess that, if, as the saying is, Homer
himself were to ascend from the shades below, he could not do justice to this subject in
words; to such an extent did all excellences surpass in Martin the possibility of being embodied
in language. Never did a single hour or moment pass in which he was not either actually
engaged in prayer; or, if it happened that he was occupied with something else, still he never
let his mind loose from prayer. In truth, just as it is the custom of blacksmiths, in the midst
of their work to beat their own anvil as a sort of relief to the laborer, so Martin even when
he appeared to be doing something else, was still engaged in prayer. O truly blessed man in
whom there was no guile—judging no man, condemning no man, returning evil for evil to
no man! He displayed indeed such marvelous patience in the endurance of injuries, that
even when he was chief41 priest, he allowed himself to be wronged by the lowest clerics with
impunity; nor did he either remove them from the office on account of such conduct, or,
as far as in him lay, repel them from a place in his affection.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>Wonderful Piety of Martin.</head>
<p>No one ever saw him enraged, or excited, or lamenting, or laughing; he was always one
and the same: displaying a kind of heavenly happiness in his countenance, he seemed to
have passed the ordinary limits of human nature. Never was there any word on his lips but
Christ, and never was there a feeling in his heart except piety, peace, and tender mercy.
Frequently, too, he used to weep for the sins of those who showed themselves his revilers—
those who, as he led his retired and tranquil life, slandered him with poisoned tongue
and a viper’s mouth. And truly we have had experience of some who were envious of his
virtues and his life—who really hated in him what they did not see in themselves, and what
they had not power to imitate. And—O wickedness worthy of deepest grief and
groans!—some of his calumniators, although very few, some of his maligners, I say, were
reported to be no others than bishops! Here, however, it is not necessary to name any one,
although a good many of these people are still venting42 their spleen against myself. I shall
deem it sufficient that, if any one of them reads this account, and perceives that he is himself
pointed at, he may have the grace to blush. But if, on the other hand, he shows anger, he
will, by that very fact, own that he is among those spoken of, though all the time perhaps I
have been thinking of some other person. I shall, however, by no means feel ashamed if any
people of that sort include myself in their hatred along with such a man as Martin. I am
quite persuaded of this, that the present little work will give pleasure to all truly good men.
And I shall only say further that, if any one read this narrative in an unbelieving spirit, he
himself will fall into sin. I am conscious to myself that I have been induced by belief in the
facts, and by the love of Christ, to write these things; and that, in doing so, I have set forth
what is well known, and recorded what is true; and, as I trust, that man will have a reward
prepared by God, not who shall read these things, but who shall believe them.43</p>
<note type="footnote">42 Lit. “are barking round about.”</note>
<note type="footnote">43 It seems extremely difficult (to recur to the point once more), after reading this account of St. Martin by
Sulpitius, to form any certain conclusion regarding it. The writer so frequently and solemnly assures us of his
good faith, and there is such a verisimilitude about the style, that it appears impossible to accept the theory of
willful deception on the part of the writer. And then, he was so intimately acquainted with the subject of his
narrative, that he could hardly have accepted fictions for facts, or failed in his estimate of the friend he so much
admired and loved. Altogether, this Life of St. Martin seems to bring before us one of the puzzles of history. The
saint himself must evidently have been a very extraordinary man, to impress one of the talents and learning of
Sulpitius so remarkably as he did; but it is extremely hard to say how far the miraculous narratives, which enter
so largely into the account before us, were due to pure invention, or unconscious hallucination. Milner remarks
(Church History, II. 193), “I should be ashamed, as well as think the labor ill spent, to recite the stories at length
which Sulpitius gives us.” See, on the other side, Cardinal Newman’s Essays on Miracles, p. 127, 209, U+0026c. </note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="45"/>
<head>LETTER I. TO EUSEBIUS.</head>
<head>Against Some Envious Assailants of Martin.</head>
<p>Yesterday a number of monks having come to me, it happened that amid endless fables,
and much tiresome discourse, mention was made of the little work which I published concerning
the life of that saintly man Martin, and I was most happy to hear that it was being
eagerly and carefully read by multitudes. In the meantime, however, I was told that a certain
person, under the influence of an evil spirit, had asked why Martin, who was said to have
raised the dead and to have rescued houses from the flames, had himself recently become
subject to the power of fire, and thus been exposed to suffering of a dangerous character.
Wretched man, whoever he is, that expressed himself thus! We recognize his perfidious talk
in the words of the Jews of old, who reviled the Lord, when hanging upon the cross, in the
following terms: “He saved others; himself he cannot save.”1 Truly it is clear that, whoever
be the person referred to, if he had lived in those times, he would have been quite prepared
to speak against the Lord in these terms, inasmuch as he blasphemes a saint of the Lord,
after a like fashion. How then, I ask thee, whosoever thou art, how does the case stand? Was
Martin really not possessed of power, and not a partaker of holiness, because he became
exposed to danger from fire? O thou blessed man, and in all things like to the Apostles, even
in the reproaches which are thus heaped upon thee! Assuredly those Gentiles are reported
to have entertained the same sort of thought respecting Paul also, when the viper had bitten
him, for they said, “This man must be a murderer, whom, although saved from the sea, the
fates do not permit to live.”2 But he, shaking off the viper into the fire, suffered no harm.
They, however, imagined that he would suddenly fall down, and speedily die; but when they
saw that no harm befell him, changing their minds, they said that he was a God. But, O thou
most miserable of men, you ought, even from that example to have yourself been convinced
of your falsity; so that, if it had proved a stumbling-block to thee that Martin appeared
touched by the flame of fire, you should, on the other hand, have ascribed his being merely
touched to his merits and power, because, though surrounded by flames, he did not perish.
For acknowledge, thou miserable man, acknowledge what you seem ignorant of, that almost
all the saints have been more remarkable for3 the dangers they encountered, than even for
the virtues they displayed. I see, indeed, Peter strong in faith, walking over the waves of the
sea, in opposition to the nature of things, and that he pressed the unstable waters with his
footprints. But not on that account does the preacher of the Gentiles4 seem to me a smaller

man, whom the waves swallowed up; and, after three days5 and three nights, the water restored
him emerging from the deep. Nay, I am almost inclined to think that it was a greater
thing to have lived in the deep, than to have walked along the depths of the sea. But, thou
foolish man, you had not, as I suppose, read these things; or, having read them, had not
understood them. For the blessed Evangelist would not have recorded in holy writ an incident
of that kind—under divine guidance—(except that, from such cases, the human mind might
be instructed as to the dangers connected with shipwrecks and serpents!) and, as the Apostle
relates, who gloried in his nakedness, and hunger, and perils from robbers, all these things
are indeed to be endured in common by holy men, but that it has always been the chief excellence
of the righteous in enduring and conquering such things, while amid all their trials,
being patient and ever unconquerable, they overcame them all the more courageously, the
heavier was the burden which they had to bear. Hence this event which is ascribed to the
infirmity of Martin is, in reality, full of dignity and glory, since indeed, being tried by a most
dangerous calamity, he came forth a conqueror. But let no one wonder that the incident
referred to was omitted by me in that treatise which I wrote concerning his life, since in that
very work I openly acknowledged that I had not embraced all his acts; and that for the good
reason that, if I had been minded to narrate them all, I must have presented an enormous
volume to my readers. And indeed, his achievements were not of so limited a number that
they could all be comprehended in a book. Nevertheless, I shall not leave this incident, about
which a question has arisen, to remain in obscurity, but shall relate the whole affair as it
occurred, lest I should appear perchance to have intentionally passed over that which might
be put forward in calumniation of the saintly man.</p>
<p>Martin having, about the middle of winter, come to a certain parish,6 according to the
usual custom for the bishops to visit the churches in the diocese, the clerics had prepared
an abode for him in the private7 part of the church, and had kindled a large fire beneath the
floor which was decayed and very thin.8 They also erected for him a couch consisting of a
large amount of straw. Then, when Martin betook himself to rest, he was annoyed with the
softness of the too luxurious bed, inasmuch as he had been accustomed to lie on the bare

ground with only a piece of sackcloth stretched over him. Accordingly, influenced by the
injury which had, as it were, been done him, he threw aside the whole of the straw. Now, it
so happened that part of the straw which he had thus removed fell upon the stove. He
himself, in the meantime, rested, as was his wont, upon the bare ground, tired out by his
long journey. About midnight, the fire bursting up through the stove which, as I have said,
was far from sound, laid hold of the dry straw. Martin, being wakened out of sleep by this
unexpected occurrence, and being prevented by the pressing danger, but chiefly, as he afterwards
related, by the snares and urgency of the devil, was longer than he ought to have been
in having recourse to the aid of prayer. For, desiring to get outside, he struggled long and
laboriously with the bolt by which he had secured the door. Ere long he perceived that he
was surrounded by a fearful conflagration; and the fire had even laid hold of the garment
with which he was clothed. At length recovering his habitual conviction that his safety lay
not in flight, but in the Lord, and seizing the shield of faith and prayer, committing himself
entirely to the Lord, he lay down in the midst of the flames. Then truly, the fire having been
removed by divine interposition, he continued to pray amid a circle of flames that did him
no harm. But the monks, who were before the door, hearing the sound of the crackling and
struggling fire, broke open the barred door; and, the fire being extinguished, they brought
forth Martin from the midst of the flames, all the time supposing that he must ere then have
been burnt to ashes by a fire of so long continuance. Now, as the Lord is my witness, he
himself related to me, and not without groans, confessed that he was in this matter beguiled
by the arts of the devil; in that, when roused from sleep, he did not take the wise course of
repelling the danger by means of faith and prayer. He also added that the flames raged
around him all the time that, with a distempered mind, he strove to throw open the door.
But he declared that as soon as he again sought assistance from the cross, and tried the
weapons of prayer, the central flames gave way, and that he then felt them shedding a dewy
refreshment over him, after having just experienced how cruelly they burned him. Considering
all which, let every one who reads this letter understand that Martin was indeed tried
by that danger, but passed through it with true acceptance.9</p>

<head>LETTER II. TO THE DEACON AURELIUS.</head>
<head>Sulpitius has a Vision of St. Martin.</head>
<p>Sulpitius Severus to Aurelius the Deacon sendeth greeting,—10</p>
<p>After you had departed from me in the morning, I was sitting alone in my cell; and there
occurred to me, as often happens, that hope of the future which I cherish, along with a
weariness of the present world, a terror of judgment, a fear of punishment, and, as a consequence,
indeed as the source from which the whole train of thought had flowed, a remembrance
of my sins, which had rendered me worn and miserable. Then, after I had placed on
my couch my limbs fatigued with the anguish of my mind, sleep crept upon me, as frequently
happens from melancholy; and such sleep, as it is always somewhat light and uncertain in
the morning hours, so it pervaded my members only in a hovering and doubtful manner.
Thus it happens, what does not occur in a different kind of slumber, that one can feel he is
dreaming while almost awake. In these circumstances, I seemed suddenly to see St. Martin
appear to me in the character of a bishop, clothed in a white robe, with a countenance as of
fire, with eyes like stars, and with purple hair.11 He thus appeared to me with that aspect
and form of body which I had known, so that I find it almost difficult to say what I mean—he
could not be steadfastly beheld, though he could be clearly recognized. Well, directing a
gentle smile towards me, he held out in his right hand the small treatise which I had written
concerning his life. I, for my part, embraced his sacred knees, and begged for his blessing
according to custom. Upon this, I felt his hand placed on my head with the sweetest touch,
while, amid the solemn words of benediction, he repeated again and again the name of the
cross so familiar to his lips. Ere long, while my eyes were earnestly fixed upon him, and
when I could not satisfy myself with gazing upon his countenance, he was suddenly taken
away from me and raised on high. At last, having passed through the vast expanse of the
air, while my straining eyes followed him ascending in a rapidly moving cloud, he could no
longer be seen by me gazing after him. And not long after, I saw the holy presbyter Clarus,
a disciple of Martin’s who had lately died, ascend in the same way as I had seen his master.
I, impudently desiring to follow, while I aim at and strive after such lofty steps, suddenly
wake up; and, being roused from sleep, I had begun to rejoice over the vision, when a boy,
a servant in the family, enters to me with a countenance sadder than is usual with one who
gives utterance to his grief in words. “What,” I enquire of him, “do you wish to tell me with
so melancholy an aspect?” “Two monks,” he replied, “have just been here from Tours, and
they have brought word that Martin is dead.” I confess that I was cut to the heart; and
bursting into tears, I wept most abundantly. Nay, even now, as I write these things to you,
<note type="footnote">10 This salutation is omitted by Halm.</note>
<note type="footnote">11 “crine purpureo”: it is impossible to tell the exact color which is intended.</note>

<pb n="49"/>
brother, my tears are flowing, and I find no consolation for my all but unbearable sorrow.
And I should wish you, when this news reaches you, to be a partaker in my grief, as you
were a sharer with me in his love. Come then, I beg of you, to me without delay, that we
may mourn in common him whom in common we love. And yet I am well aware that such
a man ought not to be mourned over, to whom, after his victory and triumph over the world,
there has now at last been given the crown of righteousness. Nevertheless, I cannot so
command myself as to keep from grieving. I have, no doubt, sent on before me one who
will plead my cause in heaven, but I have, at the same time, lost my great source of consolation
in this present life; yet if grief would yield to the influence of reason, I certainly ought to
rejoice. For he is now mingling among the Apostles and Prophets, and (with all respect for
the saints on high be it said) he is second to no one in that assembly of the righteous as I
firmly hope, believe, and trust, being joined especially to those who washed their robes in
the blood of the12 Lamb. He now follows the Lamb as his guide, free from all spot of defilement.
For although the character13 of our times could not ensure him the honor of martyrdom,
yet he will not remain destitute of the glory of a martyr, because both by vow and
virtues he was alike able and willing to be a martyr. But if he had been permitted, in the
times of Nero and of Decius,14 to take part in the struggle which then went on, I take to
witness the God of heaven and earth that he would freely have submitted15 to the rack of
torture, and readily surrendered himself to the flames: yea, worthy of being compared to
the illustrious Hebrew youths, amid the circling flames, and though in the very midst of the
furnace, he would have sung a hymn of the Lord. But if perchance it had pleased the persecutor
to inflict upon him the punishment which Isaiah endured, he would never have shown
himself inferior to the prophet, nor would have shrunk from having his members torn in
pieces by saws and swords. And if impious fury had preferred to drive the blessed man over
precipitous rocks or steep mountains, I maintain that, clinging16 to the testimony of truth
he would willingly have fallen. But if, after the example of the teacher of the Gentiles,17 as
indeed often happened, he had been included among other victims who were condemned18
to die by the sword, he would have been foremost to urge on the executioner to his work
that he might obtain the crown19 of blood. And, in truth, far from shrinking from a confes-

too much for human infirmity, he would have stood so immovable as to have smiled with
joy and gladness over the sufferings and torments he endured, whatever might have been
the tortures inflicted upon him. But although he did in fact suffer none of these things, yet
he fully attained to the honor of martyrdom without shedding his blood. For what agonies
of human sufferings did he not endure in behalf of the hope of eternal life, in hunger, in
watchings, in nakedness, in fastings, in reproachings of the malignant, in persecutions of
the wicked, in care for the weak, in anxiety for those in danger? For who ever suffered but
Martin suffered along with him? Who was made to stumble and he burnt not? Who perished,
and he did not mourn deeply? Besides those daily struggles which he carried on against the
various conflicts with human and spiritual wickedness, while invariably, as he was assailed
with divers temptations, there prevailed in his case fortitude in conquering, patience in
waiting, and placidity in enduring. O man, truly indescribable in piety, mercy, love, which
daily grows cold even in holy men through the coldness of the world, but which in his case
increased onwards to the end, and endured from day to day! I, for my part, had the happiness
of enjoying this grace in him even in an eminent degree, for he loved me in a special manner,
though I was far from meriting such affection. And, on the remembrance, yet again my tears
burst forth, while groans issue from the bottom of my heart. In what man shall I for the future
find such repose for my spirit as I did in him? and in whose love shall I enjoy like consolation?
Wretched being that I am, sunk in affliction, can I ever, if life be spared me, cease to lament
that I have survived Martin? Shall there in future be to me any pleasure in life, or any day
or hour free from tears; or can I ever, my dearest brother, make mention of him to you
without lamentation? And yet, in conversing with you, can I ever talk of any other subject
than him? But why do I stir you up to tears and lamentations? So I now desire you to be
comforted, although I am unable to console myself. He will not be absent from us; believe
me, he will never, never forsake us, but will be present with us as we discourse regarding
him, and will be near to us as we pray; and the happiness which he has even to-day deigned
to bestow, even that of seeing him in his glory, he will frequently in future afford; and he
will protect us, as he did but a little while ago, with his unceasing benediction. Then again,
according to the arrangement of the vision, he showed that heaven was open to those following
him, and taught us to what we ought to follow him; he instructed us to what objects our
hope should be directed, and to what attainment our mind should be turned. Yet, my
brother, what is to be done? For, as I am myself well aware, I shall never be able to climb
that difficult ascent, and penetrate into those blessed regions. To such a degree does a
miserable burden press me down; and while I cannot, through the load of sin which overwhelms
me, secure an ascent to heaven, the cruel pressure rather sinks me in my misery to
the place of despair.20 Nevertheless, hope remains, one last and solitary hope, that, what I
<note type="footnote">20 “in tartara.”</note>

<pb n="51"/>
cannot obtain of myself, I may, at any rate, be thought worthy of, through the prayers of
Martin in my behalf. But why, brother, should I longer occupy your time with a letter which
has turned out so garrulous, and thus delay you from coming to me? At the same time, my
page being now filled, can admit no more. This, however, was my object in prolonging my
discourse to a somewhat undue extent, that, since this letter conveys to you a message of
sorrow, it might also furnish you with consolation, through my sort of friendly conversation
with you.</p>

<head>LETTER III. TO BASSULA, HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW.</head>
<head>How St. Martin passed from this Life to Life Eternal.</head>
<p>Sulpitius Severus to Bassula, his venerable parent, sendeth greeting.</p>
<p>If it were lawful that parents should be summoned to court by their children, clearly I
might drag you with a righteous thong21 before the tribunal of the prætor, on a charge of
robbery and plunder. For why should I not complain of the injury which I have suffered at
your hands? You have left me no little bit of writing at home, no book, not even a letter—to
such a degree do you play the thief with all such things and publish them to the world. If I
write anything in familiar style to a friend; if, as I amuse myself I dictate anything with the
wish at the same time that it should be kept private, all such things seem to reach you almost
before they have been written or spoken. Surely you have my secretaries22 in your23 debt,
since through them any trifles I compose are made known to you. And yet I cannot be
moved with anger against them if they really obey you, and have invaded my rights under
the special influence of your generosity to them, and ever bear in mind that they belong to
you rather than to me. Yes, thou alone art the culprit—thou alone art to blame—inasmuch
as you both lay your snares for me, and cajole them with your trickery, so that without
making any24 selection, pieces written familiarly, or let out of hand without care, are sent
to thee quite unelaborated and unpolished. For, to say nothing about other writings, I beg
to ask how that letter could reach you so speedily, which I recently wrote to Aurelius the
Deacon. For, as I was situated at Toulouse,25 while you were dwelling at Treves, and were
so far distant from your native land, owing to the anxiety felt on account of your son, what
opportunity, I should like to know, did you avail yourself of, to get hold of that familiar26
epistle? For I have received your letter in which you write that I ought in the same epistle
in which I made mention of the death of our master, Martin, to have described the manner
in which that saintly man left this world. As if, indeed, I had either given forth that epistle
with the view of its being read by any other except him to whom it purported to be sent; or
as if I were fated to undertake so great a work as that all things which should be known respecting
Martin are to be made public through me particularly as the writer. Therefore, if

you desire to learn anything concerning the end of the saintly bishop, you should direct
your enquiries rather to those who were present when his death occurred. I for my part have
resolved to write nothing to you lest you publish me27 everywhere. Nevertheless if you
pledge your word that you will read to no one what I send you, I shall satisfy your desire in
a few words. Accordingly I shall communicate28 to you the following particulars which are
comprised within my own knowledge.</p>
<p>I have to state, then, that Martin was aware of the period of his own death long before
it occurred, and told the brethren that his departure from the body was at hand. In the
meantime, a reason sprang up which led him to visit the church at Condate.29 For, as the
clerics of that church were at variance among themselves, Martin, wishing to restore peace,
although he well knew that the end of his own days was at hand, yet he did not shrink from
undertaking the journey, with such an object in view. He did, in fact, think that this would
be an excellent crown to set upon his virtues, if he should leave behind him peace restored
to a church. Thus, then, having set out with that very numerous and holy crowd of disciples
who usually accompanied him, he perceives in a river a number of water-fowl busy in capturing
fishes, and notices that a voracious appetite was urging them on to frequent seizures
of their prey. “This,” exclaimed he, “is a picture of how the demons act: they lie in wait for
the unwary and capture them before they know it: they devour their victims when taken,
and they can never be satisfied with what they have devoured.” Then Martin, with a miraculous30
power in his words, commands the birds to leave the pool in which they were
swimming, and to betake themselves to dry and desert regions; using with respect to those
birds that very same authority with which he had been accustomed to put demons to flight.
Accordingly, gathering themselves together, all those birds formed a single body, and leaving
the river, they made for the mountains and woods, to no small wonder of many who perceived
such power in Martin that he could even rule the birds. Having then delayed some time in
that village or church to which he had gone, and peace having been restored among the
clerics, when he was now meditating a return to his monastery, he began suddenly to fail
in bodily strength, and, assembling the brethren, he told them that he was on the point of
dissolution. Then indeed, sorrow and grief took possession of all, and there was but one
<note type="footnote">27 There is clearly some affectation in the horror which Sulpitius expresses in this and other passages at the
thought of his writings being published. It is obvious that he derived gratification from the fact of their being
widely read.</note>
<note type="footnote">28 “præstabo his participem”: the construction is peculiar, but the meaning is obvious.</note>
<note type="footnote">29 There were several towns of this name in Gaul. The one probably here referred to was on the road from
Augustodunum (Autun) to Paris. It corresponds to the modern Cosne, at the junction of the stream Nonain
with the river Loire.</note>

voice of them lamenting, and saying: “Why, dear father, will you leave us? Or to whom can
you commit us in our desolation? Fierce wolves will speedily attack thy flock, and who,
when the shepherd has been smitten, will save us31 from their bites? We know, indeed, that
you desire to be with Christ; but thy reward above is safe, and will not be diminished by
being delayed; rather have pity upon us, whom you are leaving desolate.” Then Martin, affected
by these lamentations, as he was always, in truth, full32 of compassion, is said to have
burst into tears; and, turning to the Lord, he replied to those weeping round him only in
the following words, “O Lord, if I am still necessary to thy people, I do not shrink from toil:
thy will be done.” Thus hovering as he did between33 desire and love, he almost doubted
which he preferred; for he neither wished to leave us, nor to be longer separated from Christ.
However, he placed no weight upon his own wishes, nor reserved anything to his own will,
but committed himself wholly to the will and power of the Lord. Do you not think you hear
him speaking in the following few words which I repeat? “Terrible, indeed, Lord, is the
struggle of bodily warfare, and surely it is now enough that I have continued the fight till
now; but, if thou dost command me still to persevere in the same toil for the defense34 of
thy flock, I do not refuse, nor do I plead against such an appointment my declining years.
Wholly given to thee, I will fulfill whatever duties thou dost assign me, and I will serve under
thy standard as long as thou shalt prescribe. Yea, although release is sweet to an old man
after lengthened toil, yet my mind is a conqueror over my years, and I have no desire35 to
yield to old age. But if now thou art merciful to my many years, good, O Lord, is thy will to
me; and thou thyself wilt guard over those for whose safety I fear.” O man, whom no language
can describe, unconquered by toil, and unconquerable even by death, who didst show no
personal preference for either alternative, and who didst neither fear to die nor refuse to
live! Accordingly, though he was for some days under the influence of a strong fever, he
nevertheless did not abandon the work of God. Continuing in supplications and watchings
through whole nights, he compelled his worn-out limbs to do service to his spirit as he lay
on his glorious36 couch upon sackcloth and ashes. And when his disciples begged of him
that at least he should allow some common straw to be placed beneath him, he replied: “It
is not fitting that a Christian should die except among ashes; and I have sinned if I leave
you a different example.” However, with his hands and eyes steadfastly directed towards
<note type="footnote">31 A singular and obviously corrupt reading is “quis eos a morsibus nostris prohibebit?” Halm’s reading has

heaven, he never released his unconquerable spirit from prayer. And on being asked by the
presbyters who had then gathered round him, to relieve his body a little by a change of side,
he exclaimed: “Allow me, dear brother, to fix my looks rather on heaven than on earth, so
that my spirit which is just about to depart on its own journey may be directed towards the
Lord.” Having spoken these words, he saw the devil standing close at hand, and exclaimed:
“Why do you stand here, thou bloody monster? Thou shalt find nothing in me, thou deadly
one: Abraham’s bosom is about to receive me.”</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, his spirit fled; and those who were there present have testified
to us that they saw his face as if it had been the face37 of an angel. His limbs too appeared
white as snow, so that people exclaimed, “Who would ever believe that man to be clothed
in sackcloth, or who would imagine that he was enveloped with ashes?” For even then he
presented such an appearance, as if he had been manifested in the glory of the future resurrection,
and with the nature of a body which had been changed. But it is hardly credible
what a multitude of human beings assembled at the performance of his funeral rites: the
whole city poured forth to meet his body; all the inhabitants of the district and villages,
along with many also from the neighboring cities, attended. O how great was the grief of
all! how deep the lamentations in particular of the sorrowing monks! They are said to have
assembled on that day almost to the number of two thousand,—a special glory of Martin,—
through his example so numerous plants had sprung up for the service of the Lord.
Undoubtedly the shepherd was then driving his own flocks before him—the pale crowds of
that saintly multitude—bands arrayed in cloaks, either old men whose life-labor was finished,
or young soldiers who had just taken the oath of allegiance to Christ. Then, too, there was
the choir of virgins, abstaining out of modesty from weeping; and with what holy joy did
they conceal the fact of their affliction! No doubt faith would prevent the shedding of tears,
yet affection forced out groans. For there was as sacred an exultation over the glory to which
he had attained, as there was a pious sorrow on account of his death. One would have been
inclined to pardon those who wept, as well as to congratulate those who rejoiced, while each
single person preferred that he himself should grieve, but that another should rejoice. Thus
then this multitude, singing hymns of heaven, attended the body of the sainted man onwards
to the place of sepulture. Let there be compared with this spectacle, I will not say the worldly38
pomp of a funeral, but even of a triumph; and what can be reckoned similar to the obsequies
of Martin? Let your worldly great men lead before their chariots captives with their hands
bound behind their backs. Those accompanied the body of Martin who, under his guidance,
had overcome the world. Let madness honor these earthly warriors with the united praises
of nations. Martin is praised with the divine psalms, Martin is honored in heavenly hymns.

Those worldly men, after their triumphs here are over, shall be thrust into cruel Tartarus,
while Martin is joyfully received into the bosom of Abraham. Martin, poor and insignificant
on earth, has a rich entrance granted him into heaven. From that blessed region, as I trust,
he looks upon me, as my guardian, while I am writing these things, and upon you while you
read them.39</p>

<head>DIALOGUE I.
CONCERNING THE VIRTUES OF THE MONKS OF THE EAST.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="59"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>When I and a Gallic friend had assembled in one place, this Gaul being a man very dear
to me, both on account of his remembrance of Martin (for he had been one of his disciples),
and on account of his own merits, my friend Postumianus joined us. He had just, on my
account, returned from the East, to which, leaving his native country, he had gone three
years before. Having embraced this most affectionate friend, and kissed both his knees and
his feet, we were for a moment or two, as it were, astounded; and, shedding mutual tears of
joy, we walked about a good deal. But by and by we sat down on our garments of sackcloth
laid upon the ground. Then Postumianus, directing his looks towards me is the first to speak,
and says,—</p>
<p>“When I was in the remote parts of Egypt, I felt a desire to go on as far as the sea. I there
met with a merchant vessel, which was ready to set sail with the view of making for Narbonne.
40 The same night you seemed in a dream to stand beside me, and laying hold of me
with your hand, to lead me away that I should go on board that ship. Ere long, when the
dawn dispersed the darkness, and when I rose up in the place in which I had been resting,
as I revolved my dream in my mind, I was suddenly seized with such a longing after you,
that without delay I went on board the ship. Landing on the thirtieth day at Marseilles, I
came on from that and arrived here on the tenth day—so prosperous a voyage was granted
to my dutiful desire of seeing you. Do thou only, for whose sake I have sailed over so many
seas, and have traversed such an extent of land, yield yourself over to me to be embraced
and enjoyed apart from all others.”</p>
<p>“I truly,” said I, “while you were still staying in Egypt, was ever holding fellowship with
you in my mind and thoughts, and affection for you had full possession of me as I meditated
upon you day and night. Surely then, you cannot imagine that I will now fail for a single
moment to gaze with delight upon you, as I hang upon your lips. I will listen to you, I will
converse with you, while no one at all is admitted to our retirement, which this remote cell
of mine furnishes to us. For, as I suppose, you will not take amiss the presence of this friend
of ours, the Gaul, who, as you perceive, rejoices with his whole heart over this arrival of
yours, even as I do myself.”</p>
<p>“Quite right,” said Postumianus, “that Gaul will certainly be retained in our company;
who, although I am but little acquainted with him, yet for this very reason that he is greatly
beloved by you, cannot fail also to be dear to me. This must especially be the case, since he
is of the school of Martin; nor will I grudge, as you desire, to talk with you in connected
discourse, since I came hither for this very purpose, that I should, even at the risk of being
tedious, respond to the desire of my dear Sulpitius ”—and in so speaking he affectionately
took hold of me with both his hands.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>“Truly” said I, “you have clearly proved how much a sincere love can accomplish, inasmuch
as, for my sake, you have traveled over so many seas, and such an extent of land,
journeying, so to speak, from the rising of the sun in the East to where he sets in the West.
Come, then, because we are here in a retired spot by ourselves, and not being otherwise
occupied, feel it our duty to attend to your discourse, come, I pray thee, relate to us the
whole history of your wanderings. Tell us, if you please, how the faith of Christ is flourishing
in the East; what peace the saints enjoy; what are the customs of the monks; and with what
signs and miracles Christ is working in his servants. For assuredly, because in this region
of ours and amid the circumstances in which we are placed, life itself has become a weariness
to us, we shall gladly hear from you, if life is permitted to Christians even in the desert.”</p>
<p>In reply to these words, Postumianus declares, “I shall do as I see you desire. But I beg
you first to tell me, whether all those persons whom I left here as priests, continue the same
as I knew them before taking my departure.”</p>
<p>Then I exclaim, “Forbear, I beseech thee, to make any enquiry on such points, which
you either, I think, know as well as I do, or if you are ignorant of them, it is better that you
should hear nothing regarding them. I cannot, however, help saying, that not only are those,
of whom you enquire, no better than they were when you knew them, but even that one
man, who was formerly a great friend of mine, and in whose affection I was wont to find
some consolation from the persecutions of the rest, has shown himself more unkind towards
me than he ought to have been. However, I shall not say anything harsher regarding him,
both because I once esteemed him as a friend, and loved him even when he was deemed my
enemy. I shall only add that while I was silently meditating on these things in my thoughts,
this source of grief deeply afflicted me, that I had almost lost the friendship of one who was
both a wise and a religious man. But let us turn away from these topics which are full of
sorrow, and let us rather listen to you, according to the promise which you gave some time
ago.”</p>
<p>“Let it be so,” exclaimed Postumianus. And on his saying this, we all kept silence, while,
moving his robe of sackcloth, on which he had sat down, a little nearer me, he thus began.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>“Three years ago, Sulpitius, at which time, leaving this neighborhood, I bade thee farewell,
after setting sail from Narbonne, on the fifth day we entered a port of Africa: so prosperous,
by the will of God, had been the voyage. I had in my mind a great desire to go to Carthage,
to visit those localities connected with the saints, and, above all, to worship at the tomb41
of the martyr Cyprian. On the fifth day we returned to the harbor, and launched forth into
the deep. Our destination was Alexandria; but as the south wind was against us, we were
almost driven upon the Syrtis;42 the cautious sailors, however, guarding against this, stopped
the ship by casting anchor. The continent of Africa then lay before our eyes; and, landing
on it in boats, when we perceived that the whole country round was destitute of human
cultivation, I penetrated farther inland, for the purpose of more carefully exploring the
locality. About three miles from the sea-coast, I beheld a small hut in the midst of the sand,
the roof of which, to use the expression43 of Sallust, was like the keel of a ship. It was close
to44 the earth, and was floored with good strong boards, not because any very heavy rains
are there feared (for, in fact, such a thing as rain has there never even been heard of), but
because, such is the strength of the winds in that district, that, if at any time only a little
breath of air begins there to be felt, even when the weather is pretty mild, a greater wreckage
takes place in those lands than on any sea. No plants are there, and no seeds ever spring up,
since, in such shifting soil, the dry sand is swept along with every motion of the winds. But
where some promontories, back from the sea, act as a check to the winds, the soil, being
somewhat more firm, produces here and there some prickly grass, and that furnishes fair
pasturage for sheep. The inhabitants live on milk, while those of them that are more skillful,
or, so to speak, more wealthy, make use of barley bread. That is the only kind of grain which
flourishes there, for barley, by the quickness of its growth in that sort of soil, generally escapes
the destruction caused by the fierce winds. So rapid is its growth that we are told it is ripe
on the thirtieth day after the sowing of the seed. But there is no reason why men should
settle there, except that all are free from the payment of taxes. The sea-coast of the Cyrenians
<note type="footnote">41 “Ad sepulchrum Cypriani martyris adorare.”</note>
<note type="footnote">42 This was probably the Syrtis Minor, a dangerous sandbank in the sea on the northern coast of Africa; it is
now known as the Gulf of Cabes. The Syrtis Major lay farther to the east, and now bears the name of the Gulf

is indeed the most remote, bordering upon that desert which lies between Egypt and Africa,45
and through which Cato formerly, when fleeing from Cæsar, led an army.46</p>

<p>I therefore bent my steps toward the hut which I had beheld from a distance. There I
find an old man, in a garment made of skins, turning a mill with his hand. He saluted and
received us kindly. We explain to him that we had been forced to land on that coast, and
were prevented by the continued raging of the sea47 from being able at once to pursue our
voyage; that, having made our way on shore, we had desired, as is in keeping with ordinary
human nature, to become acquainted with the character of the locality, and the manners of
the inhabitants. We added that we were Christians, and that the principal object of our enquiry
was whether there were any Christians amid these solitudes. Then, indeed, he, weeping
for joy, throws himself at our feet; and, kissing us over and over again, invites us to prayer,
while, spreading on the ground the skins of sheep, he makes us sit down upon them. He
then serves up a breakfast truly luxurious,48 consisting of the half of a barley cake. Now, we
were four, while he himself constituted the fifth. He also brought in a bundle of herbs, of
which I forget the name, but they were like mint, were rich in leaves, and yielded a taste like
honey. We were delighted with the exceedingly sweet taste of this plant, and our hunger
was fully satisfied.”</p>
<p>Upon this I smiled, and said to my friend the Gaul, “What, Gaul, do you think of this?
Are you pleased with a bundle of herbs and half a barley cake as a breakfast for five men?”</p>
<p>Then he, being an exceedingly modest person, and blushing somewhat, while he takes
my49 joke in good part, says, “You act, Sulpitius, in a way like yourself, for you never miss
any opportunity which is offered you of joking us on the subject of our fondness for eating.
But it is unkind of you to try to force us Gauls to live after the fashion of angels; and yet,
through my own liking for eating, I could believe that even the angels are in the habit of
eating; for such is my appetite that I would be afraid even singly to attack that half barley
cake. However, let that man of Cyrene be satisfied with it, to whom it is either a matter of
necessity or nature always to feel hungry; or, again, let those be content with it from whom,
I suppose, their tossing at sea had taken away all desire for food. We, on the other hand, are
at a distance from the sea; and, as I have often testified to you, we are, in one word, Gauls.
But instead of wasting time over such matters, let our friend here rather go on to complete
his account of the Cyrenian.”</p>
<note type="footnote">47 “maris mollitie.”</note>

<p>“Assuredly,” continues Postumianus, “I shall take care in future not to mention the abstinence
of any one, in case the difficult example should quite offend our friends the Gauls.
I had intended, however, to give an account also of the dinner of that man of Cyrene—for
we were seven days with him—or some of the subsequent feasts; but these things had better
be passed over, lest the Gaul should think that he was jeered at. However, on the following
day, when some of the natives had come together to visit us, we discovered that that host
of ours was a Presbyter—a fact which he had concealed from us with the greatest care. We
then went with him to the church, which was about two miles distant, and was concealed
from our view by an intervening mountain. We found that it was constructed of common
and worthless trees, and was not much more imposing than the hut of our host, in which
one could not stand without stooping. On enquiring into the customs of the men of the
district, we found that they were not in the habit of either buying or selling anything. They
knew not the meaning of either fraud or theft. As to gold and silver, which mankind generally
deem the most desirable of all things, they neither possess them, nor do they desire to possess
them. For when I offered that Presbyter ten gold coins, he refused them, declaring, with
profound wisdom, that the church was not benefited but rather50 injured by gold. We​presented him, however, with some pieces of clothing.</p>

<p>“After he had kindly accepted our gifts, on the sailors calling us back to the sea, we departed;
and after a favorable passage, we arrived at Alexandria on the seventh day. There
we found a disgraceful strife raging between the bishops and monks, the cause or occasion
of which was that the priests were known when assembled together often to have passed
decrees in crowded synods to the effect that no one should read or possess the books of
Origen. He was, no doubt, regarded as a most able disputant on the sacred Scriptures. But
the bishops maintained that there were certain things in his books of an unsound character;
and his supporters, not being bold enough to defend these, rather took the line of declaring
that they had been inserted by the heretics. They affirmed, therefore, that the other portions
of his writings were not to be condemned on account of those things which justly fell under
censure, since the faith of readers could easily make a distinction, so that they should not
follow what had been forged, and yet should keep hold of those points which were handled
in accordance with the Catholic faith. They remarked that there was nothing wonderful if,
in modern and recent writings, heretical guile had been at work; since it had not feared in
certain places to attack even Gospel truth. The bishops, struggling against these positions
to the utmost extent of their power, insisted that what was quite correct in the writings of
Origen should, along with the author himself, and even his whole works, be condemned,
because those books were more than sufficient which the church had received. They also
said that the reading was to be avoided of such works as would do more harm to the unwise
than they would benefit the wise. For my part, on being led by curiosity to investigate some
portions of these writings, I found very many things which pleased me, but some that were
to be blamed. I think it is clear that the author himself really entertained these impious
opinions, though his defenders maintain that the passages have been forged. I truly wonder
that one and the same man could have been so different from himself as that, in the portion
which is approved, he has no equal since the times of the Apostles, while in that which is
justly condemned, no one can be shown to have erred more egregiously.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>For while many things in his books which were extracted from them by the bishops
were read to show that they were written in opposition to the Catholic faith, that passage
especially excited bad feeling against him, in which we read in his published works that the
Lord Jesus, as he had come in the flesh for the redemption of mankind, and suffering upon
the cross for the salvation of man, had tasted death to procure eternal life for the human
race, so he was, by the same course of suffering, even to render the devil a partaker of redemption.
He maintained this on the ground that such a thing would be in harmony with
his goodness and beneficence, inasmuch as he who had restored fallen and ruined man,
would thus also set free an angel who had previously fallen. When these and other things
of a like nature were brought forward by the bishops, a tumult arose owing to the zeal of
the different parties; and when this could not be quelled by the authority of the priests, the
governor of the city was called upon to regulate the discipline of the church by a perverse
precedent; and through the terror which he inspired, the brethren were dispersed, while the
monks took to flight in different directions; so that, on the decrees being published, they
were not permitted to find lasting acceptance51 in any place. This fact influenced me greatly,
that Hieronymus, a man truly Catholic and most skillful in the holy law, was thought at first
to have been a follower of Origen, yet now, above most others, went the length of condemning
the whole of his writings. Assuredly, I am not inclined to judge rashly in regard to any one;
but even the most learned men were said to hold different opinions in this controversy.
However, whether that opinion of Origen was simply an error, as I think, or whether it was
a heresy, as is generally supposed, it not only could not be suppressed by multitudes of
censures on the part of the priests, but it never could have spread itself so far and wide, had
it not gathered strength from their contentions. Accordingly, when I came to Alexandria,
I found that city in a ferment from disturbances connected with the matter in question. The
Bishop, indeed, of that place received me very kindly, and in a better spirit than I expected,
and even endeavored to retain me with him. But I was not at all inclined to settle there,
where a recent outbreak of ill-will had resulted in a destruction of the brethren. For, although
perhaps it may seem that they ought to have obeyed the bishops, yet such a multitude of
persons, all living in an open confession of Christ, ought not for that reason to have been
persecuted, especially by bishops.</p>

<p>Accordingly, setting out from that place, I made for the town of Bethlehem, which is
six miles distant from Jerusalem, but requires sixteen stoppages52 on the part of one journeying
from Alexandria. The presbyter Jerome53 rules the church of this place; for it is a
parish of the bishop who has possession of Jerusalem. Having already in my former journey
become acquainted with Hieronymus, he had easily brought it about that I with good reason
deemed no one more worthy of my regard and love. For, besides the merit due to him on
account of his Faith, and the possession of many virtues, he is a man learned not only in
Latin and Greek, but also Hebrew, to such a degree that no one dare venture to compare
himself with him in all knowledge. I shall indeed be surprised if he is not well known to you
also through means of the works which he has written, since he is, in fact, read the whole
world over.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says the Gaul at this point, “he is, in truth, but too well known to us. For, some
five years ago, I read a certain book of his, in which the whole tribe of our monks is most
vehemently assaulted and reviled by him. For this reason, our Belgian friend is accustomed
to be very angry, because he has said that we are in the habit of cramming ourselves even
to repletion. But I, for my part, pardon the eminent man; and am of opinion that he had
made the remark rather about Eastern than Western monks. For the love of eating is gluttony
in the case of the Greeks, whereas among the Gauls it is owing to the nature they possess.”</p>
<p>Then exclaimed I, “You defend your nation, my Gallic friend, by means of rhetoric; but
I beg to ask whether that book condemns only this vice in the case of the monks?”</p>
<p>“No indeed,” replies he; “the writer passed nothing over, which he did not blame, scourge,
and expose: in particular, he inveighed against avarice and no less against arrogance. He
discoursed much respecting pride, and not a little about superstition; and I will freely own
that he seemed to me to draw a true picture of the vices of multitudes.”</p>

<p>“But as to familiarities which take place between virgins and monks, or even clerics,
how true and how courageous were his words! And, on account of these, he is said not to
stand high in favor with certain people whom I am unwilling to name. For, as our Belgian
friend is angry that we were accused of too great fondness for eating, so those people, again,
are said to express their rage when they find it written in that little work,—‘The virgin despises
her true unmarried brother, and seeks a stranger.’”</p>
<p>Upon this I exclaim, “You are going too far, my Gallic friend: take heed lest some one
who perhaps owns to these things, hear what you are saying, and begin to hold you, along
with Hieronymus, in no great affection. For, since you are a learned54 man, not unreasonably
will I admonish you in the verse of that comic poet who says,—‘Submission procures friends,
while truth gives rise to hatred.’ Let rather, Postumianus, your discourse to us about the
East, so well begun, now be resumed.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says he, “as I had commenced to relate, I stayed with Hieronymus six months,
who carried on an unceasing warfare against the wicked, and a perpetual struggle in opposition
to the deadly hatred of ungodly men. The heretics hate him, because he never desists
from attacking them; the clerics hate him, because he assails their life and crimes. But beyond
doubt, all the good admire and love him; for those people are out of their senses, who suppose
that he is a heretic. Let me tell the truth on this point, which is that the knowledge of the
man is Catholic, and that his doctrine is sound. He is always occupied in reading, always at
his books with his whole heart: he takes no rest day or night; he is perpetually either reading
or writing something. In fact, had I not been resolved in mind, and had promised to God
first to visit55 the desert previously referred to, I should have grudged to depart even for the
shortest time from so great a man. Handing over, then, and entrusting to him all my possessions
and my whole family, which having followed me against my own inclination, kept me
in a state of embarrassment, and thus being in a sort of way delivered from a heavy burden,
and restored to freedom of action, I returned to Alexandria, and having visited the brethren
there I set out from the place for upper Thebais, that is for the farthest off confines of Egypt.
For a great multitude of monks were said to inhabit the widely extending solitudes of that
wilderness. But here it would be tedious, were I to seek to narrate all the things which I
witnessed: I shall only touch lightly on a few points.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>“Not far from the desert, and close to the Nile, there are numerous monasteries. For
the most part, the monks there dwell together in companies of a hundred; and their highest
rule is to live under the orders of their Abbot, to do nothing by their own inclination, but
to depend in all things on his will and authority. If it so happens that any of them form in
their minds a lofty ideal of virtue, so as to wish to betake themselves to the desert to live a
solitary life, they do not venture to act on this desire except with the permission of the Abbot.
In fact, this is the first of virtues in their estimation,—to live in obedience to the will of another.
To those who betake themselves to the desert, bread or some other kind of food is
furnished by the command of that Abbot. Now, it so happened that, in those days during
which I had come thither, the Abbot had sent bread to a certain person who had withdrawn
to the desert, and had erected a tent for himself not more than six miles from the monastery.
This bread was sent by the hands of two boys, the elder of whom was fifteen, and the
younger twelve years of age. As these boys were returning home, an asp of remarkable size
encountered them, but they were not the least afraid on meeting it; and moving up to their
very feet, as if charmed by some melody, it laid down its dark-green neck before them. The
younger of the boys laid hold of it with his hand, and, wrapping it in his dress, went on his
way with it. Then, entering the monastery with the air of a conqueror, and meeting with
the brethren, while all looked on, he opened out his dress, and set down the imprisoned
beast, not without some appearance of boastfulness. But while the rest of the spectators ex-
tolled the faith and virtue of the children, the Abbot, with deeper insight, and to prevent
them at such a tender age from being puffed up with pride, subjected both to punishment.
This he did after blaming them much for having publicly revealed what the Lord had wrought
through their instrumentality. He declared that that was not to be attributed to their faith,
but to the Divine power; and added that they should rather learn to serve God in humility,
and not to glory in signs and wonders; for that a sense of their own weakness was better
than any vainglorious exhibition of power.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11"> 
<pb n="70"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>“When the monk whom I have mentioned heard of this,—when he learned both that
the children had encountered danger through meeting the snake, and that moreover, having
got the better of the serpent, they had received a sound beating,—he implored the Abbot
that henceforth no bread or food of any kind should be sent to him. And now the eighth
day had passed since that man of Christ had exposed himself to the danger of perishing
from hunger; his limbs were growing dry with fasting, but his mind fixed upon heaven could
not fail; his body was wearing away with abstinence, but his faith remained firm. In the
meantime, the Abbot was admonished by the Spirit to visit that disciple. Under the influence
of a pious solicitude, he was eager to learn by what means of preserving life that faithful
man was supported, since he had declined any human aid in ministering to his necessities.
Accordingly, he sets out in person to satisfy himself on the subject. When the recluse saw
from a distance the old man coming to him, he ran to meet him: he thanks him for the visit,
and conducts him to his cell. As they enter the cell together, they behold a basket of palm
branches, full of hot bread, hanging fixed at the door-post. And first the smell of the hot
bread is perceived; but on touching it, it appears as if just a little before it had been taken
from the oven. At the same time, they do not recognize the bread as being of the shape
common in Egypt. Both are filled with amazement, and acknowledge the gift as being from
heaven. On the one side, the recluse declared that this event was due to the arrival of the
Abbot; while, on the other side, the Abbot ascribed it rather to the faith and virtue of the
recluse; but both broke the heaven-sent bread with exceeding joy. And when, on his return
to the monastery, the old man reported to the brethren what had occurred, such enthusiasm
seized the minds of all of them, that they vied with each other in their haste to betake
themselves to the desert, and its sacred seclusion; while they declared themselves miserable
in having made their abode only too long amid a multitude, where human fellowship had
to be carried on and endured.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>“In this monastery I saw two old men who were said to have already lived there for forty
years, and in fact never to have departed from it. I do not think that I should pass by all
mention of these men, since, indeed, I heard the following statement made regarding their
virtues on the testimony of the Abbot himself, and all the brethren, that in the case of one
of them, the sun never beheld him feasting, and in the case of the other, the sun never saw
him angry.”</p>
<p>Upon this, the Gaul looking at me exclaims: “Would that a friend of yours—I do not
wish to mention his name—were now present; I should greatly like him to hear of that example,
since we have had too much experience of his bitter anger in the persons of a great
many people. Nevertheless, as I hear, he has lately forgiven his enemies; and, in these circumstances,
were he to hear of the conduct of that man, he would be more and more
strengthened in his forgiving course by the example thus set before him, and would feel that
it is an admirable virtue not to fall under the influence of anger. I will not indeed deny that
he had just reasons for his wrath; but where the battle is hard, the crown of victory is all the
more glorious. For this reason, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that a certain man was
justly to be praised, because when an ungrateful freedman abandoned him he rather pitied
than inveighed against the fugitive. And, indeed, he was not even angry with the man by
whom he seems to have been carried off.”56</p>
<p>Upon this I remarked: “Unless Postumianus had given us that example of overcoming
anger, I would have been very angry on account of the departure of the fugitive; but since
it is not lawful to be angry, all remembrance of such things, as it annoys us, ought to be
blotted from our minds. Let us rather, Postumianus, listen to what you have got to say.”</p>
<p>“I will do,” says he, “Sulpitius, what you request, as I see you are all so desirous of
hearing me. But remember that I do not address my speech to you without hope of a larger
recompense; I shall gladly perform what you require, provided that, when ere long my turn
comes, you do not refuse what I ask.”</p>
<p>“We indeed,” said I, “have nothing by means of which we can return the obligation we
shall lie under to you even without a larger return.57 However, command us as to anything
you have thought about, provided you satisfy our desires, as you have already begun to do,
for your speech conveys to us true delight.”</p>
<p>“I will stint nothing,” said Postumianus, “of your desires; and inasmuch as you have
recognized the virtue of one recluse, I shall go on to relate to you some few things about
more such persons.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>“Well then, when I entered upon the nearest parts of the desert, about twelve miles from
the Nile, having as my guide one of the brethren who was well acquainted with the localities,
we arrived at the residence of a certain old monk who dwelt at the foot of a mountain. In
that place there was a well, which is a very rare thing in these regions. The monk had one
ox, the whole labor of which consisted in drawing water by moving a machine worked with
a wheel. This was the only way of getting at the water, for the well was said to be a thousand
or more feet deep. There was also a garden there full of a variety of vegetables. This, too,
was contrary to what might have been expected in the desert where, all things being dry and
burnt up by the fierce rays of the sun produce not even the slenderest root of any plant. But
the labor which in common with his ox, the monk performed, as well as his own special
industry, produced such a happy state of things to the holy man; for the frequent irrigation
in which he engaged imparted such a fertility to the sand that we saw the vegetables in his
garden flourishing and coming to maturity in a wonderful manner. On these, then, the ox
lived as well as its master; and from the abundance thus supplied, the holy man provided
us also with a dinner. There I saw what ye Gauls, perchance, may not believe—a pot boiling
without fire58 with the vegetables which were being got ready for our dinner: such is the
power of the sun in that place that it is sufficient for any cooks, even for preparing the
dainties of the Gauls. Then after dinner, when the evening was coming on, our host invites
us to a palm-tree, the fruit of which he was accustomed to use, and which was at a distance
of about two miles. For that is the only kind of tree found in the desert, and even these are
rare, though they do occur. I am not sure whether this is owing to the wise foresight of
former ages, or whether the soil naturally produces them. It may indeed be that God,
knowing beforehand that the desert was one day to be inhabited by the saints, prepared
these things for his servants. For those who settle within these solitudes live for the most
part on the fruit of such trees, since no other kinds of plants thrive in these quarters. Well,
when we came up to that tree to which the kindness of our host conducted us, we there met
with a lion; and on seeing it, both my guide and myself began to tremble; but the holy man
went up to it without delay, while we, though in great terror, followed him. As if commanded
by God, the beast modestly withdrew and stood gazing at us, while our friend, the monk,
plucked some fruit hanging within easy reach on the lower branches. And, on his holding
out his hand filled with dates, the monster ran up to him and received them as readily as
any domestic animal could have done; and having eaten them, it departed. We, beholding
these things, and being still under the influence of fear, could not but perceive how great
was the power of faith in his case, and how weak it was in ourselves.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>“We found another equally remarkable man living in a small hut, capable only of containing
a single person. Concerning him we were told that a she-wolf was accustomed to
stand near him at dinner; and that the beast could by no means be easily deceived so as to
fail to be with him at the regular hour when he took refreshment. It was also said that the
wolf waited at the door until he offered her the bread which remained over his own humble
dinner; that she was accustomed to lick his hand, and then, her duty being, as it were, fulfilled,
and her respects paid to him, she took her departure. But it so happened that that holy man,
while he escorted a brother who had paid him a visit, on his way home, was a pretty long
time away, and only returned under night.59 In the meanwhile, the beast made its appearance
at the usual dinner time. Having entered the vacant cell and perceived that its benefactor
was absent, it began to search round the hut with some curiosity to discover, if possible, the
inhabitant. Now it so happened that a basket of palm-twigs was hanging close at hand with
five loaves of bread in it. Taking one of these, the beast devoured it, and then, having committed
this evil deed, went its way. The recluse on his return found the basket in a state of
disorder, and the number of loaves less than it should have been. He is aware of the loss of
his household goods, and observes near the threshold some fragments of the loaf which had
been stolen. Considering all this, he had little doubt as to the author of the theft. Accordingly,
when on the following days the beast did not, in its usual way, make its appearance (undoubtedly
hesitating from a consciousness of its audacious deed to come to him on whom
it had inflicted injury), the recluse was deeply grieved at being deprived of the happiness he
had enjoyed in its society. At last, being brought back through his prayers, it appeared to
him as usual at dinner time, after the lapse of seven days. But to make clear to every one the
shame it felt, through regret for what had been done, not daring to draw very near, and with
its eyes, from profound self-abasement, cast upon the earth, it seemed, as was plain to the
intelligence of every one, to beg in a sort of way, for pardon. The recluse, pitying its confusion,
bade it come close to him, and then, with a kindly hand, stroked its head; while, by giving
it two loaves instead of the usual one, he restored the guilty creature to its former position;
and, laying aside its misery on thus having obtained forgiveness, it betook itself anew to its
former habits. Behold, I beg of you, even in this case, the power of Christ, to whom all is
wise that is irrational, and to whom all is mild that is by nature savage. A wolf discharges
duty; a wolf acknowledges the crime of theft; a wolf is confounded with a sense of shame:
when called for, it presents itself; it offers its head to be stroked; and it has a perception of
the pardon granted to it, just as if it had a feeling of shame on account of its misconduct,—this
is thy power, O Christ—these, O Christ, are thy marvelous works. For in truth, whatever
things thy servants do in thy name are thy doings; and in this only we find cause for deepest
<note type="footnote">59 “sub nocte”: this may be used for the usual classical form “sub noctem,” towards evening.</note>

<p>“But lest this should perchance seem incredible to any one, I shall mention still greater
things. I call Christ60 to witness that I invent nothing, nor will I relate things published by
uncertain authors, but will set forth facts which have been vouched for to me by trustworthy
men.</p>
<p>“Numbers of those persons live in the desert without any roofs over their heads, whom
people call anchorites.61 They subsist on the roots of plants; they settle nowhere in any fixed
place, lest they should frequently have men visiting them; wherever night compels them
they choose their abode. Well, two monks from Nitria directed their steps towards a certain
man living in this style, and under these conditions. They did so, although they were from
a very different quarter, because they had heard of his virtues, and because he had formerly
been their dear and intimate friend, while a member of the same monastery. They sought
after him long and much; and at length, in the seventh month, they found him staying in
that far-distant wilderness which borders upon Memphis. He was said already to have dwelt
in these solitudes for twelve years; but although he shunned intercourse with all men, yet
he did not shrink from meeting these friends; on the contrary, he yielded himself to their
affection for a period of three days. On the fourth day, when he had gone some distance
escorting them in their return journey, they beheld a lioness of remarkable size coming towards
them. The animal, although meeting with three persons, showed no uncertainty as
to the one she made for, but threw herself down at the feet of the anchorite: and, lying there
with a kind of weeping and lamentation, she manifested mingled feelings of sorrow and
supplication. The sight affected all, and especially him who perceived that he was sought
for: he therefore sets out, and the others follow him. For the beast stopping from time to
time, and, from time to time looking back, clearly wished it to be understood that the anchorite
should follow wherever she led. What need is there of many words? We arrived at
the den of the animal, where she, the unfortunate mother, was nourishing five whelps already
grown up, which, as they had come forth with closed eyes from the womb of their dam, so
they had continued in persistent blindness. Bringing them out, one by one, from the hollow
of the rock, she laid them down at the feet of the anchorite. Then at length the holy man
perceived what the creature desired; and having called upon the name of God, he touched
with his hand the closed eyes of the whelps; and immediately their blindness ceased, while
light, so long denied them, streamed upon the open eyes of the animals. Thus, those brethren,
having visited the anchorite whom they were desirous of seeing, returned with a very precious
reward for their labor, inasmuch as, having been permitted to be eye-witnesses of such
power, they had beheld the faith of the saint, and the glory of Christ, to which they will in

future bear testimony. But I have still more marvels to tell: the lioness, after five days, returned
to the man who had done her so great a kindness, and brought him, as a gift, the skin of an
uncommon animal. Frequently clad in this, as if it were a cloak, that holy man did not disdain
to receive that gift through the instrumentality of the best; while, all the time, he rather regarded
Another as being the giver.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>“There was also an illustrious name of another anchorite in those regions, a man who
dwelt in that part of the desert which is about Syene. This man, when first he betook himself
to the wilderness, intended to live on the roots of plants which the sand here and there
produces, of a very sweet and delicious flavor; but being ignorant of the nature of the herbs,
he often gathered those which were of a deadly character. And, indeed, it was not easy to
discriminate between the kind of the roots by the mere taste, since all were equally sweet,
but many of them, of a less known nature, contained within them a deadly poison. When,
therefore, the poison within tormented him on eating these, and all his vitals were tortured
with terrific pains, while frequent vomitings, attended by excruciating agonies, were shattering
the very citadel of life, his stomach being completely exhausted, he was in utter terror
of all that had to be eaten for sustaining existence. Having thus fasted for seven days, he was
almost at the point of death when a wild animal called an Ibex came up to him. To this
creature standing by him, he offered a bundle of plants which he had collected on the previous
day, yet had not ventured to touch; but the beast, casting aside with its mouth those which
were poisonous, picked out such as it knew to be harmless. In this way, that holy man, taught
by its conduct what he ought to eat, and what to reject, both escaped the danger of dying of
hunger and of being poisoned by the plants. But it would be tedious to relate all the facts
which we have either had personal knowledge of, or have heard from others, respecting
those who inhabit the desert. I spent a whole year, and nearly seven months more, of set
purpose, within these solitudes, being, however, rather an admirer of the virtues of others,
than myself making any attempt to manifest the extraordinary endurance which they displayed.
For the greater part of the time I lived with the old man whom I have mentioned,
who possessed the well and the ox.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p>“I visited two monasteries of St. Anthony, which are at the present day occupied by his
disciples. I also went to that place in which the most blessed Paul, the first of the eremites,
had his abode. I saw the Red Sea and the ridges of Mount Sinai, the top of which almost
touches heaven, and cannot, by any human effort, be reached. An anchorite was said to live
somewhere within its recesses: and I sought long and much to see him, but was unable to
do so. He had for nearly fifty years been removed from all human fellowship, and used no
clothes, but was covered with bristles growing on his own body, while, by Divine gift, he
knew not of his own nakedness. As often as any pious men desired to visit him, making
hastily for the pathless wilderness, he shunned all meeting with his kind. To one man only,
about five years before my visit, he was said to have granted an interview; and I believe that
man obtained the favor through the power of his faith. Amid much talk which the two had
together, the recluse is said to have replied to the question why he shunned so assiduously
all human beings, that the man who was frequently visited by mortals like himself, could
not often be visited by angels. From this, not without reason, the report had spread, and
was accepted by multitudes, that that holy man enjoyed angelic fellowship. Be this as it may,
I, for my part, departed from Mount Sinai, and returned to the river Nile, the banks of which,
on both sides, I beheld dotted over with numerous monasteries. I saw that, for the most
part, as I have already said, the monks resided together in companies of a hundred; but it
was well known that so many as two or three thousand sometimes had their abode in the
same villages. Nor indeed would one have any reason to think that the virtue of the monks
there dwelling together in great numbers, was less than that of those was known to be, who
kept themselves apart from human fellowship. The chief and foremost virtue in these places,
as I have already said, is obedience. In fact, any one applying for admission is not received
by the Abbot of the monastery on any other condition than that he be first tried and proved;
it being understood that he will never afterwards decline to submit to any injunction of the
Abbot, however arduous and difficult, and though it may seem something unworthy to be
endured.</p>

<p>“I will relate two wonderful examples of almost incredible obedience, and two only, although
many present themselves to my recollection; but if, in any case, a few instances do
not suffice to rouse readers to an imitation of the like virtues, many would be of no advantage.
Well then, when a certain man having laid aside all worldly business, and having entered a
monastery of very62 strict discipline, begged that he might be accepted as a member, the
Abbot began to place many considerations before him,—that the toils of that order were
severe; that his own requirements were heavy, and such as no one’s endurance could easily
comply with; that he should rather enquire after another monastery where life was carried
on under easier conditions; and that he should not try to attempt that which he was unable
to accomplish. But he was in no degree moved by these terrors; on the contrary, he all the
more promised obedience, saying that if the Abbot should order him to walk into the fire,
he would not refuse to enter it. The Master then, having accepted that profession of his, did
not delay putting it to the test. It so happened that an iron vessel was close at hand, very
hot, as it was being got ready by a powerful fire for cooking some loaves of bread: the flames
were bursting forth from the oven broken open, and fire raged without restraint within the
hollows of that furnace. The Master, at this stage of affairs, ordered the stranger to enter it,
nor did he hesitate to obey the command. Without a moment’s delay he entered into the
midst of the flames, which, conquered at once by so bold a display of faith, subsided at his
approach, as happened of old to the well-known Hebrew children. Nature was overcome,
and the fire gave way; so that he, of whom it was thought that he would be burned to death,
had reason to marvel at himself, besprinkled, as it were, with a cooling dew. But what wonder
is it, O Christ, that that fire did not touch thy youthful soldier? The result was that, neither
did the Abbot regret having issued such harsh commands, nor did the disciple repent having
obeyed the orders received. He, indeed, on the very day on which he came, being tried in
his weakness, was found perfect; deservedly happy, deservedly glorious, having been tested
in obedience, he was glorified through suffering.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<p>“In the same monastery, the fact which I am about to narrate was said to have occurred
within recent memory. A certain man had come to the same Abbot in like manner with the
former, in order to obtain admission. When the first law of obedience was placed before
him, and he promised an unfailing patience for the endurance of all things however extreme,
it so happened that the Abbot was holding in his hand a twig of storax already withered.
This the Abbot fixed in the ground, and imposed this work upon the visitor, that he should
continue to water the twig, until (what was against every natural result) that dry piece of
wood should grow green in the sandy soil. Well, the stranger, being placed under the authority
of unbending law, conveyed water every day on his own shoulders—water which had to be
taken from the river Nile, at almost two miles’ distance. And now, after a year had run its
course, the labor of that workman had not yet ceased, but there could be no hope of the
good success of his undertaking. However, the grace of obedience continued to be shown
in his labor. The following year also mocked the vain labor of the (by this time) weakened
brother. At length, as the third annual circle was gliding by, while the workman ceased not,
night or day, his labor in watering, the twig began to show signs of life. I have myself seen
a small tree sprung from that little rod, which, standing at the present day with green branches
in the court of the monastery, as if for a witness of what has been stated, shows what a reward
obedience received, and what a power faith can exert. But the day would fail me before I
could fully enumerate the many different miracles which have become known to me in
connection with the virtues of the saints.</p>

<p>“I will, however, still further give you an account of two extraordinary marvels. The one
of these will be a notable warning against the inflation of wretched vanity, and the other
will serve as no mean guard against the display of a spurious righteousness.</p>
<p>“A certain saint, then, endowed with almost incredible power in casting out demons
from the bodies of those possessed by them, was, day by day, performing unheard-of miracles.
For, not only when present, and not merely by his word, but while absent also, he, from
time to time, cured possessed bodies, by some threads taken from his garment, or by letters
which he sent. He, therefore, was to a wonderful degree visited by people who came to him
from every part of the world. I say nothing about those of humbler rank; but prefects,
courtiers, and judges of various ranks often lay at his doors. Most holy bishops also, laying
aside their priestly dignity, and humbly imploring him to touch and bless them, believed
with good reason that they were sanctified, and illumined with a divine gift, as often as they
touched his hand and garment. He was reported to abstain always and utterly from every
kind of drink, and for food (I will whisper this, Sulpitius, into your ear lest our friend the
Gaul hear it), to subsist upon only six dried figs. But in the meantime, just as honor accrued
to the holy man from his excellence,63 so vanity began to steal upon him from the honor
which was paid him. When first he perceived that this evil was growing upon him, he
struggled long and earnestly to shake it off, but it could not be thoroughly got rid of by all
his efforts, since he still had a secret consciousness of being under the influence of vanity.
Everywhere did the demons acknowledge his name, while he was not able to exclude from
his presence the number of people who flocked to him. The hidden poison was, in the
meantime, working in his breast, and he, at whose beck demons were expelled from the
bodies of others, was quite unable to cleanse himself from the hidden thoughts of vanity.
Betaking himself, therefore, with fervent supplication to God, he is said to have prayed that,
power being given to the devil over him for five months, he might become like to those
whom he himself had cured. Why should I delay with many words? That most powerful
man,—he, renowned for his miracles and virtues through all the East, he, to whose threshold
multitudes had gathered, and at whose door the highest dignitaries of that age had prostrated
themselves—laid hold of by a demon, was kept fast in chains. It was only after having suffered
all those things which the possessed are wont to endure, that at length in the fifth month
he was delivered, not only from the demon, but (what was to him more useful and desirable)
from the vanity which had dwelt within him.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<p>“But to me reflecting on these things, there occurs the thought of our own unhappiness
and our own infirmity. For who is there of us, whom if one despicable creature of a man
has humbly saluted, or one woman has praised with foolish and flattering words, is not at
once elated with pride and puffed up with vanity? This will bring it about that even though
one does not possess a consciousness of sanctity, yet, because through the flattery, or, it may
be, the mistake of fools, he is said to be a holy man, he will, in fact, deem himself most holy!
And then, if frequent gifts are sent to him, he will maintain that he is so honored by the
munificence of God, inasmuch as all necessary things are bestowed upon him when sleeping
and at rest. But further, if some signs of any kind of power fall to him even in a low degree,
he will think himself no less than an angel. And even if he is not marked out from others
either by acts or excellence, but is simply made a cleric, he instantly enlarges the fringes of
his dress, delights in salutations, is puffed up by people visiting him, and himself gads about
everywhere. Nay, the man who had been previously accustomed to travel on foot, or at most
to ride on the back of an ass, must needs now ride proudly on frothing steeds; formerly
content to dwell in a small and humble cell, he now builds a lofty fretted ceiling; he constructs
many rooms; he cuts and carves doors; he paints wardrobes; he rejects the coarser kind of
clothing, and demands soft garments; and he gives such orders as the following to dear
widows and friendly virgins, that the one class weave for him an embroidered cloak, and
the other a flowing robe. But let us leave all these things to be described more pungently by
that blessed man Hieronymus; and let us return to the object more immediately in view.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says our Gallic friend upon this, “I know not indeed what you have left to be
said by Hieronymus; you have within such brief compass comprehended all our practices,
that I think these few words of yours, if they are taken in good part, and patiently considered,
will greatly benefit those in question, so that they will not require in future to be kept in
order by the books of Hieronymus. But do thou rather go on with what you had begun, and
bring forward an example, as you said you would do, against spurious righteousness; for to
tell you the truth, we are subject to no more destructive evil than this within the wide
boundaries of Gaul.”</p>
<p>“I will do so,” replied Postumianus, “nor will I any longer keep you in a state of expectation.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<p>“A certain young man from Asia, exceedingly wealthy, of distinguished family, and
having a wife and little son, happening to have been a tribune in Egypt, and in frequent
campaigns against the Blembi to have touched on some parts of the desert, and having also
seen several tents of the saints, heard the word of salvation from the blessed John. And he
did not then delay to show his contempt for an unprofitable military life with its vain honor.
Bravely entering into the wilderness, he in a short time became distinguished as being perfect
in every kind of virtue. Capable of lengthened fasting, conspicuous for humility, and steadfast
in faith, he had easily obtained a reputation in the pursuit of virtue equal to that of the monks
of old. But by and by, the thought (proceeding from the devil) entered his mind that it would
be more proper for him to return to his native land and be the means of saving his only son
and his family along with his wife; which surely would be more acceptable to God than if
he, content with only rescuing himself from the world, should, not without impiety, neglect
the salvation of his friends. Overcome by the plausible appearance of that kind of spurious
righteousness, the recluse, after a period of nearly four years, forsook his cell and the end
to which he had devoted his life. But on arriving at the nearest monastery, which was inhabited
by many brethren, he made known to them, in reply to their questionings, the reason
of his departure and the object he had in view. All of them, and especially the Abbot of that
place, sought to keep him back; but the intention he had unfortunately formed could not
be rooted out of his mind. Accordingly with an unhappy obstinacy he went forth, and, to
the grief of all, departed from the brethren. But scarcely had he vanished from their sight,
when he was taken possession of by a demon, and vomiting bloody froth from his mouth,
he began to lacerate himself with his own teeth. Then, having been carried back to the same
monastery on the shoulders of the brethren, when the unclean spirit could not be restrained
within its walls, he was, from dire necessity, loaded with iron fetters, being bound both in
hands and feet—a punishment not undeserved by a fugitive, inasmuch as chains now restrained
him whom faith had not restrained. At length, after two years, having been set free
from the unclean spirit by the prayers of the saints, he immediately returned to the desert
from which he had departed. In this way he was both himself corrected and was rendered
a warning to others, that the shadow of a spurious righteousness might neither delude any
one, nor a shifting fickleness of character induce any one, with unprofitable inconstancy,
to forsake the course on which he has once entered. And now let it suffice for you to learn
these things respecting the various operations of the Lord which he has carried on in the
persons of his servants; with the view either of stimulating others to a like kind of conduct,
or of deterring them from particular actions. But since I have by this time fully satisfied
your ears—have, in fact, been more lengthy than I ought to have been—do you now (upon
this he addressed himself to me)—pay me the recompense you owe, by letting us hear you,

<pb n="84"/>
after your usual fashion, discoursing about your friend Martin, for my longings after this
have already for a long time been strongly excited.”</p>

<p>“What,” replied I, “is there not enough about my friend Martin in that book of mine
which you know that I published respecting his life and virtues?”</p>
<p>“I own it,” said Postumianus, “and that book of yours is never far from my right hand.
For if you recognize it, look here—(and so saying he displayed the book which was concealed
in his dress)—here it is. This book,” added he, “is my companion both by land and sea: it
has been my friend and comforter in all my wanderings. But I will relate to you to what
places that book has penetrated, and how there is almost no spot upon earth in which the
subject of so happy a history is not possessed as a well-known narrative. Paulinus, a man
who has the strongest regard for you, was the first to bring it to the city of Rome; and then,
as it was greedily laid hold of by the whole city, I saw the booksellers rejoicing over it, inasmuch
as nothing was a source of greater gain to them, for nothing commanded a readier
sale, or fetched a higher price. This same book, having got a long way before me in the course
of my traveling, was already generally read through all Carthage, when I came into Africa.
Only that presbyter of Cyrene whom I mentioned did not possess it; but he wrote down its
contents from my description. And why should I speak about Alexandria? for there it is almost
better known to all than it is to yourself. It has passed through Egypt, Nitria, the
Thebaid, and the whole of the regions of Memphis. I found it being read by a certain old
man in the desert; and, after I told him that I was your intimate friend, this commission was
given me both by him and many other brethren, that, if I should ever again visit this country,
and find you well, I should constrain you to supply those particulars which you stated in
your book you had passed over respecting the virtues of the sainted man. Come then, as I
do not desire you to repeat to me those things which are already sufficiently known from
what you have written, let those other points, at my request and that of many others, be
fully set forth, which at the time of your writing you passed over, to prevent, as I believe,
any feeling of weariness on the part of your readers.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<p>“Indeed, Postumianus,” replied I, “while I was listening attentively, all this time, to you
talking about the excellences of the saints, in my secret thoughts I had my mind turned to
my friend Martin, observing on the best of grounds that all those things which different
individuals had done separately, were easily and entirely accomplished by that one man
alone. For, although you certainly related lofty deeds, I really heard nothing from your lips
(may I say it, without offence to these holy men), in which Martin was inferior to any one
of them. And while I hold that the excellence of no one of these is ever to be compared with
the merits of that man, still this point ought to be attended to, that it is unfair he should be
compared, on the same terms, with the recluses of the desert, or even with the anchorites.
For they, at freedom from every hindrance, with heaven only and the angels as witnesses,
were clearly instructed to perform admirable deeds; he, on the other hand, in the midst of
crowds and intercourse with human beings—among quarrelsome clerics, and among furious
bishops, while he was harassed with almost daily scandals on all sides, nevertheless stood
absolutely firm with unconquerable virtue against all these things, and performed such
wonders as not even those accomplished of whom we have heard that they are, or at one
time were, in the wilderness. But even had they done things equal to his, what judge would
be so unjust as not, on good grounds, to decide that he was the more powerful? For put the
case that he was a soldier who fought on unfavorable ground, and yet turned out a conqueror,
and compare them, in like manner, to soldiers, who however, contended on equal terms,
or even on favorable terms, with the enemy. What then? Although the victory of all is one
and the same, the glory of all certainly cannot be equal. And even though you have narrated
marvelous things, still you have not stated that a dead man was recalled to life by any one.
In this one particular undoubtedly, it must be owned that no one is to be compared with Martin.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25"> 
<pb n="87"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<p>“For, if it is worthy of admiration that the flames did not touch that Egyptian of whom
you have spoken, Martin also not infrequently proved his power over fire. If you remind us
that the savagery of wild beasts was conquered by, and yielded to, the anchorites, Martin,
for his part, was accustomed to keep in check both the fury of wild beasts and the poison of
serpents. But, if you bring forward for comparison him who cured those possessed of unclean
spirits, by the authority of his word, or even through the instrumentality of threads from
his dress, there are many proofs that Martin was not, even in this respect, inferior. Nay,
should you have recourse to him, who, covered with his own hair instead of a garment, was
thought to be visited by angels, with Martin angels were wont to hold daily discourse.
Moreover, he bore so unconquerable a spirit against vanity and boastfulness, that no one
more determinedly disdained these vices, and that, although he often, while absent, cured
those who were filled with unclean spirits, and issued his commands not only to courtiers
or prefects, but also to kings themselves. This was indeed a very small thing amid his other
virtues, but I should wish you to believe that no one ever contended more earnestly than he
did against not only vanity, but also the causes and the occasions of vanity. I shall also
mention what is indeed a small point, but should not be passed over, because it is to the
credit of a man who, being possessed of the highest power, manifested such a pious desire
to show his regard for the blessed Martin. I remember, then, that Vincentius the prefect, an
illustrious man, and one of the most eminent in all Gaul for every kind of virtue, when he
had occasion to be in the vicinity of Tours, often begged of Martin that he would allow him
to stay with him in the monastery. In making this request, he brought forward the example
of Saint Ambrose, the bishop, who was generally spoken of at that time as being in the habit
of entertaining both consuls and prefects. But Martin, with deeper judgment, refused so to
act, lest by so doing some vanity and inflation of spirit might steal upon him. You, therefore,
must acknowledge that there existed in Martin the virtues of all those men whom you have
mentioned, but there were not found in all of them the virtues by which Martin was distinguished.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<p>“Why do you,” here exclaimed Postumianus, “speak to me in such a manner? As if I
did not hold the same opinion as yourself, and had not always been of the same mind. I,
indeed, as long as I live, and retain my senses, will ever celebrate the monks of Egypt: I will
praise the anchorites; I will admire the eremites; but I will place Martin in a position of his
own: I do not venture to compare to him any one of the monks, far less any of the bishops.
Egypt owns this: Syria and Æthiopia have discovered this: India has heard this; Parthia and
Persia have known this; not even Armenia is ignorant of it; the remote Bosphorus is aware
of it; and in a word, those are acquainted with it who visit the Fortunate Islands or the
Arctic Ocean. All the more wretched on this account is this country of ours, which has not
been found worthy to be acquainted with so great a man, although he was in its immediate
vicinity. However, I will not include the people at large in this censure: only the clerics, only
the priests know nothing of him; and not without reason were they, in their ill-will, disinclined
to know him, inasmuch as, had they become acquainted with his virtues they must
have recognized their own vices. I shudder to state what I have lately heard, that a miserable
man (I know him not), has said that you have told many lies in that book of yours. This is
not the voice of a man, but of the devil; and it is not Martin who is, in this way, injured, but
faith is taken from the Gospels themselves. For, since the Lord himself testified of works of
the kind which Martin accomplished, that they were to be performed by all the faithful, he
who does not believe that Martin accomplished such deeds, simply does not believe that
Christ uttered such words. But the miserable, the degenerate, the somnolent, are put to
shame, that the things which they themselves cannot do, were done by him, and prefer
rather to deny his virtues than to confess their own inertness. But let us, as we hasten on to
other matters, let go all remembrance of such persons: and do you rather, as I have for a
long time desired, proceed to narrate the still untold deeds of Martin.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said I, “I think that your request would more properly be directed to our friend
the Gaul, since he is acquainted with more of Martin’s doings than I am—for a disciple
could not be ignorant of the deeds of his master—and who certainly owes a return of kindness,
not only to Martin, but to both of us, inasmuch as I have already published my book,
and you have, so far, related to us the doings of our brethren in the East. Let then, our friend
the Gaul commence that detailed account which is due from him: because, as I have said,
he both owes us a return in the way of speaking, and will, I believe, do this much for his
friend Martin—that he shall, not unwillingly, give a narrative of his deeds.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<p>“Well,” said the Gaul, “I, for my part, though I am unequal to so great a task, feel constrained
by those examples of obedience which have been related above by Postumianus,
not to refuse that duty which you impose upon me. But when I reflect that I, a man of Gaul,64
am about to speak in the presence of natives of Aquitania, I fear lest my somewhat rude
form of speech should offend your too delicate ears. However, you will listen to me as a
foolish sort65 of man, who says nothing in an affected or stilted fashion. For if you have
conceded to me that I was a disciple of Martin, grant me this also that I be allowed, under
the shelter of his example, to despise the vain trappings of speech and ornaments of words.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” replied Postumianus, “speak either in Celtic, or in Gaulish, if you prefer it,
provided only you speak of Martin. But for my part, I believe, that, even though you were
dumb, words would not be wanting to you, in which you might speak of Martin with eloquent
lips, just as the tongue of Zacharias was loosed at the naming of John. But as you are, in fact,
an orator,66 you craftily, like an orator, begin by begging us to excuse your unskillfulness,
because you really excel in eloquence. But it is not fitting either that a monk should show
such cunning, or that a Gaul should be so artful. But to work rather, and set forth what you
have still got to say, for we have wasted too much time already in dealing with other matters;
and the lengthening shadow of the declining sun warns us that no long portion of day remains
till night be upon us. Then, after we had all kept silence for a little, the Gaul thus begins—“I
think I must take care in the first place not to repeat those particulars about the virtues of
Martin, which our friend Sulpitius there has related in his book. For this reason, I shall pass
over his early achievements, when he was a soldier; nor will I touch on those things which
he did as a layman and a monk. At the same time, I shall relate nothing which I simply heard
from others, but only events of which I myself was an eye-witness.”</p>

<head>DIALOGUE II.
CONCERNING THE VIRTUES OF ST. MARTIN.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="91"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>“Well then, when first, having left the schools, I attached myself to the blessed man, a
few days after doing so, we followed him on his way to the church. In the way, a poor man,
half-naked in these winter-months, met him, and begged that some clothing might be given
him. Then Martin, calling for the chief-deacon, gave orders that the shivering creature
should be clothed without delay. After that, entering a private apartment, and sitting down
by himself, as his custom was—for he secured for himself this retirement even in the church,
liberty being granted to the clerics, since indeed the presbyters were seated in another
apartment, either spending their time in mutual67 courtesies, or occupied in listening to
affairs of business. But Martin kept himself in his own seclusion up to the hour at which
custom required that the sacred rites should be dispensed to the people. And I will not pass
by this point that, when sitting in his retirement, he never used a chair; and, as to the church,
no one ever saw him sitting there, as I recently saw a certain man (God is my witness), not
without a feeling of shame at the spectacle, seated on a lofty throne, yea, in its elevation, a
kind of royal tribunal; but Martin might be seen sitting on a rude little stool, such as those
in use by the lowest of servants, which we Gallic country-people call tripets,68 and which
you men of learning, or those at least who are from Greece, call tripods. Well, that poor man
who had been chanced upon, as the chief-deacon delayed to give him the garment, rushed
into this private apartment of the blessed man, complaining that he had not been attended
to by the cleric, and bitterly mourning over the cold he suffered. No delay took place: the
holy man, while the other did not observe, secretly drew off his tunic which was below his
outer69 garment, and clothing the poor man with this, told him to go on his way. Then, a
little after, the chief-deacon coming in informs him, according to custom, that the people
were waiting in the church, and that it was incumbent on him to proceed to the performance
of the sacred rites. Martin said to him in reply that it was necessary that the poor man—referring
to himself—should be clothed, and that he could not possibly proceed to the church,
unless the poor man received a garment. But the deacon, not understanding the true state
of the case—that Martin, while outwardly clad with a cloak, was not seen by him to be naked
underneath, at last begins to complain that the poor man does not make his appearance.
‘Let the garment which has been got ready,’ said Martin, ‘be brought to me; there will not
be wanting the poor man requiring to be clothed.’ Then, at length, the cleric, constrained
by necessity, and now in not the sweetest temper, hurriedly procures a rough70 garment
<note type="footnote">67 “salutationibus vacantes”: this is, in the original, a very confused and obscure sentence.</note>
<note type="footnote">68 Halm edits “tripeccias,” which may have been the local patois for “tripetias” (ter-pes), corresponding to

<pb n="92"/>
out of the nearest shop, short and shaggy, and costing only five pieces of silver, and lays it,
in wrath at the feet of Martin. ‘See,’ cries he, ‘there is the garment, but the poor man is not
here.’ Martin, nothing moved, bids him go to the door for a little, thus obtaining secrecy,
while, in his nakedness, he clothes himself with the garment, striving with all his might to
keep secret what he had done. But when do such things remain concealed in the case of the
saints desiring that they should be so? Whether they will or not, all are brought to light.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>“Martin, then, clothed in this garment, proceeds to offer the sacrifice71 to God. And
then on that very day—I am about to narrate something wonderful—when he was engaged
in blessing the altar, as is usual, we beheld a globe of fire dart from his head, so that, as it
rose on high, the flame produced a hair of extraordinary length. And, although we saw this
take place on a very famous day in the midst of a great multitude of people, only one of the
virgins, one of the presbyters, and only three of the monks, witnessed the sight: but why the
others did not behold it is a matter not to be decided by our judgment.</p>
<p>“About the same time, when my uncle Evanthius, a highly Christian man, although
occupied in the affairs of this world, had begun to be afflicted with a very serious illness, to
the extreme danger of his life, he sent for Martin. And, without any delay, Martin hastened
towards him; but, before the blessed man had completed the half of the distance between
them, the sick man experienced the power of him that was coming; and, being immediately
restored to health, he himself met us as we were approaching. With many entreaties, he
detained Martin, who wished to return home on the following day; for, in the meantime, a
serpent had struck with a deadly blow a boy belonging to my uncle’s family; and Evanthius
himself, on his own shoulders, carried him all but lifeless through the force of the poison,
and laid him at the feet of the holy man, believing that nothing was impossible to him. By
this time, the serpent had diffused its poison through all the members of the boy: one could
see his skin swollen in all his veins, and his vitals strung up like a leather-bottle. Martin
stretched forth his hand, felt all the limbs of the boy, and placed his finger close to the little
wound, at which the animal had instilled the poison. Then in truth—I am going to tell things
wonderful—we saw the whole poison, drawn from every part of the body, gather quickly
together to Martin’s finger; and next, we beheld the poison mixed with blood press through
the small puncture of the wound, just as a long line of abundant milk is wont to flow forth
from the teats of goats or sheep, when these are squeezed by the hand of shepherds. The
boy rose up quite well. We were amazed by so striking a miracle; and we acknowledged—as,
indeed, truth compelled us to do—that there was no one under heaven who could equal the
deeds of Martin.</p>

<p>“In the same way, some time afterwards, we made a journey with him while he visited
the various parishes in his diocese. He had gone forward a little by himself, some necessity
or other, I know not what, compelling us to keep behind. In the meantime, a state-conveyance,
full of military men, was coming along the public highway. But when the animals near
the side beheld Martin in his shaggy garment, with a long black cloak over it, being alarmed,
they swerved a little in the opposite direction. Then, the reins getting entangled, they threw
into confusion those extended lines in which, as you have often seen, those wretched creatures
are held together; and as they were with difficulty rearranged, delay, of course, was caused
to those people hastening forward. Enraged by this injury, the soldiers, with hasty leaps,
made for the ground. And then they began to belabor Martin with whips and staves; and as
he, in silence and with incredible patience, submitted his back to them smiting him, this
roused the greater fury in these wretches, for they became all the more violent from the fact,
that he, as if he did not feel the blows showered upon him, seemed to despise them. He fell
almost lifeless to the earth; and we, ere long, found him covered with blood, and wounded
in every part of his body. Lifting him up without delay, and placing him upon his own ass,
while we execrated the place of that cruel bloodshed, we hastened, off as speedily as possible.
In the meantime, the soldiers having returned to their conveyance, after their fury was satisfied,
urge the beasts to proceed in the direction in which they had been going. But they all
remained fixed to the spot, as stiff as if they had been brazen statues, and although their
masters shouted at them, and the sound of their whips echoed on every side, still the animals
never moved. These men next all fall to with lashes; in fact, while punishing the mules, they
waste all the Gallic whips they had. The whole of the neighboring wood is laid hold of, and
the beasts are beaten with enormous cudgels; but these cruel hands still effected nothing:
the animals continued to stand in one and the same place like fixed effigies. The wretched
men knew not what to do, and they could no longer conceal from themselves that, in some
way or other, there was a higher power at work in the bosoms of these brutes, so that they
were, in fact, restrained by the interposition of a deity. At length, therefore, returning to
themselves, they began to enquire who he was whom but a little before they had scourged
at the same place; and when, on pursuing the investigation, they ascertained from those on
the way that it was Martin who had been so cruelly beaten by them, then, indeed, the cause
of their misfortune appeared manifest to all; and they could no longer doubt that they were
kept back on account of the injury done to that man. Accordingly, they all rush after us at
full speed, and, conscious of what they had done and deserved, overwhelmed with shame,
weeping, and having their heads and faces smeared with the dust with which they themselves
had besprinkled their bodies, they cast themselves at Martin’s feet, imploring his pardon,
and begging that he would allow them to proceed. They added that they had been sufficiently
punished by their conscience alone, and that they deeply felt that the earth might swallow

<pb n="95"/>
them alive in that very spot, or that rather, they, losing all sense, might justly be stiffened
into immovable rocks, just as they had seen their beasts of burden fixed to the places in
which they stood; but they begged and entreated him to extend to them pardon for their
crime, and to allow them to go on their way. The blessed man had been aware, before they
came up to us, that they were in a state of detention, and had already informed us of the
fact; however, he kindly granted them forgiveness; and, restoring their animals, permitted
them to pursue their journey.</p>

<p>“I have often noticed this, Sulpitius, that Martin was accustomed to say to you, that such
an abundance72 of power was by no means granted him while he was a bishop, as he remembered
to have possessed before he obtained that office. Now, if this be true, or rather
since it is true, we may imagine how great those things were which, while still a monk, he
accomplished, and which, without any witness, he effected apart by himself; since we have
seen that, while a bishop, he performed so great wonders before the eyes of all. Many, no
doubt, of his former achievements were known to the world, and could not be hid, but those
are said to have been innumerable which, while he avoided boastfulness, he kept concealed
and did not allow to come to the knowledge of mankind; for, inasmuch as he transcended
the capabilities of mere man, in a consciousness of his own eminence, and trampling upon
worldly glory, he was content simply to have heaven as a witness of his deeds. That this is
true we can judge even from these things which are well known to us, and could not be hid;
since e.g. before he became a bishop he restored two dead men to life, facts of which your
book has treated pretty fully, but, while he was bishop, he raised up only one, a point which
I am surprised you have not noticed. I myself am a witness to this latter occurrence; but,
probably, you have no doubts about the matter being duly testified. At any rate, I will set
before you the affair as it happened. For some reason, I know not what, we were on our way
to the town of the Carnutes.73 In the meantime, as we pass by a certain village most populous
in inhabitants, an enormous crowd went forth to meet us, consisting entirely of heathen;
for no one in that village was acquainted with a Christian. Nevertheless, owing to the report
of the approach of so great a man, a multitude of those streaming to one point had filled all
the widely spreading plains. Martin felt that some work was to be performed; and as the
spirit within him was thus moving him, he was deeply excited. He at once began to preach
to the heathen the word of God, so utterly different from that of man, often groaning that
so great a crowd should be ignorant of the Lord the Saviour. In the meantime, while an incredible
multitude had surrounded us, a certain woman, whose son had recently died, began
to present, with outstretched hands, the lifeless body to the blessed man, saying, “We know
that you are a friend of God: restore me my son, who is my only one.” The rest of the multitude
joined her, and added their entreaties to those of the mother. Martin perceiving, as he
afterwards told us, that he could manifest power, in order to the salvation of those waiting
for its display, received the body of the deceased into his own hands; and when, in the sight
of all, he had fallen on his knees, and then arose, after his prayer was finished, he restored
to its mother the child brought back to life. Then, truly, the whole multitude, raising a shout
<note type="footnote">72 “eam virtutum gratiam.”</note>
<note type="footnote">73 The Carnutes dwelt on both sides of the Loire, and their chief town, here referred to, was Autricum, now
Chartres.</note>

<pb n="97"/>
to heaven, acknowledged Christ as God, and finally began to rush in crowds to the knees
of the blessed man, sincerely imploring that he would make them Christians. Nor did he
delay to do so. As they were in the middle of the plain, he made them all catechumens, by
placing his hand upon the whole of them; while, at the same time, turning to us, he said
that, not without reason, were these made catechumens in that plain where the martyrs
were wont to be consecrated.”</p>

<p>“You have conquered, O Gaul,” said Postumianus, “you have conquered, although
certainly not me, who am, on the contrary, an upholder of Martin, and who have always
known and believed all these things about that man; but you have conquered all the eremites
and anchorites. For no one of them, like your friend, or rather our friend, Martin, ruled
over deaths of all74 kinds. And Sulpitius there justly compared him to the apostles and
prophets, inasmuch as the power of his faith, and the works accomplished by his power,
bear witness that he was, in all points, like them. But go on, I beg of you, although we can
hear nothing more striking than we have heard—still, go on, O Gaul, to set forth what still
remains of what you have to say concerning Martin. For the mind is eager to know even
the least and commonest of his doings, since there is no doubt that the least of his actions
surpass the greatest deeds of others.”</p>
<p>“I will do so,” replies the Gaul, “but I did not myself witness what I am about to relate,
for it took place before I became an associate of Martin’s; still, the fact is well known, having
been spread through the world by the accounts given by faithful brethren, who were present
on the occasion. Well, just about the time when he first became a bishop, a necessity arose
for his visiting the imperial75 court. Valentinian, the elder, then was at the head of affairs.
When he came to know that Martin was asking for things which he did not incline to grant,
he ordered him to be kept from entering the doors of the palace. Besides his own unkind
and haughty temper, his wife Arriana had urged him to this course, and had wholly alienated
him from the holy man, so that he should not show him the regard which was due to him.
Martin, accordingly, when he had once and again endeavored to procure an interview with
the haughty prince, had recourse to his well-known weapons—he clothes himself in sackcloth,
scatters ashes upon his person, abstains from food and drink, and gives himself, night and
day, to continuous prayer. On the seventh day, an angel appeared to him, and tells him to
go with confidence to the palace, for that the royal doors, although closed against him, would
open of their own accord, and that the haughty spirit of the emperor would be softened.
Martin, therefore, being encouraged by the address of the angel who thus appeared to him,
and trusting to his assistance, went to the palace. The doors stood open, and no one opposed
his entrance; so that, going in, he came at last into the presence of the king, without any one
seeking to hinder him. The king, however, seeing him at a distance as he approached, and
gnashing his teeth that he had been admitted, did not, by any means, condescend to rise up
as Martin advanced, until fire covered the royal seat, and until the flames seized on a part
of the royal person. In this way the haughty monarch is driven from his throne, and, much
against his will, rises up to receive Martin. He even gave many embraces to the man whom
<note type="footnote">74 “mortibus.”</note>
<note type="footnote">75 “adire comitatum”: this is a common meaning of comitatus in writers of the period.</note>

<pb n="99"/>
he had formerly determined to despise, and, coming to a better frame of mind, he confessed
that he perceived the exercise of Divine power; without waiting even to listen to the requests
of Martin, he granted all he desired before being asked. Afterwards the king often invited
the holy man both to conferences and entertainments; and, in the end, when he was about
to depart, offered him many presents, which, however, the blessed man, jealously maintaining
his own poverty, totally refused, as he did on all similar occasions.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>“And as we have, once for all, entered the palace, I shall string together events which
there took place, although they happened at different times. And, indeed, it does not seem
to me right that I should pass unmentioned the example of admiration for Martin which
was shown by a faithful queen. Maximus then ruled the state, a man worthy of being extolled
in76 his whole life, if only he had been permitted to reject a crown thrust upon him by the
soldiery in an illegal tumult, or had been able to keep out of civil war. But the fact is, that a
great empire can neither be refused without danger, nor can be preserved without war. He
frequently sent for Martin, received him into the palace, and treated him with honor; his
whole speech with him was concerning things present, things to come, the glory of the
faithful, and the immortality of the saints; while, in the meantime, the queen hung upon
the lips of Martin, and not inferior to her mentioned in the Gospel, washed the feet of the
holy man with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Martin, though no woman
had hitherto touched him, could not escape her assiduity, or rather her servile attentions.
She did not think of the wealth of the kingdom, the dignity of the empire, the crown, or the
purple; only stretched upon the ground, she could not be torn away from the feet of Martin.
At last she begs of her husband (saying that both of them should constrain Martin to agree)
that all other attendants should be removed from the holy man, and that she alone should
wait upon him at meals. Nor could the blessed man refuse too obstinately. His modest entertainment
is got up by the hands of the queen; she herself arranges his seat for him; places
his table; furnishes him with water for his hands; and serves up the food which she had
herself cooked. While he was eating, she, with her eyes fixed on the ground, stood motionless
at a distance, after the fashion of servants, displaying in all points the modesty and humility
of a ministering servant. She herself mixed for him his drink and presented it. When the
meal was over, she collected the fragments and crumbs of the bread that had been used,
preferring with true faithfulness these remains to imperial banquets. Blessed woman! worthy,
by the display of so great piety, of being compared to her who came from the ends of the
earth to hear Solomon, if we merely regard the plain letter of the history. But the faith of
the two queens is to be compared (and let it be granted me to say this, setting aside the
majesty of the secret77 truth implied): the one obtained her desire to hear a wise man; the
other was thought worthy not only to hear a wise man, but to wait upon him.”</p>
<note type="footnote">76 Halm’s text is here followed. The older texts which read “vir omni vitæ merito prædicandus,” seem hardly
intelligible.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>To these sayings Postumianus replies: “While listening to you, O Gaul, I have for a long
time been admiring the faith of the queen; but to what does that statement of yours lead,
that no woman was ever said to have stood more close to Martin? For let us consider that
that queen not only stood near him, but even ministered unto him. I really fear lest those
persons who freely mingle among women should to some extent defend themselves by that
example.”</p>
<p>Then said the Gaul: “Why do you not notice, as grammarians are wont to teach us, the
place, the time, and the person? For only set before your eyes the picture of one kept in the
palace of the emperor importuned by prayers, constrained by the faith of the queen, and
bound by the necessities of the time, to do his utmost that he might set free those shut up
in prison, might restore those who had been sent into exile, and might recover goods that
had been taken away,—of how much importance do you think that these things should have
appeared to a bishop, so as to lead him, in order to the accomplishment of them all, to abate
not a little of the rigor of his general scheme of life? However, as you think that some will
make a bad use of the example thus furnished them, I shall only say that those will be truly
happy if they do not fall short of the excellence of the example in question. For let them
consider that the facts of the case are these: once in his life only, and that when in his seventieth
year, was Martin served and waited upon at his meals, not by a free sort of widow, nor
by a wanton virgin, but by a queen, who lived under the authority of a husband, and who
was supported in her conduct by the entreaties of her husband, that she might be allowed
so to act. It is further to be observed that she did not recline with Martin at the entertainment,
nor did she venture even to partake in the feast, but simply gave her services in waiting upon
him. Learn, therefore, the proper course; let a matron serve thee, and not rule thee; and let
her serve, but not recline along with thee; just as Martha, of whom we read, waited upon
the Lord without being called to partake in the feast: nay, she who chose rather simply to
hear the word was preferred to her that served. But in the case of Martin, the queen spoken
of fulfilled both parts: she both served like Martha and listened like Mary. If any one, then,
desires to make use of this example, let him keep to it in all particulars; let the cause be the
same, the person the same, the service the same, and the entertainment the same,—and let
the thing occur once only in one’s whole life.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>“Admirably,” exclaimed Postumianus, “does your speech bind those friends of ours
from going beyond the example of Martin; but I own to you my belief that these remarks
of yours will fall upon deaf ears. For if we were to follow the ways of Martin, we should
never need to defend ourselves in the case of kissing, and we should be free from all the reproaches
of sinister opinion. But as you are wont to say, when you are accused of being too
fond of eating, ‘We are Gauls,’ so we, for our part, who dwell in this district, will never be
reformed either by the example of Martin, or by your dissertations. But while we have been
discussing these points at so great length, why do you, Sulpitius, preserve such an obstinate
silence?”</p>
<p>“Well, for my part,” replied I, “I not only keep silence, but for a long time past I have
determined to be silent upon such points. For, because I rebuked a certain spruce gaddingabout
widow, who dressed expensively, and lived in a somewhat loose manner, and also a
virgin, who was following somewhat indecently a certain young man who was dear to
me,—although, to be sure, I had often heard her blaming others who acted in such a manner,—
I raised up against me such a degree of hatred on the part of all the women and all
the monks, that both bands entered upon sworn war against me. Wherefore, be quiet, I beg
of you, lest even what we are saying should tend to increase their animosity towards me.
Let us entirely blot out these people from our memory, and let us rather return to Martin.
Do thou, friend Gaul, as you have begun, carry out the work you have taken in hand.”</p>
<p>Then says he: “I have really related already so many things to you, that my speech ought
to have satisfied your desires; but, because I am not at liberty to refuse compliance with your
wishes, I shall continue to speak as long as the day lasts. For, in truth, when I glance at that
straw, which is being prepared for our beds, there comes into my mind a recollection respecting
the straw on which Martin had lain, that a miracle was wrought in connection with it.
The affair took place as follows. Claudiomagus is a village on the confines of the Bituriges
and the Turoni. The church there is celebrated for the piety of the saints, and is not less illustrious
for the multitude of the holy virgins. Well, Martin, being in the habit of passing
that way, had an apartment in the private part of the church. After he left, all the virgins
used to rush into that retirement: they kiss78 every place where the blessed man had either
sat or stood, and distribute among themselves the very straw on which he had lain. One of
them, a few days afterwards, took a part of the straw which she had collected for a blessing
to herself, and hung it from the neck of a possessed person, whom a spirit of error was
troubling. There was no delay; but sooner than one could speak the demon was cast out,
and the person was cured.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>“About the same time, a cow which a demon harassed met Martin as he was returning
from Treves. That cow, leaving its proper herd, was accustomed to attack human beings,
and had already seriously gored many with its horns. Now, when she was coming near us,
those who followed her from a distance began to warn us, with a loud voice, to beware of
her. But after she had in great fury come pretty near to us, with rage in her eyes, Martin,
lifting up his hand, ordered the animal to halt, and she immediately stood stock-still at his
word. Upon this, Martin perceived a demon sitting upon her back, and reproving it, he ex-
claimed, ‘Begone, thou deadly being; leave the innocent beast, and cease any longer to torment
it.’ The evil spirit obeyed and departed. And the heifer had sense enough to understand that
she was set free; for, peace being restored to her, she fell at the feet of the holy man; and on
Martin directing her, she made for her own herd, and, quieter than any sheep, she joined
the rest of the band. This also was the time at which he had no sensation of being burnt, although
placed in the midst of the flames; but I do not think it necessary for me to give an
account of this, because Sulpitius there, though passing over it in his book, has nevertheless
pretty fully narrated it in the epistle which he sent to Eusebius, who was then a presbyter,
and is now a bishop. I believe, Postumianus, you have either read this letter, or, if it is still
unknown to you, you may easily obtain it, when you please, from the bookcase. I shall simply
narrate particulars which he has omitted.</p>
<p>“Well, on a certain occasion, when he was going round the various parishes, we came
upon a band of huntsmen. The dogs were pursuing a hare, and the little animal was already
much exhausted by the long run it had had. When it perceived no means of escape in the
plains spreading far on every side, and was several times just on the point of being captured,
it tried to delay the threatened death by frequent doublings. Now the blessed man pitied
the danger of the creature with pious feelings, and commanded the dogs to give up following
it, and to permit it to get safe away. Instantly, at the first command they heard, they stood
quite still: one might have thought them bound, or rather arrested, so as to stand immovable
in their own footprints. In this way, through her pursuers being stopped as if tied together,
the hare got safe away.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>“Moreover, it will be worth while to relate also some of his familiar sayings, since they
were all salted with spiritual instruction. He happened to see a sheep79 that had recently
been sheared; and, ‘See,’ says he, ‘she has fulfilled the precept of the Gospel: she had two
coats, and one of them she has given to him who had none: thus, therefore, ye ought also
to do.’ Also, when he perceived a swineherd in a garment of skin, cold and, in fact, all but
naked, he exclaimed: ‘Look at Adam, cast out of Paradise, how he feeds his swine in a garment
of skin; but let us, laying aside that old Adam, who still remains in that man, rather put on
the new Adam.’ Oxen had, in one part, eaten up the grass of the meadows; pigs also had
dug up some portions of them with their snouts; while the remaining portion, which continued
uninjured, flourished, as if painted with variously tinted flowers. ‘That part,’ said he,
‘which has been eaten down by cattle, although it has not altogether lost the beauty of grass,
yet retains no grandeur of flowers, conveys to us a representation of marriage; that part,
again, which the pigs, unclean animals, had dug up, presents a loathsome picture of fornication;
while the remaining portion, which had sustained no injury, sets forth the glory of
virginity;—it flourishes with abundance of grass; the fruits of the field abound in it; and,
decked with flowers to the very extreme of beauty, it shines as if adorned with glittering
gems. Blessed is such beauty and worthy of God; for nothing is to be compared with virginity.
Thus, then, those who set marriage side by side with fornication grievously err; and those
who think that marriage is to be placed on an equal footing with virginity are utterly wretched
and foolish. But this distinction must be maintained by wise people, that marriage belongs
to those things which may be excused, while virginity points to glory, and fornication must
incur punishment unless its guilt is purged away through atonement.’</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>“A certain soldier had renounced the military80 life in the Church, having professed
himself a monk, and had erected a cell for himself at a distance in the desert, as if with the
purpose of leading the life of an eremite. But in course of time the crafty adversary harassed
his unspiritual81 nature with various thoughts, to the effect that, changing his mind, he
should express a desire that his wife, whom Martin had ordered to have a place in the nunnery82
of the young women, should rather dwell along with him. The courageous eremite,
therefore, visits Martin, and makes known to him what he had in his mind. But Martin
denied very strongly that a woman could, in inconsistent fashion, be joined again to a man
who was now a monk, and not a husband. At last, when the soldier was insisting on the
point in question; asserting that no evil would follow from carrying out his purpose; that
he simply desired to possess the solace of his wife’s company; and that there was no fear of
his again returning to his own pursuits; adding that he was a soldier of Christ, and that she
also had taken the oath of allegiance in the same service; and that the bishop therefore should
allow to serve as soldiers together people who were saints, and who, in virtue of their faith,
totally ignored the question of sex,—then Martin (I am going to repeat his very words to
you) exclaimed: ‘Tell me if you have ever been in war, and if you have ever stood in the line
of battle?’ In answer he said, ‘Frequently; I have often stood in line of battle, and been present
in war.’ On this Martin replies: ‘Well, then, tell me, did you ever in a line which was prepared
with arms for battle, or, having already advanced near, was fighting against a hostile army
with drawn sword—did you ever see any woman standing there, or fighting?’ Then at length
the soldier became confused and blushed, while he gave thanks that he had not been permitted
to follow his own evil counsel, and at the same time had not been put right by the use
of any harsh language, but by a true and rational analogy, connected with the person of a
soldier. Martin, for his part, turning to us (for a great crowd of brethren had surrounded
him), said: ‘Let not a woman enter the camp of men, but let the line of soldiers remain separate,
and let the females, dwelling in their own tent, be remote from that of men. For this
renders an army ridiculous, if a female crowd is mixed with the regiments of men. Let the
soldier occupy the line, let the soldier fight in the plain, but let the woman keep herself
within the protection of the walls. She, too, certainly has her own glory, if, when her husband
is absent, she maintains her chastity; and the first excellence, as well as completed victory
of that, is, that she should not be seen.’</p>

<p>“I believe, my dear Sulpitius, that you remember with what emphasis he extolled to us
(when you too were present) that virgin who had so completely withdrawn herself from the
eyes of all men, that she did not admit to her presence Martin himself, when he wished to
visit her in the discharge of duty. For when he was passing by the little property, within
which for several years she had chastely confined herself, having heard of her faith and excellence,
he turned out of his way that, as a bishop, he might honor, with pious respect, a
gift of such eminent merit. We who journeyed with him thought that that virgin would rejoice,
inasmuch as she was to obtain such a testimony to her virtue, while a priest of so great
reputation, departing from his usual rigor of conduct, paid her a visit. But she did not relax
those bonds of a most severe method of life, which she had imposed upon herself, even by
allowing herself to see Martin. And thus the blessed man, having received, through another
woman, her praiseworthy apology, joyfully departed from the doors of her who had not
permitted herself to be seen or saluted. O glorious virgin, who did not allow herself to be
looked upon even by Martin! O blessed Martin, who did not regard that repulse as being
any insult to himself, but, extolling with exultant heart her excellence, rejoiced in an example
only too rare in that locality! Well, when approaching night had compelled us to stay at no
great distance from her humble dwelling, that same virgin sent a present to the blessed man;
and Martin did what he had never done before (for he accepted a present or gift from
nobody), he refused none of those things which the estimable virgin had sent him, declaring
that her blessing was by no means to be rejected by a priest, since she was indeed to be placed
before many priests. Let, I beg, virgins listen to that example, so that they shall, if they desire
to close their doors to the wicked, even shut them against the good; and that the ill-disposed
may have no free access to them, they shall not fear even to exclude priests from their society.
Let the whole world listen attentively to this: a virgin did not permit herself to be looked
upon by Martin. And it was no common83 priest whom she repulsed, but the girl refused
to come under the eyes of a man whom it was the salvation of onlookers to behold. But what
priest, besides Martin, would not have regarded this as doing an injury to him? What irritation
and fury would he have conceived in his mind against that virgin? He would have
deemed her a heretic; and would have resolved that she should be laid under an anathema.
And how surely would such a man have preferred to that blessed soul those virgins who are
always throwing themselves in the way of the priest, who get up sumptuous entertainments,
and who recline at table with the rest! But whither is my speech carrying me? That somewhat
too free manner of speaking must be checked, lest perchance it may give offense to some;
for words of reproach will not profit the unfaithful, while the example quoted will be enough
for the faithful. At the same time, I wish so to extol the virtue of this virgin, as nevertheless

to think that no deduction is to be made from the excellence of those others, who often
came from remote regions for the purpose of seeing Martin, since indeed, with the same
object in view, even angels ofttimes visited the blessed man.</p>

<p>“But in what I am now about to narrate, I possess you, Sulpitius” (here he looked at me)
“as a fellow-witness. One day, I and Sulpitius there were watching before Martin’s door,
and had already sat in silence for several hours. We did so with deep reverence and awe, as
if we were carrying out a watch prescribed to us before the tent of an angel; while, all the
time, the door of his cell being closed, he did not know that we were there. Meanwhile, we
heard the sound of people conversing, and by and by we were filled with a kind of awe and
amazement, for we could not help perceiving that something divine was going on. After
nearly two hours, Martin comes out to us; and then our friend Sulpitius (for no one was
accustomed to speak to him more familiarly) began to entreat him to make known to us,
piously enquiring on the subject, what meant that sort of Divine awe which we confessed
we had both felt, and with whom he had been conversing in his cell. We added that, as we
stood before the door, we had undoubtedly heard a feeble sound of people talking, but had
scarcely understood it. Then he after a long delay (but there was really nothing which Sulpitius
could not extort from him even against his will: I am about to relate things somewhat
difficult of belief, but, as Christ is my witness, I lie not, unless any one is so impious as to
think that Martin himself lied) said: ‘I will tell you, but I beg you will not speak of it to any
one else. Agnes, Thecla, and Mary were there with me.’ He proceeded to describe to us the
face and general aspect of each. And he acknowledged that, not merely on that day, but
frequently, he received visits from them. Nor did he deny that Peter also and Paul, the
Apostles, were pretty frequently seen by him. Moreover, he was in the habit of rebuking the
demons by their special names, according as they severally came to him. He found Mercury
a cause of special annoyance, while he said that Jupiter was stupid and doltish. I am aware
that these things seemed incredible even to many who dwelt in the same monastery; and
far less can I expect that all who simply hear of them will believe them. For unless Martin
had lived such an inestimable life, and displayed such excellence, he would by no means be
regarded among us as having been endowed with so great glory. And yet it is not at all
wonderful that human infirmity doubted concerning the works of Martin, when we see that
many at the present day do not even believe the Gospels. But we have ourselves had personal
knowledge and experience, that angels often appeared and spoke familiarly with Martin.
As bearing upon this, I am to narrate a matter, of small importance indeed, but still I will
state it. A synod, composed of bishops, was held at Nemausus, and while he had refused to
attend it, he was nevertheless desirous of knowing what was done at it. It so happened that
our friend Sulpitius was then on board ship with him, but, as was his custom, he kept his
place at a distance from the rest, in a retired part of the vessel. There an angel announced
to him what had taken place in the synod. And when, afterwards, we carefully enquired into
the time at which the council was held, we found, beyond all doubt, that that was the very

<pb n="109"/>
day of the council, and that those things were there decreed by the bishops which the angel
had announced to Martin.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>“But when we questioned him concerning the end of the world, he said to us that Nero
and Antichrist have first to come; that Nero will rule in the Western portion of the world,
after having subdued ten kings; and that a persecution will be carried on by him, with the
view of compelling men to worship the idols of the Gentiles. He also said that Antichrist,
on the other hand, would first seize upon the empire of the East, having his seat and the
capital of his kingdom at Jerusalem; while both the city and the temple would be restored
by him. He added that his persecution would have for its object to compel men to deny
Christ as God, while he maintained rather that he himself was Christ, and ordered all men
to be circumcised, according to the law. He further said that Nero was to be destroyed by
Antichrist, and that the whole world, and all nations, were to be reduced under the power
of Antichrist, until that impious one should be overthrown by the coming of Christ. He told
us, too, that there was no doubt but that Antichrist, having been conceived by an evil spirit,
was already born, and had, by this time, reached the years of boyhood, while he would assume
power as soon as he reached the proper age. Now, this is the eighth year since we heard
these words from his lips: you may conjecture, then, how nearly about to happen are those
things which are feared in the future.”</p>
<p>As our friend the Gaul was emphatically speaking thus, and had not yet finished what
he intended to relate, a boy of the family entered with the announcement that the presbyter
Refrigerius was standing at the door. We began to doubt whether it would be better to hear
the Gaul further, or to go and welcome that man whom we so greatly loved, and who had
come to pay his respects to us, when our friend the Gaul remarked: “Even although this
most holy priest had not arrived, this talk of ours would have had to be cut short, for the
approach of night was itself urging us to finish the discourse which has been so far continued.
But inasmuch as all things bearing upon the excellences of Martin have by no means yet
been mentioned, let what you have heard suffice for to-day: to-morrow we shall proceed to
what remains.” This promise of our Gallic friend being equally acceptable to us all, we rose
up.</p>

<head>THE VIRTUES OF MARTIN CONTINUED.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">  
<pb n="112"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>“It is daylight, our Gallic friend, and you must get up. For, as you see, both Postumianus
is urgent, and this presbyter, who was yesterday admitted to hear what was going on, expects
that what you put off narrating with regard to our beloved Martin till to-day, you should
now, in fulfillment of your promise, proceed to tell. He is not, indeed, ignorant of all the
things which are to be related, but knowledge is sweet and pleasant even to one who goes
over again things already known to him; since, indeed, it has been so arranged by nature
that one rejoices with a better conscience in his knowledge of things which he is sure, through
the testimony borne to them by many, are not in any degree uncertain. For this man, too,
having been a follower of Martin from his early youth, has indeed been acquainted with all
his doings; but he gladly hears over again things already known. And I will confess to thee,
O Gaul, that the virtues of Martin have often been heard of by me, since, in fact, I have
committed to writing many things regarding him; but through the admiration I feel for his
deeds, those things are always new to me which, although I have already heard them, are,
over and over again, repeated concerning him. Wherefore, we congratulate you that Refrigerius
has been added to us as a hearer, all the84 more earnestly that Postumianus is manifesting
such eagerness, because he hastens, as it were, to convey a knowledge of these things
to the East, and is now to hear the truth from you confirmed, so to speak, by witnesses.”</p>
<p>As I was saying these words, and as the Gaul was now ready to resume his narrative,
there rushes in upon us a crowd of monks, Evagrius the presbyter, Aper, Sabbatius, Agricola;
and, a little after, there enters the presbyter Ætherius, with Calupio the deacon, and Amator
the subdeacon; lastly, Aurelius the presbyter, a very dear friend of mine, who came from a
longer distance, rushes up out of breath. “Why,” I enquire, “do you so suddenly and unexpectedly
run together to us from so many different quarters, and at so early an hour in the
morning?” “We,” they reply, “heard yesterday that your friend the Gaul spent the whole
day in narrating the virtues of Martin, and, as night overtook him, put off the rest until today:
wherefore, we have made haste to furnish him with a crowded audience, as he speaks
about such interesting matters.” In the meantime, we are informed that a multitude of lay
people are standing at the door, not venturing to enter, but begging, nevertheless, that they
might be admitted. Then Aper declares, “It is by no means proper that these people should
be mixed up with us, for they have come to hear, rather from curiosity than piety.” I was
grieved for the sake of those who ought not, as he thought, to be admitted, but all that I
could obtain, and with difficulty, was that they should admit Eucherius from among the
lieutenants,85 and Celsus, a man of consular rank, while the rest were kept back. We then
<note type="footnote">84 The original here is very obscure.</note>

place the Gaul in the middle seat; and he, after long keeping silence, in harmony with his
well-known modesty, at length began as follows.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">  
<pb n="114"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>“You have assembled, my pious and eloquent friends, to hear me; but, as I presume,
you have brought to the task religious rather than learned ears; for you are to listen to me
simply as a witness to the faith, and not as speaking with the fluency of an orator. Now, I
shall not repeat the things which were spoken yesterday: those who did not hear them can
become acquainted with them by means of the written records. Postumianus expects
something new, intending to make known what he hears to the East, that it may not, when
Martin is brought into comparison, esteem itself above the West. And first, my mind inclines
to set forth an incident respecting which Refrigerius has just whispered in my ear: the affair
took place in the city of Carnutes. A certain father of a family ventured to bring to Martin
his daughter of twelve years old, who had been dumb from her birth, begging that the blessed
man would loose, by his pious merits, her tongue, which was thus tied. He, giving way to
the bishops Valentinus and Victricius, who then happened to be by his side, declared that
he was unequal to so great an undertaking, but that nothing was impossible to them, as if
holier than himself. But they, adding their pious entreaties, with suppliant voices, to those
of the father, begged Martin to accomplish what was hoped for. He made no further
delay,—being admirable in both respects, in the display, first of all, of humility, and then in
not putting off a pious duty,—but orders the crowd of people standing round to be removed;
and while the bishops only, and the father of the girl, were present, he prostrates himself in
prayer, after his usual fashion. He then blesses a little oil, while he utters the formula of exorcism;
and holding the tongue of the girl with his fingers, he thus pours the consecrated
liquid into her mouth. Nor did the result of the power thus exerted disappoint the holy man.
He asks her the name of her father, and she instantly replied. The father cries out, embracing
the knees of Martin, with a mixture of joy and tears; and while all around are amazed, he
confesses that then for the first time he listened to the voice of his daughter. And that this
may not appear incredible to any one, let Evagrius, who is here, furnish you with a testimony
of its truth; for the thing took place in his very presence.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">  
<pb n="115"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>“The following is a small matter which I learned lately from the narration of Arpagius
the presbyter, but I do not think it ought to be passed over. The wife of the courtier Avitianus
had sent some oil to Martin, that he might bless it (such is the custom) so as to be ready
when needful to meet different causes of disease. It was contained in a glass jar of a shape
which, round throughout, gradually bulges86 out towards the middle, with a long neck; but
the hollow of the extended neck was not filled, because it is the custom to fill vessels of the
kind in such a way that the top may be left free for the knobs which stop up the jar. The
presbyter testified that he saw the oil increase under the blessing of Martin, so much that,
the abundance of it overflowing the jar, it ran down from the top in every direction. He
added that it bubbled up with the same87 effect, while the vessel was being carried back to
the mistress of the household; for the oil so steadily flowed over in the hands of the boy
carrying it, that the abundance of the liquid, thus pouring down, covered all his garment.
He said, moreover, that the lady received the vessel so full even to the brim, that (as the
same presbyter tells88 us at the present day) there was no room in that jar for inserting the
stopper by which people are accustomed to close those vessels, the contents of which are to
be preserved with special care. That, too, was a remarkable thing that happened to this man.”
Here he looked at me. “He had set down a glass vessel containing oil blessed by Martin in
a pretty high window; and a boy of the family, not knowing that a jar was there, drew towards
him the cloth covering it, with rather much violence. The vessel, in consequence, fell down
on the marble pavement. Upon this, all were filled with dread lest the blessing of God, bestowed
on the vessel by Martin, had been lost; but the jar was found as safe as ever, just as
if it had fallen on the softest feathers. Now, this result should be ascribed, not so much to
chance, as to the power of Martin, whose blessing could not possibly perish.</p>
<p>“There is this, too, which was effected by a certain person, whose name, because he is
present, and has forbidden it to be mentioned, shall be suppressed: Saturninus too, who is
now with us, was present on the occasion referred to. A dog was barking at us in a somewhat
disagreeable manner. ’ I command thee,’ said the person in question, ‘in the name of Martin,
to be quiet.’ The dog—his barking seemed to stick in his throat, and one might have thought
that his tongue had been cut out—was silent. Thus it is really a small matter that Martin
himself performed miracles: believe me that other people also have accomplished many
things in his name.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>“You knew the too barbarous and, beyond measure, bloody ferocity of Avitianus, a
former courtier. He enters the city of the Turones with a furious spirit, while rows of people,
laden with chains, followed him with melancholy looks, orders various kinds of punishments
to be got ready for slaying them; and to the grave amazement of the city, he arranges them
for the sad work on the following day. When this became known to Martin, he set out all
alone, a little before midnight, for the palace of that beast. But when, in the silence of the
depths of the night, and as all were at rest, no entrance was possible through the bolted
doors, he lays himself down before that cruel threshold. In the meantime, Avitianus, buried
in deep sleep, is smitten by an assailing angel, who says to him, ‘Does the servant of God lie
at your threshold, and do you continue sleeping?’ He, on listening to these words, rises, in
much disturbance, from his bed; and calling his servants, he exclaims in terror, ‘Martin is
at the door: go immediately, and undo the bolts, that the servant of God may suffer no harm.’
But they, in accordance with the tendency of all servants, having scarcely stepped beyond
the first threshold, and laughing at their master as having been mocked by a dream, affirm
that there was no one at the door. This they did as simply inferring from their own disposition,
that no one could be keeping watch through the night, while far less did they believe
that a priest was lying at the threshold of another man during the horror of that night. Well,
they easily persuaded Avitianus of the truth of their story. He again sinks into sleep; but,
being ere long struck with greater violence than before, he exclaimed that Martin was
standing at the door, and that, therefore, no rest either of mind or body was allowed him.
As the servants delayed, he himself went forward to the outer threshold; and there he found
Martin, as he had thought he would. The wretched man, struck by the display of so great
excellence, exclaimed, ‘Why, sir, have you done this to me? There is no need for you to
speak: I know what you wish: I see what you require: depart as quickly as possible, lest the
anger of heaven consume me on account of the injury done you: I have already suffered
sufficient punishment. Believe me, that I have firmly determined in my own mind how I
should now proceed.’ So then, after the departure of the holy man, he calls for his officials
and orders all the prisoners to be set free, while presently he himself went his way. Thus
Avitianus being put to flight, the city rejoiced, and felt at liberty.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">  
<pb n="117"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>“While these are certain facts, since Avitianus related them to many persons, they are
further confirmed on this ground that Refrigerius the presbyter, whom you see here present,
lately had them narrated to him, under an appeal to the Divine majesty, by Dagridus, a
faithful man among the tribunes, who swore that the account was given him by Avitianus
himself. But I do not wish you to wonder that I do to-day what I did not do yesterday; viz.
that I subjoin to the mention of every individual wonder the names of witnesses, and mention
persons to whom, if any one is inclined to disbelieve, he may have recourse, because they
are still in the body. The unbelief of very many has compelled that; for they are said to hesitate
about some things which were related yesterday. Let these people, then, accept as witnesses
persons who are still alive and well, and let them give more credit to such, inasmuch
as they doubt our good faith. But really, if they are so unbelieving, I give it as my opinion
that they will not believe even the witnesses named. And yet I am surprised that any one,
who has even the least sense of religion, can venture on such wickedness as to think that
any one could tell lies concerning Martin. Be that far from every one who lives in obedience
to God; for, indeed, Martin does not require to be defended by falsehoods. But, O Christ,
we lay the truth of our whole discourse before thee, to the effect that we neither have said,
nor will say, anything else than what either we ourselves have witnessed, or have learned
from undoubted authorities, and, indeed, very frequently from Martin himself. But although
we have adopted the form of a dialogue, in order that the style might be varied to prevent
weariness, still we affirm that we are really setting forth89 a true history in a dutiful spirit.
The unbelief of some has compelled me, to my great regret, to insert in my narrative these
remarks which are apart from the subject in hand. But let the discourse now return to our
assembly; in which since I saw that I was listened to so eagerly, I found it necessary to acknowledge
that Aper acted properly in keeping back the unbelieving, under the conviction
he had that those only ought to be allowed to hear who were of a believing spirit.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>“I am enraged in heart, believe me, and, through vexation, I seem to lose my senses: do
Christian men not believe in the miraculous powers of Martin, which the demons acknowledged?</p>
<p>“The monastery of the blessed man was at two miles’ distance from the city; but if, as
often as he was to come to the church, he only had set his foot outside the threshold of his
cell, one could perceive the possessed roaring through the whole church, and the bands of
guilty90 ones trembling as if their judge were coming, so that the groanings of the demons
announced the approach of the bishop to the clerics, who were not previously aware that
he was coming. I saw a certain man snatched up into the air on the approach of Martin, and
suspended there with his hands stretched upwards, so that he could in no way touch the
ground with his feet. But if at any time Martin undertook the duty of exorcising the demons,
he touched no one with his hands, and reproached no one in words, as a multitude of ex-
pressions is generally rolled forth by the clerics; but the possessed, being brought up to him,
he ordered all others to depart, and the doors being bolted, clothed in sackcloth and sprinkled
with ashes, he stretched himself on the ground in the midst of the church, and turned to
prayer. Then truly might one behold the wretched beings tortured with various results—some
hanging, as it were, from a cloud, with their feet turned upwards, and yet their garments
did not fall down over their faces, lest the part of their body which was exposed should give
rise to shame; while in another part of the church one could see them tortured without any
question being addressed to them, and confessing their crimes. They revealed their names,
too, of their own accord; one acknowledged that he was Jupiter, and another that he was
Mercury. Finally, one could see all the servants of the devil suffering agony, along with their
master, so that we could not help acknowledging that in Martin there was fulfilled that
which is written that ‘the saints shall judge angels.’</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>“There was a certain village in the country of the Senones which was every year annoyed
with hail. The inhabitants, constrained by an extreme of suffering, sought help from Martin.
A highly respectable embassy was sent to him by Auspicius, a man of the rank of prefect,
whose fields the storm had been wont to smite more severely than it did those of others.
But Martin, having there offered up prayer, so completely freed the whole district from the
prevailing plague, that for twenty years, in which he afterwards remained in the body, no
one in those places suffered from hail. And that this may not be thought to be accidental,
but rather effected by Martin, the tempest, returning afresh, once more fell upon the district
in the year in which he died. The world thus felt the departure of a believing man to such a
degree, that, as it justly rejoiced in his life, so it also bewailed his death. But if any hearer,
weak in faith, demands also witnesses to prove those things which we have said, I will bring
forward, not one man, but many thousands, and will even summon the whole region of the
Senones to bear witness to the power which was experienced. But not to speak of this, you,
presbyter Refrigerius, remember, I believe, that we lately had a conversation, concerning
the matter referred to, with Romulus, the son of that Auspicius I mentioned, an honored
and religious man. He related the points in question to us, as if they had not been previously
known; and as he was afraid of constant losses in future harvests, he did, as you yourself
beheld, regret, with much lamentation, that Martin was not preserved up to this time.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>“But to return to Avitianus: while at every other place, and in all other cities, he displayed
marks of horrible cruelty, at Tours alone he did no harm. Yes, that beast, which was nourished
by human blood, and by the slaughter of unfortunate creatures, showed himself meek and
peaceable in the presence of the blessed man. I remember that Martin one day came to him,
and having entered his private apartment, he saw a demon of marvelous size sitting behind
his back. Blowing upon him from a distance (if I may, as a matter of necessity, make use of
a word which is hardly Latin91, Avitianus thought that he was blowing at him, and exclaimed,
‘Why, thou holy man, dost thou treat me thus?’ But then Martin said, ‘It is not at you, but
at him who, in all his terribleness, leans over your neck.’ The devil gave way, and left his
familiar seat; and it is well known that, ever after that day, Avitianus was milder, whether
because he now understood that he had always been doing the will of the devil sitting by
him, or because the unclean spirit, driven from his seat by Martin, was deprived of the power
of attacking him; while the servant was ashamed of his master, and the master did not force
on his servant.</p>
<p>“In a village of the Ambatienses, that is in an old stronghold, which is now largely inhabited
by brethren, you know there is a great idol-temple built up with labor. The building
had been constructed of the most polished stones and furnished with turrets; and, rising on
high in the form of a cone, it preserved the superstition of the place by the majesty of the
work. The blessed man had often enjoined its destruction on Marcellus, who was there
settled as presbyter. Returning after the lapse of some time, he reproved the presbyter, because
the edifice of the idol-temple was still standing. He pleaded in excuse that such an immense
structure could with difficulty be thrown down by a band of soldiers, or by the strength of
a large body of the public, and far less should Martin think it easy for that to be effected by
means of weak clerics or helpless monks. Then Martin, having recourse to his well-known
auxiliaries, spent the whole night in watching and prayer—with the result that, in the
morning, a storm arose, and cast down even to its foundations the idol-temple. Now let this
narrative rest on the testimony of Marcellus.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>“I will make use of another not dissimilar marvel in a like kind of work, having the
concurrence of Refrigerius in doing so. Martin was prepared to throw down a pillar of immense
size, on the top of which an idol stood, but there was no means by which effect could
be given to his design. Well, according to his usual practice, he betakes himself to prayer.
It is undoubted that then a column, to a certain degree like the other, rushed down from
heaven, and falling upon the idol, it crushed to powder the whole of the seemingly indestructible
mass: this would have been a small matter, had he only in an invisible way made
use of the powers of heaven, but these very powers were beheld by human eyes serving
Martin in a visible manner.</p>
<p>“Again, the same Refrigerius is my witness that a woman, suffering from an issue of
blood, when she had touched the garment of Martin, after the example of the woman
mentioned in the Gospel, was cured in a moment of time.</p>
<p>“A serpent, cutting its way through a river, was swimming towards the bank on which
we had taken our stand. ‘In the name of the Lord,’ said Martin, ‘I command thee to return.’
Instantly, at the word of the holy man, the venomous beast turned round, and while we
looked on, swam across to the farther bank. As we all perceived that this had not happened
without a miracle; he groaned deeply, and exclaimed, ‘Serpents hear me, but men will not
hear.’</p>
</div>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>“Being accustomed to eat fish at the time of Easter, he enquired a little before the hour
for refreshment, whether it was in readiness. Then Cato, the deacon, to whom the outward
management of the monastery belonged, and who was himself a skillful fisher, tells him that
no capture had fallen to his lot the whole day, and that other fishers, who used to sell what
they caught, had also been able to do nothing. ‘Go,’ said he, ‘let down your line, and a capture
will follow.’ As Sulpitius there has already described, we had our dwelling close to the river.
We all went, then, as these were holidays, to see our friend fishing, with the hopes of all on
the stretch, that the efforts would not be in vain by which, under the advice of Martin himself,
it was sought to obtain fish for his use. At the first throw the deacon drew out, in a very
small net, an enormous pike, and ran joyfully back to the monastery, with the feeling undoubtedly
to which some poet gave utterance (for we use a learned verse, inasmuch as we
are conversing with learned people)—‘And brought his captive boar92 to wondering Argos.’</p>
<p>“Truly that disciple of Christ, imitating the miracles performed by the Saviour, and
which he, by way of example, set before the view of his saints, showed Christ also working
in him, who, glorifying his own holy follower everywhere, conferred upon that one man the
gifts of various graces. Arborius, of the imperial bodyguard, testifies that he saw the hand
of Martin as he was offering sacrifice, clothed, as it seemed, with the noblest gems, while it
glittered with a purple light; and that, when his right hand was moved, he heard the clash
of the gems, as they struck together.</p>
<note type="footnote">92 “captivum suem.” Probably there is here an allusion to the capture of the Erymanthian boar by Hercules,
with a punning reference to a secondary meaning of sus as a kind of fish.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>“I will now come to an event which he always concealed, owing to the character of the
times, but which he could not conceal from us. In the matter referred to, there is this of a
miraculous nature, that an angel conversed, face to face, with him. The Emperor Maximus,
while in other respects doubtless a good man, was led astray by the advices of some priests
after Priscillian had been put to death. He, therefore, protected by his royal power Ithacius
the bishop, who had been the accuser of Priscillian, and others of his confederates, whom
it is not necessary to name. The emperor thus prevented every one from bringing it as a
charge against Ithacius, that, by his instrumentality, a man of any sort had been condemned
to death. Now Martin, constrained to go to the court by many serious causes of people involved
in suffering, incurred the whole force of the storm which was there raging. The
bishops who had assembled at Treves were retained in that city, and daily communicating
with Ithacius, they had made common cause with him. When it was announced to them
expecting no such information, that Martin was coming, completely losing courage, they
began to mutter and tremble among themselves. And it so happened that already, under
their influence, the emperor had determined to send some tribunes armed with absolute
power into the two Spains, to search out heretics, and, when found, to deprive them of their
life or goods. Now there was no doubt that that tempest would also make havoc of multitudes
of the real saints, little distinction being made between the various classes of individuals.
For in such circumstances, a judgment was formed simply by appearances, so that one was
deemed a heretic rather on his turning pale from fear, or wearing a particular garment, than
by the faith which he professed. And the bishops were well aware that such proceedings
would by no means please Martin; but, conscious of evil as they were, this was a subject of
deep anxiety to them, lest when he came, he should keep from communion with them;
knowing well as they did, that others would not be wanting who, with his example to guide
them, would follow the bold course adopted by so great a man. They therefore form a plan
with the emperor, to this effect, that, officials of the court being sent on to meet him, Martin
should be forbidden to come any nearer to that city, unless he should declare that he would
maintain peace with the bishops who were living there. But he skillfully frustrated their
object, by declaring that he would come among them with the peace of Christ. And at last,
having entered during the night, he went to the church, simply for the purpose of prayer.
On the following day he betakes himself to the palace. Besides many other petitions which
he had to present, and which it would be tedious to describe, the following were the principal:
entreaties in behalf of the courtier Narses, and the president Leucadius, both of whom had
belonged to the party of Gratianus, and that, with more than ordinary zeal, upon which this
is not the time to dilate, and who had thus incurred the anger of the conqueror; but his chief
request was, that tribunes, with the power of life and death, should not be sent into the
Spains. For Martin felt a pious solicitude not only to save from danger the true Christians

<pb n="124"/>
in these regions, who were to be persecuted in connection with that expedition, but to protect
even heretics themselves. But on the first and second day the wily emperor kept the holy
man in suspense, whether that he might impress on him the importance of the affair, or
because, being obnoxious to the bishops, he could not be reconciled to them, or because,
as most people thought at the time, the emperor opposed his wishes from avarice, having
cast a longing eye on the property of the persons in question. For we are told that he was
really a man distinguished by many excellent actions, but that he was not successful in
contending against avarice. This may, however, have been due to the necessities of the empire
at the time, for the treasury of the state had been exhausted by former rulers; and he, being
almost constantly in the expectation of civil wars, or in a state of preparation for them, may
easily be excused for having, by all sorts of expedients, sought resources for the defense of
the empire.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, those bishops with whom Martin would not hold communion went
in terror to the king, complaining that they had been condemned beforehand; that it was
all over with them as respected the status of every one of them, if the authority of Martin
was now to uphold the pertinacity of Theognitus, who alone had as yet condemned them
by a sentence publicly pronounced; that the man ought not to have been received within
the walls; that he was now not merely the defender of heretics, but their vindicator; and that
nothing had really been accomplished by the death of Priscillian, if Martin were to act the
part of his avenger. Finally, prostrating themselves with weeping and lamentation, they
implored the emperor93 to put forth his power against this one man. And the emperor was
not far from being compelled to assign to Martin, too, the doom of heretics. But after all,
although he was disposed to look upon the bishops with too great favor, he was not ignorant
that Martin excelled all other mortals in faith, sanctity, and excellence: he therefore tries
another way of getting the better of the holy man. And first he sends for him privately, and
addresses him in the kindest fashion, assuring him that the heretics were condemned in the
regular course of public trials, rather than by the persecutions of the priests; and that there
was no reason why he should think that communion with Ithacius and the rest of that party
was a thing to be condemned. He added that Theognitus had created disunion, rather by
personal hatred, than by the cause he supported; and that, in fact, he was the only person
who, in the meantime, had separated himself from communion: while no innovation had
been made by the rest. He remarked further that a synod, held a few days previously, had
decreed that Ithacius was not chargeable with any fault. When Martin was but little impressed
by these statements, the king then became inflamed with anger, and hurried out of his
presence; while, without delay, executioners are appointed for those in whose behalf Martin
had made supplication.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>“When this became known to Martin, he rushed to the palace, though it was now night.
He pledges himself that, if these people were spared, he would communicate; only let the
tribunes, who had already been sent to the Spains for the destruction of the churches, be
recalled. There is no delay: Maximus grants all his requests. On the following day, the ordination
of Felix as bishop was being arranged, a man undoubtedly of great sanctity, and truly
worthy of being made a priest in happier times. Martin took part in the communion of that
day, judging it better to yield for the moment, than to disregard the safety of those over
whose heads a sword was hanging. Nevertheless, although the bishops strove to the uttermost
to get him to confirm the fact of his communicating by signing his name, he could not be
induced to do so. On the following day, hurrying away from that place, as he was on the
way returning, he was filled with mourning and lamentation that he had even for an hour
been mixed up with the evil communion, and, not far from a village named Andethanna,
where remote woods stretch94 far and wide with profound solitude, he sat down while his
companions went on a little before him. There he became involved in deep thought, alternately
accusing and defending the cause of his grief and conduct. Suddenly, an angel stood
by him and said, ‘Justly, O Martin, do you feel compunction, but you could not otherwise
get out of your difficulty. Renew your virtue, resume your courage, lest you not only now
expose your fame, but your very salvation, to danger.’ Therefore, from that time forward,
he carefully guarded against being mixed up in communion with the party of Ithacius. But
when it happened that he cured some of the possessed more slowly and with less grace than
usual, he at once confessed to us with tears that he felt a diminution of his power on account
of the evil of that communion in which he had taken part for a moment through necessity,
and not with a cordial spirit. He lived sixteen years after this, but never again did he attend
a synod, and kept carefully aloof from all assemblies of bishops.</p>

<p>“But clearly, as we experienced, he repaired, with manifold interest, his grace, which
had been diminished for a time. I saw afterwards a possessed person brought to him at the
gate95 of the monastery; and that, before the man touched the threshold, he was cured.</p>
<p>“I lately heard one testifying that, when he was sailing on the Tuscan Sea, following that
course which leads to Rome, whirlwinds having suddenly arisen, all on board were in extreme
peril of their lives. In these circumstances, a certain Egyptian merchant, who was not yet a
Christian, cried out, ‘Save us, O God of Martin,’ upon which the tempest was immediately
stilled, and they held their desired course, while the pacified ocean continued in perfect
tranquillity.</p>
<p>“Lycontius, a believing man belonging to the lieutenants, when a violent disease was
afflicting his family, and sick bodies were lying all through his house in sad proof of unheardof
calamity, implored the help of Martin by a letter. At this time the blessed man declared
that the thing asked was difficult to be obtained, for he knew in his spirit that that house
was then being scourged by Divine appointment. Yet he did not give up an unbroken course
of prayer and fasting for seven whole days and as many nights, so that he at last obtained
that which he aimed at in his supplications. Speedily, Lycontius, having experienced the
Divine kindness, flew to him, at once reporting the fact and giving thanks, that his house
had been delivered from all danger. He also offered a hundred pounds of silver, which the
blessed man neither rejected nor accepted; but before the amount of money touched the
threshold of the monastery, he had, without hesitation, destined it for the redemption of
captives. And when it was suggested to him by the brethren, that some portion of it should
be reserved for the expenses of the monastery, since it was difficult for all of them to obtain
necessary food, while many of them were sorely in need of clothing, he replied, ‘Let the
church both feed and clothe us, as long as we do not appear to have provided, in any way,
for our own wants.’</p>
<p>“There occur to my mind at this point many miracles of that illustrious man, which it
is more easy for us to admire than to narrate. You all doubtless recognize the truth of what
I say: there are many doings of his which cannot be set forth in words. For instance, there
is the following, which I rather think cannot be related by us just as it took place. A certain
one of the brethren (you are not ignorant of his name, but his person must be concealed,
lest we should cause shame to a godly man),—a certain one, I say, having found abundance
of coals for his stove, drew a stool to himself, and was sitting, with outspread legs and exposed
person, beside that fire, when Martin at once perceived that an improper thing was done
under the sacred roof, and cried out with a loud voice, ‘Who, by exposing his person, is
dishonoring our habitation?’ When our brother heard this, and felt from his own conscience,
<note type="footnote">95 “Pseudothyrum”: Halm prefers the form “pseudoforum,” but the meaning is the same.</note>

<pb n="128"/>
that it was he who was rebuked, he immediately ran to us almost in a fainting condition,
and acknowledged his shame; which was done, however, only through the forth-putting of
the power of Martin.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">  
<pb n="129"/>
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p>“Again, on a certain day, after he had sat down on that wooden seat of his (which you
all know), placed in the small open court which surrounded his abode, he perceived two
demons sitting on the lofty rock which overhangs the monastery. He then heard them, in
eager and gladsome tones, utter the following invitation, ‘Come hither, Brictio, come hither,
Brictio.’ I believe they perceived the miserable man approaching from a distance, being
conscious how great frenzy of spirit they had excited within him. Nor is there any delay:
Brictio rushes in in absolute fury; and there, full of madness, he vomits forth a thousand
reproaches against Martin. For he had been reproved by him on the previous day, because
he who had possessed nothing before he entered the clerical office, having, in fact, been
brought up in the monastery by Martin himself, was now keeping horses and purchasing
slaves. For at that time, he was accused by many of not only having bought boys belonging
to barbarous nations, but girls also of a comely appearance. The miserable man, moved with
bitter rage on account of these things, and, as I believe, chiefly instigated by the impulse
received from those demons, made such an onset upon Martin as scarcely to refrain from
laying hands upon him. The holy man, on his part, with a placid countenance and a tranquil
mind, endeavored by gentle words to restrain the madness of the unhappy wretch. But the
spirit of wickedness so prevailed within him, that not even his own mind, at best a very vain
one, was under his control. With trembling lips, and a changing countenance, pale with
rage, he rolled forth the words of sin, asserting that he was a holier man than Martin who
had brought him up, inasmuch as from his earliest years he had grown up in the monastery
amid the sacred institutions of the Church, while Martin had at first, as he could not deny,
been tarnished with the life of a soldier, and had now entirely sunk into dotage by means
of his baseless superstitions, and ridiculous fancies about visions. After he had uttered many
things like these, and others of a still more bitter nature, which it is better not to mention,
going out, at length, when his rage was satisfied he seemed to feel as if he had completely
vindicated his conduct. But with rapid steps he rushed back by the way he had gone out,
the demons having, I believe, been, in the meantime, driven from his heart by the prayers
of Martin, and he was now brought back to repentance. Speedily, then, he returns, and
throws himself at the feet of Martin, begging for pardon and confessing his error, while, at
length restored to a better mind, he acknowledges that he had been under the influence of
a demon. It was no difficult business for Martin to forgive the suppliant. And then the holy
man explained both to him and to us all, how he had seen him driven on by demons, and
declared that he was not moved by the reproaches which had been heaped upon him; for
they had, in fact, rather injured the man who uttered them. And subsequently, when this
same Brictio was often accused before him of many and great crimes, Martin could not be
induced to remove him from the presbyterate, lest he should be suspected of revenging the

<pb n="130"/>
injury done to himself, while he often repeated this saying: ‘If Christ bore with Judas, why
should not I bear with Brictio?’”</p>

<p>Upon this, Postumianus exclaims, “Let that well-known man in our immediate neighborhood,
listen to that example, who, when he is wise, takes no notice either of things present
or future, but if he has been offended, falls into utter fury, having no control over himself.
He then rages against the clerics, and makes bitter attacks upon the laity, while he stirs up
the whole world for his own revenge. He will continue in this state of contention for three
years without intermission, and refuse to be mollified either by time or reason. The condition
of the man is to be lamented and pitied, even if this were the only incurable evil by which
he is afflicted. But you ought, my Gallic friend, to have frequently recalled to his mind such
examples of patience and tranquillity, that he might know both how to be angry and how
to forgive. And if he happens to hear of this speech of mine which has been briefly interpolated
into our discourse, and. directed against himself, let him know that I spoke, not more
with the lips of an enemy than the mind of a friend; because I should wish, if the thing were
possible, that he should be spoken of rather as being like the bishop Martin, than the tyrant
Phalaris. But let us pass away from him, since the mention of him is far from pleasant, and
let us return, O Gaul, to our friend Martin.”</p>

<p>Then said I, since I perceived by the setting sun that evening was at hand: “The day is
gone, Postumianus; we must rise up; and at the same time some refreshment is due to these
so zealous listeners. And as to Martin, you ought not to expect that there is any limit to one
talking about him: he extends too far to be comprised fully in any conversation. In the
meantime, you will convey to the East the things you have now heard about that famous
man; and as you retrace your steps to your former haunts, and pass along by various coasts,
places, harbors, islands, and seas, see that you spread among the peoples the name and glory
of Martin. Especially remember that you do not omit Campania; and although your route
will take you far off the beaten track, still any expenditure from delay will not be to you of
so much importance as to keep you from visiting in that quarter Paulinus, a man renowned
and praised throughout the whole world. I beg you first to unroll to him the volume of discourse
which we either completed yesterday, or have said to-day. You will relate all to him;
you will repeat all to him; that in due time, by his means, Rome may learn the sacred merits
of this man, just as he spread that first little book of ours not only through Italy, but even
through the whole of Illyria. He, not jealous of the glories of Martin, and being a most pious
admirer of his saintly excellences in Christ, will not refuse to compare our leading man with
his own friend Felix. Next, if you happen to cross over to Africa, you will relate what you
have heard to Carthage; and, although, as you yourself have said, it already knows the man,
yet now pre-eminently it will learn more respecting him, that it may not admire its own
martyr Cyprian alone, although consecrated by his sacred blood. And then, if carried down
a little to the left, you enter the gulf of Achaia, let Corinth know, and let Athens know, that
Plato in the academy was not wiser, and that Socrates in the prison was not braver, than
Martin. You will say to them that Greece was indeed happy which was thought worthy to
listen to an apostle pleading, but that Christ has by no means forsaken Gaul, since he has
granted it to possess such a man as Martin. But when you have come as far as Egypt, although
it is justly proud of the numbers and virtues of its own saints, yet let it not disdain to hear
how Europe will not yield to it, or to all Asia, in having only Martin.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>“But when you have again set sail from that place with the view of making for Jerusalem,
I enjoin upon you a duty connected with our grief, that, if you ever come to the shore of
renowned Ptolemais, you enquire most carefully where Pomponius, that friend of ours, is
buried, and that you do not refuse to visit his remains on that foreign soil. There shed many
tears, as much from the working of your own feelings, as from our tender affection; and although
it is but a worthless gift, scatter the ground there with purple flowers and sweetsmelling
grass. And you will say to him, but not roughly, and not harshly,—with the address
of one who sympathizes, and not with the tone of one who reproaches,—that if he had only
been willing to listen to you at one time, or to me constantly, and if he had invited Martin
rather than that man whom I am unwilling to name, he would never have been so cruelly
separated from me, or covered by a heap of unknown dust, having suffered death in the
midst of the sea with the lot of a ship-wrecked pirate, and with difficulty securing burial on
a far-distant shore. Let those behold this as their own work, who, in seeking to revenge him,
have wished to injure me, let them behold their own glory, and being avenged, let them
henceforth cease to make any attacks upon me.”</p>
<p>Having uttered these sad words in a very mournful voice, and while the tears of all the
others were drawn forth by our laments, we at length departed, certainly with a profound
admiration for Martin, but with no less sorrow from our own lamentations.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="136"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>On reading your letters, my feelings were, in many ways, deeply moved, and I could
not refrain from tears. For I both wept for joy because I could perceive from the very language
of your letters, that you were living according to the precepts of the Lord God, and out of
my exceeding desire after you, I could not help lamenting that, without any fault on my
part, I was parted from you; and I would have felt this still more strongly had you not sent
me a letter. Should I not, then, enjoy the company of such a sister? But I call your salvation
to witness, that I have very often wished to come to you, but have up till now been prevented,
through the opposition of him96 who is accustomed to hinder us. For, in my eager desire,
I was both urgent to satisfy my wishes by seeing you; and we seemed, if we should meet,
likely to accomplish more effectually the work of the Lord, since by comforting one another
we should live with the heavy load of this world trodden under our feet. But I do not now
fix the day or time of visiting you, because, as often as I have done so, I have not been able
to fulfil my purpose. I shall wait on the will of the Lord, and hope that, by my supplications
and your prayers, he may bring it about that we reap some advantage from our perseverance.97</p>
<note type="footnote">96 It is obvious that, in this whole passage, Sulpitius has in his mind the language of St. Paul, Rom. i. 9–12.</note>

<p>But because you have desired from me in all my letters which I had sent to you precepts
to nourish your life and faith, it has come to pass that, through the frequency of my writings
to you, I have now exhausted language of that kind; and I can really write nothing new to
you, so as to avoid what I have written before. And in truth, through the goodness of God,
you do not now need to be exhorted, inasmuch as, perfecting your faith at the very beginning
of your saintly life, you display a devoted love in Christ. One thing, however, I do press
upon you, that you do not go back on things you have already passed away from, that you
do not long again for things you have already scorned, and that, having put your hand to
the plow, you do not look back98 again, retracing your steps; for, undoubtedly, by falling
into this fault, your furrow will lose its straightness, and the cultivator will not receive his
own proper reward. Moreover, he does not secure even a measure of the reward, if he has,
in a measure, failed. For, as we must flee from sin to righteousness, so he who has entered
on the practice of righteousness must beware lest he lay himself open to sin. For it is written
that “his righteousness shall not profit the righteous on the day on which he has gone
astray.”99 For this, then, we must take our stand, for this we must labor, that we, who have
escaped from sins, do not lose the prepared rewards. For the enemy stands ready against
us, that he may at once strike the man who has been stripped of the shield of faith. Our
shield, therefore, is not to be cast aside, lest our side be exposed to attack; and our sword is
not to be put away, lest the enemy then begin to give up all fear: moreover, we know that if
he sees a man fully armed, he will retreat. Nor are we ignorant that it is a hard and difficult
thing daily to fight against the flesh and the world. But if you reflect upon eternity, and if
you consider the kingdom of heaven, which undoubtedly the Lord will condescend to bestow
upon us although we are sinners, what suffering, I ask, is sufficiently great, by which we
may merit such things? And besides, our struggle in this world is but for a short time; for
although death do not speedily overtake us, old age will come. The years flow on, and time
glides by; while, as I hope, the Lord Jesus will speedily call us to himself, as being dear to his
heart.</p>

<p>O how happy shall be that departure of ours, when Christ shall receive us into his own
abode after we have been purged100 from the stains of sin through the experience101 of a
better life! Martyrs and prophets will meet with us, apostles will join themselves to us, angels
will be glad, archangels will rejoice, and Satan, being conquered, will look pale, though still
retaining his cruel countenance, inasmuch as he will lose all102 advantage from our sins
which he had secured for himself in us. He will see glory granted us through mercy, and
merits honored by means of glory. We shall triumph over our conquered foe. Where shall
now the wise men of the world appear? Where shall the covetous man, where shall the
adulterer, where shall the irreligious, where shall the drunkard, where shall the evil-speaker
be recognized? What shall these wretched beings say in their own defense? “We did not
know thee, Lord; we did not see that thou wast in the world: thou didst not send the
prophets: thou didst not give the law to the world: we did not see the patriarchs: we did not
read the lives of the saints. Thy Christ never was upon the earth: Peter was silent: Paul refused
to preach: no Evangelist taught. There were no martyrs whose example we should follow:
no one predicted thy future judgment: no one commanded us to clothe the poor: no one
enjoined us to restrain lust: no one persuaded us to fight against covetousness: we fell through
ignorance, not knowing what we did.”</p>
<note type="footnote">100 Clericus here remarks that “these words clearly teach us that Severus knew of no other purgation than
that by which we are cleansed in this life from sin by a change of character and which change if we steadily
maintain, then, when life is ended, we are received into the abode of Christ, without any dread of the fire of purgatory.”</note>

<p>Against these, from among the company of the saints, righteous Noah shall first proclaim,
“I, Lord, predicted that a deluge was about to come on account of the sins of men, and after
the deluge I set an example to the good in my own person; since I did not perish with the
wicked who perished, that they might know both what was the salvation of the innocent,
and what the punishment of sinners.” After him, faithful Abraham will say in opposition
to them, “I, Lord, about the mid-time103 of the age of the world, laid the foundation of the
faith by which the human race should believe in thee; I was chosen as the father of the nations,
that they might follow my example; I did not hesitate, Lord, to offer Isaac, while yet a youth,
as a sacrifice to thee, that they might understand that there is nothing which ought not to
be presented to the Lord, when they perceived that I did not spare even my only son: I left,
Lord, my country, and my family, at thy command, that they also might have an example
teaching them to leave the wickedness of the world and the age: I, Lord, was the first to recognize
thee, though under a corporeal104 form, nor did I hesitate to believe who it was that
I beheld, although thou didst appear to me in a different form from thine own, that these
might learn to judge, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.” Him the blessed
Moses will support in his pleadings, saying: “I Lord, delivered the law to all these, at thy
command, that those whom a free105 faith did not influence, the spoken law at least might
restrain: I said, ‘Thou shalt not106 commit adultery,’ in order that I might prevent the licentiousness
of fornication: I said, ‘Thou shalt love107 thy neighbor,’ that affection might
abound; I said, ‘Thou shalt worship the Lord alone,’108 in order that these might not sacrifice
to idols, or allow temples to exist; I commanded that false witness should not be spoken,
that I might shut the lips of these people against all falsehood. I set forth the things which
had been done and said from the beginning of the world, through the working within me
of the spirit of thy power, that a knowledge of things past might convey to these people instruction
about things to come. I predicted, O Lord Jesus, thy coming, that it might not be
an unexpected thing to these people, when they were called to acknowledge him whom I
had before announced as about to come.”109</p>
<note type="footnote">103 Abraham lived (in round numbers) about 2000 years b.c., and assuming the beginning of the world to
have been about 4000 years b.c., he may thus be said to have lived about “the mid-time.” The note of Clericus

<p>After him, there will stand up David worthy of his descendant the Lord, and declare:
“I, Lord, proclaimed thee by every means; I set forth that only thy name was to be worshiped;
I said, ‘Blessed is the man110 who fears the Lord’; I said too, ‘The saints shall111 be joyful in
glory’; and I said, ‘The desire of the wicked112 shall perish,’ that these people might acknowledge
thee and cease to sin. I, when I had become possessed of royal power, clothed in
sackcloth, with dust spread beneath me, and with the emblems of my greatness laid aside,
lay down in my clothes, that an example might be given to these people of gentleness and
humility. I spared my enemies who desired to slay me, that these people might approve of
my mercifulness, as worthy of being imitated.” After him, Isaiah, who was worthy of the
Spirit of God, will not be silent; but will say: “I, Lord, whilst thou wast speaking through my
mouth, gave this warning,—‘Woe to those113 who join house to house,’ that I might set a
limit to covetousness. I bore witness that thine anger came upon the wicked, that at any rate
fear of punishment, if not hope of reward, might keep back these people from their evil​ deeds.”</p>

<p>After these, and several others who have discharged for us the duties of instruction, the
Son of God himself will speak thus: “I, certainly, exalted on a lofty seat, holding heaven in
my hand, and the earth in my fist, extended within and without, in the inside of all things
which are produced, and on the outside of all114 things that move, inconceivable, infinite
in the power115 of nature, invisible to sight, inaccessible to touch, in order that I might exist
as the least of you (for the purpose of subduing the hardness of your heart and for softening
your faithlessness by sound doctrines), condescended to be born in flesh, and, having laid
aside the glory of God, I assumed the form of a servant, so that, sharing with you in bodily
infirmity, I might in turn bring you to a participation in my glory, through obedience to
the precept of salvation. I restored health to the sick and infirm, hearing to the deaf, sight
to the blind, the power of speech to the dumb, and the use of their feet to the lame; that I
might influence you, by heavenly signs, all the more easily to believe in me, and in those
things which I had announced, I promised you the kingdom of heaven; I also, in order that
you might have an example of escape from punishment, placed in Paradise the robber who
acknowledged me almost at the moment of his death, that ye might follow even the faith of
him who had been thought worthy of having his sins forgiven him. And that by my example
in your behalf, ye yourselves also might be able to suffer; I suffered for you, that no man
might hesitate to suffer for himself what God116 had endured for man. I showed myself
after my resurrection, in order that your faith might not be overthrown. I admonished the
Jews in the person of Peter; I preached to the Gentiles in the person of Paul; and I do not
regret doing so, for good results followed. The good have understood my work; the faithful
have perfected it; the righteous have completed it; the merciful have consummated it: there
have been a large number of martyrs, and a large number of saints. Those to whom I thus
refer were undoubtedly in the same body and in the same world as you. Why, then, do I
find no good work in you, ye descendants of vipers? Ye have shown no repentance for your
wicked deeds, even at the very end of your earthly course. And what does it profit that ye
honor me with your lips, when you deny me by your deeds and works? Where are now your
riches, where your honors, where your powers, and where your pleasures? I pronounce no
new sentence over you: you simply incur the judgment which I formerly predicted.”</p>

<p>Then will the Evangelist repeat this to the wretched beings, “Go ye117 into outer darkness,
where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” O ye miserable men, whom these words do
not now impress! They shall then see their own punishment, and the glory of others. Let
them use this present world, provided they do not enjoy that eternity which is prepared for
the saints. Let them abound in riches: let them rest on gold; provided that there they be
found needy and destitute. Let them be wealthy in this world, provided they be poor in
eternity, for it is written regarding them, “The rich were in118 want, and suffered hunger.”
But the Scripture has added what follows respecting the good,—“but those who seek the
Lord shall not want any good thing.”</p>
<p>Therefore, my sister, although those people mock at us, and although they call us foolish
and unhappy, let us all the more joyfully exult in such reproaches, by which glory is heaped
up for us, and punishment for them. And do not let us laugh at their folly, but rather grieve
over their unhappiness; because there is among them a large number of our own people,
whom if we win over, our glory shall be increased. But however they may conduct themselves,
let them be to us as Gentiles and publicans; but let us keep ourselves safe and sound. If they
rejoice now over us lamenting, it will be our turn afterwards to rejoice over their suffering.
Farewell, dearest sister, and tenderly beloved in Christ.</p>

<head>A LETTER OF SULPITIUS SEVERUS TO HIS SISTER CLAUDIA CONCERNING
VIRGINITY.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="144"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>How great blessedness, among heavenly gifts, belongs to holy virginity, besides the
testimonies of the Scriptures, we learn also from the practice of the Church, by which we
are taught that a peculiar merit belongs to those who have devoted themselves to it by special
consecration. For while the whole multitude of those that believe receive equal gifts of grace,
and all rejoice in the same blessings of the sacraments, those who are virgins possess something
above the rest, since, out of the holy and unstained company of the Church, they are
chosen by the Holy Spirit, and are presented by the bishop119 at the altar of God, as if being
more holy and pure sacrifices, on account of the merits of their voluntary dedication. This
is truly a sacrifice worthy of God, inasmuch as it is the offering of so precious a being, and
none will please him more than the sacrifice of his own image. For I think that the Apostle
especially referred to a sacrifice of this kind, when he said, “Now, I beseech you, brethren,
by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable120
to God.” Virginity, therefore, possesses both that which others have, and that which others
have not; while it obtains both common and special grace, and rejoices (so to speak) in its
own peculiar privilege of consecration. For ecclesiastical authority permits us to style virgins
also the brides of Christ; while, after the manner of brides, it veils those whom it consecrates
to the Lord, openly exhibiting those as very especially about to possess spiritual marriage
who have fled away from carnal fellowship. And those are worthily united, after a spiritual
manner, to God, in accordance with the analogy of marriage, who, from love to him, have
set at nought human alliances. In their case, that saying of the apostle finds its fullest possible
fulfillment, “He who is joined to the Lord,121 is one spirit.”</p>

<p>For it is a great and a divine thing, almost beyond a corporeal nature, to lay aside122
luxury, and to extinguish, by strength of mind, the flame of concupiscence, kindled by the
torch of youth; to put down by spiritual effort the force of natural delight; to live in opposition
to the practice of the human race; to despise the comforts of wedlock; to disdain the sweet
enjoyments derived from children; and to regard as nothing, in the hope of future blessedness,
everything that is reckoned among the advantages of this present life. This is, as I have said,
a great and admirable virtue, and is not undeservedly destined to a vast reward, in proportion
to the greatness of its labor. The Scripture says, “I will give to the eunuchs, saith the Lord,
a place in my house and within my walls, a place counted better than123 sons and daughters;
I will give them an eternal name, and it shall not124 fail.” The Lord again speaks concerning
such eunuchs in the Gospel, saying, “For there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.”125 Great, indeed, is the struggle connected with
chastity, but greater is the reward; the restraint is temporal, but the reward will be eternal.
For the blessed Apostle John also speaks concerning these, saying that “they follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth.”126 This, I think, is to be understood to the following effect, that
there will be no place in the court of heaven closed against them, but that all the habitations
of the divine mansions will be thrown open before them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>But that the merit of virginity may shine forth more clearly, and that there may be a
better understanding as to how worthy it is of God, let this be considered, that the Lord
God, our Saviour, when, for the salvation of the human race, he condescended to assume
mankind, chose no other than a virgin’s womb, that he might show how virtue of this kind
especially pleased him; and that he might point out the blessedness of chastity to both sexes,
he had a virgin mother, while he himself was ever to remain in a like condition. He thus
furnished in his own person to men, and in the person of his mother to women, an example
of virginity, by which it might be proved, with respect to both sexes, that the blessed state
of purity possessed the fullness of divinity,127 for whatever dwelt in the Son was also wholly
in the mother. But why should I take pains to make known the excellent and surpassing
merit of chastity, and to set forth the glorious good of virginity, when I am not ignorant
that many have discoursed on this subject, and have proved its blessedness by most conclusive
reasons, and since it can never be a matter of doubt to any reflecting mind, that a thing has
all the more merit, the more difficult it is of accomplishment? For if any one judges chastity
to be of no moment or only of small consequence, it is certain that he is either ignorant of
the matter, or is not willing to incur the trouble it implies. Hence it comes to pass that those
always derogate from the importance of chastity, who either do not possess it, or who are
unwillingly compelled to maintain it.</p>
<note type="footnote">127 The text is here most uncertain; that adopted by Halm seems unintelligible.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
<pb n="147"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>Now, therefore, since we have set forth, although in few words, both the difficulty and
the merit of purity, great care must be taken lest a matter which in itself implies great virtue,
and is also destined to a vast reward, should fail to produce its proper fruits. For the more
precious every sort of thing is, the more it is guarded with anxious solicitude. And since
there are many things which fail to secure their proper excellence, unless they are assisted
by the aid of other things, as is, for instance, the case with honey, which, unless it is preserved
by the protection of wax, and by the cells of the honeycombs, and is indeed, to state the
matter more truly, sustained by these, loses its deliciousness and cannot exist apart by itself;
and again as it is with wine, which, unless it be kept in vessels of a pleasant odor, and with
the pitch frequently renewed, loses the power of its natural sweetness; so great care must be
taken lest perchance some things may be necessary also to virginity, without which it can
by no means produce its proper fruits, and thus a matter of so great difficulty may be of no
advantage (while all the time it is believed to be of advantage), because it is possessed without
the other necessary adjuncts. For unless I am mistaken, chastity is preserved in its entirety,
for the sake of the reward to be obtained in the kingdom of heaven, which it is perfectly
certain no one can obtain who does128 not deserve eternal life. But that eternal life cannot
be merited except by the keeping of all the divine commandments, the Scripture testifies,
saying, “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”129 Therefore no one has that
life, except the man who has kept all the precepts of the law, and he who has not such life
cannot be a possessor of the kingdom of heaven, in which it is not the dead, but the living
who shall reign. Therefore virginity, which hopes for the glory of the kingdom of heaven,
will profit nothing by itself, unless it also possess that to which eternal life is promised, by
means of which the reward of the kingdom of heaven is possessed. Above all things, therefore,
the commandments which have been enjoined upon us must be kept by those who preserve
chastity in its entireness, and who are hoping for its reward from the justice of God, lest
otherwise the pains taken to maintain a glorious chastity and continence come to nothing.
No one acquainted with the law does not know that virginity is above130 the commandment
or precept, as the Apostle says, “Now, as to virgins, I have no precept of the Lord, but I give
my advice.”131 When, therefore, he simply gives advice about maintaining virginity, and
lays down no precept, he acknowledges that it is above the commandment. Those, therefore,
who preserve virginity, do more than the commandment requires. But it will then only

profit you to have done more than was commanded, if you also do that which is commanded.
For how can you boast that you have done more, if, in respect to some point, you do less?
Desiring to fulfill the Divine counsel, see that, above all things, you keep the commandment:
wishing to attain to the reward of virginity, see that you keep fast hold of what is necessary
to merit life, that your chastity may be such as can receive a recompense. For as the observance
of the commandments ensures life, so, on the other hand, does the violation give rise
to death. And he who through disobedience has been doomed to death cannot hope for the
crown pertaining to virginity; nor, when really handed over to punishment, can he expect
the reward promised to chastity.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
<pb n="149"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>Now, there are three kinds of virtue, by means of which the possession of the kingdom
of heaven is secured. The first is chastity, the second, contempt of the world, and the third,
righteousness, which, as when joined together, they very greatly benefit their possessors,
so, when separated, they can hardly be of any advantage, since every one of them is required,
not for its own sake only, but for the sake of another. First of all, then, chastity is demanded,
that contempt of the world may more easily follow, because the world can be more easily
despised by those who are not held fast in the bonds of matrimony. Contempt of the world,
again, is required, in order that righteousness may be maintained, which those can with
difficulty fully preserve who are involved in desires after worldly advantages, and in the
pursuit of mundane pleasures. Whosoever, therefore, possesses the first kind of virtue,
chastity, but does not, at the same time, have the second, which is contempt of the world,
possesses the first almost to no purpose, since he does not have the second, for the sake of
which the first was required. And if any one possesses the first and second, but is destitute
of the third which is righteousness, he labors in vain, since the former two are principally
required for the sake of the third. For what profits it to possess chastity in order to contempt
of the world, and yet not to have that on account of which you have the other? Or why
should you despise the things of the world, if you do not observe righteousness, for the sake
of which it is fitting that you should possess chastity, as well as contempt for the world? For
as the first kind of virtue is on account of the second, and the second on account of the third,
so the first and the second are on account of the third; and if it does not exist, neither the
first nor the second will prove of any advantage.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="150"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>But you perhaps say here, “Teach me, then, what righteousness is, so that knowing it,
I may be able more easily to fully practice it.” Well, I shall briefly explain it to you, as I am
able, and shall use the simplicity of common words, seeing that the subject of which we treat
is such as ought by no means to be obscured by attempts at eloquent description, but should
be opened up by the simplest forms of expression. For a matter which is necessary to all in
common ought to be set forth in a common sort of speech. Righteousness, then, is nothing
else than not to commit sin; and not to commit sin is just to keep the precepts of the law.
Now, the observance of these precepts is maintained in a two-fold way—thus, that one do
none of those things which are forbidden, and that he strive to fulfill the things which are
commanded. This is the meaning of the following statement: “Depart from evil, and do132
good.” For I do not wish you to think that righteousness consists simply in not doing evil,
since not to do good is also evil, and a transgression of the law takes place in both, since he
who said, “Depart from evil” said also, “and do good.” If you depart from evil, and do not
do good, you are a transgressor of the law, which is fulfilled, not simply by abhorring all evil
deeds, but also by the performance of good works. For, indeed, you have not merely received
this commandment, that you should not deprive one who is clothed of his garments, but
that you should cover with your own the man who has been deprived of his; nor that you
should not take away bread of his own from one who has it, but that you should willingly
impart of your bread to him who has none; nor that you should not simply not drive away
a poor man from a shelter of his own, but that you should receive him when he has been
driven out, and has no shelter, into your own. For the precept which has been given us is
“to weep with them that133 weep.” But how can we weep with them, if we share in none of
their necessities, and afford no help to them in those matters on account of which they
lament? For God does not call for the fruitless moisture of our tears; but, because tears are
an indication of grief, he wishes you to feel the distresses of another as if they were your
own. And just as you would wish aid to be given you if you were in such tribulation, so
should you help another in accordance with the statement, “Whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so134 to them.” For to weep with one that weeps, and at the
same time to refuse to help, when you can, him that weeps, is a proof of mockery, and not
of piety. In short, our Saviour wept with Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, and proved
the feeling of infinite compassion within him by the witness of his tears. But works, as the
proofs of true affection soon followed, when Lazarus, for whose sake the tears were shed,
was raised up and restored to his sisters. This was sincerely to weep with those who wept,
<note type="footnote">132 Ps. xxxiv. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">133 Rom. xii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">134 Matt. vii. 12.</note>

<pb n="151"/>
when the occasion of the weeping was removed. But he did it, you will say, as having the
power. Well, nothing is demanded of you which it is impossible for you to perform: he has
fulfilled his entire duty who has done what he could.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7"> 
<pb n="152"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>But (as we had begun to remark) it is not sufficient for a Christian to keep himself from
wickedness, unless he also has fulfilled the duties implied in good works, as is very distinctly
proved by that statement in which the Lord threatened that those will be doomed to eternal
fire, who, although they have done no evil, have not done all that is good, declaring, “Then
will the king say to those who are on his right hand: depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal
fire, which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and ye
gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no135 drink,” with what follows. He did
not say, “Depart from me, ye cursed, because ye have committed murder, or adultery, or
theft”; for it is not because they had done evil, but because they had not done good, that
they are condemned, and doomed to the punishments of the eternal Gehenna; nor because
they had committed things which were forbidden, but because they had not been willing to
do those things which had been commanded. And from this it is to be observed what hope
those can have, who, in addition, do some of those things which are forbidden, when even
such are doomed to eternal fire as have simply not done the things which are commanded.
For I do not wish you to flatter yourself in this way,—if you have not done certain things,
because you have done certain other things, since it is written, “Whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one point, has become guilty of all.”136 For Adam sinned once,
and died; and do you think that you can live, when you are often doing that which killed
another person, when he had only done it once? Or do you imagine that he committed a
great crime, and was therefore justly condemned to a severer punishment? Let us consider,
then, what it was he really did. He ate of the fruit of the tree, contrary to the commandment.
What then? Did God punish man with death for the sake of the fruit of a tree? No: not on
account of the fruit of the tree, but on account of the contempt of the commandment. The
question, therefore, is not about the nature of the offense, but about the transgression of
the commandment. And the same being who told Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree,
has commanded you not to speak evil, not to lie, not to detract, not to listen to a detractor,
to swear not at all, not to covet, not to envy, not to be drunken, not to be greedy, not to
render evil for evil to any one, to love your enemies, to bless them that curse you, to pray
for them that malign and persecute you, to turn the other cheek to one smiting you, and
not to go to law before a worldly tribunal, so that, if any one seeks to take away your goods,
you should joyfully lose them, to flee from the charge of avarice, to beware of the sin of all
pride and boastfulness, and live, humble and meek, after the example of Christ, avoiding
fellowship with the wicked so completely that you will not even eat with fornicators, or
covetous persons, or those that speak evil of others, or the envious, or detractors, or the
<note type="footnote">135 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">136 James ii. 10.</note>

<pb n="153"/>
drunken, or the rapacious. Now, if you despise him in any such matter, then, if he spared
Adam, he will also spare you. Yea, he might have been spared with better reason than you,
inasmuch as he was still ignorant and inexperienced, and was restrained by the example of
no one who had previously sinned, and who had died on account of his sin. But after such
examples as you possess, after the law, after the prophets, after the gospels, and after the
apostles, if you still set your mind on transgressing, I see not in what way pardon can be
extended to you.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
<pb n="154"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>Do you flatter yourself on account of the attribute of virginity? Remember Adam and
Eve fell when they were virgins, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit
them when they sinned. The virgin who sins is to be compared to Eve, and not to Mary. We
do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy of repentance, but we remind you
rather to hope for reward, than to look for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should
ask for indulgence who are expecting the crown of virginity, and that those should commit
anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful; for it must be remembered
that it is lawful to contract an alliance by marriage. And as those are to be praised
who, from love to Christ, and for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, have despised the tie
of wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of incontinence, after
they have vowed themselves to God, have recourse to the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as
we have said, those who decline marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful.
And if that class of people swear, if they speak evil of others, if they are detractors, or if they
patiently listen to detractors, if they return evil for evil, if they incur the charge of covetousness
with respect to other people’s property, or of avarice in regard to their own, if they
cherish the poison of revenge or envy, if they either say or think anything unbefitting against
the institutions of the law or the Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit
themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things, as is only too
common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is lawful, while they practice what
is not lawful? If you wish it to be of advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful,
take care that you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish to have
dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that which is intrinsically more [or
not to avoid those things137 which are interdicted, while such things as are permitted meet
with contempt]. For the Apostle says, “She that is unmarried careth for the things of the
Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she who
is married careth for the things of this world, how she may please138 her husband.” He thus
affirms that the married woman pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while
the unmarried woman pleases God, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about the things of the
world. Let him tell me, then, whom she desires to please, who has no husband, and yet cares
for the things of the world? Shall not the married woman, in such a case, be preferred to
her? Yes, since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her husband, but the
other neither pleases her husband, since she does not have one, nor can she please God.139
But it is not fitting that we should pass over in silence that which he said: “The unmarried

woman careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy
both in body and spirit” [she careth, he says, for the things of the Lord; she does not care
for the things of the world, or of men, but for the things of God]. What, then, are the things
of the Lord? Let the Apostle tell: “Whatsoever140 things are holy, whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue,
and if there be any praise of doctrine”: these are the things of the Lord, which holy and truly
apostolic virgins meditate upon, and think of, day and night, without any interval of time.
Of the Lord is the resurrection of the dead, of the Lord is immortality, of the Lord is incorruption,
of the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the saints, as it is
written in the Gospel, “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father”:141 of the Lord are the many mansions of the righteous in the heavens, of the
Lord is the fruit which is produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold.
Those virgins who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to merit them,
think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the law of the new and old testament, in
which shine forth the holy utterances of his lips; and if any virgins meditate without intermission
on these things, they think of the things of the Lord. In that case, there is fulfilled
in them the saying of the prophet: “The eternal142 foundations are upon a solid rock, and
the commands of God are in the heart of the holy woman.”</p>

<p>There follows the clause “how she may please God,”—God, I say, not men,—“that she
may be holy both in body and spirit.” He does not say that she may be holy only in a member
or in the body, but that she may be holy in body and spirit. For a member is only one part
of the body, but the body is a union of all the members. When, therefore, he says that she
may be holy in the body, he testifies that she ought to be sanctified in all her members, because
the sanctification of the other members will not avail, if corruption be found remaining
in one. Also, she will not be holy in body (which consists of all the members), who is defiled
by the pollution of even one of them. But in order that what I say may be made more obvious
and clear, suppose the case of a woman who is purified by the sanctification of all her other
members, and sins only with her tongue, inasmuch as she either speaks evil143 of people or
bears false testimony, will all her other members secure the acquittal of one, or will all the
rest be judged on account of the one? If, therefore, the sanctification of the other members
will not avail, even when one only is at fault, how much more, if all are corrupted by the
guilt of various sins, will the perfection of one be of no avail?</p>

<p>Wherefore, I beseech you, O virgin, do not flatter yourself on the ground of your purity
alone, and do not trust in the perfection of one member; but according to the Apostle,
maintain the sanctity of your body throughout. Cleanse thy head from all defilement, because
it is a disgrace that it, after the sanctifying oil has been applied to it, should be polluted with
the juice or powder of either crocus, or any other pigment, or should be adorned with gold
or gems or any other earthly ornament, because it already shines with the radiance of
heavenly adornment. It is undoubtedly a grave insult to Divine grace to prefer to it any
mundane and worldly ornament. And next, cleanse thy forehead, that it may blush at human,
and not at Divine works, and may display that shame which gives rise not to sin, but to the
favor of God, as the sacred Scripture declares, “There is a shame that causes sin, and there
is a shame that brings with it the favor144 of God.” Cleanse, too, thy neck, that it may not
carry thy145 locks in a golden net and necklaces hung round it, but may rather bear about
it those ornaments of which the Scripture says, “Let not146 mercy and faith depart from
thee,” and hang them upon thy heart as upon thy neck. Cleanse thine eyes, whilst thou dost
withdraw them from all concupiscence, and dost never turn them away from the sight of
the poor, and dost keep them from all dyes, in that purity in which they were made by God.
Cleanse thy tongue from falsehood, because “a mouth147 which tells lies destroys the soul”:
cleanse it from detraction, from swearing, and from perjury. I beg you not to think it is an
inverted order that I have said the tongue should be cleansed from swearing before perjury,
for one will then the more easily escape perjury, if he swears not at all, so that there may be
fulfilled in him that statement, “Keep148 thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
guile.” And be mindful of the Apostle who says, “Bless, and149 curse not.” But often call to
mind the following words, “See that no one render evil for evil to any man, or cursing for
cursing, but on the contrary, do ye bless them, because to this ye have been called, that ye
should possess a blessing150 by inheritance”; and this other passage, “If any151 one offend
not in tongue, he is a perfect man.” For it is shameful that those lips, by which you confess
God, pray to him, bless him, and praise him, should be defiled by the pollution of any sin.

I know not with what conscience any one can pray to God with that tongue with which he
either speaks falsehood, or calumniates, or detracts. God listens to holy lips, and speedily
answers those prayers which an unpolluted tongue pours forth. Cleanse also thine ears, so
that they may not listen except to holy and true discourse, that they never admit into them
obscene, or infamous, or worldly words, or tolerate any one detracting from another, on
account of that which is written, “Hedge up152 thine ears with thorns, and do not listen to
a wicked tongue, that you may have your part with him, of whom it is said, that he was153
righteous in hearing and seeing; i.e. he sinned neither with his eyes nor his ears. Cleanse,
too, thy hands, “that they be not stretched out to receive, but shut against giving,” and that
they154 be not prompt to strike, but ever ready for all the works of mercy and piety. In fine,
cleanse thy feet, that they follow not the broad and ample way which leads to grand and
costly worldly banquets, but that they tread rather the difficult and narrow path, which
guides to heaven, for it is written, “Make a155 straight path for your feet.” Acknowledge that
your members were formed for you by God the Maker, not for vices, but for virtues; and,
when you have cleansed the whole of your limbs from every stain of sin, and they have become
sanctified throughout your whole body, then understand that this purity will profit
you, and look forward with all confidence to the prize of virginity.</p>

<p>I believe that I have now set forth, briefly indeed, but, at the same time, fully, what is
implied in a woman’s purity of body: it remains that we should learn what it is to be pure
also in spirit; i.e. that what it is unlawful for one to do in act, it is also unlawful for one even
to imagine in thought. For she is holy, alike in body and in spirit, who sins neither in mind
nor heart, knowing that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes
every pains to possess a mind as well as a body free from sin. Such a person is aware that it
is written, “Keep thy156 heart with all diligence”; and again, “God loveth157 holy hearts, and
all the undefiled are acceptable to him”; and elsewhere, “Blessed158 are those of a pure heart;
for they shall see God.” I think that this last statement is made regarding those whom conscience
accuses of the guilt of no sin; concerning whom I think that John also spoke in his
Epistle when he said, “If our heart159 condemn us not, then have we confidence towards
God, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from him.” I do not wish you to think that you
have escaped the accusation of sin, although act does not follow desire, since it is written,
“Whosoever160 looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with
her in his heart.” And do not say, “I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out in
act”; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to do. Wherefore also blessed
Peter issues a precept to this effect: “purify your161 souls”; and if he had not been aware of
such a thing as defilement of the soul, he would not have expressed a desire that it should
be purified. But we should also very carefully consider that passage which says, “These162
are they who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins, and they
follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth”; and should reflect whether, if these are joined to
the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens, through the merit of chastity
and purity alone, there may be also other means by which virginity being assisted may attain
to the glory of so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to know this? From the
following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, “These were163 purchased from
among men as the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no
falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.” You see, then, that they are
spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only,

but those are said to do so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the pollution
of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she
is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those
who are married; viz. keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law.
For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married
women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married?
For although it is not allowed to any Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception
who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained
life, that they may be thoroughly identified164 with the Church, which is described as being
“without165 spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,” much more is it requisite that a virgin
should reach this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor of
any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of holy Scripture; nor
shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.</p>

<p>O Virgin, maintain thy purpose which is destined for a great reward. Eminent with the
Lord is the virtue of virginity and purity, if it be not disfigured by other kinds of lapses into
sins and wickedness. Realize your state, realize your position, realize your purpose. You are
called the bride of Christ; see that you commit no act which is unworthy of him to whom
you profess to be betrothed. He will quickly write a bill of divorcement, if he perceive in
you even one act of unfaithfulness. Accordingly, whosoever receives those gifts which, as
an earnest, are bestowed in the case of human betrothals, immediately begins earnestly and
diligently to enquire of domestics, intimates, and friends, what is the character of the young
man, what he especially loves, what he receives, in what style he lives, what habits he practices,
what luxuries he indulges in, and in what pursuits he finds his chief pleasure and delight.
And when she has learned these things, she so conducts herself, in all respects, that her
service, her cheerfulness, her diligence, and her whole mode of life, may be in harmony with
the character of her betrothed. And do thou, who hast Christ as thy bridegroom, enquire
from the domestics and intimates of that bridegroom of thine what is his character; yes, do
thou zealously and skillfully enquire in what things he specially delights, what sort of arrangement
he loves in thy dress, and what kind of adornment he desires. Let his most intimate
associate Peter tell thee, who does not allow personal adorning even to married women, as
he has written in his epistle, “Let wives,166 in like manner, be subject to their own husbands,
so that, if any believe not the word, they may, without the word, be won over by the conduct
of their wives, contemplating their chaste behavior in the fear of God; and let theirs not be
an outward adornment of the hair, or the putting on of gold, or elegance in the apparel
which is adopted, but let there be the hidden man of the heart in the stainlessness167 of a
peaceful and modest spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” Let another apostle
also tell thee, the blessed Paul, who, writing to Timothy, gives his approval to the same things
in regard to the conduct of believing women: “Let wives168 in like manner adorn themselves
with the ornament of a habit of modesty and sobriety, not with curled hair, or gold, or pearls,
or costly array, but as becomes women that profess chastity, with good and upright behavior.”</p>

<p>But perhaps you say, “Why did not the Apostles enjoin these things on virgins?” Because
they did not think that necessary, lest such an exhortation, if given to them, might rather
seem an insult than a means of edification. Nor, in fact, would they have believed that virgins
could ever proceed to such an extreme of hardihood, as to claim for themselves carnal and
worldly ornaments, not permitted even to married women. Undoubtedly, the virgin ought
to adorn and array herself; for how can she be able to please her betrothed, if she does not
come forth in a neat and ornamental form? Let her be adorned by all means, but let her ornaments
be of an internal and spiritual kind, and not of a carnal nature; for God desires in
her a beauty not of the body, but of the soul. Do thou, therefore, who desirest that thy soul
should be loved and dwelt in by God, array it with all diligence, and adorn it with spiritual
garments. Let nothing unbecoming, nothing repulsive, be seen in it. Let it shine with the
gold of righteousness, and gleam with the gems of holiness, and glitter with the most precious
pearl of purity; instead of fine linen and silk, let it be arrayed in the robe of mercifulness
and piety, according to what is written, “Put ye169 on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy
and beloved bowels of mercy, kindness, humility,” and so forth. And let the virgin not ask
for the beauty due to ceruse,170 or any other pigment, but let her have the brightness of innocence
and simplicity, the rosy hue of modesty, and the purple glow of honorable shamefacedness.
Let her be washed with the nitre of heavenly doctrine, and purified by all spiritual
lavements.171 Let no stain of malice or sin be left in her. And lest, at any time, she should
give forth the evil odor of sin, let her be imbued, through and through, with the most
pleasant ointment of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>God seeks for adornment of this kind, and desires a soul arrayed in such a manner.
Remember that you are called the daughter of God, according to what he says, “Hearken,172
O daughter, and consider.” But you yourself also, as often as you call God your Father, bear
witness that you are the daughter of God. Wherefore, if you are the daughter of God, take
care that you do none of those things which are unworthy of God, your Father; but do all
things as being the daughter of God. Reflect how the daughters of nobles in this world
conduct themselves, to what habits they are accustomed and by what exercises they train
themselves. In some of them, there is so great modesty, so great dignity, so great self-restraint,
that they excel the habits of other human beings in regard to human nobleness, and, lest
they should attach any mark of disgrace on their honorable parents by their failure, they
strive to acquire another173 nature for themselves by the mode of their acting in the world.
And do you, therefore, have regard to your origin, consider your descent, attend to the glory
of your nobility. Acknowledge that you are not merely the daughter of man, but of God,
and adorned with the nobility of a divine birth. So present yourself to the world that your
heavenly birth be seen in you, and your divine nobleness shine clearly forth. Let there be in
you a new dignity, an admirable virtue, a notable modesty, a marvelous patience, a gait becoming
a virgin with a bearing of true shamefacedness, speech always modest, and such as
is uttered only at the proper time, so that whosoever beholds you may admiringly exclaim:
“What is this exhibition of new dignity among men? What is this striking modesty, what
this well-balanced excellence, what this ripeness of wisdom? This is not the outcome of
human training or of mere human discipline. Something heavenly sheds its fragrance on
me in that earthly body. I really believe that God does reside in some human beings.” And
when he comes to know that you are a handmaid of Christ, he will be seized with the
greater amazement, and will reflect how marvelous must be the Master, when his handmaid
manifests such excellence.</p>

<p>If you wish, then, to be with Christ, you must live according to the example of Christ,
who was so far removed from all evil and wickedness, that he did not render a recompense
even to his enemies, but rather even prayed for them. For I do not wish you to reckon those
souls Christian, who (I do not say) hate either their brothers or sisters, but who do not, before
God as a witness, love their neighbors with their whole heart and conscience, since it is a
bounden duty for Christians, after the example of Christ himself, even to love their enemies.
If you desire to possess fellowship with the saints, cleanse your heart from the thought of
malice and sin. Let no one circumvent you; let no one delude you by beguiling speech. The
court of heaven will admit none except the holy, and righteous, and simple, and innocent,
and pure. Evil has no place in the presence of God. It is necessary that he who desires to
reign with Christ should be free from all wickedness and guile. Nothing is so offensive, and
nothing so detestable to God, as to hate any one, to wish to harm any one; while nothing is
so acceptable to him as to love all men. The prophet knowing this bears witness to it when
he teaches, “Ye who174 love the Lord, hate evil.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>Take heed that ye love not human glory in any respect, lest your portion also be reckoned
among those to whom it was said, “How175 can ye believe, who seek glory, one from another?”
and of whom it is said through the prophet, “Increase176 evils to them; increase evils to the
boastful of the earth”; and elsewhere, “Ye are confounded177 from your boasting, from your
reproaching in the sight of the Lord.” For I do not wish you to have regard to those, who
are virgins of the world, and not of Christ; who unmindful of their purpose and profession,
rejoice in delicacies, are delighted with riches, and boast of their descent from a merely
carnal nobility; who, if they assuredly believed themselves to be the daughters of God, would
never, after their divine ancestry, admire mere human nobility, nor glory in any honored
earthly father: if they felt that they had God as their Father, they would not love any nobility
connected with the flesh. Why, thou foolish woman, dost thou flatter thyself about the
nobleness of thy descent, and take delight in it? God, at the beginning, created two human
beings, from whom the whole multitude of the human race has descended; and thus it is
not the equity of nature, but the ambition of evil desire, which has given rise to worldly
nobility. Unquestionably, we are all rendered equal by the grace of the divine178 bath, and
there can be no difference among those, whom the second birth has generated, by means
of which alike the rich man and the poor man, the free man and the slave, the nobly born
and the lowly born, is rendered a son of God. Thus mere earthly rank is overshadowed by
the brilliance of heavenly glory, and henceforth is taken no account of, while those who
formerly had been unequal in worldly honors are now equally arrayed in the glory of a
heavenly and divine nobility. There is now among such no place for lowness of birth; nor
is any one inferior to another whom the majesty of the divine birth adorns; except in the
estimation of those who do not think that the things of heaven are to be preferred to those
of earth. There can be no worldly boasting among them, if they reflect how vain a thing it
is that they should, in smaller matters, prefer themselves to those whom they know to be
equal to themselves in greater matters, and should regard, as placed below themselves on
earth, those whom they believe to be equal to themselves in what relates to heaven. But do
thou, who art a virgin of Christ, and not of the world, flee from all the glory of this present
life, that thou mayest attain to the glory which is promised in the world to come.</p>

<p>Avoid words of contention and causes of animosity: flee also from all occasions of discord
and strife. For if, according to the doctrine of the Apostle “the servant179 of the Lord must
not strive,” how much more does this become the handmaid of the Lord, whose mind ought
to be more gentle, as her sex is more bashful and retiring. Restrain thy tongue from evil
speaking, and put the bridle of the law upon thy mouth; so that you shall speak, if you speak
at all, only when it would be a sin to be silent. Beware lest you utter anything which might
be justly found fault with. A word once spoken is like a stone which has been thrown:
wherefore it should be long thought over before it is uttered. Blessed, assuredly, are the lips,
which never utter what they would wish to recall. The talk of a chaste mind ought itself also
to be chaste, such as may always rather edify than injure the hearers, according to that
commandment of the Apostle when he says, “Let no180 corrupt communications proceed
out of your mouth, but that which is good for the edification of faith, that it may convey
grace to them that hear.” Precious to God is that tongue which knows not to form words
except about divine things, and holy is that mouth from which heavenly utterances continually
flow forth. Put down by the authority of Scripture calumniators of those who are absent,
as being evil-minded persons, because the prophet mentions this also as among the virtues
of a perfect man, if, in the presence of the righteous an evil-minded man, who brings forward
things against his neighbor which cannot be proved, is brought down to nothing. For it is
not lawful for you patiently to listen to evil-speaking against another, inasmuch as you would
not wish that to be done by others when directed against yourself. Certainly, everything is
unrighteous which goes against the Gospel of Christ, and that is the case, if you quietly
permit anything to be done to another, which you would feel painful, if done by any one to
yourself. Accustom your tongue always to speak about those who are good, and lend your
ears rather to listen to the praises of good men than to the condemnation of such as are
wicked. Take heed that all the good actions you perform are done for the sake of God,
knowing that for every such deed you will only receive a reward, so far as you have done it
out of regard to his fear and love. Study rather to be holy than to appear so, because it is of
no avail to be reckoned what you are not; and the guilt of a twofold sin is contracted when
you do not have what you are credited with having, and when you pretend to possess what
you do not possess.</p>

<p>Delight thyself rather in fastings than in feastings, mindful of that widow who did not
depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers day and night. Now, if
she who was a widow, and a Jewish widow, proved herself such, what is it fitting that a virgin
of Christ should now attain to? Love more than any other thing the feast of the divine word,
and desire that you be filled with spiritual dainties, while you seek for such food as refreshes
the soul, rather than for that which only pleases the body. Flee from all kinds of flesh and
wine, as being the sources of heat and provocatives to lust. And only then, if need be, use a
little wine, when the stomach’s uneasiness, or great infirmity of body, requires you to do
so. Subdue anger, restrain enmity, and whatever there may be which gives rise to remorse
when it is done, avoid as an abomination giving rise181 to immediate sin. It is fitting that
that mind should be very tranquil and quiet, as well as free from all the tumults of anger,
which desires to be the dwelling-place of God, as he testifies through the prophet, saying,
“Upon182 what other man shall I rest than upon him who is humble and quiet, and who
trembleth at my words?” Believe that God is a witness of all thy deeds and thoughts, and
take good heed lest you either do or think anything which is unworthy of the divine eyesight.
When you desire to engage in prayer, show yourself in such a frame of mind as becomes
one who is to speak with the Lord.</p>

<p>When you repeat183 a psalm, consider whose words you are repeating and delight
yourself more with true contrition of soul, than with the pleasantness of a trilling voice. For
God sets a higher value on the tears of one thus praising184 him, than on the beauty of his
voice; as the prophet says, “Serve185 the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.” Now,
where there are fear and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice, but humility of mind
with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all thy doings; for it is written, “Cursed186
is the man who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.” Let grace grow in you with years;
let righteousness increase with age; and let your faith appear the more perfect the older you
become; for Jesus, who has left us an example how to live, increased not only in years as
respected his body, but in wisdom and spiritual grace before God and men. Reckon all the
time in which you do not perceive yourself growing better as positively lost. Maintain to
the last that purpose of virginity which you have formed; for it is the part of virtue not merely
to begin, but to finish, as the Lord says in the Gospel, “Whosoever187 shall endure to the
end, the same shall be saved.” Beware, therefore, lest you furnish to any one an occasion
even of evil desire, because thy God, betrothed to thee, is jealous; for an adulteress against
Christ is more guilty than one against her husband. Be thou, therefore, a model of life to all;
be an example; and excel in actual conduct those whom you precede in your consecration188
to chastity. Show thyself in all respects a virgin; and let no stain of corruption be brought
as a charge against thy person. And let one whose body is perfect in its purity be also irreproachable
in conduct. Now, as we said in the beginning of this letter, that you have become
a sacrifice pertaining to God, such a sacrifice as undoubtedly imparts its own sanctity also
to others, that, as every one worthily receives from it, he himself also may be a partaker of
sanctification, so then, let the other virgins also be sanctified through you, as by means of
a divine offering. Show yourself to them so holy in all things, that, whosoever comes in
contact with thy life, whether by hearing or seeing, may experience the power of sanctification,
and may feel that such an amount of grace passes to him from your manner of acting,
that, while he desires to imitate thee, he himself becomes worthy of being a sacrifice devoted
to God.</p>

<head>A LETTER OF SEVERUS TO HOLY PAUL THE BISHOP.</head>
<p>After I learned that all thy cooks had given189 up thy kitchen (I believe because they felt
indignant at having to fulfill the duty towards cheap dishes of pulse190), I sent a little boy
to you out of our own workshop. He is quite skillful enough to cook pale beans and to pickle
homely beet-root, with vinegar and sauce, as well as to prepare cheap porridge for the jaws
of the hungry monks. He knows nothing, however, of pepper or of laser,191 but he is quite
at home with cumin, and is especially clever in plying the noisy mortar with sweetly smelling
plants. He has one fault, that he is no kindly foe to admit to any garden; for if let in, he will
mow down with a sword all things within his reach, and he will never be satisfied with the
slaughter simply of mallows. However, in furnishing himself with fuel he will not swindle
you. He will burn whatever comes in his way; he will cut down and not hesitate to lay hands
upon buildings, and to carry off old beams from the household. We present him, then, to
you, with this character and these virtues; and we wish you to regard him not as a servant,
but as a son, because you are not ashamed to be the father of very small creatures. I myself
would have wished to serve you instead of him; but if good-will may be taken as in some
measure standing for the deed do you only, in return, take care to remember me amid your
breakfasts and delightful dinners because it is more proper to be your slave, than the master
of others. Pray for me.192</p>

of character, than that, all errors being laid aside, we should lead a blessed life? In this matter,
I see that the greatest praise befits thy virtues, because you have changed even an uninstructed
mind by your exhortations, and drawn it over to an excellent condition. But it would not
seem so wonderful, if you had simply strengthened educated minds by instilling wisdom
into them; for intelligent men have a sort of relationship to devotion, but rustic natures are
not easily won over to the side of severity.193 Just as those who shape the forms of animals
out of stone, undertake a business of a pretty difficult kind, when they strike very hard rocks
with their chisels, while those who make their attempts on substances of a softer nature feel
that their hands are aided by the ease of fashioning these materials, and it is deemed proper
that the labor of the workman; when difficult, should be held in the highest honor, so, Sir,
singular commendation ought so be given to you, because you have made unpolished and
rustic minds, set free from the darkness of sin, both to think what is human, and to understand
what is divine.</p>
<p>No less is Xenocrates, by far the most learned of the philosophers, held in estimation,
who succeeded by severe exhortations in having luxury conquered. For when a certain
Polemo, heavy with wine, staggered openly out of a nocturnal revel at the time when his
hearers were flocking to the school of Xenocrates, he, too, entered the place, and impudently
took his seat among the crowd of disciples, in that dress in which he had come forth from
the banquet. A chaplet of flowers covered his head, and yet he did not feel ashamed that he
would seem unlike all the others, because, in truth, indulgence in a long drinking-bout had
upset his brains, which are the seat of reason. As the rest of those there present began to
murmur grievously, because so unsuitable a hearer had found his way in among a multitude
of men of letters, the master himself was not in the slightest degree disturbed, but, on the
contrary, began to discourse on the science of morals, and the laws of moderation. And so
powerful proved the influence of the teacher that the mind of that impudent intruder was
persuaded to the love of modesty. First of all, then, Polemo, in utter confusion, took off the
chaplet from his head, and professed himself a disciple. And in course of time he conformed
himself so thoroughly to the duties implied in dignity, and surrendered himself so entirely
to the exhibition of modesty, that a glorious amendment of character threw a cloak over
the habits of his former life. Now we admire this very thing in your instructions, that, without
the use of any threats, and without having recourse to terrors of any kind, you have turned
<note type="footnote">193 “crudelitati,” which, as Clericus remarks, must here be equivalent to severitati.</note>

infatuated minds to the worship of God; so that even a badly ordered intellect should believe
it preferable194 to live well and happily with all, rather than to hold unrighteous opinions

<head>TO AN UNKNOWN PERSON, ENTREATING HIM TO DEAL GENTLY WITH HIS BROTHER.</head>
<p>Although my lord and brother has already begged of your nobleness that you would
see that Tutus should be most195 safe, yet it has been allowed to me to commend the same
person in a letter, in order that, by the petition being doubled, he may be held all the safer.
For let it be granted that a youthful fault and error of a yet unsettled age has injured him,
so as to inflict a stain on his early years; still one, who did not yet know what was due to
right conduct, has gone wrong almost without contracting blame. For when he came to a
right state of mind and to reflection, he understood on better thoughts that a theatrical life
was to be condemned. However, he could not be completely cleared of his fault, unless he
should wash its guilt away by the aid196 of Deity, since, by the remedy obtained through the
Catholic religion, changing his views, he has denied himself the enjoyment of a less honorable
place, and has withdrawn himself from the eyes of the people.</p>
<p>Of the Master as Above.197</p>
<p>Since, therefore, both divine and state laws do not permit a faithful body and sanctified
minds to exhibit disgraceful though pleasing spectacles, and to set forth vulgar means of
enjoyment, especially since an injury seems in some degree to accrue to the chaste dedication
of one’s self, in case any one who has been renewed by holy baptism should fall back upon
his old licentiousness, it behooves your Excellency to show favor to good intentions, so that
he who, by the goodness of God, has entered on a pious duty, should not be forced to sink
into the pitfall of the theatre. He does not, however, refuse compliance with the judgment
of you all, if you enjoin other fitting actions on his part in behalf of the requirements of our
common country.198</p>
<note type="footnote">195 There is a play upon the words—“Tutum esse tutissimum.”</note>
<note type="footnote">196 “divinitatis accessu”: the context is almost unintelligible.</note>
<note type="footnote">197 This probably denotes that what follows is the substance of the Master’s petition.</note>

<head>LETTER VI.</head>
<head>TO SALVIUS: A COMPLAINT THAT THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE HARASSED,
AND THEIR POSSESSIONS PLUNDERED.</head>
<p>Forensic excitement ought to be at full heat during the time of business in the law-courts;
for it is fitting that the arms of industry, as it struggles daily, should display energetic
movements. But when loud-toned eloquence has sounded a retreat, and has retired to
peaceful groves and pleasant dwelling-places, it is right that one lay aside idle murmurs,
and cease to utter ineffectual threats. For we know that palm-bearing steeds, when they have
retired from the circus, rest with the utmost quietness in their stables. Neither constant fear
nor doubtful palms of victory distress them, but at length, haltered to the peaceful cribs,
they now no longer stand in awe of the master urging them on, enjoying sweet oblivion of
the restless rivalry which had prevailed. In like manner, let it delight the boastful soldier
after his term of service is completed, to hang up his trophies, and patiently to bear the
burden of age.</p>
<p>But I do not quite understand why you should take a delight in terrifying miserable
husbandmen; and I do not comprehend why you wish to harass my rustics with the fear of
want of sustenance;199 as if, indeed, I did not know how to console them, and to deliver
them from fear, and to show them that there is not so great a reason to fear as you pretend.
I confess that, while we were occupied in the plain, I was often frightened by the arms of
your eloquence, but frequently I returned you corresponding blows, as far as I was able. I
certainly learned along with you, by what right, and in what order, the husbandmen are
demanded back, to whom a legal process is competent, and to whom the issue of a process
is not competent. You say that the Volusians wished you brought back, and frequently, in
your wrath, you repeat that you will withdraw the country people from my little keep; and
you, the very man, as I hope and desire, bound to me by the ties of old relationship, now
rashly threaten that, casting our agreement to the winds, you will lay hold upon my men. I
ask of your illustrious knowledge, whether there is one law for advocates, and another for
private persons, whether one thing is just at Rome, and quite another thing at Matarum.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I do not know that you were ever lord of the Volusian property, since
Dionysius is said to have preserved the right of possession to it, and he never wanted heirs;
who, while he lived, was accustomed to hurl the envenomed jibes of his low language upon
a multitude of individuals.200 There was, at that time, one Porphyrius, the son of Zibberinus,
and yet he was not properly named the son of Zibberinus. He kept hidden, by military service,
the question as to his birth, and, that he might dispel the cloud from his forehead, he took
<note type="footnote">199 “exhibitionis formidine”—a strange phrase.</note>
<note type="footnote">200 The text is uncertain, and the meaning very obscure.</note>

<pb n="174"/>
part in officious services and willing acts of submission. He was much with me both at home
and in the forum, having often employed me as his defender with my father, and as his advocate
before the judge. Sometimes I even kept back Dionysius, feeling that he ought not,
for the sake of twenty acres to discharge vulgar abuse upon Porphyrius.</p>
<p>See, here is the reason why thy remarkable prudence threatened my agents, so that,
though you are not the owner of the place, you everywhere make mention of my husbandmen.
But if you give yourself out as the successor of Porphyrius, you must know that the narrow
space of twenty acres cannot certainly be managed by one cultivator, or, if mindful of your
proper dignity and determined to maintain it, you shrink from naming yourself the heir of
Porphyrius, it is certain and obvious that he can commence proceedings,201 to whom the
right of doing so belongs, so as to go to law with those who have no property in that land.
But if you diligently look into the matter, you will see that the endeavor to recover it most
especially devolves on me. Wherefore, my much esteemed lord and brother, it behooves
you to be at peace, and to return to friendship with me, while you condescend to come to
a private conference. Cease, I pray you, to disturb inactive and easily frightened persons,
and utter your boastful words at a distance. Believe me, however, that I am delighted with
your high spirit, and by no means offended; for we are neither of a harsh disposition, nor
destitute of learning. Let Maximinus at least render you gentle.202</p>
<note type="footnote">201 “posse proponere.”</note>

<p>The faith and piety of souls, no doubt, remain, but this should be made known by the

courtesy. For just as a fertile field cannot bring forth abundant fruits, if its cultivation has

<head>THE SACRED HISTORY OF SULPITIUS SEVERUS.</head>

<head>BOOK I.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">  
<pb n="178"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>I address myself to give a condensed account of those things which are set forth in the
sacred Scriptures from the beginning of the world and to tell of them, with distinction of
dates and according to204 their importance, down to period within our own remembrance.
Many who were anxious to become acquainted with divine things by means of a compendious
treatise, have eagerly entreated me to undertake this work. I, seeking to carry out their wish,
have not spared my labor, and have thus succeeded in comprising in two short books things
which elsewhere filled many volumes. At the same time, in studying brevity, I have omitted
hardly any of the facts. Moreover, it seemed to me not out of place that, after I had run
through the sacred history down to the crucifixion of Christ, and the doings of the Apostles,
I should add an account of events which subsequently took place. I am, therefore, to tell of
the destruction of Jerusalem, the persecutions of the Christian people, the times of peace
which followed, and of all things again thrown into confusion by the intestine dangers of
the churches. But I will not shrink from confessing that, wherever reason required, I have
made use of profane historians to fix dates and preserve the series of events unbroken, and
have taken out of these what was wanting to a complete knowledge of the facts, that I might
both instruct the ignorant and carry conviction to the learned. Nevertheless, as to those
things which I have condensed from the sacred books, I do not wish so to present myself as
an author to my readers, that they, neglecting the source from which my materials have
been derived, should be satisfied with what I have written. My aim is that one who is already
familiar with the original should recognize here what he has read there; for all the mysteries
of divine things cannot be brought out except from the fountain-head itself. I shall now
enter upon my narrative.</p>
<note type="footnote">204 “carptim”: such seems to be the meaning of the word here, as Sigonius has noted. His words are “Carptim—

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>The world was created by God nearly six205 thousand years ago, as we shall set forth in
the course of this book; although those who have entered upon and published a calculation
of the dates, but little agree among themselves. As, however, this disagreement is due either
to the will of God or to the fault of antiquity, it ought not to be a matter of censure. After
the formation of the world man was created, the male being named Adam, and the female
Eve. Having been placed in Paradise, they ate of the tree from which they were interdicted,
and therefore were cast forth as exiles into our earth.206 To them were born Cain and Abel;
but Cain, being an impious man, slew his brother. He had a son called Enoch, by whom a
city was first built,207 and was called after the name of its founder. From him Irad, and from
him again Maüiahel was descended. He had a son called Mathusalam, and he, in turn, begat
Lamech, by whom a young man is said to have been slain, without, however, the name of
the slain man being mentioned—a fact which is thought by the wise to have presaged a future
mystery. Adam, then, after the death of his younger son, begat another son called Seth, when
he was now two hundred and thirty years old: he lived altogether eight hundred and thirty
years. Seth begat Enos, Enos Cainan, Cainan Malaleel, Malaleel Jared, and Jared Enoch, who
on account of his righteousness is said to have been translated by God. His son was called
Mathusalam who begat Lamech; from whom Noah was descended, remarkable for his
righteousness, and above all other mortals dear and acceptable to God. When by this time
the human race had increased to a great multitude, certain angels, whose habitation was in
heaven, were captivated by the appearance of some beautiful virgins, and cherished illicit
desires after them, so much so, that falling beneath their own proper nature and origin, they
left the higher regions of which they were inhabitants, and allied themselves in earthly
marriages. These angels gradually spreading wicked habits, corrupted the human family,
and from their alliance giants are said to have sprung, for the mixture with them of beings
of a different nature, as a matter of course, gave birth to monsters.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>God being offended by these things, and especially by the wickedness of mankind, which
had gone beyond measure, had determined to destroy the whole human race. But he exempted
Noah, a righteous man and of blameless life, from the destined doom. He being warned
by God that a flood was coming upon the earth, built an ark of wood of immense size, and
covered it with pitch so as to render it impervious to water. He was shut into it along with
his wife, and his three sons and his three daughters-in-law. Pairs of birds also and of the
different kinds of beasts were likewise received into it, while all the rest were cut off by a
flood. Noah then, when he understood that the violence of the rain had ceased, and that the
ark was quietly floating on the deep, thinking (as really was the case) that the waters were
decreasing, sent forth first a raven for the purpose of enquiring into the matter, and on its
not returning, having settled, as I conjecture, on the dead bodies, he then sent forth a dove.
It, not finding a place of rest, returned to him and being again sent out, it brought back an
olive leaf, in manifest proof that the tops of the trees were now to be seen. Then being sent
forth a third time, it returned no more, from which it was understood that the waters had
subsided; and Noah accordingly went out from the ark. This was done, as I reckon, two
thousand two hundred208 and forty-two years after the beginning of the world.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>Then Noah first of all erected an altar to God, and offered sacrifices from among the
birds.209 Immediately afterwards he was blessed by God along with his sons, and received
a command that he should not eat blood, or shed the blood of any human being, because
Cain, having no such precept, had stained the first age of the world. Accordingly, the sons
of Noah were alone left in the then vacant world; for he had three, Shem, Ham, and Japhet.
But Ham, because he had mocked his father when senseless with wine, incurred his father’s
curse. His son, Chas by name, begat the giant Nebroth,210 by whom the city of Babylon is
said to have been built. Many other towns are related to have been founded at that time,
which I do not here intend to name one by one. But although the human race was now
multiplied, and men occupied different places and islands, nevertheless all made use of one
tongue, as long as the multitude, afterwards to be scattered through the whole world, kept
itself in one body. These, after the manner of human nature, formed the design of obtaining
a great name by constructing some great work before they should be separated from one
another. They therefore attempted to build a tower which should reach up to heaven. But
by the ordination of God, in order that the labors of those engaged in the work might be
hindered, they began to speak in a kind of languages very different from their accustomed
form of speech, while no one understood the others. This led to their being all the more
readily dispersed, because, regarding each other as foreigners, they were easily induced to
separate. And the world was so divided to the sons of Noah, that Shem occupied the East,
Japhet the West, and Ham the intermediate parts. After this, till the time of Abraham,211
their genealogy presented nothing very remarkable or worthy of record.</p>

<p>Abraham, whose father was Thara, was born in the one thousand and seventeenth year
after the deluge. His wife was called Sara, and his dwelling-place was at first in the country212
of the Chaldæans. He then dwelt along with his father at Charræ. Being at this time spoken
to by God, he left his country and his father, and taking with him Lot, the son of his brother,
he came into the country of the Canaanites, and settled at a place named Sychem. Ere long,
owing to the want of corn, he went into Egypt, and again returned. Lot, owing to the size
of the household, parted from his uncle, that he might take advantage of more spacious
territories in what was then a vacant region, and settled at Sodom. That town was infamous
on account of its inhabitants, males forcing themselves upon males, and it is said on that
account to have been hateful to God. At that period the kings of the neighboring peoples
were in arms, though previously there had been no213 war among mankind. But the kings
of Sodom and Gomorrah and of the adjacent territories went forth to battle against those
who were making war upon the regions round about, and being routed at the first onset,
yielded the victory to the opposite side. Then Sodom was plundered and made a spoil of by
the victorious enemy, while Lot was led into captivity. When Abraham heard of this, he
speedily armed his servants, to the number of three hundred and eighteen, and, stripping
of their spoils and arms the kings flushed with victory, he put them to flight. Then he was
blessed by Melchisedech the priest, and gave him tithes of the spoil. He restored the remainder
to those from whom it had been taken.</p>

<p>At the same time God spoke to Abraham, and promised that his seed was to be multiplied
as the sand of the sea; and that his predicted seed would live in a land not his own, while
his posterity would endure slavery in a hostile country for four hundred years, but would
afterwards be restored to liberty. Then his name was changed, as well as that of his wife, by
the addition of one letter; so that instead of Abram214 he was called Abraham, and, instead
of Sara, she was called Sarra. The mystery involved in this is by no means trifling, but it is
not the part of this work to treat of it. At the same time, the law of circumcision was enjoined
on Abraham, and he had by a maid-servant a son called Ishmael. Moreover, when he himself
was a hundred years old, and his wife ninety, God promised that they should have a son
Isaac, the Lord having come to him along with two angels. Then the angels being sent to
Sodom, found Lot sitting in the gate of the city. He supposed them to be human beings, and
welcomed them to share in his hospitality, and provided an entertainment for them in his
house, but the wicked youth of the town demanded the new arrivals for impure purposes.
Lot offered them his daughters in place of his guests, but they did not accept the offer, having
a desire rather for things forbidden, and then Lot himself was laid hold of with vile designs.
The angels, however, speedily rescued him from danger, by causing blindness to fall upon
the eyes of these unchaste sinners. Then Lot, being informed by his guests that the town
was to be destroyed, went away from it with his wife and daughters; but they were commanded
not to look back upon it. His wife, however, not obeying this precept (in accordance
with that evil tendency of human nature which renders it difficult to abstain from things
forbidden), turned back her eyes, and is said to have been at once changed into a monument.
As for Sodom, it was burned to ashes by fire from heaven. And the daughters of Lot, imagining
that the whole human race had perished, sought a union with their father while he
was intoxicated, and hence sprung the race of Moab and Ammon.</p>
<note type="footnote">214 In the Greek of the LXX. the name appears as Abraam, so that, as our author says, there is only a change

<p>Almost at the same time, when Abraham was now a hundred years old, his son Isaac
was born. Then Sara expelled the maid-servant by whom Abraham had had a son; and she
is said to have dwelt in the desert along with her son, and defended by the help of God. Not
long after this, God tried the faith of Abraham, and required that his son Isaac should be
sacrificed to him by his father. Abraham did not hesitate to offer him, and had already laid
the lad upon the altar, and was drawing the sword to slay him, when a voice came from
heaven commanding him to spare the young man; and a ram was found at hand to be for
a victim. When the sacrifice was offered, God spoke to Abraham, and promised him those
things which he had already said he would bestow. But Sara died in her one hundred and
twenty-seventh year, and her body was, through the care of her husband, buried in Hebron,
a town of the Canaanites, for Abraham was staying in that place. Then Abraham, seeing
that his son Isaac was now of youthful215 age, for he was, in fact, in his fortieth year, enjoined
his servant to seek a wife for him, but only from that tribe and territory from which he
himself was known to be descended. He was instructed, however, on finding the girl, to
bring her into the land of the Canaanites, and not to suppose that Isaac would return into
the country of his father for the purpose of obtaining a wife. In order that the servant might
carry out those instructions zealously, Abraham administered an oath to him, while his
hand rested on the thigh of his master. The servant accordingly set out for Mesopotamia,
and came to the town of Nachor, the brother of Abraham. He entered into the house of
Bathuel, the Syrian, son of Nachor; and having seen Rebecca, a beautiful virgin, the daughter
of Nachor, he asked for her, and brought her to his master. After this, Abraham took a wife
named Kethurah, who is called in the Chronicles his concubine, and begat children by her.
But he left his possessions to Isaac, the son of Sara, while, at the same time, he distributed
gifts to those whom he had begotten by his concubines; and thus they were separated from
Isaac. Abraham died after a life of a hundred and seventy-five years; and his body was laid
in the tomb of Sara his wife.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>Now, Rebecca, having long been barren, at length, through the unceasing prayers of her
husband to the Lord, brought forth twins about twenty years after the time of her marriage.
These are said to have often leaped216 in the womb of their mother; and it was announced
by the answer of the Lord on this subject, that two peoples were foretold in these children,
and that the elder would, in rank, be inferior to the younger. Well, the first that was born,
bristling over with hair, was called Esau, while Jacob was the name given to the younger. At
that time, a grievous famine had taken place. Under the pressure of this necessity, Isaac
went to Gerar, to King Abimelech, having been warned by the Lord not to go down into
Egypt. There he is promised the possession of the whole land, and is blessed, and having
been greatly increased in cattle and every kind of substance, he is, under the influence of
envy, driven out by the inhabitants. Thus expelled from that region, he sojourned by the
well, known as “the well217 of the oath.” By and by, being advanced in years, and his eyesight
being gone, as he made ready to bless his son Esau, Jacob through the counsel of his mother,
Rebecca, presented himself to be blessed in the place of his brother. Thus Jacob is set before
his brother as the one to be honored by the princes and the peoples. Esau, enraged by these
occurrences, plotted the death of his brother. Jacob, owing to the fear thus excited, and by
the advice of his mother, fled into Mesopotamia, having been urged by his father to take a
wife of the house of Laban, Rebecca’s brother: so great was their care, while they dwelt in a
strange country, that their children should marry within their own kindred. Thus Jacob,
setting out for Mesopotamia, is said in sleep to have had a vision of the Lord; and on that
account regarding the place of his dream as sacred, he took a stone from it; and he vowed
that, if he returned in prosperity, the name218 of the pillar should be the “house of the Lord,”
and that he would devote to God the tithes of all the possessions he had gained. Then he
betook himself to Laban, his mother’s brother, and was kindly received by him to share in his hospitality as the acknowledged son of his sister.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>Laban had two daughters, Leah and Rachel; but Leah had tender eyes, while Rachel is
said to have been beautiful. Jacob, captivated by her beauty, burned with love for the virgin,
and, asking her in marriage from the father, gave himself up to a servitude of seven years.
But when the time was fulfilled, Leah was foisted upon him, and he was subjected to another
servitude of seven years, after which Rachel was given him. But we are told that she was
long barren, while Leah was fruitful. Of the sons whom Jacob had by Leah, the following
are the names: Reuben, Symeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulon, and a daughter Dinah;
while there were born to him by the handmaid of Leah, Gad and Asher, and by the handmaid
of Rachel, Dan and Naphtali. But Rachel, after she had despaired of offspring, bare Joseph.
Then Jacob, being desirous of returning to his father, when Laban his father-in-law had
given him a portion of the flock as a reward for his service, and Jacob the son-in-law,
thinking him not to be acting justly in that matter, while he [also] suspected deceit on his
part, privately departed about the thirtieth year after his arrival. Rachel, without the knowledge
of her husband, stole the idols219 of her father, and on account of this injury Laban
followed his son-in-law, but not finding his idols, returned, after being reconciled, having
straitly charged his son-in-law not to take other wives in addition to his daughters. Then
Jacob, going on his way, is said to have had a vision of angels and of the army220 of the Lord.
But, as he directed his journey past the region of Edom, which his brother Esau inhabited,
suspecting the temper of Esau, he first sent messengers and gifts to try him. Then he went
to meet his brother, but Jacob took care not to trust him beyond what he could help. On
the day before the brothers were to meet, God, taking a human form, is said to have wrestled
with Jacob. And when he had prevailed with God, still he was not ignorant that his adversary
was no mere mortal; and therefore begged to be blessed by him. Then his name was changed
by God, so that from Jacob he was called Israel. But when he, in turn, inquired of God the
name of God, he was told that that should not be asked after because it was wonderful.221
Moreover, from that wrestling, the breadth222 of Jacob’s thigh shrank.</p>

<p>Israel, therefore, avoiding the house of his brother, sent forward his company to Salem,
a town of the Shechemites, and there he pitched his tent on a spot which he had purchased.
Emor, a Chorræan prince, was the ruler of that town. His son Sychem defiled Dinah, the
daughter of Jacob by Leah. Symeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, discovering this, cut
off by a stratagem all those of the male sex in the town, and thus terribly avenged the injury
done to their sister. The town was plundered by the sons of Jacob, and all the spoil carried
off. Jacob is said to have been much displeased with these proceedings. Soon after being
instructed by God, he went to Bethel, and there erected an altar to God. Then he fixed his
tent in a part of the territory belonging to the tower223 Gader. Rachel died in childbirth: the
boy she bore was called Benjamin. Israel died at the age of one hundred and eighty years.
Now, Esau was mighty in wealth, and had taken to himself wives of the nation of the
Canaanites. I do not think that, in a work so concise as the present, I am called upon to
mention his descendants, and, if any one is curious on the subject, he may turn to the original.
After the death of his father, Jacob stayed on in the place where Isaac had lived. His
other sons occasionally left him along with the flocks, for the sake of pasturage, but Joseph
and the little Benjamin remained at home. Joseph was much beloved by his father, and on
that account was hated by his brethren. There was this further cause for their aversion, that
by frequent dreams of his it seemed to be indicated that he would be greater than all of them.
Accordingly, having been sent by his father to inspect the flocks and pay a visit to his
brothers, there seemed to them a fitting opportunity for doing him harm. For, on seeing
their brother, they took counsel to slay him. But Reuben, whose mind shuddered at the
contemplation of such a crime, opposing their plan, Joseph was let down into a well.224
Afterwards, by the persuasions of Judah, they were brought to milder measures, and sold
him to merchants, who were on their way to Egypt. And by them he was delivered to Petifra,
a governor of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>About this same time, Judah, the son of Jacob, took in marriage Sava,225 a woman of
Canaan. By her he had three sons,—Her, Onan, and Sela. Her was allied by concubinage226
to Thamar. On his death, Onan took his brother’s wife; and he is related to have been destroyed
by God, because he spilled his seed upon the earth. Then Thamar, assuming the garb
of a harlot, united with her brother-in-law, and bore him two sons. But when she brought
them forth, there was this remarkable fact, that, when on one of the boys being born, the
midwife had bound his hand with a scarlet thread to indicate which of them was born first,
he, drawing back again into the womb of his mother, was born227 the last boy of the two.
The names of Fares and Zarah were given to the children. But Joseph, being kindly treated
by the royal governor who had obtained him for a sum of money, and having been made
manager of his house and family, had drawn the eyes of his master’s wife upon himself
through his remarkable beauty. And as she was madly laboring under that base passion, she
made advances to him oftener than once, and when he would not yield to her desires, she
disgraced him by the imputation of a false crime, and complained to her husband that he
had made an attempt upon her virtue. Accordingly, Joseph was thrown into prison. There
were in the same place of confinement two of the king’s servants, who made known their
dreams to Joseph, and he, interpreting these as bearing upon the future, declared that one
of them would be put to death, and the other would be pardoned. And so it came to pass.
Well, after the lapse of two years, the king also had a dream. And when this could not be
explained by the wise men among the Egyptians, that servant of the king who was liberated
from prison informs the king that Joseph was a wonderful interpreter of dreams. Accordingly,
Joseph was brought out of prison, and interpreted to the king his dream, to this effect, that,
for the next seven years, there would be the greatest fertility in the land; but in those that
followed, famine. The king being alarmed by this terror, and seeing that there was a divine
spirit in Joseph, set him over the department of food-supply, and made him equal with
himself in the government. Then Joseph, while corn was abundant throughout all Egypt,
gathered together an immense quantity, and, by increasing the number of granaries, took
measures against the future famine. At that time, the hope and safety of Egypt were placed
in him alone. About the same period, Aseneh bore him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
He himself, when he received the chief power from the king, was thirty years old; for he was sold by his brothers when he was seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>In the mean time, affairs having been well settled in Egypt to meet the famine, a grievous
want of corn began to distress the world. Jacob, constrained by this necessity, sent his sons
into Egypt, keeping only Benjamin with himself at home. Joseph, then, being at the head of
affairs, and having complete power over the corn-supplies, his brothers come to him, and
pay the same honor to him as to a king. He, when he saw them, craftily concealed his recognition
of them, and accused them of having come as enemies, subtly to spy out the land.
But he was annoyed that he did not see among them his brother Benjamin. Matters, then,
are brought to this point, that they promised he should be present, specially that he might
be asked whether they had entered Egypt for the purpose of spying out the land. In order
to secure the fulfillment of this promise, Symeon was retained as hostage, while to them
corn was given freely. Accordingly, they returned, bringing Benjamin with them as had
been arranged. Then Joseph made himself known to his brothers to the shame of these evildeservers.
Thus, he sent them home again, laden with corn, and presented with many gifts,
forewarning them that there were still five years of famine to come, and advising them to
come down with their father, their children, and their whole connections to Egypt. So Jacob
went down to Egypt, to the great joy of the Egyptians and of the king himself, while he was
tenderly welcomed by his son. That took place in the hundred and thirtieth year of the life
of Jacob, and one thousand three hundred and sixty years228 after the deluge. But from the
time when Abraham settled in the land of the Canaanites, to that when Jacob entered Egypt,
there are to be reckoned two hundred and fifteen years. After this, Jacob, in the seventeenth
year of his residence in Egypt, suffering severely from illness, entreated Joseph to see his
remains placed in the tomb. Then Joseph presented his sons to be blessed;229 and when this
had been done, but so that he set the younger before the elder as to the value of the blessing
given, Jacob then blessed all his sons in order. He died at the age of one hundred and fortyseven
years. His funeral was of a most imposing character, and Joseph laid his remains in
the tomb of his fathers. He continued to treat his brothers with kindness, although, after
the death of their father, they felt alarmed from a consciousness of the wrong they had done.
Joseph himself died in his one hundred and tenth year.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible to relate how the Hebrews who had come down into Egypt so
soon increased in numbers, and filled Egypt with their numerous descendants. But on the
death of the king, who kindly cherished them on account of the services of Joseph, they were
kept down by the government of the succeeding kings. For both the heavy labor of building
cities was laid upon them, and because their abounding numbers were now feared, lest some
day they should secure their independence by arms, they were compelled by a royal edict
to drown their newly-born male children. And no permission was granted to evade this
cruel order. Well, at that time, the daughter of Pharaoh found an infant in the river, and
caused it to be brought up as her own son, giving the boy the name of Moses. This Moses,
when he had come to manhood, saw a Hebrew being assaulted by an Egyptian; and, filled
with sorrow at the sight, he delivered his brother from injury, and killed the Egyptian with
a stone. Soon after, fearing punishment on account of what he had done, he fled into the
land of Midian, and, taking up his abode with Jothor the priest of that district, he received
his daughter Sepphora in marriage, who bore him two sons, Gersam and Eliezer. At this
epoch lived Job, who had acquired both the knowledge of God and all righteousness simply
from the law230 of nature. He was exceedingly rich, and on that account all the more illustrious,
because he was neither corrupted by that wealth while it remained entire, nor perverted
by it when it was lost. For, when, through the agency of the devil, he was stripped of his
goods, deprived of his children, and finally covered in his own person with terrible boils,
he could not be broken down, so as, from impatience of his sufferings, in any way, to commit
sin. At length he obtained the reward of the divine approval, and being restored to health,
he got back doubled all that he had lost.</p>
<note type="footnote">230 This somewhat remarkable statement is supported by the text of Halm, who reads, “lege naturæ.” But
other editions have “legem naturæ,” and the meaning will then be “who had learned the law of nature, and the

<p>But the Hebrews, oppressed by the multiplied evils of slavery, directed their complaints
to heaven, and cherished the hope of assistance from God. Then, as Moses was feeding his
sheep, suddenly a bush appeared to him burning, but, what was surprising, the flames did
it no harm. Astonished at such an extraordinary sight, he drew nearer to the bush, and im-
mediately God spoke to him in words to this effect, that he was the Lord of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and that he desired that their descendants, who were kept down under the tyranny
of the Egyptians, should be delivered from their sufferings, and that he, therefore, should
go to the king of Egypt, and present himself as a leader for restoring them to liberty. When
he hesitated, God strengthened him with power, and imparted to him the gift of working
miracles. Thus Moses, going into Egypt, after he had first performed miracles in the presence
of his own people, and having associated his brother Aaron with him, went to the king, declaring
that he had been sent by God, and that he now told him in the words of God to let
the Hebrew people go. But the king, affirming that he did not know the Lord, refused to
obey the command addressed to him. And when Moses, in proof that the orders he issued
were from God, changed his rod into a serpent,231 and soon after convened all the water
into blood, while he filled the whole land with frogs, as the Chaldæans were doing similar
things, the king declared that the wonders performed by Moses were simply due to the arts
of magic, and not to the power of God, until the land was covered with stinging insects
brought over it, when the Chaldæans confessed that this was done by the divine majesty.
Then the king, constrained by his sufferings, called to him Moses and Aaron, and gave the
people liberty to depart, provided that the calamity brought upon the kingdom were removed.
But, after the suffering was put an end to, his mind, having no control over itself returned
to its former state, and did not allow the Israelites to depart, as had been agreed upon. Finally,
however, he was broken down and conquered by the ten plagues which were sent upon his
person and his kingdom.</p>

<p>But on the day232 before the people went out of Egypt, being as yet unacquainted with
dates, they were instructed by the command of God to acknowledge that month which was
then passing by as the first of all months; and were told that the sacrifice of the day was to
be solemnly and regularly offered in coming ages, so that, on the fourteenth day of the
month, a lamb without blemish, one year old, should be slain as a victim, and that the doorposts
should be sprinkled with its blood; that its flesh was wholly to be eaten, but not a bone
of it was to be broken; that they should abstain from what was leavened for seven days, using
only unleavened bread; and that they should hand down the observance to their posterity.
Thus the people went forth rich, both by their own wealth, and still more by the spoils of
Egypt. Their number had grown from those seventy-five233 Hebrews, who had first gone
down into Egypt, to six hundred thousand men. Now, there had elapsed from the time when
Abraham first reached the land of the Canaanites a period of four hundred and thirty years,
but from the deluge a period of five hundred and seventy-five234 years. Well, as they went
forth in haste, a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, marched before them.
But since, owing to the fact that the gulf of the Red Sea lay between, the way led by235 the
land of the Philistines, in order that an opportunity might not afterwards be offered to the
Hebrews, shrinking from the desert, of returning into Egypt by a well-known road through
a continuous land-journey, by the command of God they turned aside, and journeyed towards
the Red Sea, where they stopped and pitched their camp. When it was announced to the
king that the Hebrew people, through mistaking the road, had come to have the sea right
before them, and that they had no means of escape since the deep would prevent them,
vexed and furious that so many thousand men should escape from his kingdom and power,
he hastily led forth his army. And already the arms, and standards, and the lines drawn up
in the widespreading plains were visible, when, as the Hebrews were in a state of terror, and
gazing up to heaven, Moses being so instructed by God, struck the sea with his rod, and divided
it. Thus a road was opened to the people as on firm land, the waters giving way on
both sides. Nor did the king of Egypt hesitate to follow the Israelites going forward, for he
entered the sea where it had opened; and, as the waters speedily came together again, he,
with all his host, was destroyed.</p>

<p>Then Moses, exulting in the safety of his own people, and in the destruction of the enemy,
by such a miracle,236 sang a song of praise to God, and the whole multitude, both of males
and females, took part in it. But, after they had entered the desert, and advanced a journey
of three days, want of water distressed them; and, when it was found, it proved of no use on
account of its bitterness. And then for the first time the stubbornness of the impatient people
showed itself, and burst forth against Moses; when, as instructed by God, he cast some wood
into the waters, and its power was such that it rendered the taste of the fluid sweet. Thence
advancing, the multitude found at Elim twelve fountains of waters, with seventy palm-trees,
and there they encamped. Again the people, complaining of famine, heaped reproaches
upon Moses, and longed for the slavery of Egypt, accompanied as it was with abundance to
please their appetite, when a flock of quails was divinely sent, and filled the camp. Besides,
on the following day, those who had gone forth from the camp perceived that the ground
was covered with a sort of pods,237 the appearance of which was like a coriander-seed of
snowy whiteness, as we often see the earth in the winter months covered with the hoar-frost
that has been spread over it. Then the people were informed, through Moses, that this bread
had been sent them by the gift of God; that every one should gather in vessels prepared for
the purpose only so much of it as would be sufficient for each, according to their number,
during one day; but that on the sixth day they should gather double, because it was not
lawful to collect it on the Sabbath. The people, however, as they were never prone to obedience,
did not, in accordance with human nature, restrain their desires, providing in their
stores not merely for one, but also for the following day. But that which was thus laid up
swarmed with worms, while its fetid odor was dreadful, yet that which was laid up on the
sixth day with a view to the Sabbath remained quite untainted. The Hebrews made use of
this food for forty years; its taste was very like that of honey; and its name is handed down
as being manna. Moreover, as an abiding witness to the divine gift, Moses is related to have
laid up a full gomer of it in a golden vessel.</p>
<note type="footnote">236 “Virtute.”</note>
<note type="footnote">237 This is a somewhat strange description of the manna. Hornius remarks upon it that there may be a reference

<p>The people going on from thence, and being again tried with want of water, hardly restrained
themselves from destroying their leader. Then Moses, under divine orders, striking
with his rod the rock at the place which is called Horeb, brought forth an abundant supply
of water. But when they came to Raphidin, the Amalekites destroyed numbers of the people
by their attacks. Moses, leading out his men to battle, placed Joshua at the head of the army;
and, in company with Aaron and Hur, was himself simply to be a spectator of the fight,
while, at the same time, for the purpose of praying to the Lord, he went up to the top of a
mountain. But when the armies had met with doubtful issue, through the prayers of Moses,
Joshua slew the enemy until nightfall. At the same time, Jothor, Moses’ father-in-law, with
his daughter Sepphora (who, having been married to Moses, had remained at home when
her husband went into Egypt), and his children, having learned the things which were being
done by Moses, came to him. By his advice Moses divided the people into various ranks;
and, setting tribunes, centurions, and decurions238 over them, thus furnished a mode of
discipline and order to posterity. Jothor then returned to his own country, while the Israelites
came on to Mount Sinai. There Moses was admonished by the Lord that the people should
be sanctified, since they were to hearken to the words of God; and that was carefully seen
to. But when God rested on the mountain, the air was shaken with the loud sounds of
trumpets, and thick clouds rolled around with frequent flashes of lightning. But Moses and
Aaron were on the top of the mountain beside the Lord, while the people stood around the
bottom of the mountain. Thus a law was given, manifold and full of the words of God, and
frequently repeated; but if any one is desirous of knowing particulars regarding it, he must
consult the original, as we here only briefly touch upon it. “There shall not be,” said God,
“any strange gods among you, but ye shall worship me alone; thou shalt not make to time
any idol; thou shalt not take the name of thy God in vain; thou shalt do no work upon the
Sabbath; honor thy father and thy mother; thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery;
thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor; thou shalt not
covet anything belonging to thy neighbor.”</p>

<p>These things being said by God, while the trumpets uttered their voices, the lamps
blazed, and smoke covered the mountain, the people trembled from terror; and begged of
Moses that God should speak to him alone, and that he would report to the people what he
thus heard. Now, the commandments of God to Moses were as follows: A Hebrew servant
purchased with money shall serve six years, and after that he shall be free; but his ear shall
be bored, should he willingly remain in slavery. Whosoever slays a man shall be put to death;
he who does so unwittingly shall in due form be banished. Whosoever shall beat his father
or his mother, and utter evil sayings against them, shall suffer death. If any one sell a Hebrew
who has been stolen, he shall be put to death. If any one strike his own man-servant or
maidservant, and he or she die of the blow, he shall be put on his trial for doing so. If any
one cause a woman239 to miscarry, he shall be put to death. If any one knock out the eye or
the tooth of his servant, that servant shall receive his liberty in due form. If a bull kill a man,
it shall be stoned; and if its master, knowing the vicious temper of the animal, did not take
precautions in connection with it, he also shall be stoned, or shall redeem himself by a price
as large as the accuser shall demand. If a bull kill a servant, money to the amount of thirty
double-drachmas shall be paid to his master. If any one does not cover up a pit which has
been dug, and an animal fall into that pit, he shall pay the price of the animal to its master.
If a bull kill the bull of another man, the animal shall be sold, and the two masters shall share
the price; they shall also divide the animal that has been killed. But if a master, knowing the
vicious temper of the bull, did not take precautions in connection with it, he shall give up
the bull. If any one steals a calf, he shall restore five; if he steals a sheep, the penalty shall be
fourfold; and if the animals be found alive in the hands of him who drove them off, he shall
restore double. It shall be lawful to kill a thief by night, but not one by day. If the cattle of
any one has eaten up the corn of another, the master of the cattle shall restore what has been
destroyed. If a deposit disappears, he, in whose hands it was deposited, shall swear that he
has not been guilty of any deceit. A thief who is caught shall pay double. An animal given
in trust, if devoured by a wild beast, shall not be made good. If any one defile a virgin not
yet betrothed, he shall bestow a dowry on the girl, and thus take her to wife; but, if the
father of the girl shall refuse to give her in marriage, then the ravisher shall give her a dowry.
If any one shall join himself to a beast, he shall be put to death. Let him who sacrifices to
idols perish. The widow and orphan are not to be oppressed; the poor debtor is not to be
hardly treated, nor is usury to be demanded: the garment of the poor is not to be taken as
a pledge. A ruler of the people is not to be evil spoken of. All the first-born are to be offered
to God. Flesh taken from a wild beast is not to be eaten. Agreements to bear false witness,
or for any evil purpose, are not to be made. Thou shalt not pass by any animal of thine enemy

which has strayed, but shalt bring it back. If you find an animal of your enemy fallen down
under a burden, it will be your duty to raise it up. Thou shalt not slay the innocent and the
righteous. Thou shalt not justify the wicked for rewards. Gifts are not to be accepted. A
stranger is to be kindly treated. Work is to be done on six days: rest is to be taken on the
Sabbath. The crops of the seventh year are not to be reaped, but are to be left for the poor
and needy.</p>

<p>Moses reported these words of God to the people, and placed an altar of twelve stones
at the foot of the mountain. Then he again ascended the mountain on which the Lord had
taken his place, bringing with him Aaron, Nabad, and seventy of the elders. But these were
not able to look upon the Lord; nevertheless, they saw the place240 in which God stood,
whose form is related to have been wonderful, and his splendor glorious. Now, Moses,
having been called by God, entered the inner cloud which had gathered round about God,
and is related to have remained there forty days and forty nights. During this time, he was
taught in the words of God about building the tabernacle and the ark, and about the ritual
of sacrifice-things which I, as they were obviously told at great length, have not thought
proper to be inserted in such a concise work as the present. But as Moses stayed away a long
time, since he spent forty days in the presence of the Lord, the people, despairing of his return,
compelled Aaron to construct images. Then, out of metals which had been melted together,
there came forth the head of a calf. The people, unmindful of God, having offered sacrifices
to this, and given themselves up to eating and drinking, God, looking upon these things,
would in his righteous indignation, have destroyed the wicked people, had he not been entreated
by Moses’ not to do so. But Moses, on his return, bringing down the two tables of
stone which had been written by the hand of God, and seeing the people devoted to luxury
and sacrilege, broke the tables, thinking the nation unworthy of having the law of the Lord
delivered to them. He then called around himself the Levites, who had been assailed with
many insults, and commanded them to smite the people with drawn swords. In this onset
twenty-three thousand241 men are said to have been slain. Then Moses set up the tabernacle
outside the camp; and, as often as he entered it, the pillar of cloud was observed to stand
before the door; and God spoke, face to face, with Moses. But when Moses entreated that
he might see the Lord in his peculiar majesty, he was answered that the form of God could
not be seen by mortal eyes; yet it was allowed to see his back parts; and the tables which
Moses had formerly broken were constructed afresh. And Moses is reported, during this
conference with God, to have stayed forty days with the Lord. Moreover, when he descended
from the mountain, bringing with him the tables, his face shone with so great brightness,
that the people were not able to look upon him. It was arranged, therefore, that when he
was to make known to them the commands of God, he covered his face with a veil, and thus
spoke to the people in the words of God. In this part of the history an account is given242
of the tabernacle, and the building of its inner parts. Which having been finished, the cloud

descended from above, and so overshadowed the tabernacle that it prevented Moses himself

<p>Then follows the book of Leviticus, in which the precepts bearing upon sacrifice are set
forth; commandments also are added to the law formerly given; and almost the whole is full
of instructions connected with the priests. If any one wishes to become acquainted with
these, he will obtain fuller information from that source. For we, keeping within the limits
of the work undertaken, touch upon the history only. The tribe of Levi, then, being set apart
for the priesthood, the rest of the tribes were numbered, and were found to amount to six
hundred and three thousand five hundred persons.243 When, therefore, the people made
use of the manna for food, as we have related above, even amid so many and so great kindnesses
of God, showing themselves, as ever, ungrateful, they longed after the worthless viands
to which they had been accustomed in Egypt. Then the Lord brought an enormous supply
of quails into the camp; and as they were eagerly tearing these to pieces, as soon as their lips
touched the flesh, they perished. There was indeed on that day a great destruction in the
camp, so that twenty and three thousand men are said to have died. Thus the people were
punished by the very food which they desired. Thence the company went forward, and came
to Faran; and Moses was instructed by the Lord that the land was now near, the possession
of which the Lord had promised them. Spies, accordingly, having been sent into it, they report
that it was a land blessed with all abundance, but that the nations were powerful, and the
towns fortified with immense walls. When this was made known to the people, fear seized
the minds of all; and to such a pitch of wickedness did they come, that, despising the authority
of Moses, they prepared to appoint for themselves a leader, under whose guidance they
might return to Egypt. Then Joshua and Caleb, who had been of the number of the spies,
rent their garments with tears, and implored the people not to believe the spies relating such
terrors; for that they themselves had been with them, and had found nothing dreadful in
that country; and that it behooved them to trust the promises of God, that these enemies
would rather become their prey than prove their destruction. But that stiff-necked race,
setting themselves against every good advice, rushed upon them to destroy them. And the
Lord, angry on account of these things, exposed a part of the people to be slain by the enemy,
while the spies were slain for having excited fear among the people.</p>

<p>There followed the revolt of those, who, with Dathan and Abiron as leaders, endeavored
to set themselves up against Moses and Aaron; but the earth, opening, swallowed them alive.
And not long after, a revolt of the whole people arose against Moses and Aaron, so that they
rushed into the tabernacle, which it was not lawful for any but the priests to enter. Then
truly death mowed them down in heaps; and all would have perished in a moment, had not
the Lord, appeased by the prayers of Moses, turned aside the disaster. Nevertheless, the
number of those slain amounted to seven hundred and fourteen thousand.244 And not long
after, as had already often happened, a revolt of the people arose on account of the want of
water. Then Moses, instructed by God to strike the rock with his rod, with a kind of trial
new familiar to him, since he had already done that before, struck the rock once and again,
and thus water flowed out of it. In regard, however, to this point, Moses is said to have been
reproved by God, that, through want of faith, he did not bring out the water except by repeated
blows; in fact, on account of this transgression, he did not enter the land promised
to him, as I shall show farther on. Moses, then, moving away from that place, as he was
preparing to lead his company along by the borders of Edom, sent ambassadors to the king
to beg liberty to pass by; for he thought it right to abstain from war on account of the connection
by blood; for that nation was descended from Esau. But the king despised the suppliants,
and refused them liberty to pass by, being ready to contend in arms. Then Moses
directed his march towards the mountain, Or, keeping clear of the forbidden road, that he
might not furnish any cause of war between those related by blood, and on that route he
destroyed the king of the nation of the Canaanites. He smote also Seon the king of the
Amorites, and possessed himself of all their towns: he conquered, too, Basan and Balac. He
pitched his camp beyond Jordan, not far from Jericho. Then a battle took place against the
Midianites, and they were conquered and subdued. Moses died, after he had ruled the people
forty years in the wilderness. But the Hebrews are said to have remained in the wilderness
for so long a time, with this view, until all those who had not believed the words of God
perished. For, except Joshua and Caleb, not one of those who were more than twenty years
old on leaving Egypt passed over Jordan. That Moses himself only saw the promised land,
and did not reach it, is ascribed to his sin, because, at that time when he was ordered to
strike the rock, and bring forth water, he doubted, even after so many proofs of his miraculous
power. He died in the one hundred and twentieth year of his age. Nothing is known concerning
the place of his burial.</p>

<p>After the death of Moses, the chief power passed into the hands of Joshua the son of
Nun, for Moses had appointed him his successor, being a man very like himself in the good
qualities which he displayed. Now, at the commencement of his rule, he sent messengers
through the camp to instruct the people to make ready supplies of corn, and announces that
they should march on the third day. But the river Jordan, a very powerful stream, hindered
their crossing, because they did not have a supply of vessels for the occasion, and the stream
could not be crossed by fords, as it was then rushing on in full flood. He, therefore, orders
the ark to be carried forward by the priests, and that they should take their stand against
the current of the river. On this being done, Jordan is said to have been divided, and thus
the army was led over on dry ground. There was in these places a town called Jericho, fortified
with very strong walls, and not easy to be taken, either by storm or blockade. But Joshua,
putting his trust in God, did not attack the city either by arms or force; he simply ordered
the ark of God to be carried round the walls, while the priests walked before the ark, and
sounded trumpets. But when the ark had been carried round seven times, the walls and the
towers fell; and the city was plundered and burnt. Then Joshua is said to have addressed the
Lord, and245 to have called down a curse upon any one who should attempt to restore the
town which had thus by divine help been demolished. Next, the army was led against Geth,
and an ambuscade having been placed behind the city, Joshua, pretending fear, fled before
the enemy. On seeing this, those who were in the town, opening the gates, began to press
upon the enemy giving way. Thus, the men who were in ambush took the city, and all the
inhabitants were slain, without one escaping: the king also was taken, and suffered capital
punishment.</p>

<p>When this became known to the kings of the neighboring nations, they made a warlike
alliance to put down the Hebrews by arms. But the Gibeonites, a powerful nation with a
wealthy city, spontaneously yielded to the Hebrews, promising to do what they were ordered,
and were received under protection, while they were told to bring in wood and water. But
their surrender had roused the resentment of the kings of the nearest cities. Accordingly,
moving up their troops, they surround with a blockade their town, which was called Gabaoth.
The townspeople, therefore, in their distress, send messengers to Joshua, that he would help
them in their state of siege. Accordingly, he by a forced march came upon the enemy at
unawares, and many thousands of them were completely destroyed. When day failed the
victors, and it seemed that night would furnish protection to the vanquished, the Hebrew
general, through the power of his faith, kept off the night, and the day continued, so that
there was no means of escape for the enemy. Five kings who were taken suffered death. By
the same attack, neighboring cities also were brought under the power of Joshua, and their
kings were cut off. But as it was not my design, studious as I am of brevity, to follow out all
these things in order, I only carefully observe this, that twenty-nine kingdoms were brought
under the yoke of the Hebrews, and that their territory was distributed among eleven tribes,
to man after man. For to the Levites, who had been set apart for the priesthood, no portion
was given, in order that they might the more freely serve God. I desire not, in silence, to
pass over the example thus set, but I would earnestly bring it forward as well worthy of being
read by the ministers of the Church. For these seem to me not only unmindful of this precept,
but even utterly ignorant of it—such a lust for possessing has, in this age, seized, like an incurable
disease, upon their minds. They gape upon possessions; they cultivate estates; they
repose upon gold; they buy and sell; they study gain by every possible means. And even, if
any of them seem to have a better aim in life, neither possessing nor trading, still (what is
much more disgraceful) remaining inactive, they look for gifts, and have corrupted the
whole glory of life by their mercenary dispositions, while they present an appearance of
sanctity, as if even that might be made a source of gain. But I have gone farther than I intended
in expressing my loathing and disgust over the character of our times; and I hasten to
return to the subject in hand. The vanquished territory, then, as I have already said, having
been divided among the tribes, the Hebrews enjoyed profound peace; their neighbors, being
terrified by war, did not venture to attempt hostilities against those distinguished by so
many victories. At the same period died Joshua in the hundred and tenth year of his age. I
do not express any definite opinion as to the length of time he ruled: the prevalent view,
however, is, that he was at the head of the Hebrew affairs during twenty-seven years. If this
were so, then three thousand eight hundred and eighty-four years had elapsed from the
beginning of the world to his death.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<p>After the death of Joshua, the people acted without a leader. But a necessity of making
war with the Canaanites having arisen, Judah was appointed as general in the war. Under
his guidance, matters were successfully conducted: there was the greatest tranquillity both
at home and abroad: the people ruled over the nations which had either been subdued or
received under terms of surrender. Then, as almost always happens in a time of prosperity,
becoming unmindful of morals and discipline, they began to contract marriages from among
the conquered, and by and by to adopt foreign customs, yea, even in a sacrilegious manner
to offer sacrifice to idols: so pernicious is all alliance with foreigners. God, foreseeing these
things long before, had, by a wholesome precept enjoined upon the Hebrews to give over
the conquered nations to utter destruction. But the people, through lust for power, preferred
(to their own ruin) to rule over those who were conquered. Accordingly, when, forsaking
God, they worshiped idols, they were deprived of the divine assistance, and, being vanquished
and subdued by the king of Mesopotamia, they paid the penalty of eight years’ captivity,
until, with Gothoniel as their leader, they were restored to liberty, and enjoyed independence
for fifty years. Then again, corrupted by the evil effect of a lengthened peace, they began to
sacrifice to idols. And speedily did retribution fall upon them thus sinning. Conquered by
Eglon, king of the Moabites, they served him eighteen years, until, by a divine impulse, Aod
slew the enemies’ king by a stratagem, and, gathering together a hasty army, restored them
to liberty by force of arms. The same man ruled the Hebrews in peace for forty years. To
him Semigar succeeded, and he, engaging in battle with the Philistines,246 secured a decisive
victory. But again, the king of the Canaanites, Jabin by name, subdued the Hebrews who
were once more serving idols, and exercised over them a grievous tyranny for twenty years,
until Deborah, a woman, restored them to their former condition. They had to such a degree
lost confidence in their generals, that they were now protected by means of a woman. But
it is worthy of notice, that this form of deliverance was arranged beforehand, as a type of
the Church, by whose aid captivity to the devil is escaped. The Hebrews were forty years
under this leader or judge. And being again delivered over to the Midianites for their sins,
they were kept under hard rule; and, being afflicted by the evils of slavery, they implored
the divine help. Thus always when in prosperity they were unmindful of the kindnesses of
heaven, and prayed to idols; but in adversity they cried to God. Wherefore, as often as I reflect
that those people who lay under so many obligations to the goodness of God, being chastised
with so many disasters when they sinned, and experiencing both the mercy and the severity
of God, yet were by no means rendered better, and that, though they always obtained pardon
for their transgressions, yet they as constantly sinned again after being pardoned, it can
appear nothing wonderful that Christ when he came was not received by them, since already,
<note type="footnote">246 “Allophylos”: lit. strangers.</note>

<pb n="204"/>
from the beginning, they were found so often rebelling against the Lord. It is, in fact, far
more wonderful that the clemency of God never failed them when they sinned, if only they
called upon his name.247</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the Midianites, as we have related above, ruled over them, they
turned to the Lord, imploring his wonted tender mercy, and obtained it. There was then
among the Hebrews one Gideon by name, a righteous man who was dear and acceptable to
God. The angel stood by him as he was returning home from the harvest-field, and said
unto him, “The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.” But he in a humble voice
complained that the Lord was not248 with him, because captivity pressed sore upon his
people, and he remembered with tears the miracles wrought by the Lord, who had brought
them out of the land of Egypt. Then the angel said, “Go, in this spirit in which you have
spoken, and deliver the people from captivity.” But he declared that he could not, with his249
feeble strength, since he was a man of very small importance, undertake such a heavy task.
The angel, however, persisted in urging him not to doubt that those things could be done
which the Lord said. So then, having offered sacrifice, and overthrown the altar which the
Midianites had consecrated to the image of Baal, he went to his own people, and pitched
his camp near the camp of the enemy. But the nation of the Amalekites had also joined
themselves to the Midianites, while Gideon had not gathered more than an army of thirtytwo
thousand men. But before the battle began, God said to him that this was a larger
number than he wished him to lead forth to the conflict; that, if he did make use of so many,
the Hebrews would, in accordance with their usual wickedness ascribe the result of the fight,
not to God, but to their own bravery; he should therefore furnish an opportunity of leaving
to those who desired to do so. When this was made known to the people, twenty and two
thousand left the camp. But of the ten thousand who had remained, Gideon, as instructed
by God, did not retain more than three hundred: the rest he dismissed from the field. Thus,
entering the camp of the enemy in the middle watch of the night, and having ordered all
his men to sound their trumpets, he caused great terror to the enemy; and no one had
courage to resist; but they made off in a disgraceful flight wherever they could. The Hebrews,
however, meeting them in every direction, cut the fugitives to pieces. Gideon pursued the
kings beyond Jordan, and having captured them, gave them over to death. In that battle, a
hundred and twenty thousand of the enemy are said to have been slain, and fifteen thousand
captured. Then, by universal consent, a proposal was made to Gideon that he should be
king of the people. But he rejected this proposal, and preferred rather to live on equal terms
with his fellow-citizens than to be their ruler. Having, therefore, escaped from their captivity,
which had pressed upon the people for seven years, they now enjoyed peace for a period of
forty years.</p>

<p>But on the death of Gideon, his son Abimelech, whose mother was a concubine, having
slain his brothers with the concurrence of a multitude of wicked men, and especially by the
help of the chief men among the Shechemites, took possession of the kingdom. And he,
being harassed by civil strife, while he pressed hard upon his people by war, attempted to
storm a certain tower, into which they, after losing the town, had betaken themselves by
flight. But, as he approached the place without sufficient caution, he was slain by a stone
which a woman threw, after holding the government for three years. To him succeeded
Thola, who reigned two and twenty years. After him came Jair; and after he had held the
chief place for a like period of twenty-two years, the people, forsaking God, gave themselves
up to idols. On this account, the Israelites were subdued by the Philistines and Ammonites,
and remained under their power for eighteen years. At the end of this period, they began
to call upon God; but the divine answer to them was that they should rather invoke the aid
of their images, for that he would no longer extend his mercy to those who had been so
ungrateful. But they with tears confessed their fault, and implored forgiveness; while,
throwing away their idols, and earnestly calling upon God, they obtained the divine compassion,
though it had been at first refused. Accordingly, under Jephtha as general, they assembled
in great numbers for the purpose of recovering their liberty by arms, having first
sent ambassadors to King Ammon, begging that, content with his own territories, he should
keep from warring against them. But he, far from declining battle, at once drew up his army.
Then Jephtha, before the signal for battle was given, is said to have vowed that, if he obtained
the victory, the person who first met him as he returned home, should be offered to God as
a sacrifice. Accordingly, on the enemy being defeated, as Jephtha was returning home, his
daughter met him, having joyfully gone forth with drums and dances to receive her father
as a conqueror. Then Jephtha, being overwhelmed with sorrow, rent his clothes in his afflic-
tion, and made known to his daughter the stringent obligation of his vow. But she, with a
courage not to be expected from a woman, did not refuse to die; she only begged that her
life might be spared for two months, that she might before dying have the opportunity of
seeing the friends of her own age. This being done, she willingly returned to her father, and
fulfilled the vow to God. Jephtha held the chief power for six years. To him Esebon succeeded,
and having ruled in tranquillity for seven years, then died. After him, Elon the Zebulonite
ruled for ten years, and Abdon also for eight years; but, as their rule was peaceful, they performed
nothing which history might record.</p>

<p>The Israelites yet again turned to idols; and, being deprived of the divine protection,
were subdued by the Philistines, and paid the penalty of their unfaithfulness by forty years
of captivity. At that time, Samson is related to have been born. His mother, after being long
barren, had a vision of an angel, and was told to abstain from wine, and strong drink, and
everything unclean; for that she should bear a son who would be the restorer of liberty to
the Israelites, and their avenger upon their enemies. He, with unshorn locks, is said to have
been possessed of marvelous strength, so much so that he tore to pieces with his hands a lion
which met him in the way. He had a wife from the Philistines, and when she, in the absence
of her husband, had entered into marriage with another, he, through indignation on account
of his wife being thus taken from him, wrought destruction to her nation. Trusting in God
and his own strength, he openly brought disaster on those hitherto victors. For, catching
three hundred foxes, he tied burning torches to their tails, and sent them into the fields of
the enemy. It so happened that at the time the harvest was ripe, and thus the fire easily
caught, while the vines and olive-trees were burnt to ashes. He was thus seen to have avenged
the injury done him in taking away his wife, by a great loss inflicted on the Philistines. And
they, enraged at this disaster, destroyed by fire the woman who had been the cause of so
great a calamity, along with her house and her father. But Samson, thinking himself as yet
but poorly avenged, ceased not to harass the heathen race with all sorts of evil devices. Then
the Jews, being compelled to it, handed him over as a prisoner to the Philistines; but, when
thus handed over, he burst his bonds and seizing the jaw-bone250 of an ass, which chance
offered him as a weapon, he slew a thousand of his enemies. And, as the heat of the day grew
violent, and he began to suffer from thirst, he called upon God, and water flowed forth
from251 the bone which he held in his hand.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<p>At that time Samson ruled over the Hebrews, the Philistines having been subdued by
the prowess of a single individual. They, therefore, sought his life by stratagem, not daring
to assail him openly, and with this view they bribe his wife (whom he had received after
what has been stated took place) to betray to them wherein the strength of her husband lay.
She attacked him with female blandishments; and, after he had deceived her, and staved off
her purpose for a long time, she persuaded him to tell that his strength was situated in his
hair. Presently she cut off his hair stealthily while he was asleep, and thus delivered him up
to the Philistines; for although he had often before been given up to them, they had not been
able to hold him fast. Then they, having put out his eyes, bound him with fetters, and cast
him into prison. But, in course of time, his hair which had been cut off began to grow again,
and his strength to return with it. And now Samson, conscious of his recovered strength,
was only waiting for an opportunity of righteous revenge. The Philistines had a custom on
their festival days of producing Samson as if to make a public spectacle of him, while they
mocked their illustrious captive. Accordingly, on a certain day, when they were making a
feast in honor of their idol, they ordered Samson to be exhibited. Now, the temple, in which
all the people and all the princes of the Philistines feasted, rested on two pillars of remarkable
size; and Samson, when brought out, was placed between these pillars. Then he, having first
called upon the Lord, seized his opportunity, and threw down the pillars. The whole multitude
was overwhelmed in the ruins of the building, and Samson himself died along with his enemies,
not without having avenged himself upon them, after he had ruled the Hebrews
twenty years. To him Simmichar succeeded, of whom Scripture relates nothing more than
that simple fact. For I do not find that even the time when his rule came to an end is mentioned,
and I see that the people was for some time without a leader. Accordingly, when
civil war arose against the tribe of Benjamin, Judah was chosen as a temporary leader in the
war. But most of those who have written about these times note that his rule was only for a
single year. On this account, many pass him by altogether, and place Eli, the priest, immediately
after Samson. We shall leave that point doubtful, as one not positively ascertained.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">

<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<p>About these times, civil war, as we have said, had broken out; and the following was the
cause of the tumult. A certain Levite was on a journey along with his concubine, and, constrained
by the approach of night, he took up his abode in the town of Gabaa, which was
inhabited by men of Benjamin. A certain old man having kindly admitted him to hospitality,
the young men of the town surrounded the guest, with the view of subjecting him to improper
treatment. After being much chidden by the old man, and with difficulty dissuaded from
their purpose, they at length received for their wanton sport the person of his concubine as
a substitute for his own; and they thus spared the stranger, but abused her through the whole
night, and only restored her on the following day. But she (whether from the injury their
vile conduct had inflicted on her, or from shame, I do not venture to assert) died on again
seeing252 her husband. Then the Levite, in testimony of the horrible deed, divided her
members into twelve parts, and distributed them among the twelve tribes that indignation
at such conduct might the more readily be excited in them all. And when this became known
to all of them, the other eleven tribes entered into a warlike confederacy against Benjamin.
In this war, Judah, as we have said, was the general. But they had bad success in the first two
battles. At length, however, in the third, the Benjamites were conquered, and cut off to a
man; thus the crime of a few was punished by the destruction of a multitude. These things
also are contained in the Book of Judges: the Books of Kings follow. But to me who am following
the succession of the years, and the order of the dates, the history does not appear
marked by strict chronological accuracy. For, since after Samson as judge, there came
Semigar, and a little later the history certifies that the people lived without judges, Eli the
priest is related in the Books of Kings to have also been a judge,253 but the Scripture has not
stated how many years there were between Eli and Samson. I see that there was some portion
of time between these two, which is left in obscurity. But, from the day of the death of Joshua
up to the time at which Samson died, there are reckoned four hundred and eighteen years,
and from the beginning of the world, four thousand three hundred and three. Nevertheless,
I am not ignorant that others differ from this reckoning of ours; but I am at the same time
conscious that I have, not without some care, set forth the order of events in the successive
years (a thing hitherto left in obscurity), until I have fallen upon these times, concerning
which I confess that I have my doubts. Now I shall go on to what remains.</p>

<p>The Hebrews, then, as I have narrated above, were living according to their own will,
without any judge or general. Eli was priest; and in his days Samuel was born. His father’s
name was Elchana, and his mother’s, Anna. She having long been barren, is said, when she
asked a child from God, to have vowed that, if it were a boy, it should be dedicated to God.
Accordingly, having brought forth a boy, she delivered him to Eli the priest. By and by,
when he had grown up, God spoke to him. He denounced wrath against Eli the priest on
account of the life of his sons, who had made the priesthood of their father a means of gain
to themselves, and exacted gifts from those who came to sacrifice; and, although their father
is related to have often reproved them, yet his reproofs were too gentle to serve the purpose
of discipline. Well, the Philistines made an incursion into Judæa, and were met by the Israelites.
But the Hebrews, being beaten, prepare to renew the contest: they carry the ark of the
Lord with them into battle, and the sons of the priests go forth with it, because he himself,
being burdened with years, and afflicted with blindness, could not discharge that duty. But,
when the ark was brought within sight of the enemy, terrified as if by the majesty of God’s
presence, they were ready to take to flight. But again recovering courage, and changing their
minds (not without a divine impulse), they rush into battle with their whole strength. The
Hebrews were conquered; the ark was taken; the sons of the priest fell. Eli, when the news
of the calamity was brought to him, being overwhelmed with grief, breathed his last, after
he had held the priesthood for twenty254 years.</p>

<p>The Philistines, victorious in this prosperous battle, brought the ark of God, which had
fallen into their hands, into the temple of Dagon in the town of Azotus. But the image,
dedicated to a demon, fell down when the ark was brought in there; and, on their setting
the idol up again in its place, in the following night it was torn in pieces. Then mice,
springing up throughout all the country, caused by their venomous bites the death of many
thousand persons.255 The men of Azotus, constrained by this source of suffering, in order
to escape the calamity, removed the ark to Gath. But the people there being afflicted with
the same evils, conveyed the ark to Ascalon. The inhabitants, however, of that place, the
chief men of the nation having been called together, formed the design of sending back the
ark to the Hebrews. Thus, in accordance with the opinion of the chiefs, and augurs, and
priests, it was placed upon a cart, and sent back with many gifts. This remarkable thing then
happened, that when they had yoked heifers to the conveyance, and had retained their calves
at home, these cattle took their course, without any guide, towards Judæa, and showed no
desire of returning, from affection toward their young left behind. The rulers of the Philistines,
who had followed the ark into the territory of the Hebrews, were so struck by the
marvelousness of this occurrence that they performed a religious service. But the Jews, when
they saw the ark brought back, vied with each other in joyously rushing forth from the town
of Betsamis to meet it, and in hurrying, exulting, and returning thanks to God. Presently,
the Levites, whose business it was, perform a sacrifice to God, and offer those heifers which
had brought the ark. But the ark could not be kept in the town which I have named above,
and thus severe illness fell by the appointment of God, upon the whole city. The ark was
then transferred to the town of Cariathiarim,256 and there it remained twenty years.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
<p>At this time, Samuel the priest257 ruled over the Hebrews; and there being a cessation
of all war, the people lived in peace. But this tranquillity was disturbed by an invasion of
the Philistines, and all ranks were in a state of terror from their consciousness of guilt.
Samuel, having first offered sacrifice, and trusting in God, led his men out to battle, and the
enemy being routed at the first onset, victory declared for the Hebrews. But when the fear
of the enemy was thus removed, and affairs were now prosperous and peaceful, the people,
changing their views for the worse, after the manner of the mob, who are always weary of
what they have, and long for things of which they have had no experience, expressed a desire
for the kingly name—a name greatly disliked by almost all free nations. Yes, with an example
of madness certainly very remarkable, they now preferred to exchange liberty for slavery.
They, therefore, come in great numbers to Samuel, in order that, as he himself was now an
old man, he might make for them a king. But he endeavored in a useful address, quietly to
deter the people from their insane desire; he set forth the tyranny and haughty rule of kings,
while he extolled liberty, and denounced slavery; finally, he threatened them with the divine
wrath, if they should show themselves men so corrupt in mind as that, when having God
as their king, they should demand for themselves a king from among men. Having spoken
these and other words of a like nature to no purpose, finding that the people persisted in
the determination, he consulted God. And God, moved by the madness of that insane nation,
replied that nothing was to be refused to them asking against their own interests.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<p>Accordingly, Saul, having been first anointed by Samuel with the sacerdotal oil, was
appointed king. He was of the tribe of Benjamin, and his father’s name was Kish. He was
modest in mind, and of a singularly handsome figure, so that the dignity of his person
worthily corresponded to the royal dignity. But in the beginning of his reign, some portion
of the people had revolted from him, refusing to acknowledge his authority, and had joined
themselves to the Ammonites. Saul, however, energetically wreaked his vengeance on these
people; the enemy were conquered, and pardon was granted to the Hebrews. Then Saul is
said to have been anointed by Samuel a second time. Next, a bloody war arose by an invasion
of the Philistines; and Saul had appointed Gilgal as the place where his army was to assemble.
As they waited there seven days for Samuel, that he might offer sacrifice to God, the people
gradually dropped away owing to his delay, and the king, with unlawful presumption,
presented a burnt-offering, thus taking upon him the duty of a priest. For this he was severely
rebuked by Samuel, and acknowledged his sin with a penitence that was too late. For, as a
result of the king’s sin, fear had pervaded the whole army. The camp of the enemy lying at
no great distance showed them how actual the danger was, and no one had the courage to
think of going forth to battle: most had be-taken themselves to the marshes.258 For besides
the want of courage on the part of those who felt that God was alienated from them on account
of the king’s sin, the army was in the greatest want of iron weapons; so much so that
nobody, except Saul and Jonathan his son, is said to have possessed either sword or spear.
For the Philistines, as conquerors in the former wars, had deprived the Hebrews of the use
of arms,259 and no one had had the power of forging any weapon of war, or even making
any implement for rural purposes. In these circumstances, Jonathan, with an audacious
design, and with his armor-bearer as his only companion, entered the camp of the enemy,
and having slain about twenty of them, spread a terror throughout the whole army. And
then, through the appointment of God, betaking themselves to flight, they neither carried
out orders nor kept their ranks, but placed all the hope of safety in flight. Saul, perceiving
this, hastily drew forth his men, and pursuing the fugitives, obtained a victory. The king is
said on that day to have issued a proclamation that no one should help himself to food until
the enemy were destroyed. But Jonathan, knowing nothing of this prohibition, found a
honey-comb, and, dipping the point of his weapon in it, ate up the honey. When that became
known to the king through the anger of God which followed, he ordered his son to be put
to death. But by the help of the people, he was saved from destruction. At that time, Samuel,
being instructed by God, went to the king, and told him in the words of God to make war

on the nation of the Amalekites, who had of old hindered the Hebrews when they were
coming out of Egypt; and the prohibition was added that they should not covet any of the
spoils of the conquered. Accordingly, an army was led into the territory of the enemy, the
king was taken, and the nation subdued. But Saul, unable to resist the magnitude of the
spoil, and unmindful of the divine injunctions, ordered the booty to be saved and gathered
together.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
<p>God, displeased with what had been done, spoke to Samuel, saying that he repented
that he had made Saul king. The priest reports what he had heard to the king. And ere long,
being instructed by God, he anointed David with the royal oil, while he was as yet only a
little boy260 living under the care of his father, and acting as a shepherd, while he was accustomed
often to play upon the harp. For this reason, he was taken afterwards by Saul, and
reckoned among the servants of the king. And the Philistines and Hebrews being at this
time hotly engaged in war, as the armies were stationed opposite to each other, a certain
man of the Philistines named Goliath, a man of marvelous size and strength, passing along
the ranks of his countrymen, cast insults, in the fiercest terms, upon the enemy, and challenged
any one to engage in single combat with him. Then the king promised a great reward
and his daughter in marriage to any one who should bring home the spoils of that boaster;
but no one out of so great a multitude ventured to make the attempt. In these circumstances,
though still a youth,261 David offered himself for the contest, and rejecting the arms by
which his yet tender age was weighed down, simply with a staff and five stones which he
had taken, advanced to the battle. And by the first blow, having discharged one of the stones
from a sling, he overthrew the Philistine; then he cut off the head of his conquered foe,
carried off his spoils, and afterwards laid up his sword in the temple. In the meanwhile, all
the Philistines, turning to flight, yielded the victory to the Hebrews. But the great favor
shown to David as they were returning from the battle excited the envy of the king. Fearing,
however, that if he put to death one so beloved by all, that might give rise to hatred against
himself and prove disastrous, he resolved, under an appearance of doing him honor, to expose
him to danger. First then he made him a captain, that he might be charged with the affairs
of war; and next, although he had promised him his daughter, he broke his word, and gave
her to another. Ere long, a younger daughter of the king, Melchol by name, fell violently in
love with David. Accordingly, Saul sets before David as the condition of obtaining her in
marriage the following proposal: that if he should bring in a hundred foreskins of the enemy,
the royal maiden would be given him in marriage; for he hoped that the youth, venturing
on so great dangers, would probably perish. But the result proved very different from what
he imagined, for David, according to the proposal made to him, speedily brought in a hundred
foreskins of the Philistines; and thus he obtained the daughter of the king in marriage.</p>

<p>The hatred of the king towards him increased daily, under the influence of jealousy, for
the wicked always persecute the good. He, therefore, commanded his servants and Jonathan
his son, to prepare snares against his life. But Jonathan had even from the first had a great
regard and affection for David; and therefore the king, being taken to task by his son, suppressed
the cruel order he had given. But the wicked are not long good. For, when Saul was
afflicted by a spirit of error, and David stood by him, soothing him with the harp under his
trouble, Saul tried to pierce him with a spear, and would have done so, had not he rapidly
evaded the deadly blow. From this time forth, the king no longer secretly but openly sought
to compass his death; and David no longer trusted himself in his power. He fled, and first
betook himself to Samuel, then to Abimelech, and finally fled to the king of Moab. By-andby,
under the instructions of the prophet Gad, he returned into the land of Judah, and there
ran in danger of his life. At that time, Saul slew Abimelech the priest because he had received
David; and when none of the king’s servants ventured to lay hands upon the priest, Doeg,
the Syrian, fulfilled the cruel duty. After that, David made for the desert. Thither Saul also
followed him, but his efforts at his destruction were in vain, for God protected him. There
was a cave in the desert, opening with a vast recess. David had thrown himself into the inner
parts of this cave. Saul, not knowing that he was there, had gone into it for the purpose of
taking262 bodily refreshment, and there, overcome by sleep, he was resting. When David
perceived this, although all urged him to avail himself of the opportunity, he abstained from
slaying the king, and simply took away his mantle. Presently going out, he addressed the
king from a safe position behind, recounting the services he had done him, how often he
had exposed his life to peril for the sake of the kingdom, and how last of all, he had not, on
the present occasion, sought to kill him when he was given over to him by God. Upon
hearing these things, Saul confessed his fault, entreated pardon, shed tears, extolled the piety
of David, and blamed his own wickedness, while he addressed David as king and son. He
was so much changed from his former ferocious character, that no one could now have
thought he would make any further attempt against his son-in-law. But David, who had
thoroughly263 tested and known his evil disposition, did not think it safe to put himself in
the power of the king, and kept himself within the desert. Saul, almost mad with rage, because
he was unable to capture his son-in-law, gave in marriage to one Faltim his daughter Melchol,
who, as we have related above, had been married to David. David fled to the Philistines.</p>

<p>At that time Samuel died. Saul, when the Philistines made war upon him, consulted
God, and no answer was returned to him. Then, by means of a woman whose entrails a
spirit of error264 had filled, he called up and consulted Samuel. Saul was informed by him
that on the following day he with his sons, being overcome by the Philistines, would fall in
the battle. The Philistines, accordingly, having pitched their camp on the enemy’s territory,
drew up their army in battle array on the following day, David, however, being sent away
from the camp, because they did not believe that he would be faithful to them against his
own people. But the battle taking place, the Hebrews were routed and the sons of the king
fell; Saul, having sunk down from his horse, that he might not be taken alive by the enemy,
fell on his own sword. We do not find any certain statements as to the length of his reign,
unless that he is said in the Acts of the Apostles to have reigned forty years. As to this,
however, I am inclined to think that Paul, who made the statement in his preaching, then
meant to include also the years of Samuel under the length of that king’s reign.265 Most of
those, however, who have written about these times, remark that he reigned thirty years. I
can, by no means, agree with this opinion, for at the time when the ark of God was transferred
to the town of Cariathiarim, Saul had not yet begun to reign, and it is related that the ark
was removed by David the king out of that town after it had been there twenty years.
Therefore, since Saul reigned and died within that period, he must have held the government
only for a very brief space of time. We find the same obscurity concerning the times of
Samuel, who, having been born under the priesthood of Eli, is related, when very old, to
have fulfilled the duties of a priest. By some, however, who have written about these times
(for the sacred history has recorded almost nothing about his years),266 but by most he is
said to have ruled the people seventy years. I have, however, been unable to discover what
authority there is for this assumption. Amid such variety of error, we have followed the account
of the Chronicles,267 because we think that it was taken (as said above) from the Acts
of the Apostles, and we repeat that Samuel and Saul together held the government for forty
years</p>

<p>Saul having thus been cut off, David, when the news of his death was brought to him
in the land of the Philistines, is related to have wept, and to have given a marvelous proof
of his affection. He then betook himself to Hebron, a town of Judæa; and, being there again
anointed with the royal oil, received the title of king. But Abenner, who had been master of
the host of King Saul, despised David, and made Isbaal king, the son of King Saul. Various
battles then took place between the generals of the kings. Abenner was generally routed; yet
in his flight he cut off the brother of Joab, who had the command of the army on the side
of David. Joab, on account of the sorrow he felt for this, afterwards, when Abenner had
surrendered to King David, ordered him to be murdered, not without regret on the part of
the king, whose honor he had thus tarnished. At the same time, almost all the older men of
the Hebrews conferred on him by public consent the sovereignty of the whole nation; for
during seven years he had reigned only in Hebron. Thus, he was anointed king for the third
time, being about thirty years of age. He repulsed in successful battles the Philistines making
inroads upon his kingdom. And at that time, he transferred to Zion the ark of God, which,
as I have said above, was in the town of Cariathiarim. And when he had formed the intention
of building a temple to God, the divine answer was given him to the effect, that that was
reserved for his son. He then conquered the Philistines in war, subjugated the Moabites,
and subdued Syria, imposing tribute upon it. He brought back with him an enormous
amount of booty in gold and brass. Next, a war arose against the Ammonites on account of
the injury which had been done by their king, Annon. And when the Syrians again rebelled,
having formed a confederacy for war with the Ammonites, David intrusted the chief command
of the war to Joab, the master of his host, and he himself remained in Jerusalem far
from the scene of strife.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
<p>At this time, he knew in a guilty way Bersabe, a woman of remarkable beauty. She is
said to have been the wife of a certain man called Uriah, who was then in the camp. David
caused him to be slain by exposing him to the enemy at a dangerous place in the battle. In
this way, he added to the number of his wives the woman who was now free from the bond
of marriage, but who was already pregnant through adultery. Then David, after being severely
reproved by Nathan the prophet, although he confessed his sin, did not escape the punishment
of God. For he lost in a few days the son who was born from the clandestine connection,
and many terrible things happened in respect to his house and family. At last his son Absalom
lifted impious arms against his father, with the desire of driving him from the throne. Joab
encountered him in the field of battle, and the king entreated him to spare the young man
when conquered; but he, disregarding this command, avenged with the sword his parricidal
attempts. That victory is said to have been a mournful one to the king: so great was his
natural affection that he wished even his parricidal son to be forgiven. This war seemed
hardly finished when another arose, under a certain general called Sabæa, who had stirred
up all the wicked to arms. But the whole commotion was speedily checked by the death of
the leader. David then engaged in several battles against the Philistines with favorable results;
and all being subdued by war, both foreign and home disturbances having been brought to
accord, he possessed in peace a most flourishing kingdom. Then a sudden desire seized him
of numbering the people, in order to ascertain the strength of his empire; and accordingly
they were numbered by Joab, the master of the host, and were found to amount to one
million three hundred thousand268 citizens. David soon regretted and repented of this
proceeding, and implored pardon of God for having lifted up his thoughts to this, that he
should reckon the power of his kingdom rather by the multitude of his subjects than by the
divine favor. Accordingly, an angel was sent to him to reveal to him a threefold punishment,
and to give him the power of choosing either one or another. Well, when a famine for three
years was set before him, and flight before his enemies for three months, and a pestilence
for three days, shunning both flight and famine, he made choice of pestilence, and, almost
in a moment of time, seventy thousand men perished. Then David, beholding the angel by
whose right hand the people were overthrown, implored pardon, and offered himself singly
to punishment instead of all, saying that he deserved destruction inasmuch as it was he who
had sinned. Thus, the punishment of the people was turned aside; and David built an altar
to God on the spot where he had beheld the angel. After this, having become infirm through
years and illness, he appointed Solomon, who had been born to him by Bersabe, the wife of
<note type="footnote">268 As is often the case with respect to numbers, there are discrepancies in the various accounts given of this
census.</note>

<pb n="220"/>
Uriah, his successor in the kingdom. He, having been anointed with the royal oil by Sadoc
the priest, received the title of king, while his father was still alive. David died, after he had
reigned forty years.</p>

<p>Solomon in the beginning of his reign surrounded the city with a wall. To him while
asleep God appeared standing by him, and gave him the choice of whatever things he desired.
But he asked that nothing more than wisdom should be granted him, deeming all other
things of little value. Accordingly, when he arose from sleep, taking his stand before the
sanctuary of God, he gave a proof of the wisdom which had been bestowed upon him by
God. For two women who dwelt in one house, having given birth to male children at the
same time, and one of these having died in the night three days afterwards, the mother of
the dead child, while the other woman slept, insidiously substituted her child, and took away
the living one. Then there arose an altercation between them, and the matter was at length
brought before the king. As no witness was forthcoming, it was a difficult matter to give a
judgment between both denying guilt. Then Solomon, in the exercise of his gift of divine
wisdom, ordered the child to be slain and its body to be divided between the two doubtful
claimants. Well, when one of them acquiesced in this judgment, but the other wished rather
to give up the boy than that he should be cut in pieces, Solomon, concluding from the feeling
displayed by this woman that she was the true mother, adjudged the child to her. The
bystanders could not repress their admiration at this decision, since he had in such a way
brought out the hidden truth by his sagacity. Accordingly, the kings of the neighboring nations,
out of admiration for his ability and wisdom, courted his friendship and alliance, being
prepared to carry out his commands.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">

<head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
<p>Trusting in these resources, Solomon set about erecting a temple of immense size to
God, funds for the purpose having been got together during three years, and laid the
foundation of it about the fourth year of his reign. This was about the five hundred and
eighty-eighth year after the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt, although in the third
Book of Kings the years are reckoned at four hundred and forty.269 This is by no means
accurate; for it would have been more likely that, in the order of dates I have given above,
I should perhaps reckon fewer years than more. But I do not doubt that the truth had been
falsified by the carelessness of copyists, especially since so many ages intervened, rather than
that the sacred270 writer erred. In the same way, in the case of this little work of ours, we
believe it will happen that, through the negligence of transcribers, those things which have
been put together, not without care on our part, should be corrupted. Well, then, Solomon
finished his work of building the temple in the twentieth year from its commencement.
Then, having offered sacrifice in that place, as well as uttered a prayer, by which he blessed
the people and the temple, God spoke to him, declaring that, if at any time they should sin
and forsake God, their temple should be razed to the ground. We see that this has a long
time ago been fulfilled, and in due time we shall set forth the connected order of events. In
the meantime, Solomon abounded in wealth, and was, in fact, the richest of all the kings
that ever lived. But, as always takes place in such circumstances, he sunk from wealth into
luxury and vice, forming marriages (in spite of the prohibition of God) with foreign women,
until he had seven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines. As a consequence, he set
up idols for them, after the manner of their nations, to which they might offer sacrifice.
God, turned away from him by such doings, reproved him sharply, and made known to
him as a punishment, that the greater part of his kingdom would be taken from his son, and
given to a servant. And that happened accordingly.</p>

<p>For, on the death of Solomon in the fortieth year of his reign, Roboam his son having
succeeded to the throne of his father in the sixteenth year of his age, a portion of the people,
taking offense, revolted from him. For, having asked that the very heavy tribute which Solomon
had imposed upon them might be lessened, he rejected the entreaties of these suppliants,
and thus alienated from him the favor of the whole people. Accordingly, by universal
consent, the government was bestowed on Jeroboam. He, sprung from a family of middle
rank, had for some time been in the service of Solomon. But when the king found that the
sovereignty of the Hebrews had been promised to him by a response of the prophet Achia,
he had resolved privately to cut him off. Jeroboam, under the influence of this fear, fled into
Egypt, and there married a wife of the royal family. But, when at length he heard of the death
of Solomon, he returned to his native land, and, by the wish of the people, as we have said
above, he assumed the government. Two tribes, however, Judah and Benjamin, had remained
under the sway of Roboam; and from these he got ready an army of thirty thousand men.
But when the two hosts advanced, the people were instructed by the words of God to abstain
from fighting, for that Jeroboam had received the kingdom by divine appointment. Thus
the army disdained the command of the king, and dispersed, while the power of Jeroboam
was increased. But, since Roboam held Jerusalem, where the people had been accustomed
to offer sacrifice to God in the temple built by Solomon, Jeroboam, fearing lest their religious
feelings might alienate the people from him, resolved to fill their minds with superstition.
Accordingly, he set up one golden calf at Bethel, and another at Dan, to which the people
might offer sacrifice; and, passing by the tribe of Levi, he appointed priests from among the
people. But censure followed this guilt so hateful to God. Frequent battles then took place
between the kings, and so they retained their respective kingdoms on doubtful conditions.
Roboam died at the close of the seventeenth year of his reign.</p>

<p>In his room Abiud his son held the kingdom at Jerusalem for six years, although he is
said in the Chronicles271 to have reigned three years. Asab his son succeeded him, being
the fifth from David, as he was his great-great-grandson. He was a pious worshiper of God;
for, destroying the altars and the groves of the idols, he removed the traces of his father’s
faithlessness. He formed an alliance with the king of Syria, and by his help inflicted much
loss on the kingdom of Jeroboam, which was then held by his son, and often, after conquering
the enemy, carried off spoil as the result of victory. After forty-one years he died, afflicted
with disease in his feet. To him sin of a three-fold kind is ascribed; first, that he trusted too
much to his alliance with the king of Syria; secondly, that he cast into prison a prophet of
God who rebuked him for this; and thirdly, that, when suffering from disease in his feet, he
sought a remedy, not from God, but from the physicians. In the beginning of his reign died
Jeroboam, king of the ten tribes, and left his throne to his son Nabath. He, from his wicked
works, and, both by his own and his272 father’s doings, hateful to God, did not possess the
kingdom more than two years, and his children, as being unworthy, were deprived273 of
the government. He had for his successor Baasa, the son of Achia, and he proved himself
equally estranged from God. He died in the twenty-sixth year of his reign: and his power
passed to Ela his son, but was not retained more than two years. For Zambri, leader of his
cavalry, killed him at a banquet, and seized the kingdom,—a man equally odious to God
and men. A portion of the people revolted from him, and the royal power was conferred on
one Thamnis. But Zambri reigned before him seven years, and at the same time with him
twelve years. And, on the death of Asab, Josaphat his son began to reign over part of the
tribe of Judah, a man deservedly famous for his pious virtues. He lived at peace with Zambri;
and he died, after a reign of twenty-five years.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
<p>In the time of his reign, Ahab, the son of Ambri, was king of the ten tribes, impious
above all against God. For having taken in marriage Jezebel, the daughter of Basa, king of
Sidon, he erected an altar and groves to the idol Bahal, and slew the prophets of God. At
this time, Elijah the prophet by prayer shut up heaven, that it should not give any rain to
the earth, and revealed that to the king, in order that he, in his impiety, might know himself
to be the cause of the evil. The waters of heaven, therefore, being restrained, and since the
whole country, burned up by the heat of the sun, did not furnish food either for man or
beast, the prophet had even exposed himself to the side of perishing from hunger. At that
time, when he betook himself to the desert, he depended for life on the ravens furnishing
him with food, while a neighboring rivulet furnished him with water, until it was dried up.
Then, being instructed by God, he went to the town of Saraptæ, and turned aside to lodge
with a widow-woman. And when, in his hunger, he begged food from her, she complained
that she had only a handful of meal and a little oil, on the consumption of which she expected
death along with her children.274 But when Elijah promised in the words of God that neither
should the meal lessen in the barrel nor the oil in the vessel, the woman did not hesitate to
believe the prophet demanding faith, and obtained275 the fulfillment of what was promised,
since by daily increase as much was added as was day by day taken away. At the same time,
Elijah restored to life the dead son of the same widow. Then, by the command of God, he
went to the king, and having reproved his impiety, he ordered all the people to be gathered
together to himself. When these had hastily assembled, the priests of the idols and of the
groves to the number of about four hundred and fifty, were also summoned. Then there
arose a dispute between them, Elijah setting forth the honor of God, while they upheld their
own superstitions. At length they agreed that a trial should be made to this effect, that if fire
sent down from heaven should consume the slain victim of either of them, that religion
should be accepted as the true one which performed the miracle. Accordingly, the priests,
having slain a calf, began to call upon the idol Bahal; and, after wasting their invocations to
no purpose, they tacitly acknowledged the helplessness of their God. Then Elijah mocked
them and said, “Cry aloud more vehemently, lest perchance he sleeps, and that thus you
may rouse him from the slumber in which he is sunk.” The wretched men could do nothing
but shudder and mutter to themselves, but still they waited to see what Elijah would do.
Well, he slew a calf and laid it upon the altar, having first of all filled the sacred place with
water; and then, calling upon the name of the Lord, fire fell from heaven in the sight of all,
and consumed alike the water and the victim. Then truly the people, casting themselves

<note type="footnote">275 Such seems clearly to be the meaning of the somewhat strange phrase, “promissorum fidem consecuta

<pb n="226"/>
upon the earth, confessed God and execrated the idols; while finally, by the command of
Elijah, the impious priests were seized, and, being brought down to the brook, were there
slain. The prophet followed the king as he returned from that place; but as Jezebel, the wife
of the king, was devising means for taking his life, he retired to a more remote spot. There
God addressed him, telling him that there were still seven thousand men who had not given
themselves up to idols. That was to Elijah a marvelous statement, for he had supposed that
he himself was the only one who had kept free from impiety.</p>

<p>At that time, Ahab, king of Samaria, coveted the vineyard of Naboth, which was adjacent
to his own. And as Naboth was unwilling to sell it to him, he was cut off by the wiles of
Jezebel. Thus Ahab got possession of the vineyard, though he is said at the same time to
have regretted the death of Naboth. Acknowledging his crime, he is related to have done276
penance clothed in sackcloth; and in this way he turned aside threatening punishment. For
the king of Syria with a great army, having formed a military confederacy with thirty-two
kings, entered the territories of Samaria, and began to besiege the city with its king. The affairs
of the besieged being then in a state of great distress, the Syrian king offers these conditions
in the war,—if they should give up their gold and silver and women, he would spare their
lives. But, with such iniquitous conditions offered, it seemed better to suffer the greatest
extremities. And now when the safety of all was despaired of, a prophet sent by God went
to the king, encouraged him to go forth to battle, and when he hesitated, strengthened his
confidence in many ways. Accordingly making a sally, the enemy were routed, and an
abundant store of booty was secured. But, after a year, the Syrian king returned with recruited
strength into Samaria, burning to avenge the defeat he had received, but was again overthrown.
In that battle one hundred and twenty thousand of the Syrians perished; the king
was pardoned, and his kingdom and former position were granted him. Then Ahab was
reproved by the prophet in the words of God, for having abused the divine kindness, and
spared the enemy delivered up to him. The Syrian king, therefore, after three years, made
war upon the Hebrews. Against him Ahab, under the advice of some false prophet, went
forth to battle, having spurned the words of Michea the prophet and cast him into prison,
because the prophet had warned him that the fight would prove disastrous to him. Thus,
then, Ahab, being slain in that battle, left the kingdom to his son Ochozia.</p>

<p>He, being sick in body, and having sent some of his servants to consult an idol about
his recovery, Elijah, as instructed by God, met them in the way, and, after rebuking them
ordered them to inform the king that his death would follow from that disease. Then the
king ordered him to be seized and brought into his presence, but those who were sent for
this purpose were consumed by fire from heaven. The king died, as the prophet had predicted.
To him there succeeded his brother Joram; and he held the government for the space of
twelve years. But on the side of the two tribes, Josaphat the king having died, Joram his son
possessed the kingdom for eighteen years. He had the daughter of Ahab to wife, and proved
himself more like his father-in-law than his father. After him, Ochozias his son obtained
the kingdom. During his reign, Elijah is related to have been taken up to heaven. At the
same time, Elisha his disciple showed himself powerful by working many miracles, which
are all too well known to need any description from my pen. By him the son of a widow was
restored to life, a leper of Syria was cleansed, at a time of famine abundance of all things
was brought into the city by the enemy having been put to flight, water was furnished for
the use of three armies, and from a little oil the debt of a woman was paid by the oil being
immensely multiplied, and sufficient means for a livelihood was provided for herself. In his
times, as we have said, Ochozia was king of the two tribes, while Joram, as we have related
above, ruled over the ten; and an alliance was formed between them. For war was carried
on by them with combined forces both against the Syrians, and against Jeu, who had been
anointed by the prophet as king of the ten tribes; and having gone forth to battle in company,
they both perished in the same fight.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">

<head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
<p>But Jeu possessed the kingdom of Joram. After the death of Ochozia in Judæa, when he
had reigned one year, his mother, Gotholiah, seized the supreme power, having deprived
her grandson (whose name was Joas) of the government, he being at the time but a little
child. But the power thus snatched from him by his grandmother was, after eight years, restored
to him through means of the priests and people, while his grandmother was driven
into exile. He, at the beginning of his reign, was most devoted to the divine worship, and
embellished the temple at great expense; afterwards, however, being corrupted by the flattery
of the chief men, and unduly honored by them, he incurred wrath. For Azahel, king of
Syria, made war upon him; and, as things went badly with him, he purchased peace with
the gold of the temple. He did not, however, obtain it; but through resentment for what he
had done he was slain by his own people in the fortieth year of his reign. He was succeeded
by his son Amassia. But, on the side of the ten tribes, Jeu having died, Joachas his son began
to reign, displeasing to God on account of his wicked works, in punishment of which his
kingdom was ravaged by the Syrians, until, through the mercy of God, the enemy was
driven back, and the inhabitants of the land began to occupy their former position. Joachas,
having ended his days, left the kingdom to his son Joa. He raised civil war against Amassia,
king of the two tribes; and, having obtained the victory, conveyed much spoil into his own
kingdom. That is related to have occurred to Amassia as a punishment of his sin, for, having
entered as a conqueror the territories of the Idumæans, he had adopted the idols of that
nation. He is described as having reigned nine years, so far as I find it stated in the Books
of Kings. But in the Chronicles277 of Scripture, as well as in the Chronicles278 of Eusebius,
he is affirmed to have held the government twenty-nine years; and the mode of reckoning
which may easily be perceived in these Books of Kings undoubtedly leads to that conclusion.
For Jeroboam is said to have begun to reign as king of the ten tribes in the eighth year of
the reign of Amassia, and to have held the government forty-one years, and to have at length
died in the fourth year of the reign of Ozia, son of Amassia. By this mode of reckoning, the
reign of Amassia is made to extend over twenty-eight years. Accordingly, we, following out
this, inasmuch as it is our purpose to adhere in this work to the dates in their proper order,
have accepted the authority of the Chronicles.279</p>

<p>Ozias, then, the son of Amassia, succeeded to him. For, on the side of the ten tribes,
Joas, reaching the end of his days, had given place to his son Jeroboa, and after him, again,
his son Zacharias began to reign. Of these kings, and of all who ruled over Samaria on the
side of the ten tribes, we have not thought it necessary to note the dates, because, aiming at
brevity, we have omitted everything superfluous; and we have thought that the years should
be carefully traced for a knowledge especially of the times of that portion280 of the Jews,
which being carried into captivity at a later period than the other, passed through a longer
time as a kingdom. Ozias, then, having obtained the kingdom of Judah, gave his principal
care to knowing the Lord, making great use of Zachariah the prophet (Isaiah, too, is said to
have first prophesied under this king); and, on this account, he carried on war against his
neighbors with deservedly prosperous results, while he also conquered the Arabians. And
already he had shaken Egypt with the terror of his name; but, being elated by prosperity, he
ventured on what was forbidden, and offered incense to God, a thing which it was the established
custom for the priests alone to do. Being, then, rebuked by Azaria the priest, and
compelled to leave the sacred place, he burst out into a rage, but was, when he finally with-
drew, covered with leprosy. Under the influence of this disease he ended his days, after
having reigned fifty-two years. Then the kingdom was given to Joathas his son; and he is
related to have been very pious, and carried on the government with success: he subdued
in war the nation of the Ammonites, and compelled them to pay tribute. He reigned sixteen
years, and his son Achaz succeeded him.</p>

<p>The remarkable faith of the Ninevites is related to have been manifested about these
times. That town, founded of old by Assure, the son of Sem, was the capital of the kingdom
of the Assyrians. It was then full of a multitude of inhabitants, sustaining one hundred and
twenty thousand men, and abounding in wickedness, as is usually the case among a vast
concourse of people. God, moved by their sinfulness, commanded the prophet Jonah to go
from Judæa, and denounce destruction upon the city, as Sodom and Gomorrah had of old
been consumed by fire from heaven. But the prophet declined that office of preaching, not
out of contumacy, but from foresight, which enabled him to behold God reconciled through
the repentance of the people; and he embarked on board a ship which was bound for Tharsus,
in a very different direction. But, after they had gone forth into the deep, the sailors, constrained
by the violence of the sea, inquired by means of the lot who was the cause of that
suffering. And when the lot fell upon Jonah, he was cast into the sea, to be, as it were, a
sacrifice for stilling the tempest, and he was seized and swallowed by a whale—a monster
of the deep. Cast out three days afterwards on the shores of the281 Ninevites, he preached
as he had been commanded, namely that the city would be destroyed in three282 days, as a
punishment for the sins of the people. The voice of the prophet was listened to, not in a
hypocritical fashion, as at Sodom of old; and immediately by the order, and after the example,
of the king, the whole people, and even those infants newly born, are commanded to abstain
from meat and drink: the very beasts of burden in the place, and animals of different kinds,
being forced by hunger and thirst, presented an appearance of those who lamented along
with the human inhabitants. In this way, the threatened evil was averted. To Jonah, complaining
to God, that his words had not been fulfilled, it was answered that pardon could
never be denied to the penitent.</p>
<note type="footnote">281 Surely a blunder; for, as has been well asked, how could Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale in the
Mediterranean, have been cast out by the fish on the shores of the Ninevites? The Hebrew text has simply “the
dryland.”</note>

<p>But in Samaria, Zacharia the king, who was very wicked, and whom we have spoken of
above as occupying the throne, was slain by a certain Sella, who seized the kingdom. He, in
turn, perished by the treachery of Mane, who simply repeated the conduct of his predecessor.
Mane held the government which he had taken from Sella, and left it to his son Pache. But
a certain person of the same name slew Pache, and seized the kingdom. Ere long being cut
off by Osee, he lost the sovereignty by the same crime by which he had received it. This
man, being ungodly beyond all the kings who had preceded him, brought punishment upon
himself from God, and a perpetual captivity on his nation. For Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians,
made war with him, and when conquered rendered him tributary. But when, with
secret plans, he was preparing for rebellion, and had asked the king of the Ethiopians, who
then had possession of Egypt for his assistance, Salmanasar, on discovering that, cast him
into prison with fetters never taken off, while he destroyed the city, and carried off the whole
people into his own kingdom, Assyrians being placed in the enemy’s country to guard it.
Hence that district was called Samaria, because in the language of the Assyrians guards are
called Samaritæ.283 Very many of their settlers accepted the divine rites of the Jewish religion,
while others remained in the errors of heathenism. In this war, Tobias was carried into
captivity. But on the side of the two tribes, Achaz, who was displeasing to God on account
of his impiety, finding he had frequently the worst of it in wars with his neighbors, resolved
to worship the gods of the heathen, undoubtedly because by their help his enemies had
proved victorious in frequent battles. He ended his days with this crime284 in his wicked
mind, after a reign of sixteen years.</p>

<p>To him succeeded Ezekias his son, a man very unlike his father in character. For, in the
beginning of his reign, urging the people and the priests to the worship of God, he discoursed
to them in many words, showing how often, after being chastened by the Lord, they had
obtained mercy, and how the ten tribes, having been at last carried away into captivity, as
had lately happened, were now paying the penalty of their impiety. He added that their duty
was carefully to be on their guard lest they should deserve to suffer the same things. Thus,
the minds of all being turned to religion, he appointed the Levites and all the priests to offer
sacrifices according to the law, and arranged that the Passover, which had for a long time
been neglected, should be celebrated. And when the holy day was at hand, he proclaimed
the special day of assembly by messengers sent throughout all the land, so that, if any had
remained in Samaria, after the removal of the ten tribes, they might gather together for the
sacred observance. Thus, in a very full assemblage, the sacred day was spent with public rejoicing,
and, after a long interval, the proper religious rites were restored by means of
Ezekias. He then carried on military affairs with the same diligence with which he had attended
to divine things, and defeated the Philistines in frequent battles; until Sennacherim,
king of the Assyrians, made war against him, having entered his territories with a large army;
and then, when the country had been laid waste without any opposition, he laid siege to the
city. For Ezekias, being inferior in numbers, did not venture to come to an engagement with
him, but kept himself safe within the walls. The king of Assyria, thundering at the gates,
threatened destruction, and demanded surrender, exclaiming that in vain did Ezekias put
his trust in God, for that he rather had taken up arms by the appointment of God; and that
the conqueror of all nations, as well as the overthrower of Samaria could not be escaped,
unless the king secured his own safety by a speedy surrender. In this state of affairs, Ezekias,
trusting in God, consulted the prophet Isaiah, and from his answer he learned that there
would be no danger from the enemy, and that the divine assistance would not fail him. And,
in fact, not long after, Tarraca, king of Ethiopia, invaded the kingdom of the Assyrians.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">  
<pb n="234"/>
<head>CHAPTER LI.</head>
<p>By this news Sennacherim was led to return in order to defend his own territories, and
he gave up the war, at the same time murmuring and crying out that victory was snatched
from him the victor. He also sent letters to Ezekias, declaring, with many insulting words,
that he, after settling his own affairs, would speedily return for the destruction of Judæa.
But Ezekias, in no wise disturbed by these threats, is said to have prayed to God that he
would not allow the so great insolence of this man to pass unavenged. Accordingly, in the
same night, an angel attacking the camp of the Assyrians, caused285 the death of many
thousand men. The king in terror fled to the town of Nineveh, and being there slain by his
sons, met with an end worthy of himself. At the same time, Ezekias, sick in body, lay suffering
from disease. And when Isaiah had announced to him in the words of the Lord that the end
of his life was at hand, the king is related to have wept; and thus he got fifteen years added
to his life. These coming to an end, he died in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, and left
the kingdom to his son Manasse. He, degenerating much from his father, forsook God, and
took to the practice of impious worship; and being, as a punishment for this, delivered into
the power of the Assyrians, he was by his sufferings constrained to acknowledge his error,
and exhorted the people that, forsaking their idols, they should worship God. He accomplished
nothing worthy of special mention, but reigned for fifty-five years. Then Amos his
son obtained the kingdom, but possessed it only two years. He was the heir of his father’s
impiety, and showed himself regardless of God: being entrapped by some stratagems of his
friends, he perished.</p>

<p>The government then passed to his son Josia. He is related to have been very pious, and
to have attended to divine things with the utmost care, profiting largely by the aid of the
priest Helchia. Having read a book written with the words of God, and which had been
found in the temple by the priest, in which it was stated that the Hebrew nation would be
destroyed on account of their frequent acts of impiety and sacrilege, by his pious supplications
to God, and constant tears, he averted the impending overthrow. When he learned through
Olda the prophetess that this favor was granted him, he then with still greater care set himself
to practice the worship of God, inasmuch as he was now under obligation to the divine
goodness. Accordingly, he burned all the vessels which had by the superstitions of former
kings been consecrated to idols. For to such a height had profane observances prevailed,
that they used to pay divine honors to the sun and moon, and even erected shrines made
of metal to these fancied deities. Josia reduced these to powder, and also slew the priests of
the profane temples. He did not even spare the tombs of the impious; and it was observed
that thus was fulfilled what had of old been predicted by the prophet. In the eighteenth year
of his reign, the Passover was celebrated. And about three years afterwards, having gone
forth to battle against Nechao, king of Egypt, who was making war upon the Assyrians, before
the armies properly engaged, he was wounded by an arrow. And being carried back to the
city, he died of that wound, after he had reigned twenty and one years.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">

<head>CHAPTER LIII.</head>
<p>Joachas, his son, having then obtained the kingdom, held it for three months, being
doomed to captivity on account of his impiety. For Nechao, king of Egypt, bound him and
led him away captive, and not long after, while still a prisoner, he ended his days. An annual
tribute was demanded of the Jews, and a king was given them at the will of the victor. His
name was Eliakim, but he afterwards changed it to Joachim. He was the brother of Joacha,
and the son of Josia, but liker his brother than his father, displeasing God by his impiety.
Accordingly, while he was in subjection to the king of Egypt, and in token thereof paid him
tribute, Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, seized the land of Judæa, and as victor held
it by the right of war for three years. For the king of Egypt now giving way, and the boundaries
of their empire being fixed between them, it had been agreed that the Jews should belong
to Babylon. Thus after Joachim, having finished his reign of eleven years, had given place
to his son of the same name, and he had excited against himself the wrath of the king of
Babylon (God undoubtedly overruling everything, having resolved to give the nation of the
Jews up to captivity and destruction), Nabuchodonosor entered Jerusalem with an army,
and leveled the walls and the temple to the ground. He also carried off an immense amount
of gold, with sacred ornaments either public or private, and all of mature age both of the
male and female sex, those only being left behind whose weakness or age caused trouble to
the conquerors. This useless crowd had the task assigned them of working and cultivating
the fields in slavery, in order that the soil might not be neglected. Over them a king called
Sedechias was appointed; but while the empty shadow of the name of king was allowed him,
all real power was taken away. Joachim, for his part, possessed the sovereignty only for three
months. He was carried away, along with the people, to Babylon, and was there thrown into
prison; but being, after a period of thirty years released, while he was admitted by the king
to his friendship, and made a partaker with him at his table and in his counsels, he died at
last, not without some consolation in that his misfortunes had been removed.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="54">  
<pb n="237"/>
<head>CHAPTER LIV.</head>
<p>Meanwhile Sedechias, the king of the useless multitude, although without power, being
of an unfaithful disposition and neglectful of God, and not understanding that captivity had
been brought upon them on account of the sins of the nation, becoming at length ripe for
suffering the last evils he could endure, offended the mind of the king. Accordingly, after a
period of nine years, Nabuchodonosor made war against him, and having forced him to
flee within the walls, besieged him for three years. At this time, he consulted Jeremia the
prophet, who had already often proclaimed that captivity impended over the city, to discover
if perhaps there might still be some hope. But he, not ignorant of the anger of heaven, having
frequently had the same question put to him, at length gave an answer, denouncing special
punishment upon the king. Then Sedechias, roused to resentment, ordered the prophet to
be thrust into prison. Ere long, however, he regretted this cruel act, but, as the chief men of
the Jews (whose practice it had been even from the beginning to afflict the righteous) opposed
him, he did not venture to release the innocent man. Under coercion from the same persons,
the prophet was let down into a pit286 of great depth, and which was disgusting from its
filth and squalor, while a deadly stench issued from it. This was done that he might not
simply die by a common death. But the king, impious though he was, yet showed himself
somewhat more merciful than the priests, and ordered the prophet to be taken out of the
pit, and restored to the safekeeping of the prison. In the meantime the force of the enemy
and want began to press the besieged hard, and everything being consumed that could be
eaten, famine took a firm hold of them. Thus, its defenders being worn out with want of
food, the town was taken and burnt. The king, as the prophet had declared, had his eyes put
out, and was carried away to Babylon, while Jeremia, through the mercy of the enemy, was
taken out of his prison. When Nabuzardan, one of the royal princes, was leading him away
captive with the rest, the choice was granted by him to the prophet, either to remain in his
deserted and desolated native country, or to go along with him in the possession of the
highest honors; and Jeremia preferred to abide in his native land. Nabuchodonosor, having
carried away the people, appointed as governor over those left behind by the conquerors
(either from the circumstances attending the war, or from an absolute weariness of accumu-
lating spoil) Godolia, who belonged to the same nation. He gave him, however, no royal
ensign, or even the name of governor, because there was really no honor in ruling over these
few wretched persons.</p>

<p>The times of the captivity have been rendered illustrious by the predictions and deeds
of the prophets, and especially by the remarkable persistency of Daniel in upholding the
law, and by the deliverance of Susanna through the divine wisdom, as well as by the other
things which it accomplished, and which we shall now relate in their order, Daniel was made
a prisoner under King Joachim, and was brought to Babylon, while still a very little child.
Afterwards, on account of the beauty of his countenance, he had a place given him among
the king’s servants, and along with him, Annanias, Misael, and Azarias. But, when the king
had ordered them to be supplied with the finer kinds of food, and had imposed it as a duty
on Asphane the eunuch to attend to that matter, Daniel, mindful of the traditions of his
fathers which forbade him to partake of food from the table of a king of the Gentiles, begged
of the eunuch to be allowed to use a diet of pulse only. Asphane objected that the leanness
which would follow might reveal the fact that the king’s commandment had been disobeyed;
but Daniel, putting his trust in God, promised that he would have greater beauty of countenance
from living on pulse than from the use of the king’s dainties. And his words were
made good, so that the faces of those who were cared for at the public expense were regarded
as by no means comparable to those of Daniel and his friends. Accordingly, being promoted
by the king to honor and favor, they were, in a short time, by their prudence and wise conduct,
preferred to all those that stood nearest to the king. About the same time, Susanna,
the wife of a certain man called Joachis, a woman of remarkable beauty, was desired by two
elders, and, when she would not listen to their unchaste proposals, was assailed by a false
accusation. These elders reported that a young man was found with her in a retired place,
but escaped their hands by his youthful nimbleness, while they were enfeebled with age.
Credit, accordingly, was given to these elders, and Susanna was condemned by the sentence
of the people. And, as she was being led away to punishment according to the law, Daniel,
who was then twelve years old, after having rebuked the Jews for delivering the innocent to
death, demanded that she should be brought back to trial, and that her cause should be
heard afresh. For the multitude of the Jews who were then present, thought that a boy of an
age so little commanding respect, had not ventured to take such a bold step without a divine
impulse, and, granting him the favor which was asked, returned anew to council. The trial,
then, is entered upon once more; and Daniel was allowed to take his place among the elders.
Upon this, he orders the two accusers to be separated from each other, and inquires of each
of them in turn, under what kind of a tree he had discovered the adulteress. From the difference
of answers which they gave, their falsehood was detected: Susanna was acquitted; and
the elders, who had brought the innocent into danger, were condemned to death.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>At that time, Nabuchodonosor had a dream marvelous for that insight287 into the future
which it implied. As he could not of himself bring out its interpretation, he sent for the
Chaldæans who were supposed by magic arts and by the entrails of victims to know secret
things, and to predict the future, in order to its interpretation. Presently becoming apprehensive
lest, in the usual manner of men, they should extract from the dream not what was
true, but what would be acceptable to the king, he suppresses the things he had seen, and
demands of them that, if a real power of divination was in them, they should relate to him
the dream itself; saying that he would then believe their interpretation, if they should first
make proof of their skill by relating the dream. But they declined attempting so great a difficulty,
and confessed that such a thing was not within the reach of human power. The king,
enraged because, under a false profession of divination, they were mocking men with their
errors, while they were compelled by the present case to acknowledge that they had no such
knowledge as was pretended, made an exposure of them by means of a royal edict; and all
the men professing that art were publicly put to death. When Daniel heard of that, he spoke
to one of those nearest to the king, and promised to give an account of the dream, as well
as supply its interpretation. The thing is reported to the king, and Daniel is sent for. The
mystery had already been revealed to him by God; and so he relates the vision of the king,
as well as interprets it. But this matter demands that we set forth the dream of the king and
its interpretation, along with the fulfillment of his words by what followed. The king, then,
had seen in his sleep an image with a head of gold, with a breast and arms of silver, with a
belly and thighs of brass, with legs of iron, and which in its feet ended partly with iron, and
partly with clay. But the iron and the clay when blended together could not adhere to each
other. At last, a stone cut out without hands broke the image to pieces, and the whole, being
reduced to dust, was carried away by the wind.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>Accordingly, as the prophet interpreted the matter, the image which was seen furnished
a representation of the world. The golden head is the empire of the Chaldæans; for we have
understood that it was the first and wealthiest. The breast and the arms of silver represent
the second kingdom; for Cyrus, after the Chaldæans and the Medes were conquered, conferred
the empire on the Persians. In the brazen belly it is said that the third sovereignty
was indicated; and we see that this was fulfilled, for Alexander took the empire from the
Persians, and won the sovereignty for the Macedonians. The iron legs point to a fourth
power, and that is understood of the Roman empire, which is more powerful288 than all the
kingdoms which were before it. But the fact that the feet were partly of iron and partly clay,
indicates that the Roman empire is to be divided, so as never to be united. This, too, has
been fulfilled, for the Roman state is ruled not by one emperor but by several, and these are
always quarreling among themselves, either in actual warfare or by factions. Finally, by the
clay and the iron being mixed together, yet never in their substance thoroughly uniting, are
shadowed forth those future mixtures of the human race which disagree among themselves,
though apparently combined. For it is obvious that the Roman territory is occupied by foreign
nations, or rebels, or that it has been given over to those who have surrendered themselves
under an appearance289 of peace. And it is also evident that barbarous nations, and especially
Jews, have been commingled with our armies, cities, and provinces; and we thus behold
them living among us, yet by no means agreeing to adopt our customs. And the prophets
declare that these are the last times. But in the stone cut out without hands, which broke to
pieces the gold, silver, brass, iron, and clay, there is a figure of Christ. For he, not born under
human conditions (since he was born not of the will of man, but of the will of God), will
reduce to nothing that world in which exist earthly kingdoms, and will establish another
kingdom, incorruptible and everlasting, that is, the future world, which is prepared for the
saints. The faith of some still hesitates about this point only, while they do not believe about
things yet to come, though they are convinced of the things that are past. Daniel, then, was
presented with many gifts by the king, was set over Babylon and the whole empire, and was
held in the highest honor. By his influence, Annanias, Azarias, and Misael were also advanced
to the highest dignity and power. About the same time, the remarkable prophecies of Ezekiel
came out, the mystery of future things and of the resurrection290 having been revealed to
him. His book is one of great weight, and deserves to be read with care.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>But in Judæa, over which, as we have related above, Godolia was set after the destruction
of Jerusalem, the Jews taking it very ill that a ruler not of the royal race had been assigned
them by the mere will of the conqueror, with a certain Ismael as their leader and instigator
of the execrable conspiracy, cut off Godolia by means of treachery while he was at a banquet.
Those, however, who had no part in the plot, wishing to take steps for avenging the deed,
hastily take up arms against Ismael. But when he learned that destruction threatened him,
leaving the army which he had collected, and with not more than eight companions he fled
to the Ammonites. Fear, therefore, fell upon the whole people, lest the king of Babylon
should avenge the guilt of a few by the destruction of all; for, in addition to Godolia, they
had slain many of the Chaldæans along with him. They, therefore, form a plan of fleeing
into Egypt, but they first go in a body to Jeremia, requesting of him divine counsel. He then
exhorted them all in the words of God to remain in their native country, telling them that
if they did so, they would be protected by the power of God, and that no danger would accrue
from the Babylonians, but that, if they went into Egypt, they would all perish there by sword,
and famine, and different kinds of death. The rabble, however, with the usual evil tendency
they show, being unaccustomed to yield to useful advice and the divine power, did go into
Egypt. The sacred Scriptures are silent as to their future fate; and I have not been able to
discover anything regarding it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>At this period of time, Nabuchodonosor elated with prosperity, erected a golden statue
to himself of enormous size, and ordered it to be worshiped as a sacred image. And when
this was zealously gone about by all, inasmuch as their minds had been corrupted by the
universal flattery which prevailed, Annanias, Azarias, and Misael kept aloof from the profane
observance, being well aware that that honor was due to God alone. They were therefore,
according to an edict of the king, regarded as criminals, and there was set before them, as
the means of punishment, a fiery furnace, in order that, by present terror, they might be
compelled to worship the statue. But they preferred to be swallowed up by the flames rather
than to commit such a sin. Accordingly, they were bound, and cast into the midst of the
fire. But the flames laid hold of the agents in this execrable work, as they were forcing, with
all eagerness, the victims into the fire; while—wonderful to say, and indeed incredible to all
but eye-witnesses—the fire did not touch the Hebrews at all. They were seen by the spectators
walking in the midst of the furnace, and singing a song of praise to God, while there was
also beheld along with them a fourth person having the appearance of an angel, and whom
Nabuchodonosor, on obtaining a nearer view of him, acknowledged to be the291 Son of
God. Then the king having no doubt that the divine power was present in the event which
had taken place, sent proclamations throughout his whole kingdom making known the
miracle which had taken place, and confessing that honor was to be paid to God alone. Not
long after, being instructed by a vision which presented itself to him, and presently also by
a voice which reached him from heaven, he is said to have done penance by laying aside his
kingly power, retiring from all intercourse with mankind, and to have sustained life by herbs
alone. However, his empire was kept for him by the will of God, until the time was fulfilled,
and at length duly acknowledging God, he was, after seven years, restored to his kingdom
and former position. He is related, after having conquered Sedechia (whom he carried away
captive to Babylon), as we have said above, to have reigned twenty-six years, although I do
not find that recorded in the sacred history. But it has perhaps happened that, while I was
engaged in searching out many points, I found this remark in the work of some anonymous
author which had become interpolated in course of time, and in which the dates of the
Babylonish kings were contained. I did not think it right to pass the remark unnoticed, since
it does in fact harmonize with the Chronicles, and thus its account agrees with us, to the
effect that, through the succession of the kings, whose dates the record contained, it completed
seventy years up to the first year of king Cyrus, and such in fact is the number of
years which is stated in the sacred history to have elapsed from the captivity up to the time
of Cyrus.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>After Nabuchodonosor, the kingdom fell to his son, whom I find called Euilmarodac
in the Chronicles. He died in the twelfth year of his reign, and made room for his younger
brother, who was called Balthasar. He, when in the fourteenth year he gave a public feast to
his chief men and rulers, ordered the sacred vessels (which had been taken away by
Nabuchodonosor from the temple at Jerusalem, yet had not been employed for any uses of
the king, but were kept laid up in the treasury) to be brought forth. And when all persons,
both of the male and female sex, with his wives and concubines, were using these amid the
luxury and licentiousness of a royal banquet, suddenly the king observed fingers writing
upon the wall, and the letters were perceived to be formed into words.292 But no one could
be found who was able to read the writing. The king, therefore, in perturbation called for
the magi and the Chaldæans. When these simply muttered among themselves and answered
nothing, the queen reminded the king that there was a certain Hebrew, Daniel by name,
who had formerly revealed to Nabuchodonosor a dream containing a secret mystery, and
had then, on account of his remarkable wisdom, been promoted to the highest honors. Accordingly,
he, being sent for, read and interpreted the writing, to the effect that, on account
of the sin of the king, who had profaned vessels sacred to God, destruction impended over
him, and that his kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians. And this presently took
place. For, on the same night, Balthasar perished, and Darius, a Mede by nation, took possession
of his kingdom. He again, finding that Daniel was held in the highest reputation,
placed him at the head of the whole empire, in this following the judgment of the kings who
had preceded him. For Nabuchodonosor had also set him over the kingdom, and Balthasar
had presented him with a purple robe and a golden chain, while he also constituted him the
third ruler in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Those, therefore, who were possessed of power along with him, stimulated by envy,
because a foreigner belonging to a captive nation had been placed on a footing of equality
with them, constrain the king, who had been corrupted by flattery, to enact that divine
honors should be paid to him for the next thirty days, and that it should not be lawful for
any one to pray to a god except the king. Darius was easily persuaded to that, through the
folly of all kings who claim for themselves divine honors. In these circumstances, Daniel
being not unacquainted with what had happened, and not being ignorant that prayer ought
to be addressed to God, and not to man, is accused of not having obeyed the king’s commandment.
And much against the will of Darius, to whom he had always been dear and
acceptable, the rulers prevailed that he should be let down into a den.293 But no harm came
to him when thus exposed to the wild beasts. And on the king discovering this, he ordered
his accusers to be given over to the lions. They, however, did not pass through a similar experience,
for they were instantly devoured to satisfy the hunger of the savage beasts. Daniel,
who had been famous before, was now esteemed still more famous; and the king, repealing
his former edict, issued a new one to the effect that, all errors and superstitions being
abandoned, the God of Daniel was to be worshiped. There exists also a record of visions of
Daniel, in which he revealed the order of events in coming ages, embracing in them also
the number of the years, within which he announced that Christ would descend to earth
(as has taken place), and clearly set forth the future coming of Antichrist. If any one is eager
to inquire into these points, he will find them more fully treated of in the book of Daniel:
our design is simply to present a connected statement of events. Darius is related to have
reigned eighteen years; after which date Astyages began to rule over the Medes.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>Him Cyrus, his grandson by his daughter, expelled from the kingdom, having used the
arms of the Persians for the purpose; and hence the chief power was transferred to the Persians.
The Babylonians also fell under his power and government. It happened at the beginning
of his reign that, by the issue of public edicts, he gave permission to the Jews to return
into their own country; and he also restored the sacred vessels which Nabuchodonosor had
carried away from the temple at Jerusalem. Accordingly, a few then returned into Judæa;
as to the others, we have not been able to discover whether the desire of returning, or the
power of doing so, was wanting. There was at that time among the Babylonians a brazen
image of Belus, a very ancient king, whom Virgil also has mentioned.294 This having been
deemed sacred by the superstition of the people, Cyrus also had been accustomed to worship,
being deceived by the trickery of its priests. They affirmed that the image ate and drank,
while they themselves secretly carried off the daily portion which was offered to the idol.
Cyrus, then, being on intimate terms with Daniel, asked him why he did not worship the
image, since it was a manifest symbol of the living God, as consuming those things which
were offered to it. Daniel, laughing at the mistake of the man, replied that it could not possibly
be the case, that that work of brass—mere insensate matter—could use either meat or drink.
The king, therefore, ordered the priests to be called (they were about seventy in number);
and, bringing terror to bear upon them, he reprovingly asked them who was in the way of
consuming what was offered, since Daniel, a man distinguished for his wisdom, maintained
that that could not be done by an insensate image. Then they, trusting in their ready-made
trick, ordered the usual offering to be made, and the temple to be sealed up by the king, on
the understanding that, unless on the following day the whole offering were found to have
been consumed, they should suffer death, while, on the opposite being discovered, the same
fate awaited Daniel. Accordingly, the temple was sealed up by the signet of the king; but
Daniel had previously, without the knowledge of the priests, covered the floor of it with
ashes, so that their footprints might betray the clandestine approaches of those who entered.
The king, then, having entered the temple on the following day, perceived that those things
had been taken away, which he had ordered to be served up to the idol. Then Daniel lays
open the secret fraud by the betraying footprints, showing that the priests, with their wives
and children, had entered the temple by a hole opened from below, and had devoured those
things which were served up to the idol. Accordingly, all of them were put to death by the
order of the king, while the temple and image were submitted to the power of Daniel, and
were destroyed at his command.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>In the meantime, those Jews, who, as we have said above, returned into their native land
by the permission of Cyrus, attempted to restore their city and temple. But, being few and
poor, they made but little progress, until, at last, after the lapse of about a hundred years,
while Artaxerxes the king ruled over the Persians, they were absolutely deterred from
building by those who had local authority. For, at that time, Syria and all Judæa was ruled
under the empire of the Persians by magistrates and governors. Accordingly, these took
counsel to write to king Artaxerxes, that it was not fitting that opportunity should be granted
to the Jews of rebuilding their city, lest, in accordance with their stubborn character, and
being accustomed to rule over other nations, they should, on recovering their strength, not
submit to live under the sway of a foreign power. Thus, the plan of the rulers being approved
of by the king, the building of the city was put a stop to, and delayed until the second year
of Darius the king. But, who were kings of Persia throughout this period of time, we shall
here insert, in order that the succession of the dates may be set forth in a regular and fixed
order. Well, then, after Darius the Mede, who, as we have said above, reigned eighteen years,
Cyrus held the supreme power for thirty-one years. While making war upon the Scythians,
he fell in battle, in the second year after Tarquinius Superbus began to reign at Rome. To
Cyrus succeeded his son Cambyses, and reigned eight years. He, after harassing with war
Egypt and Ethiopia, and subduing these countries, returned as victor to Persia, but accidentally
hurt himself, and died from that wound. After his death, two brothers, who were magi,
and Medes by nation, held rule over the Persians for seven months. To slay these, seven of
the most noble of the Persians formed a conspiracy, of whom the leader was Darius, the son
of Hystaspes, who was a cousin of Cyrus, and by unanimous consent the kingdom was bestowed
on him: he reigned thirty and six years. He, four years before his death, fought at
Marathon, in a battle greatly celebrated both in Greek and Roman history. That took place
about the two hundred and sixtieth year after the founding of Rome, while Macerinus and
Augurinus were consuls, that is, eight hundred and eighty-eight years ago, provided the
research I have made into the succession of Roman consuls does not deceive me; for I have
made the entire reckoning down to the time of Stilico.295 After Darius came Xerxes, and
he is said to have reigned twenty-one years, although I have found that the length of his rule
is, in most copies,296 set down at twenty and five years. To him succeeded Artaxerxes, of
whom we have made mention above. Since he ordered the building of the Jewish city and
temple to be stopped, the work was suspended to the second year of king Darius. But that
the succession of dates may be completed up to him, I have to state that Artaxerxes reigned
forty-one years, Xerxes two months, and that, after him, Sucdianus ruled for seven months.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>Next, Darius, under whom the temple was restored, obtained the kingdom, his name
being at that time Ochus. He had three Hebrew of tried fidelity as his bodyguard, and of
these had, from the proof of his prudence which he had given, attracted towards himself
the admiration of the king. The choice, then, being given him of asking for anything which
he had formed a desire for in his heart, groaning over the ruins of his country, he begged
permission to restore the city, and obtained an order from the king to urge the lieutenants
and rulers to hurry forward the building of the holy temple, and furnish the expense needful
to that end. Accordingly, the temple was completed in four years; that is, in the sixth year
after Darius began to reign, and that seemed, for the time, enough to the people of the Jews.
For, as it was a work of great labor to restore the city, distrusting their own resources, they
did not venture at the time to begin an undertaking of so great difficulty, but were content
with having rebuilt the temple. At the same time, Esdras the scribe, who was skilled in the
law, about twenty years after the temple had been completed (Darius being now dead who
had possessed the sovereignty for nineteen years), by the permission of Artaxerxes the
second (not he who had a place between the two Xerxes, but he who had succeeded to
Darius Ochus), set out from Babylon with many following him, and they carried to Jerusalem
the vessels of various workmanship, as well as the gifts which the king had sent for the temple
of God. Along with them were but twelve Levites; for with difficulty that number of the tribe
is related then to have been found. He, having found that the Jews united in marriage with
the Gentiles, rebuked them severely on that account, and ordered them to renounce all
connections of that kind, as well as to put away the children which had been the issue of
such marriages; and all yielded obedience to his word. The people, then, being sanctified,
performed the rites sanctioned by the ancient law. But I do not find that Esdras did anything
with the view of restoring the city; because he thought, as I imagine, that a more urgent duty
was to reform the people from the corrupt habits which they had contracted.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11"> 
<pb n="249"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>There was at that time at Babylon one Nehemiah, a servant of the king, a Jew by birth,
and very much beloved by Artaxerxes on account of the services he had rendered. He, having
inquired of his fellow-countrymen the Jews, what was the condition of their ancestral city;
and having learned that his native land remained in the same fallen condition as before, is
said to have been disturbed with all his heart, and to have prayed to God with groans and
many tears. He also called to mind the sins of his nation, and urgently entreated the divine
compassion. Accordingly, the king noticing that he, while waiting at table, seemed more
sorrowful than usual, asked him to explain the reasons of his grief. Then he began to bewail
the misfortunes of his nation, and the ruin of his ancestral city, which now, for almost two
hundred and fifty years, being leveled with the ground, furnished a proof of the evils which
had been endured, and a gazing-stock to their enemies. He therefore begged the king to
grant him the liberty of going and restoring it. The king yielded to these dutiful entreaties,
and immediately sent him away with a guard of cavalry, that he might the more safely accomplish
his journey, giving him, at the same time, letters to the rulers requesting them to
furnish him with all that was necessary. When he arrived at Jerusalem, he distributed the
work connected with the city to the people, man by man; and all vied with each other in
carrying out the orders which they received. And already the work of rebuilding297 had
been half accomplished, when the jealousy of the surrounding heathen burst out, and the
neighboring cities conspired to interrupt the works, and to deter the Jews from building.
But Nehemiah, having stationed guards against those making assaults upon the people, was
in no degree alarmed, and carried out what he had begun. And thus, after the wall was
completed, and the entrances of the gates finished, he measured out the city for the construction
by families of houses within it. He reckoned, also, that the people were not adequate
in numbers to the size of the city; for there were not more of them than fifty thousand of
both sexes and of all ranks—to such an extent had their formerly enormous numbers been
reduced by frequent wars, and by the multitude kept in captivity. For, of old, those two
tribes, of whom the remaining people were all that survived, had, when the ten tribes were
separated from them, been able to furnish three hundred and twenty thousand armed men.
But being given up by God, on account of their sin, to death and captivity, they had sunk
down to the miserably small number which they now presented. This company, however,
as I have said, consisted only of the two tribes: the ten298 which had previously been carried
<note type="footnote">297 “jamque ad medium machinae processerant.”</note>
<note type="footnote">298 Our author here touches upon a most interesting question—the ultimate destiny of the ten tribes. He
seems to imply that none of them returned to Palestine, but were wholly absorbed among the Gentile nations.
That, however, cannot be correct, for it was still possible, in the time of Christ, to speak of some as connected
with the tribe of Asher, one of the ten tribes. See Luke ii. 36.</note>

away being scattered among the Parthians, Medes, Indians, and Ethiopians never returned
to their native country, and are to this day held under the sway of barbarous nations. But
the completion of the restored city is related to have been effected in the thirty-second year
of the reign of Artaxerxes. From that time to the crucifixion of Christ; that is, to the time
when Fufius Geminus and Rubellius were consuls, there elapsed three hundred and ninety
and eight years. But from the restoration of the temple to its destruction, which was completed
by Titus under Vespasian, when Augustus was consul, there was a period of four
hundred and eighty-three years. That was formerly predicted by Daniel, who announced
that from the restoration of the temple to its overthrow there would elapse seventy and nine
weeks. Now, from the date of the captivity of the Jews until the time of the restoration of
the city, there were two hundred and sixty years.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>At this period of time we think Esther and Judith lived, but I confess that I cannot easily
perceive with what kings especially I should connect the actions of their lives. For, while
Esther is said to have lived under King Artaxerxes, I find that there were two Persian kings
of that name, and there is much hesitation in concluding to which of these her date is to be
assigned. However, it has seemed preferable to me to connect the history of Esther with that
Artaxerxes under whom Jerusalem was restored, because it is not likely that, if she had lived
under the former Artaxerxes, whose times Esdras has given an account of, he would have
made no mention of such an illustrious woman. This is all the more convincing since we
know that the building of the temple was (as we have related above) prohibited by that
Artaxerxes and Esther would not have allowed that had she then been united with him in
marriage. But I will now repeat what things she accomplished. There was at that time a
certain Vastis connected with the king in marriage, a woman of marvelous beauty. Being
accustomed to extol her loveliness to all, he one day, when he was giving a public entertainment,
ordered the queen to attend for the purpose of exhibiting her beauty. But she, more
prudent than the foolish king, and being too modest to make a show of her person before
the eyes of men, refused compliance with his orders. His savage mind was enraged by this
insult, and he drove her forth, both from her condition of marriage with him and from the
palace. Consequently, when a young woman was sought after to take her place as the wife
of the king, Esther was found to excel all others in beauty. She being a Jewess of the tribe of
Benjamin, and an orphan, without father or mother, had been brought up by her cousingerman,
299 Mardochæus. On being espoused to the king, she, by the instructions of him
who had brought her up, concealed her nation and fatherland, and was also admonished
by him not to become forgetful of her ancestral traditions, nor, though as a captive she had
entered into marriage with a foreigner, to take part in the food of the heathen. Thus, then,
being united to the king, she, in a short time, as was to be expected, easily captivated his
whole mind by the power of her beauty, so that, equalizing her with himself in the emblem
of sovereign power, he presented her with a purple robe.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13"> 
<pb n="252"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>At this time, Mardochæus was among those nearest to the king, having entirely under
his charge the affairs of the household. He had made known to the king a plot which had
been formed by two eunuchs, and, on that account, had become a greater favorite, while he
was presented with the highest honors. There was at that period one Haman, a very confidential
friend of the king, whom he had made equal to himself and, after the manner of sovereign
rulers, had ordered to be worshiped. Mardochæus being the one man among all who
refused to do that, had greatly kindled the wrath of the Persian against himself. Accordingly,
Haman setting his mind to work the ruin of the Hebrew, went to the king, and affirmed
that there was in his kingdom a race of men of wicked superstitions, and hateful alike to
God and men. He said that, as they lived according to foreign laws, they deserved to be
destroyed; and that it was a righteous thing to hand over the whole of this nation to death.
At the same time, he promised the king immense wealth out of their possessions. The barbarous
prince was easily persuaded, and an edict was issued for the slaughter of the Jews,
while men were at once sent out to publish it through the whole kingdom from India even
to Ethiopia. When Mardochæus heard of this, he rent his clothes, clothed himself in sackcloth,
scattered ashes upon his head, and, going to the palace, he there made the whole place resound
with his wailing and complaints, crying out that it was an unworthy thing that an
innocent nation should perish, while there existed no ground for its destruction. Esther’s
attention was attracted by the voice of lamentation, and she learned how the case really
stood. But she was then at a loss what step she should take (for, according to the custom of
the Persians, the queen is not permitted access to the king, unless she has been sent for, and
indeed is not admitted at any time the king may please, but only at a fixed period); and it
happened at the time, that by this rule, Esther was held as separated from the presence of
the king for the next thirty days. However, thinking that she ought to run some risk in behalf
of her fellow-countrymen, even should sure destruction await her, she was prepared to encounter
death in such a noble cause, and, after having called upon God, she entered the
court of the king. But the barbarian, though at first amazed at this unusual occurrence, was
gradually won over by female blandishments, and at length went so far as to accompany the
queen to a banquet which she had prepared. Along with him also went Haman, the favorite
of the king, but a deadly enemy of the nation of the Jews. Well, when after the feasting the
banquet began to become jovial through the many cups which were drank, Esther cast herself
down at the knees of the king, and implored him to stay the destruction which threatened
her nation. Then the king promised to refuse nothing to her entreaties, if she had any further
request to make. Esther at once seized the opportunity, and demanded the death of Haman
as a satisfaction to her nation, which he had desired to see destroyed. But the king could
not forget his friend, and hesitating a little, he withdrew for a short time for the purpose of
considering the matter. He then returned, and when he saw Haman grasping the knees of

<pb n="253"/>
the queen, excited with rage, and, crying out that violence was being applied to the queen,
he ordered him to be put to death. It then came to the knowledge of the king that a cross300
had been got ready by Haman on which Mardochæus was to suffer. Thus, Haman was fixed
to that very cross, and all his goods were handed over to Mardochæus, while the Jews at
large were set free. Artaxerxes reigned sixty and two years, and was succeeded by Ochus.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>To this series of events it will be right that I should append an account of the doings of
Judith; for she is related to have lived after the captivity, but the sacred history has not revealed
who was king of the Persians in her day. It, however, calls the king under whom her
exploits were performed by the name of Nabuchodonosor, and that was certainly not the
one who took Jerusalem. But I do not find that any one of that name reigned over the Persians
after the captivity, unless it be that, on account of the301 wrath and like endeavors which
he manifested, any king acting so was styled Nabuchodonosor by the Jews. Most persons,
however, think that it was Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, on this ground that he, as a conqueror,
penetrated into Egypt and Ethiopia. But the sacred history is opposed to this opinion; for
Judith is described as having lived in the twelfth year of the king in question. Now, Cambyses
did not possess the supreme power for more than eight years. Wherefore, if it is allowable
to make a conjecture on a point of history, I should be inclined to believe that her exploits
were performed under king Ochus, who came after the second Artaxerxes. I found this
conjecture on the fact that (as I have read in profane histories) he is related to have been by
nature cruel and fond of war. For he both engaged in hostilities with his neighbors, and recovered
by wars Egypt, which had revolted many years before. At that time, also, he is related
to have ridiculed the sacred rites of the Egyptians and Apis, who was regarded by them as
a god; a thing which Baguas, one of his eunuchs, an Egyptian by nation, and indignant at
the king’s conduct, afterwards avenged by the death of the king, considering that the king
had insulted the race to which he belonged. Now, the inspired302 history makes mention
of this Baguas; for, when Holofernes by the order of the king led an army against the Jews,
it has related that Baguas was among the host. Wherefore, not without reason may I bring
it forward in proof of the opinion I have expressed that that king who was named
Nabuchodonosor was really Ochus, since profane historians have related that Baguas lived
in his reign. But this ought not to be felt at all remarkable by any one, that mere worldly
writers have not touched on any of those points which are recorded in the sacred writings.
The spirit of God thus took care that the history should be strictly confined within its own
mysteries, unpolluted by any corrupt mouth, or that which mingled truth with fiction. That
history being, in fact, separated from the affairs of the world, and of a kind to be expressed
only in sacred words, clearly ought not to have been mixed up with other histories, as being
on a footing of equality with them. For it would have been most unbecoming that this history
should be commingled with others treating of other things, or pursuing different inquiries.
But I will now proceed to what remains, and will narrate in as few words as I can the acts
performed by Judith.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p>The Jews, then, having returned, as we have narrated above, to their native land, and
the condition of their affairs and of their city being not yet properly settled, the king of the
Persians made war on the Medes, and engaged in a successful battle against their king, who
was named Arphaxad. That monarch being slain, he added the nation to his empire. He did
the same to other nations, having sent before him Holofernes whom he had appointed
master of his host, with a hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and twelve thousand
cavalry. He, after having ravaged in war, Cilicia and Arabia, took many cities by force, or
compelled them through fear to surrender. And now the army, having moved on to Damascus,
had struck the Jews with great terror. But as they were unable to resist, and as, at the
same time, they could not bring their minds to acquiesce in the thought of surrender, since
they had previously known from experience the miseries of slavery, they betook themselves
in crowds to the temple. There, with a general groaning and commingled wailing, they implored
the divine assistance; saying that they had been sufficiently punished by God for their
sins and offenses; and begging him to spare the remnant of them who had recently been
delivered from slavery. In the meantime, Holofernes had admitted the Moabites to surrender,
and joined them to himself as allies in the war against the Jews. He inquired of their chief
men what was the power on which the Hebrews relied in not bringing their minds to submit
to the thought of submission. In reply, a certain man called Achior stated to him the facts,
viz.: that the Jews being worshipers of God, and trained by their fathers to pious observances,
had formerly passed through a period of slavery in Egypt, and that, brought out from that
country by the divine aid, and having passed over on foot the sea which was dried up before
them, they had at last conquered all the opposing nations, and recovered the territory inhabited
by their ancestors. That subsequently, with various fluctuations in their affairs, they
had either prospered or the reverse, that, when they did sink into adversity, they had again
escaped from their sufferings, finding that God was, in turn, either angry against them, or
reconciled towards them, according to their deserts, so that, when they sinned, they were
chastised by the attacks of enemies or by being sent into captivity, but were always unconquerable
when they enjoyed the divine favor. So then, if at the present time they are free
from guilt, they cannot possibly be subdued; but if they are otherwise situated, they will
easily be conquered. Upon this, Holofernes, flushed with many victories, and thinking that
everything must give way before him, was roused to wrath, because victory on his part was
regarded as principally depending on the sin of the Jews, and ordered Achior to be pushed
forward into the camp of the Hebrews, that he might perish in company with those who he
had affirmed could not be conquered. Now, the Jews had then made for the mountains; and
those to whom the business had been assigned, proceeded to the foot of the mountains, and
there left Achior in chains. When the Jews perceived that, they freed him from his bonds
and conducted him up the hill. On their inquiring the reason of what had happened, he

<pb n="256"/>
explained it to them, and, being received in peace, awaited the result. I may add that, after
the victory, he was circumcised and became a Jew. Well, Holofernes, perceiving the difficulty
of the localities, because he could not reach the heights, surrounded the mountains with
soldiers, and took the greatest pains to cut off the Hebrews from all water supplies. On that
account, they felt all the sooner the misery of a siege. Being therefore overcome through
want of water, they went in a company to Ozias, their leader, all inclined to make a surrender.
But he replied that they should wait a little, and look for the divine assistance, so that the time of surrender was fixed for the fifth day afterwards.</p>

<p>When this became known to Judith (a widow woman of great wealth, and remarkable
for beauty, but still more distinguished for her virtue than her beauty), who was then in the
camp, she thought that, in the distressed circumstances of her people, some bold effort ought
to be made by her, even though it should lead to her own destruction. She therefore decks
her head and beautifies her countenance, and then, attended by a single maidservant, she
enters the camp of the enemy. She was immediately conducted to Holofernes, and tells him
that the affairs of her countrymen were desperate, so that she had taken precautions for her
life by flight. Then she begs of the general the right of a free egress from the camp during
night, for the purpose of saying her prayers. That order was accordingly given to the sentinels
and keepers of the gates. But when by the practice of three days she had established for
herself the habit of going out and returning, and had also in this way inspired belief in her
into the barbarians, the desire took possession of Holofernes of abusing the person of his
captive; for, being of surpassing beauty, she had easily impressed the Persian. Accordingly,
she was conducted to the tent of the general by Baguas, the eunuch; and, commencing a
banquet, the barbarian stupefied himself with a great deal of wine. Then, when the servants
withdrew, before he offered violence to the woman, he fell asleep. Judith, seizing the opportunity,
cut off the head of the enemy and carried it away with her. Being regarded as simply
going out of the camp according to her usual custom, she returned to her own people in
safety. On the following day the Hebrews held forth for show the head of Holofernes from
the heights; and, making a sally, marched upon the camp of the enemy. And then the barbarians
assemble in crowds at the tent of their general, waiting for the signal of battle. When
his mutilated body was discovered, they turned to flight under the influence of a disgraceful
panic, and fled before the enemy. The Jews, for their part, pursued the fugitives, and after
slaying many thousands, took possession of the camp and the booty within it. Judith was
extolled with the loftiest praises, and is said to have lived one hundred and five years. If
these things took place, as we believe, under king Ochus, in the twelfth year of his reign,
then from the date of the restoration of Jerusalem up to that war there elapsed two and
twenty years. Now Ochus reigned in all twenty-three years. And he was beyond all others
cruel, and more than of a barbarous disposition. Baguas, the eunuch, took him off by poison
on an occasion of his suffering from illness. After him, Arses his son held the government
for three years, and Darius for four.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p>Against him Alexander of Macedon engaged in war. And on his being conquered, the
sovereign power was taken from the Persians, after having lasted, from the time of its establishment
by Cyrus, two hundred and fifty years. Alexander, the conqueror of almost all nations,
is said to have visited the temple at Jerusalem, and to have conveyed gifts into it; and
he proclaimed throughout the whole territory which he had reduced under his sway that it
should be free to the Jews living in it to return to their own country. At the end of the twelfth
year of his reign, and seven years after he had conquered Darius, he died at Babylon. His
friends who, along with him, had carried on those very important wars, divided his empire
among themselves. For some time they administered the charges they had undertaken
without making use of the name of king, while a certain Arridæus Philippus, the brother of
Alexander, reigned, to whom, being of a very weak character, the sovereignty was nominally
and in appearance given, but the real power was in the hands of those who had divided
among themselves the army and the provinces. And indeed this state of things did not long
continue, but all preferred that they should be called by the name of kings. In Syria Seleucus
was the first king after Alexander, Persia and Babylon being also subject to his sway. At that
time the Jews paid an annual tribute of three hundred talents of silver to the king; but they
were governed not by foreign magistrates but by their own priests. And they lived according
to the fashions of their ancestors until very many of them again corrupted by a long peace,
began to mingle all things with seditions, and to create disturbances, while they aimed at
the high-priesthood under the influence of lust, avarice, and the desire of power.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18"> 
<pb n="259"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>For, first of all, under king Seleucus, the son of Antiochus the great, a certain man called
Simon accused to the king on false charges Onias the priest, a holy and uncorrupted man,
and thus tried, but in vain, to overthrow him. Then, after an interval of time, Jason, the
brother of Onias, went to Antiochus the king, who had succeeded his brother Seleucus, and
promised him an increase of tribute, if the high-priesthood were transferred to him. And
although it was an unusual, and indeed, until now, an unpermitted thing for a man to enjoy
the high-priesthood year after year, still the eager mind of the king, diseased with avarice,
was easily persuaded. Accordingly, Onias was driven from office, and the priesthood bestowed
on Jason. He harassed his countrymen and his country in the most shameful manner. Then,
as he had sent through a certain Menelaus (the brother of that Simon who has been mentioned)
the money he had promised to the king, a way being once laid open to his ambition,
Menelaus obtained the priesthood by the same arts which Jason had employed before. But
not long after, as he had not furnished the promised amount of money, he was driven from
his position, and Lysimachus substituted in his stead. Then there arose disgraceful conflicts
between Jason and Menelaus, until Jason, as an exile, left the country. By examples like these,
the morals of the people became corrupted to such an extent, that numbers of the natives
begged permission from Antiochus to live after the fashion of the Gentiles. And when the
king granted their request, all the most worthless vied with each other in their endeavors
to construct temples, to sacrifice to idols, and to profane the law. In the meantime, Antiochus
returned from Alexandria (for he had then made war upon the king of Egypt, which, however,
he gave up by the orders of the senate and Roman people, when Paulus and Crassus were
consuls), and went to Jerusalem. Finding the people at variance from the diverse superstitions
they had adopted, he destroyed the law of God, and showed favor to those who followed
impious courses, while he carried off all the ornaments of the temple, and wasted it with
much destruction. That came to pass in the hundred and fiftieth year after the death of Alexander,
Paulus and Crassus being, as we have said, consuls, about five years after Antiochus
began to reign.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<p>But that the order of the dates may be correctly preserved, and that it may appear more
clearly who this Antiochus was, we shall enumerate both the names and times of the kings
who came after Alexander in Syria. Well, then, king Alexander having died, as we have related
above, his whole empire was portioned out by his friends, and was governed for some time
by them under the name of the king.303 Seleucus, after the lapse of nine years, was himself
styled king in Syria, and reigned thirty-two years. After him came Antiochus, his son, with
a reign of twenty-one years. Then came Antiochus, the son of Antiochus, who was surnamed
Theus, and he reigned fifteen years. After him, his son Seleucus, surnamed Callinicus, reigned
twenty-one years. Another Seleucus, the son of Callinicus, reigned three years. After his
death Antiochus, the brother of Callinicus, held Asia and Syria for thirty-seven years. This
is the Antiochus against whom Lucius Scipio Asiaticus made war; and he, being worsted in
the war was stripped of a part of his empire. He had two sons, Seleucus and Antiochus, the
latter of whom he had given as a hostage to the Romans. Thus, then, Antiochus the great
having died, his younger son Seleucus obtained the kingdom, under whom, as we have said,
Onias the priest had an accusation brought against him by Simon. Then Antiochus was set
free by the Romans, and there was given in his place as hostage Demetrius, the son of
Seleucus, who was at that time reigning. Seleucus dying in the twelfth year of his reign, his
brother Antiochus, who had been a hostage at Rome, seized the kingdom. He, five years
after the beginning of his reign, did, as we have shown above, lay waste Jerusalem. For, as
he had to pay a heavy tribute to the Romans, he was almost of necessity compelled, in order
to meet that enormous expense, to provide himself with money by rapine, and to neglect
no opportunity of plundering. Then, after two years, the Jews being again visited by a similar
disaster to that which they had suffered before, lest it should happen that, driven on by their
numerous miseries, they should commence war, he placed a garrison in the citadel. Next,
with the view of overturning the holy law, he published an edict, that all, forsaking the traditions
of their ancestors, should live after the manner of the Gentiles. And there were not
wanting those who readily obeyed this profane enactment. Then truly there was a horrible
spectacle presented; through all the cities sacrifices were publicly offered in the streets, while
the sacred volumes of the law and the prophets were consumed with fire.</p>
<note type="footnote">303 They did not themselves, for a time, assume the name of king, but, as said above, professed to rule under the authority of king Arridæus, brother of Alexander.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20"> 
<pb n="261"/>
<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<p>At that time, Matthathias, the son of John, was high-priest. When he was being forced
by the servants of the king to obey the edict, with marvelous courage he set at naught the
profane enactments, and slew, in the presence of all, a Hebrew who was publicly performing
profane acts. A leader having thus been found, rebellion at once took place. Matthathias left
the town; and as many flocked to him, he got up the appearance of a regular army. The object
of every man in that host was to defend himself by arms against a profane government, and
rather even to fall in war than to take part in impious ceremonies. In the meantime, Antiochus
was compelling those Jews who were found in the Greek cities in his dominions to offer
sacrifice, and was visiting with unheard-of torments those who refused. At this time, there
occurred that well-known and remarkable suffering of the seven brothers and their mother.
All of the brothers, when they were being forced to violate the law of God, and the customs
of their ancestors, preferred rather to die. At last, their mother, too, accompanied them both
in their sufferings and death.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21"> 
<pb n="262"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<p>In the meantime, Matthathias dies, having appointed in his own place his son Judah,
as general of the army which he had brought together. Under his leadership, several successful
battles took place against the royal forces. For first of all, he destroyed, along with his whole
army, Apollonius, the enemy’s general, who had entered on the conflict with a large number
of troops. When a certain man, named Seron, who was then the ruler of Syria, heard of this,
he increased his forces, and attacked Judah with much spirit as being superior in numbers,
but when a battle took place, he was routed and put to flight; and with the loss of nearly
eight hundred men, he returned to Syria. On this becoming known to Antiochus, he was
filled with rage and regret, inasmuch as it vexed him that his generals had been conquered,
notwithstanding their large armies. He therefore gathers aid from his whole empire, and
bestows a donative on the soldiers, almost to the exhaustion of his treasury. For he was then
suffering in a very special manner from the want of money. The reason of this was, on the
one side, that the Jews, who had been accustomed to pay him an annual tribute of more
than three hundred talents of silver, were now in a state of rebellion against him; and on
the other side, that many of the Greek cities and countries were unsettled by the evil of
persecution. For Antiochus had not spared even the Gentiles, whom he had sought to persuade
to abandon their long-established superstitions, and to draw over to one kind of religious
observance. And no doubt, those of them who regarded nothing as sacred, easily were
induced to give up their ancient forms of worship, but at the same time all were in a state
of alarm and disaster. For these reasons, then, the taxes had ceased to be paid. Boiling with
wrath on these grounds (for he who had of old been the richest of kings now deeply felt the
poverty due to his own wickedness), he divided his forces with Lysias, and committed to
him Syria and the war against the Jews, while he himself set out against the Persians, to
collect the taxes among them. Lysias, then, selected Ptolemy, Gorgias, Doro, and Nicanor,
as generals in the war; and to these he gave forty thousand infantry, and seven thousand
cavalry. At the first onset these caused great alarm among the Jews. Then Judah, when all
were in despair, exhorted his men to go with courageous hearts to battle—that, if they put
their trust in God, everything would give way before them; for that often before then the
victory had been won by a few fighting against many. A fast was proclaimed, and sacrifice
was offered, after which they went down to battle. The result was that the forces of the enemy
were scattered, and Judah, taking possession of their camp, found in it both much gold and
Tyrian treasures. For merchants from Syria, having no doubt as to victory, had followed the
king’s army with the hope of purchasing prisoners, and now were themselves spoiled. When
these things were reported to Lysias by messengers, he got together troops with still greater
efforts, and in a year after again attacked the Jews with an enormous army; but being defeated,
he retreated to Antioch.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<p>Judah, on the defeat of the enemy, returned to Jerusalem, and bent his mind on the
purification and restoration of the temple, which having been overthrown by Antiochus,
and profaned by the Gentiles, presented a melancholy spectacle. But as the Syrians held the
citadel, which being connected with the temple, but standing above it in position, was really
impregnable, the lower parts proved inaccessible, as frequent sallies from above prevented
persons from approaching them. But Judah placed against these assailants a very powerful
body of his men. Thus the work of the sacred building was protected, and the temple was
surrounded with a wall, while armed men were appointed to maintain a perpetual defence.
And Lysias, having again returned into Judæa with increased forces, was once more defeated
with a great loss both of his own army and of the auxiliaries, which being sent to him by
various states had combined with him in the war. In the meantime, Antiochus, who, as we
have said above, had marched into Persia, endeavored to plunder the town of Elymus, the
wealthiest in the country, and a temple situated there which was filled with gold; but, as a
multitude flocked together from all sides for the defense of the place, he was put to flight.
Moreover, he received news of the want of success which had attended the efforts of Lysias.304
Thus, from distress of mind, he fell into bodily disease. But as he was then tormented with
internal sufferings, he remembered the miseries which he had inflicted on the people of
God, and acknowledged that these evils had deservedly been sent upon him. Then, after a
few days, he died, having reigned eleven years. He left the kingdom to his son Antiochus,
to whom the name of Eupator was given.</p>
<note type="footnote">304 Some add the words, “or of Lysimachus,” but this appears to have been a gloss.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23"> 
<pb n="264"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<p>At that time Judah besieged the Syrians who were posted in the citadel. They, being sore
pressed with famine and want of all things, sent messengers to the king to implore assistance.
Accordingly, Eupator came to their aid with a hundred thousand infantry and twenty
thousand cavalry, while elephants marched in front of his line, causing immense terror to
the onlookers. Then Judah, abandoning the siege, went to meet the king, and routed the
Syrians in the first battle. The king begged for peace, which, because305 he, with his treacherous
disposition, made a bad use of, vengeance followed his treachery. For Demetrius, the
son of Seleucus, who, we have said above, was handed over as a hostage to the Romans,
when he heard that Antiochus had departed, begged that they would send him to take possession
of the kingdom. And when this was refused to him, he secretly fled from Rome,
came into Syria, and seized the supreme power, having slain the son of Antiochus, who had
reigned one year and six months. It was during his reign that the Jews first begged the
friendship of the Roman people, and alliance with them; and the embassy to this effect
having been kindly received, they were, by a decree of the senate, styled allies and friends.
In the meantime Demetrius was, by means of his generals, carrying on war against Judah.
And first the army was led by a certain man named Bacchides, and by Alcimus, a Jew;
Nicanor, being afterwards placed at the head of the war, fell in battle. Then Bacchides and
Alcimus, recovering power, and having increased their forces, fought against Judah. The
Syrians, turning out victorious in that battle, cruelly abused their victory. The Hebrews elect
Jonathan, the brother of Judah, in his place. In the meantime, Alcimus, after he had fearfully
desolated Jerusalem, dies; Bacchides, being thus deprived of his ally, returns to the king.
Then, after an interval of two years, Bacchides again made war upon the Jews, and being
beaten, he begged for peace. This was granted him certain conditions, to the effect that he
should give up the deserters and prisoners, along with all that he had taken in war.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<p>While these things are going on in Judæa, a certain young man educated at Rhodes, by
name Alexander, gave himself out as being the son of Antiochus (which was false), and assisted
by the power of Ptolemy, king of Alexandria, came into Syria with an army. He
conquered Demetrius in war, and slew him after he had reigned twelve years. This Alexander
before he made war against Demetrius, had formed an alliance with Jonathan, and had
presented him with a purple robe and royal ensigns. For this reason Jonathan had assisted
him with auxiliary forces; and on the defeat of Demetrius, had been the very first to meet
him with congratulations. Nor did Alexander afterwards violate the faith which he had
pledged. Accordingly, in the five years during which he held the chief power, the affairs of
the Jews were peaceful. In these circumstances, Demetrius, the son of Demetrius, who, after
the death of his father, had betaken himself to Crete, at the instigation of Lasthenes, general
of the Cretans, tried by war to recover the kingdom of his, father, but finding his power
unequal to the task, he implored Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt, the father-in-law of
Alexander, but who was then on bad terms with his son-in-law, to give him assistance. But
he, induced not so much by the entreaties of the suppliant as by the hope of seizing Syria,
joined his forces with those of Demetrius, and gives him his daughter, who had been married
to Alexander. Against these two Alexander fought a pitched battle. Ptolemy fell in the fight,
but Alexander was defeated; and he was soon afterwards slain, after he had reigned five, or
as I find it stated in many authors, nine years.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25"> 
<pb n="266"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<p>Demetrius, having thus obtained the kingdom, treated Jonathan with kindness, made
a treaty with him, and restored the Jews to their own laws. In the meantime, Tryphon, who
had belonged to the party of Alexander, was appointed306 governor of Syria, to keep him
in check by war. Jonathan,307 on the other hand, descended to battle, formidable with an
army of forty thousand men. Tryphon, when he saw himself unequal to the contest, pretended
a desire for peace, and slew Ptolemais who had been received and invited into friendship
with him. After Jonathan, the chief power was conferred on his brother Simon. He celebrated
the funeral of his brother with great pomp, and built those well-known seven pyramids of
most noble workmanship, in which he buried the remains both of his brothers and of his
father. Then Demetrius renewed his treaty with the Jews; and in consideration of the loss
caused to them by Tryphon (for after the death of Jonathan he had wasted by war their cities
and territories), he remitted to them their annual tribute forever; for up to that time, they
had paid tribute to the kings of Syria, except when they resisted by force of arms. That took
place in the second year of king Demetrius; and we have noted that, because up to this year
we have run through the times of the Asiatic kings, that the series of dates being given in
order might be perfectly clear. But now we shall arrange the order of events through the
times of those, who were either high-priests or kings among the Jews, up to the period of
the birth of Christ.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<p>Well, then, after Jonathan, his brother Simon, as has been said above, ruled over the
Hebrews with the power of high-priest. For that honor was then bestowed upon him both
by his own countrymen and by the Roman people. He began to rule over his countrymen
in the second year of king Demetrius, but eight years afterwards, being deceived by a plot
of Ptolemy, he met his death. He was succeeded by his son John. And he, on the ground
that he had fought with distinction against the Hyrcani, a very powerful nation, received
the surname of Hyrcanus. He died, after having held the supreme power for twenty-six
years. After him, Aristobulus being appointed high-priest, was the first of all living after the
captivity to assume the name of king, and to have a crown placed upon his head. At the
close of a year, he died. Then Alexander, his son, who was both king and high-priest, reigned
twenty-seven years; but I have found nothing in his doings worthy of mention, except his
cruelty. He having left two young sons named Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, Salina or Alexandra,
his wife, held the sovereignty for three years. After his decease, frightful conflicts about the
supreme power arose between the two brothers. And first of all, Hyrcanus held the govern-
ment; but being by and by defeated by his brother Aristobulus, he fled to Pompey. That
Roman general, having finished the war with Mithridates, and settled Armenia and Pontus,
being, in fact, the conqueror of all the nations which he had visited, desired to march inwards,
308 and to add all the neighboring regions to the Roman empire. He therefore inquired
into the causes of the war, and the means of obtaining309 the mastery. Accordingly he
readily received Hyrcanus, and, under his guidance, attacked the Jews; but when the city
was taken and destroyed, he spared the temple. He sent Aristobulus in chains to Rome, and
restored the right of the high-priesthood to Hyrcanus. Settling the tribute to be paid by the
Jews, he placed over them as governor a certain Antipater of Askelon. Hyrcanus held the
chief power for thirty-four years; but while he carried on war against the Parthians, he was
taken prisoner.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<p>Then Herod, a foreigner, the son of Antipater of Askelon, asked and received the sovereignty
of Judæa from the senate and people of Rome. Under him, the Jews began for the
first time to have a foreigner as king. For as now the advent of Christ was at hand, it was
necessary, according to the predictions of the prophets, that they should be deprived of their
own rulers, that they might not look for anything beyond Christ. Under this Herod, in the
thirty-third year of his reign, Christ was born on the twenty-fifth of December in the consulship
of Sabinus and Rufinus. But we do not venture to touch on these things which are
contained in the Gospels, and subsequently in the Acts of the Apostles, lest the character of
our condensed work should, in any measure, detract from the dignity of the events; and I
shall proceed to what remains. Herod reigned four years after the birth of the Lord; for the
whole period of his reign comprised thirty-seven years. After him, came Archelaus the
tetrarch, for eight years, and Herod for twenty-four years. Under him, in the eighteenth
year of his reign, the Lord was crucified, Fufius Geminus and Rubellius Geminus being
consuls; from which date up to the consulship of Stilico, there have elapsed three hundred
and seventy-two years.</p>

<p>Luke made known the doings of the apostles up to the time when Paul was brought to
Rome under the emperor Nero. As to Nero, I shall not say that he was the worst of kings,
but that he was worthily held the basest of all men, and even of wild beasts. It was he who
first began a persecution; and I am not sure but he will be the last also to carry it on, if, indeed,
we admit, as many are inclined to believe, that he will yet appear immediately before the
coming of Antichrist. Our subject would induce me to set forth his vices at some length, if
it were not inconsistent with the purpose of this work to enter upon so vast a topic. I content
myself with the remark, that he showed himself in every way most abominable and cruel,
and at length even went so far as to be the murderer of his own mother. After this, he also
married a certain Pythagoras in the style of solemn alliances, the bridal veil being put upon
the emperor, while the usual dowry, and the marriage couch, and wedding torches, and, in
short, all the other observances were forthcoming—things which even in the case of women,
are not looked upon without some feeling of modesty. But as to his other actions, I doubt
whether the description of them would excite greater shame or sorrow. He first attempted
to abolish the name of Christian, in accordance with the fact that vices are always inimical
to virtues, and that all good men are ever regarded by the wicked as casting reproach upon
them. For, at that time, our divine religion had obtained a wide prevalence in the city. Peter
was there executing the office of bishop, and Paul, too, after he had been brought to Rome,
on appealing to Cæsar from the unjust judgment of the governor. Multitudes then came
together to hear Paul, and these, influenced by the truth which they were given to know,
and by the miracles310 of the apostles, which they then so frequently performed, turned to
the worship of God. For then took place the well-known and celebrated encounter of Peter
and Paul with Simon.311 He, after he had flown up into the air by his magical arts, and
supported by two demons (with the view of proving that he was a god), the demons being
put to flight by the prayers of the apostles, fell to the earth in the sight of all the people, and
was dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the number of the Christians being now very large, it happened that
Rome was destroyed by fire, while Nero was stationed at Antium. But the opinion of all cast
the odium of causing the fire upon the emperor, and he was believed in this way to have
sought for the glory of building a new city. And in fact, Nero could not by any means he
tried escape from the charge that the fire had been caused by his orders. He therefore turned
the accusation against the Christians, and the most cruel tortures were accordingly inflicted
upon the innocent. Nay, even new kinds of death were invented, so that, being covered in
the skins of wild beasts, they perished by being devoured by dogs, while many were crucified
or slain by fire, and not a few were set apart for this purpose, that, when the day came to a
close, they should be consumed to serve for light during the night. In this way, cruelty first
began to be manifested against the Christians. Afterwards, too, their religion was prohibited
by laws which were enacted; and by edicts openly set forth it was proclaimed unlawful to
be a Christian. At that time Paul and Peter were condemned to death, the former being beheaded
with a sword, while Peter suffered crucifixion. And while these things went on at
Rome, the Jews, not able to endure the injuries they suffered under the rule of Festus Florus,
began to rebel. Vespasian, being sent by Nero against them, with proconsular power, defeated
them in numerous important battles, and compelled them to flee within the walls of Jerusalem.
In the meanwhile Nero, now hateful even to himself from a consciousness of his
crimes, disappears from among312 men, leaving it uncertain whether or not he had laid violent
hands upon himself: certainly his body was never found. It was accordingly believed
that, even if he did put an end to himself with a sword, his wound was cured, and his life
preserved, according to that which was written regarding him,—“And his mortal313 wound
was healed,”—to be sent forth again near the end of the world, in order that he may practice
the mystery of iniquity.</p>

<p>So then, after the departure of Nero, Galba seized the government; and ere long, on
Galba being slain, Otho secured it. Then Vitellius from Gaul, trusting to the armies which
he commanded, entered the city, and having killed Otho, assumed the sovereignty. This
afterwards passed to Vespasian, and although that was accomplished by evil means, yet it
had the good effect of rescuing the state from the hands of the wicked. While Vespasian was
besieging Jerusalem, he took possession of the imperial power; and as the fashion is, he was
saluted as emperor by the army, with a diadem placed upon his head. He made his son Titus,
Cæsar; and assigned him a portion of the forces, along with the task of continuing the siege
of Jerusalem. Vespasian set out for Rome, and was received with the greatest favor by the
senate and people; and Vitellius having killed himself, his hold of the sovereign power was
fully confirmed. The Jews, meanwhile, being closely besieged, as no chance either of peace
or surrender was allowed them, were at length perishing from famine, and the streets began
everywhere to be filled with dead bodies, for the duty of burying them could no longer be
performed. Moreover, they ventured on eating all things of the most abominable nature,
and did not even abstain from human bodies, except those which putrefaction had already
laid hold of and thus excluded from use as food. The Romans, accordingly, rushed in upon
the exhausted defenders of the city. And it so happened that the whole multitude from the
country, and from other towns of Judæa, had then assembled for the day of the Passover:
doubtless, because it pleased God that the impious race should be given over to destruction
at the very time of the year at which they had crucified the Lord. The Pharisees for a time
maintained their ground most boldly in defense of the temple, and at length, with minds
obstinately bent on death, they, of their own accord, committed themselves to the flames.
The number of those who suffered death is related to have been eleven hundred thousand,
and one hundred thousand were taken captive and sold. Titus is said, after calling a council,
to have first deliberated whether he should destroy the temple, a structure of such extraordinary
work. For it seemed good to some that a sacred edifice, distinguished above all human
achievements, ought not to be destroyed, inasmuch as, if preserved, it would furnish an
evidence of Roman moderation, but, if destroyed, would serve for a perpetual proof of Roman
cruelty. But on the opposite side, others and Titus himself thought that the temple ought
specially to be overthrown, in order that the religion of the Jews and of the Christians might
more thoroughly be subverted; for that these religions, although contrary to each other, had
nevertheless proceeded from the same authors; that the Christians had sprung up from
among the Jews; and that, if the root were extirpated, the offshoot would speedily perish.
Thus, according to the divine will, the minds of all being inflamed, the temple was destroyed,
three hundred and thirty-one years ago. And this last overthrow of the temple, and final
captivity of the Jews, by which, being exiles from their native land, they are beheld scattered
through the whole world, furnish a daily demonstration to the world, that they have been

<pb n="272"/>
punished on no other account than for the impious hands which they laid upon Christ. For
though on other occasions they were often given over to captivity on account of their sins,
yet they never paid the penalty of slavery beyond a period of seventy years.</p>

<p>Then, after an interval, Domitian, the son of Vespasian, persecuted the Christians. At
this date, he banished John the Apostle and Evangelist to the island of Patmos. There he,
secret mysteries having been revealed to him, wrote and published his book of the holy
Revelation, which indeed is either foolishly or impiously not accepted by many. And with
no great interval there then occurred the third persecution under Trajan. But he, when after
torture and racking he found nothing in the Christians worthy of death or punishment,
forbade any further cruelty to be put forth against them. Then under Adrian the Jews attempted
to rebel, and endeavored to plunder both Syria and Palestine; but on an army being
sent against them, they were subdued. At this time Adrian, thinking that he would destroy
the Christian faith by inflicting an injury upon the place, set up the images of demons both
in the temple and in the place where the Lord suffered. And because the Christians were
thought principally to consist of Jews (for the church at Jerusalem did not then have a priest
except of the circumcision), he ordered a cohort of soldiers to keep constant guard in order
to prevent all Jews from approaching to Jerusalem. This, however, rather benefited314 the
Christian faith, because almost all then believed in Christ as God while continuing315 in the
observance of the law. Undoubtedly that was arranged by the over-ruling care of the Lord,
in order that the slavery of the law might be taken away from the liberty of the faith and of
the church. In this way, Mark from among the Gentiles was then, first of all, bishop at Jerusalem.
A fourth persecution is reckoned as having taken place under Adrian, which, however,
he afterwards forbade to be carried on, declaring it to be unjust that any one should be put
on his trial without a charge being specified against him.</p>
<note type="footnote">314 How so? Because, according to Drusius, the Christian Jews were thus first taught to cast off the yoke of
the law, which they had observed up to this time.</note>

<p>After Adrian, the churches had peace under the rule of Antoninus Pius. Then the fifth
persecution began under Aurelius, the son of Antoninus. And then, for the first time, martyrdoms
were seen taking place in Gaul, for the religion of God had been accepted somewhat
late beyond the Alps. Then the sixth persecution of the Christians took place under the
emperor Severus. At this time Leonida, the father of Origen, poured forth his sacred blood
in martyrdom. Then, during an interval of thirty-eight years, the Christians enjoyed peace,
except that at the middle of that time Maximinus persecuted the clerics of some churches.
Ere long, under Decius as emperor, the seventh bloody persecution broke out against the
Christians. Next, Valerian proved himself the eighth enemy of the saints. After him, with
an interval of about fifty years, there arose, under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian,
a most bitter persecution which, for ten continuous years, wasted the people of God. At this
period, almost the whole world was stained with the sacred blood of the martyrs. In fact,
they vied with each other in rushing upon these glorious struggles, and martyrdom by
glorious deaths was then much more keenly sought after than bishoprics are now attempted
to be got by wicked ambition. Never more than at that time was the world exhausted by
wars, nor did we ever achieve victory with a greater triumph than when we showed that we
could not be conquered by the slaughters of ten long years. There survive also accounts of
the sufferings of the martyrs at that time which were committed to writing; but I do not
think it suitable to subjoin these lest I should exceed the limits prescribed to this work.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<p>Well, the end of the persecutions was reached eighty-eight years ago, at which date the
emperors began to be Christians. For Constantine then obtained the sovereignty, and he
was the first Christian of all the Roman rulers. At that time, it is true, Licinius, who was a
rival of Constantine for the empire, had commanded his soldiers to sacrifice, and was expelling
from the service those who refused to do so. But that is not reckoned among the
persecutions; it was an affair of too little moment to be able to inflict any wound upon the
churches. From that time, we have continued to enjoy tranquillity; nor do I believe that
there will be any further persecutions, except that which Antichrist will carry on just before
the end of the world. For it has been proclaimed in divine words, that the world was to be
visited by ten afflictions;316 and since nine of these have already been endured, the one
which remains must be the last. During this period of time, it is marvelous how the Christian
religion has prevailed. For Jerusalem which had presented a horrible mass of ruins was then
adorned with most numerous and magnificent churches. And Helena, the mother of the
emperor Constantine (who reigned along with her son as Augusta), having a strong desire
to behold Jerusalem, cast down the idols and the temples which were found there; and in
course of time, through the exercise of her royal powers, she erected churches317 on the site
of the Lord’s passion, resurrection, and ascension. It is a remarkable fact that the spot on
which the divine footprints had last been left when the Lord was carried up in a cloud to
heaven, could not be joined by a pavement with the remaining part of the street. For the
earth, unaccustomed to mere human contact, rejected all the appliances laid upon it, and
often threw back the blocks of marble in the faces of those who were seeking to place them.
Moreover, it is an enduring proof of the soil of that place having been trodden by God, that
the footprints are still to be seen; and although the faith of those who daily flock to that
place, leads them to vie with each other in seeking to carry away what had been trodden by
the feet of the Lord, yet the sand of the place suffers no injury; and the earth still preserves
the same appearance which it presented of old, as if it had been sealed by the footprints
impressed upon it.</p>

<p>Through the kind efforts of the same queen, the cross of the Lord was then found. It
could not, of course, be consecrated at the beginning, owing to the opposition of the Jews,
and afterwards it had been covered over by the rubbish of the ruined city. And now, it would
never have been revealed except to one seeking for it in such a believing spirit. Accordingly,
Helena having first got information about the place of our Lord’s passion, caused a band of
soldiers to be brought318 to it, while the whole multitude of the inhabitants of the locality
vied with each other in seeking to gratify the desires of the queen, and ordered the earth to
be dug up, and all the adjacent most extensive ruins to be cleared out. Ere long, as the reward
of her faith and labor, three crosses (as of old they had been fixed for the Lord and the two
robbers) were discovered. But upon this, the greater difficulty of distinguishing the gibbet
on which the Lord had hung, disturbed the minds and thoughts of all, lest by a mistake,
likely enough to be committed by mere mortals, they might perhaps consecrate as the cross
of the Lord, that which belonged to one of the robbers. They form then the plan of placing
one who had recently died in contact with the crosses. Nor is there any delay in carrying
out this purpose; for just as if by the appointment of God, the funeral of a dead man was
then being conducted with the usual ceremonies, and all rushing up took the body from the
bier. It was applied in vain to the first two crosses, but when it touched that of Christ, wonderful
to tell, while all stood trembling, the dead body was319 shaken off, and stood up in
the midst of those looking at it. The cross was thus discovered, and was consecrated with
all due ceremony.320</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
<p>Such were the things accomplished by Helena, while, under a Christian prince, the world
had both attained to liberty, and possessed in him an exemplar of faith. But a far more
dreadful danger than all that had preceded fell upon all the churches from that state of
tranquillity. For then the Arian heresy burst forth, and disturbed the whole world by the
error which it instilled. For by means of the two321 Ariuses, who were the most active originators
of this unfaithfulness, the emperor himself was led astray; and while he seemed to
himself to fulfill a religious duty, he proceeded to a violent exercise of persecution. The
bishops were driven into exile: cruelty was exerted against the clerics; and even the laity
were punished, who had separated from the communion of the Arians. Now, the doctrines
which the Arians proclaimed were of the following nature,—that God the Father had begotten
his Son for the purpose of creating the world; and that, by his power, he had made322 out
of nothing into a new and second substance, a new and second God; and that there was a
time when the Son had no existence. To meet this evil, a synod was convened from the whole
world to meet at Nicæa. Three hundred and eighteen bishops were there assembled: the
faith was fully set forth in writing; the Arian heresy was condemned; and the emperor confirmed
the whole by an imperial decree. The Arians, then, not daring to make any further
attempt against the orthodox faith, mixed themselves among the churches, as if they acqui-
esced in the conclusions which had been reached, and did not hold any different opinions.
There remained, however, in their hearts, a deep-seated hatred against the Catholics, and
they assailed, with suborned accusers and trumped-up charges, those with whom they could
not contend in argument on matters of faith.</p>
<note type="footnote">321 The one of these was Arius, the author of the heresy, and the other a presbyter of Alexandria bearing the

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
<p>Accordingly, they first attack and condemn in his absence Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria,
a holy man, who had been present as deacon at the Synod of Nicæa. For they added
to the charges which false witnesses had heaped up against him, this one, that, with wicked
intentions, he had received323 Marcellus and Photinus, heretical priests who had been
condemned by a sentence of the Synod. Now, it was not doubtful as to Photinus that he had
been justly condemned. But in the case of Marcellus, it seemed that nothing had then been
found worthy of condemnation, and324 a belief in his innocence was above all strengthened
by the animus of that party, inasmuch as no one doubted that those same judges were
heretical by whom he had been condemned. But the Arians did not so much desire to get
these persons out of the way as Athanasius himself. Accordingly, they constrain the emperor
to go so far as this, that Athanasius should be sent as an exile into Gaul. But ere long, eighty
bishops, assembling together in Egypt, declare that Athanasius had been unjustly condemned.
The matter is referred to Constantine: he orders325 bishops from the whole world to assemble
at Sardes, and that the entire process by which Athanasius had been condemned, should be
reconsidered by the council. In the meantime, Constantine dies, but the Synod, called together
while he was yet emperor, acquits Athanasius. Marcellus, too, is restored to his
bishopric, but the sentence on Photinus, bishop of Sirmion, was not rescinded; for even326
in the judgment of our friends, he is regarded as a heretic. However, even this result chagrined
Marcellus, because Photinus was known to have been his disciple in his youth. But this, too,
tended to secure an acquittal for Athanasius, that Ursatius and Valens, leading men among
the Arians, when they were openly separated from the communion of the Church after the
Synod at Sardes, entering into the presence of Julius, bishop of Rome, asked pardon of him
for having condemned the innocent, and publicly declared that he had been justly acquitted
by the decree of the Council of Sardes.</p>
<note type="footnote">323 Different periods and events are here mixed up by our author.</note>
<note type="footnote">324 The text is in utter confusion, and we can only make a probable guess at the meaning.</note>
<note type="footnote">325 It has been remarked that Sulpitius is in error in ascribing the summoning of this council to Constantine

an event so near his own time.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
<p>When, after an interval of some time had elapsed, Athanasius, finding that Marcellus
was by no means sound in the faith, suspended him from communion. And he had this
degree of modesty, that, being censured by the judgment of so great a man, he voluntarily
gave way. But though at a former period innocent, yet confessedly afterwards becoming
heretical, it may be allowed to conclude that he was really then guilty when judgment was
pronounced regarding him. The Arians, then, finding an opportunity of that kind, conspire
to subvert altogether the decrees of the Synod of Sardes. For a certain coloring of right
seemed to be furnished them in this fact, that a favorable judgment had as unjustly been
formed on the side of Athanasius, as Marcellus had been improperly acquitted, since now,
even in the opinion of Athanasius himself, he was deemed a heretic. For Marcellus had stood
forward as an upholder of the Sabellian heresy.327 But Photinus had already brought forward
a new heresy, differing indeed from Sabellius with respect to the union of the divine persons,
but proclaiming that Christ had his beginning in Mary. The Arians, therefore, with cunning
design, mix up what was harmless with what was blameworthy, and embrace, under the
same judgment, the condemnation of Photinus, and Marcellus, and Athanasius. They undoubtedly
did this with the view of leading the minds of the ignorant to conclude, that those
had not judged incorrectly regarding Athanasius, who, it was admitted, had expressed a
well-based opinion respecting Marcellus and Photinus. At that time, however, the Arians
concealed their treachery; and not daring openly to proclaim their erroneous doctrines,
they professed themselves Catholics. They thought that their first great object should be to
get Athanasius turned out of the church, who had always presented a wall of opposition to
their endeavors, and they hoped that, if he were removed, the rest would pass over to their
evil328 opinion. Now, that part of the bishops which followed the Arians accepted the condemnation
of Athanasius with delight. Another part, constrained by fear and faction, yielded
to the wish of the Arian party; and only a few, to whom the true faith was dearer than any
other consideration, refused to accept their unjust judgment. Among these was Paulinus,
the bishop of Treves. It is related that he, when a letter on the subject was placed before him,
thus wrote, that he gave his consent to the condemnation of Photinus and Marcellus, but
did not approve that of Athanasius.</p>

<p>But then the Arians, seeing that stratagem did not succeed, determined to proceed by
force. For it was easy for those to attempt and carry out anything who were supported by
the favor of the monarch, whom they had thoroughly won over to themselves by wicked
flatteries. Moreover, they were by the consent of all unconquerable; for almost all the bishops
of the two Pannonias, and many of the Eastern bishops, and those throughout all Asia, had
joined in their unfaithfulness. But the chief men in that evil company were Ursatius of
Singidunum, Valens of Mursa, Theodorus of Heraclia, Stephanus of Antioch, Acatius of
Cæsarea, Menofantus of Ephesus, Georgius of Laodicia, and Narcissus of Neronopolis.
These had got possession of the palace to such an extent that the emperor did nothing
without their concurrence. He was indeed at the beck of all of them, but was especially under
the influence of Valens. For at that time, when a battle was fought at Mursa against
Magnentius, Constantius had not the courage to go down to witness for himself the conflict,
but took up his abode in a church of the martyrs which stood outside the town, Valens who
was then the bishop of the place being with him to keep up his courage. But Valens had
cunningly arranged, through means of his agents, that he should be the first to be made acquainted
with the result of the battle. He did this either to gain the favor of the king, if he
should be the first to convey to him good news, or with a view to saving his own life, since
he would obtain time for flight, should the issue prove unfortunate. Accordingly, the few
persons who were with the king being in a state of alarm, and the emperor himself being a
prey to anxiety, Valens was the first to announce to them the flight of the enemy. When
Constantius requested that the person who had brought the news should be introduced to
his presence, Valens, to increase the reverence felt for himself, said that an angel was the
messenger who had come to him. The emperor, who was easy of belief, was accustomed
afterwards openly to declare that he had won the victory through the merits of Valens, and
not by the valor of his army.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
<p>From this first proof that the prince had been won over to their side, the Arians plucked
up their courage, knowing that they could make use of the power of the king, when they
could make little impression by their own authority. Accordingly, when our friends did not
accept of the judgment which they had pronounced in regard to Athanasius, an edict was
issued by the emperor to the effect that those who did not subscribe to the condemnation
of Athanasius should be sent into banishment. But, at that time, councils of bishops were
held by our friends at Arles and Bitteræ, towns situated in Gaul. They requested that before
any were compelled to subscribe against Athanasius, they should rather enter on a discussion
as to the true faith; and maintained that only then was a decision to be come to respecting
the point in question, when they had agreed as to the person of the judges.329 But Valens
and his confederates not venturing on a discussion respecting the faith, first desired to secure
by force the condemnation of Athanasius. Owing to this conflict of parties, Paulinus was
driven into banishment. In the meantime, an assembly was held at Milan, where the emperor
then was; but the same controversy was there continued without any relaxation of its bitterness.
Then Eusebius, bishop of the Vercellenses, and Lucifer, bishop of Caralis330 in
Sardinia, were exiled. Dionysius, however, priest of Milan, subscribed to the condemnation
of Athanasius, on the condition that there should be an investigation among the bishops as
to the true faith. But Valens and Ursatius, with the rest of that party, through fear of the
people, who maintained the Catholic faith with extraordinary enthusiasm, did not venture
to set forth in public their monstrous331 doctrines, but assembled within the palace. From
that place, and under the name of the emperor, they issued a letter full332 of all sorts of
wickedness, with this purpose, no doubt, that, if the people gave it a favorable hearing, they
should then bring forward, under public authority, the things which they desired; but if it
should be received otherwise, that all the ill feeling might be directed against the king, while
his mistake might be regarded as excusable, because being then only a catechumen, he might
readily be supposed to have erred concerning the mysteries of the faith. Well, when the letter
was read in the church, the people expressed their aversion to it. And Dionysius, because
he did not concur with them, was banished from the city, while Auxentius was immediately

chosen as bishop in his place. Liberius, too, bishop of the city of Rome, and Hilarius, bishop
of Poictiers, were driven into exile. Rhodanius, also, bishop of Toulouse (who, being by
nature of a softer disposition, had resisted the Arians, not so much from his own powers as
from his fellowship with Hilarius) was involved in the same punishment. All these persons,
however, were prepared to suspend Athanasius from communion, only in order that an
inquiry might be instituted among the bishops as to the true faith. But it seemed best to the
Arians to withdraw the most celebrated men from the controversy. Accordingly, those
whom we have mentioned above were driven into exile, forty-five years ago, when Arbitio
and Lollianus were consuls. Liberius, however, was, a little afterwards, restored to the city,
in consequence of the disturbances at Rome. But it is well known that the persons exiled
were celebrated by the admiration of the whole world, and that abundant supplies of money
were collected to meet their wants, while they were visited by deputies of the Catholic people
from almost all the provinces.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
<p>In the meantime, the Arians, not secretly, as before, but openly and publicly proclaimed
their monstrous heretical doctrines. Moreover, they interpreted after their own views the
Synod of Nicæa, and by the addition of one letter to its finding, threw a sort of obscurity
over the truth. For where the expression Homoousion had been written, which denotes “of
one substance,” they maintained that it was written Homoiousion, which simply means “of
like substance.” They thus granted a likeness, but took away unity; for likeness is very different
from unity; just as, for illustration’s sake, a picture of a human body might be like a man,
and yet possess nothing of the reality of a man. But some of them went even farther, and
maintained Anomoiousia, that is, an unlike substance. And to such a pitch did these controversies
extend, that the wide world was involved in these monstrous errors. For Valens and
Ursatius, with their supporters, whose names we have stated, infected Italy, Illyria, and the
East with these opinions. Saturninus, bishop of Arles, a violent and factious man, harassed
our country of Gaul in like manner. There was also a prevalent belief that Osius from Spain
had gone over to the same unfaithful party, which appears all the more wonderful and incredible
on this account, that he had been, almost during his whole life, the most determined
upholder of our views, and the Synod of Nice was regarded as having been held at his instigation.
If he did go over, the reason may have been that in his extreme old age (for he was
then more than a centenarian, as St. Hilarius relates in his epistles) he had fallen into dotage.
While the world was disturbed by these things, and the churches were languishing as if from
a sort of disease, an anxiety, less exciting indeed, but no less serious, pressed upon the emperor,
that although the Arians, whom he favored, appeared the stronger, yet there was still
no agreement among the bishops concerning the faith.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">

<head>CHAPTER XLI.</head>
<p>Accordingly, the emperor orders a Synod to assemble at Ariminum, a city of Italy, and
instructs Taurus the prefect, not to let them separate, after they were once assembled, until
they should agree as to one faith, at the same time promising him the consulship, if he carried
the affair to a successful termination. Imperial333 officers, therefore, being sent through Illyria,
Italy, Africa, and the two Gauls, four hundred and rather more Western bishops were
summoned or compelled to assemble at Ariminum; and for all of these the emperor had
ordered provisions334 and lodgings to be provided. But that appeared unseemly to the men
of our part of the world, that is, to the Aquitanians, the Gauls, and Britons, so that refusing
the public supplies, they preferred to live at their own expense. Three only of those from
Britain, through want of means of their own, made use of the public bounty, after having
refused contributions offered by the rest; for they thought it more dutiful to burden the
public treasury than individuals. I have heard that Gavidius, our bishop, was accustomed
to refer to this conduct in a censuring sort of way, but I would be inclined to judge far otherwise;
and I hold it matter of admiration that the bishops had nothing of their own, while
they did not accept assistance from others rather than from the public treasury, so that they
burdened nobody. In both points, they thus furnished us with noble example. Nothing
worthy of mention is recorded of the others; but I return to the subject in hand. After all
the bishops had been collected together, as we have said, a separation of parties took place.
Our friends335 take possession of the church, while the Arians select, as a place for prayer,
a temple which was then intentionally standing empty. But these did not amount to more
than eighty persons: the rest belonged to our party. Well, after frequent meetings had been
held, nothing was really accomplished, our friends continuing in the faith, and the others
not abandoning their unfaithfulness. At length it was resolved to send ten deputies to the
emperor, that he might learn what was the faith or opinion of the parties, and might know
that there could be no peace with heretics. The Arians do the same thing, and send a like
number of deputies, who should contend with our friends in the presence of the emperor.
But on the part of our people, young men of but little learning and little prudence had been
selected; while, on the side of the Arians, old men were sent, skillful and abounding in talent,
thoroughly imbued, too, with their old unfaithful doctrines; and these easily got the upper
hand with the prince. But our friends had been specially charged not to enter into any kind
of communion with the Arians, and to reserve every point, in its entirety, for discussion in
a Synod.</p>

<p>In the meantime in the East, after the example of the West, the emperor ordered almost
all the bishops to assemble at Seleucia, a town of Isauria. At that time, Hilarius, who was
now spending the fourth year of his exile in Phrygia, is compelled to be present among the
other bishops, the means of a public conveyance being furnished to him by the lieutenant336
and governor. As, however, the emperor had given no special orders regarding him, the
judges, simply following the general order by which they were commanded to gather all
bishops to the council, sent him also among the rest who were willing to go. This was done,
as I imagine, by the special ordination of God, in order that a man who was most deeply
instructed in divine things, might be present when a discussion was to be carried on respecting
the faith. He, on arriving at Seleucia, was received with great favor, and drew the minds
and affections of all towards himself. His first inquiry was as to the real faith of the Gauls,
because at that time the Arians had spread evil reports regarding us, and we were held suspected
by the Easterns as having embraced the belief of Sabellius, to the effect that the unity
of the one God was simply distinguished337 by a threefold name. But after he had set forth
his faith in harmony with those conclusions which had been reached by the fathers at Nicæa,
he bore his testimony in favor of the Westerns. Thus the minds of all having been satisfied,
he was admitted to communion, and being also received into alliance, was added to the
council. They then proceeded to actual work, and the originators of the wicked heresy being
discovered, were separated from the body of the Church. In that number were Georgius of
Alexandria, Acacius, Eudoxius, Vranius, Leontius, Theodosius, Evagrius, Theodulus. But
when the Synod was over, an embassy was appointed to go to the emperor and make him
acquainted with what had been done. Those who had been condemned also went to the
prince, relying upon the power of their confederates, and a common cause with the monarch.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
<p>In the meantime, the emperor compels those deputies of our party who had been sent
from the council at Ariminum to join in communion with the heretics. At the same time,
he hands them a confession of faith which had been drawn up by these wicked men, and
which, being expressed in deceptive terms, seemed to exhibit the Catholic faith, while unfaithfulness
secretly lay hid in it. For under an appearance of false reasoning, it abolished
the use of the word Ousia as being ambiguous, and as having been too hastily adopted by
the fathers, while it rested upon no Scriptural authority. The object of this was that the Son
might not be believed to be of one substance with the Father. The same confession of faith
acknowledged that the Son was like the Father. But deception was carefully prepared within
the words, in order that he might be like, but not equal. Thus, the deputies being sent away,
orders were given to the prefect that he should not dissolve the Synod, until all professed
by their subscriptions their agreement to the declaration of faith which had been drawn up;
and if any should hold back with excessive obstinacy, they should be driven into banishment,
provided their number did not amount to fifteen. But when the deputies returned, they
were refused communion, although they pleaded the force which had been brought to bear
upon them by the king. For when it was discovered what had been decreed, greater disturbance
arose in their affairs and purposes. Then by degrees numbers of our people, partly
overcome through the weakness of their character, and partly influenced by the thought of
a weary journeying into foreign lands, surrendered to the opposite party. These were now,
on the return of the deputies, the stronger of the two bodies, and had taken possession of
the church, our friends being driven out of it. And when the minds of our people once began
to incline in that direction, they rushed in flocks over to the other side, until the number of
our friends was diminished down to twenty.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
<p>But these, the fewer they became, showed themselves all the more powerful; as the most
steadfast among them was to be reckoned our friend Foegadius, and Servatio, bishop of the
Tungri. As these had not yielded to threats and terrors, Taurus assails them with entreaties,
and beseeches them with tears to adopt milder counsels. He argued that the bishops were
now in the seventh month since they had been shut up within one city—that no hope of
returning home presented itself to them, worn out by the inclemency of winter and positive
want; and what then would be the end? He urged them to follow the example of the majority,
and to derive authority for so doing at least from the numbers who had preceded them. For
Foegadius openly declared that he was prepared for banishment, and for every kind of
punishment that might be assigned him, but would not accept that confession of faith which
had been drawn up by the Arians. Thus several days passed in this sort of discussion. And
when they made little progress towards a pacification, by degrees Foegadius began to yield,
and at the last was overcome by a proposal which was made to him. For Valens and Ursatius
affirmed that the present confession of faith was drawn up on the lines of Catholic doctrine,
and having been brought forward by the Easterns at the instigation of the emperor, could
not be rejected without impiety; and what possible end of strife could there be if a confession
which satisfied the Easterns was rejected by those of the West? Finally, if there appeared
anything less fully stated in the present confession than was desirable, they themselves should
add what they thought ought to be added, and that they, for their part, would acquiesce in
those things which might be added. This friendly profession was received with favorable
minds by all. Nor did our people venture any longer to make opposition, desiring as they
did in some way or other now to put an end to the business. Then confessions drawn up by
Foegadius and Servatio began to be published; and in these first Arius and his whole unfaithful
scheme was condemned, while the Son of God also was338 pronounced equal to the Father,
and without beginning, [that is] without any commencement339 in time. Then Valens, as
if assisting our friends, subjoined the statement (in which there lurked a secret guile) that
the Son of God was not a creature like the other creatures; and the deceit involved in this
declaration escaped the notice of the hearers. For in these words, in which the Son was
denied to be like the other creatures, he was nevertheless pronounced a creature, only superior
to the rest. Thus neither party could hold that it had wholly conquered or had wholly
been conquered, since the confession itself was in favor of the Arians, but the declarations
afterwards added were in favor of our friends. That one, however, must be excepted which
Valens had subjoined, and which, not being at the time understood, was at length compre-

hended when it was too late. In this way, at any rate, the council was brought to an end, a
council which had a good beginning but a disgraceful conclusion.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
<p>Thus, then, the Arians, with their affairs in a very flourishing condition, and everything
turning out according to their wishes, go in a body to Constantinople where the emperor
was. There they found the deputies from the Synod of Seleucia, and compel them by an exercise
of the royal power to follow the example of the Westerns, and accept that heretical
confession of faith. Numbers who refused were tortured with painful imprisonment and
hunger, so that at length they yielded their conscience captive. But many who resisted more
courageously, being deprived of their bishoprics, were driven into exile, and others substituted
in their place. Thus, the best priests being either terrified by threats, or driven into exile, all
gave way before the unfaithfulness of a few. Hilarius was there at the time, having followed
the deputies from Seleucia; and as no certain orders had been given regarding him, he was
waiting on the will of the emperor to see whether perchance he should be ordered to return
into banishment. When he perceived the extreme danger into which the faith had been
brought, inasmuch as the Westerns had been beguiled, and the Easterns were being overcome
by means of wickedness, he, in three papers publicly presented, begged an audience of the
king, in order that he might debate on points of faith in the presence of his adversaries. But
the Arians opposed that to the utmost extent of their ability. Finally, Hilarius was ordered
to return to Gaul, as being a sower340 of discord, and a troubler of the East, while the sentence
of exile against him remained uncanceled. But when he had wandered over almost the whole
earth which was infected with the evil of unfaithfulness, his mind was full of doubt and
deeply agitated with the mighty burden of cares which pressed upon it. Perceiving that it
seemed good to many not to enter into communion with those who had acknowledged the
Synod of Ariminum, he thought the best thing he could do was to bring back all to repentance
and reformation. In frequent councils within Gaul, and while almost all the bishops publicly
owned the error that had been committed, he condemns the proceedings at Ariminum, and
frames anew the faith of the churches after its pristine form. Saturninus, however, bishop
of Arles, who was, in truth, a very bad man, of an evil and corrupt character, resisted these
sound measures. He was, in fact, a man who, besides the infamy of being a heretic, was
convicted of many unspeakable crimes, and cast out of the Church. Thus, having lost its
leader, the strength of the party opposed to Hilarius was broken. Paternus also of Petrocorii,
341 equally infatuated, and not shrinking from openly professing unfaithfulness, was
expelled from the priesthood: pardon was extended to the others. This fact is admitted by
all, that our regions of Gaul were set free from the guilt of heresy through the kind efforts
of Hilarius alone. But Lucifer, who was then at Antioch held a very different opinion. For
he condemned those who assembled at Ariminum to such an extent, that he even separated
<note type="footnote">340 “seminarium”: lit. seed-plot.</note>
<note type="footnote">341 The modern Perigueux.</note>

<pb n="290"/>
himself from the communion of those who had received them as friends, after they had
made satisfaction or exhibited penitence. Whether this resolution of his was right or wrong,
I will not take upon me to say. Paulinus and Rhodanius died in Phrygia; Hilarius died in
his native country in the sixth year after his return.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
<p>There follow the times of our own day, both difficult and dangerous. In these the
churches have been defiled with no ordinary evil, and all things thrown into confusion. For
then, for the first time, the infamous heresy of the Gnostics was detected in Spain—a
deadly342 superstition which concealed itself under mystic343 rites. The birthplace of that
mischief was the East, and specially Egypt, but from what beginnings it there sprang up and
increased is not easy to explain. Marcus was the first to introduce it into Spain, having set
out from Egypt, his birthplace being Memphis. His pupils were a certain Agape, a woman
of no mean origin, and a rhetorician named Helpidius. By these again Priscillian was instructed,
a man of noble birth, of great riches, bold, restless, eloquent, learned through much
reading, very ready at debate and discussion—in fact, altogether a happy man, if he had not
ruined an excellent intellect by wicked studies. Undoubtedly, there were to be seen in him
many admirable qualities both of mind and body. He was able to spend much time in
watchfulness, and to endure both hunger and thirst; he had little desire for amassing wealth,
and he was most economical in the use of it. But at the same time he was a very vain man,
and was much more puffed up than he ought to have been with the knowledge of mere
earthly344 things: moreover, it was believed that he had practised magical arts from his
boyhood. He, after having himself adopted the pernicious system referred to, drew into its
acceptance many persons of noble rank and multitudes of the common people by the arts
of persuasion and flattery which he possessed. Besides this, women who were fond of novelties
and of unstable faith, as well as of a prurient curiosity in all things, flocked to him in
crowds. It increased this tendency that he exhibited, a kind of humility in his countenance
and manner, and thus excited in all a greater honor and respect for himself. And now by
degrees the wasting disorder of that heresy345 had pervaded the most of Spain, and even
some of the bishops came under its depraving influence. Among these, Instantius and
Salvianus had taken up the cause of Priscillian, not only by expressing their concurrence in
his views, but even by binding themselves to him with a kind of oath. This went on until
Hyginus, bishop of Cordova, who dwelt in the vicinity, found out how matters stood, and
reported the whole to Ydacius, priest of Emerita. But he, by harassing Instantius and his
confederates without measure, and beyond what the occasion called for, applied, as it were,
a torch to the growing conflagration, so that he rather exasperated than suppressed these
evil men.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
<p>So, then, after many controversies among them, which are not worthy of mention, a
Synod was assembled at Saragossa, at which even the Aquitanian bishops were present. But
the heretics did not venture to submit themselves to the judgment of the council; sentence,
however, was passed against them in their absence, and Instantius and Salvianus, bishops,
with Helpidius and Priscillian, laymen, were condemned. It was also added that if any one
should admit the condemned persons to communion, he should understand that the same
sentence would be pronounced against himself. And the duty was entrusted to Ithacius,
bishop of Sossuba, of seeing that the decree of the bishops was brought to the knowledge
of all, and that Hyginus especially should be excluded from communion, who, though he
had been the first to commence open proceedings against the heretics, had afterwards fallen
away shamefully and admitted them to communion. In the meantime, Instantius and
Salvianus, having been condemned by the judgment of the priests, appoint as bishop in the
town of Arles, Priscillian, a layman indeed, but the leader in all these troubles, and who had
been condemned along with themselves in the Synod at Saragossa. This they did with the
view of adding to their strength, doubtless imagining that, if they armed with sacerdotal
authority a man of bold and subtle character, they would find themselves in a safer position.
But then Ydacius and Ithacius pressed forward their measures more ardently, in the belief
that the mischief might be suppressed at its beginning. With unwise counsels, however, they
applied to secular judges, that by their decrees and prosecutions the heretics might be expelled
from the cities. Accordingly, after many disgraceful squabbles, a rescript was, on the entreaty
of Ydacius, obtained from Gratianus, who was then emperor, in virtue of which all heretics
were enjoined not only to leave churches or cities, but to be driven forth beyond all the territory
under346 his jurisdiction. When this edict became known, the Gnostics, distrusting
their own affairs, did not venture to oppose the judgment, but those of them who bore the
name of bishops gave way of their own accord, while fear scattered the rest.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLVIII.</head>
<p>And then Instantius, Salvianus, and Priscillian set out for Rome, in order that before
Damasus who was at that time the bishop of the city, they might clear themselves of the
charges brought against them. Well, their journey led them through the heart of Aquitania,
and being there received with great pomp by such as knew no better, they spread the seeds
of their heresy. Above all, they perverted by their evil teachings the people of Elusa, who
were then of a good and religious disposition. They were driven forth from Bordeaux by
Delfinus, yet lingering for a little while in the territory of Euchrotia,347 they infected some
with their errors. They then pursued the journey on which they had entered, attended by a
base and shameful company, among whom were their wives and even strange women. In
the number of these was Euchrotia and her daughter Procula, of the latter of whom there
was a common report that, when pregnant through adultery with Priscillian, she procured
abortion by the use of certain plants. When they reached Rome with the wish of clearing
themselves before Damasus, they were not even admitted to his presence. Returning to
Milan, they found that Ambrose was equally opposed to them. Then they changed their
plans, with the view that, as they had not got the better of the two bishops, who were at that
time possessed of the highest authority, they might, by bribery and flattery, obtain what
they desired from the emperor. Accordingly, having won over Macedonius, who was the
master348 of public services, they procured a rescript, by which, those decrees which had
formerly been made being trampled under foot, they were ordered to be restored to their
churches. Relying upon this, Instantius and Priscillian made their wayback to Spain (for
Salvianus had died in the city); and they then, without any struggle, recovered the churches
over which they had ruled.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
<p>But the power, not the will, to resist, failed Ithacius; for the heretics had won over by
bribes Voluentius, the proconsul, and thus consolidated their own power. Moreover, Ithacius
was put on his trial, by these men as being a disturber of the churches, and he having been
ordered as the result of a fierce prosecution, to be carried off349 as a prisoner, fled in terror
into Gaul, where he betook himself to Gregory the prefect. He, after he learned what had
taken place, orders the authors of these tumults to be brought before himself, and makes a
report on all that had occurred to the emperor, in order that he might close against the
heretics every means of flattery or bribery. But that was done in vain; because, through the
licentiousness and power of a few, all things were there to be purchased. Accordingly, the
heretics by their artifices, having presented Macedonius with a large sum of money, secure
that, by the imperial authority, the hearing of the trial was taken from the prefect, and
transferred to the lieutenant in Spain. By that time, the Spaniards had ceased to have a
proconsul as ruler, and officials were sent by the Master to bring back to Spain Ithacius who
was then living at Treves. He, however, craftily escaped them, and being subsequently de-
fended by the bishop Pritannius, he set them at defiance. Then, too, a faint350 rumor had
spread that Maximus had assumed imperial power in Britain, and would, in a short time,
make an incursion into Gaul. Accordingly, Ithacius then resolved, although his affairs were
in a ticklish state, to wait the arrival of the new emperor; and that, in the meantime, no step
should on his part be taken. When therefore Maximus, as victor, entered the town of the
Treveri, he poured forth entreaties full of ill-will and accusations against Priscillian and his
confederates. The emperor influenced by these statements sent letters to the prefect of Gaul
and to the lieutenant in Spain, ordering that all whom that disgraceful351 heresy had affected
should be brought to a Synod at Bordeaux. Accordingly, Instantius and Priscillian were escorted
thither and, of these, Instantius was enjoined to plead his cause; and after he was
found unable to clear himself, he was pronounced unworthy of the office of a bishop. But
Priscillian, in order that he might avoid being heard by the bishops, appealed to the emperor.
And that was permitted to be done through the want of resolution on the part of our friends,
who ought either to have passed a sentence even against one who resisted it, or, if they were
regarded as themselves suspicious persons, should have reserved the hearing for other
bishops, and should not have transferred to the emperor a cause involving such manifest
offences.</p>

<head>CHAPTER L.</head>
<p>Thus, then, all whom the process embraced were brought before the king. The bishops
Ydacius and Ithacius followed as accusers; and I would by no means blame their zeal in
overthrowing heretics, if they had not contended for victory with greater keenness than was
fitting. And my feeling indeed is, that the accusers were as distasteful to me as the accused.
I certainly hold that Ithacius had no worth or holiness about him. For he was a bold, loquacious,
impudent, and extravagant man; excessively devoted to the pleasures of sensuality.
He proceeded even to such a pitch of folly as to charge all those men, however holy, who
either took delight in reading, or made it their object to vie with each other in the practice
of fasting, with being friends or disciples of Priscillian. The miserable wretch even ventured
publicly to bring forward a disgraceful charge of heresy against Martin, who was at that time
a bishop, and a man clearly worthy of being compared to the Apostles. For Martin, being
then settled at Treves, did not cease to importune Ithacius, that he should give up his accusations,
or to implore Maximus that he should not shed the blood of the unhappy persons
in question. He maintained that it was quite sufficient punishment that, having been declared
heretics by a sentence of the bishops, they should have been expelled from the churches;
and that it was, besides, a foul and unheard-of indignity, that a secular ruler should be judge
in an ecclesiastical cause. And, in fact, as long as Martin survived, the trial was put off; while,
when he was about to leave this world, he, by his remarkable influence, obtained a promise
from Maximus, that no cruel measure would be resolved on with respect to the guilty persons.
But subsequently, the emperor being led astray by Magnus and Rufus, and turned from the
milder course which Martin had counseled, entrusted the case to the prefect Evodius, a man
of stern and severe character. He tried Priscillian in two assemblies, and convicted him of
evil conduct. In fact, Priscillian did not deny that he had given himself up to lewd doctrines;
had been accustomed to hold, by night, gatherings of vile women, and to pray in a state of
nudity. Accordingly, Evodius pronounced him guilty, and sent him back to prison, until he
had time to consult the emperor. The matter, then, in all its details, was reported to the
palace, and the emperor decreed that Priscillian and his friends should be put to death.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51"> 
<pb n="296"/>
<head>CHAPTER LI.</head>
<p>But Ithacius, seeing how much ill-will it would excite against him among the bishops,
if he should stand forth as accuser also at the last trial on a capital charge (for it was requisite
that the trial should be repeated), withdrew from the prosecution. His cunning, however,
in thus acting was in vain, as the mischief was already accomplished. Well, a certain Patricius,
an advocate connected with the treasury, was then appointed accuser by Maximus. Accordingly,
under him as prosecutor, Priscillian was condemned to death, and along with him,
Felicissimus and Armenius, who, when they were clerics, had lately adopted the cause of
Priscillian, and revolted from the Catholics. Latronianus, too, and Euchrotia were beheaded.
Instantius, who, as we have said above, had been condemned by the bishops, was transported
to the island of Sylina352 which lies beyond Britain. A process was then instituted against
the others in trials which followed, and Asarivus, and Aurelius the deacon, were condemned
to be beheaded, while Tiberianus was deprived of his goods, and banished to the island of
Sylina. Tertullus, Potamius, and Joannes, as being persons of less consideration, and worthy
of some merciful treatment, inasmuch as before the trial they had made a confession, both
as to themselves and their confederates, were sentenced to a temporary banishment into
Gaul. In this sort of way, men who were most unworthy of the light of day, were, in order
that they might serve as a terrible example to others, either put to death or punished with
exile. That conduct353 which he had at first defended by his right of appeal to the tribunals,
and by regard to the public good, Ithacius, harassed354 with invectives, and at last overcome,
threw the blame of upon those, by whose direction and counsels he had effected his object.
Yet he was the only one of all of them who was thrust out of the episcopate. For Ydacius,
although less guilty, had voluntarily resigned his bishopric: that was wisely and respectfully
done, had he not afterward spoiled the credit of such a step by endeavoring to recover the
position which had been lost. Well, after the death of Priscillian, not only was the heresy
not suppressed, which, under him, as its author, had burst forth, but acquiring strength, it
became more widely spread. For his followers who had previously honored him as a saint,
subsequently began to reverence him as a martyr. The bodies of those who had been put to
death were conveyed to Spain, and their funerals were celebrated with great pomp. Nay, it
came to be thought the highest exercise of religion to swear by Priscillian. But between them
and our friends, a perpetual war of quarreling has been kept up. And that conflict, after being
<note type="footnote">352 Halm prefers the form “Sylinancim” to “Sylinam.” The reference is probably to the Scilly Isles.</note>
<note type="footnote">353 The meaning seems to be, that Ithacius being blamed for bringing accusations against his brethren, at
first defended his conduct by an appeal to the laws and the public weal, both of which justified the prosecution
of heretics; but being at last driven from this position, he turned round and cast the blame upon those for whom
he had acted.</note>
<note type="footnote">354 Some read “solitus,” instead of “sollicitus.</note>

sustained for fifteen years with horrible dissension, could not by any means be set at rest.
And now all things were seen to be disturbed and confused by the discord, especially of the
bishops, while everything was corrupted by them through their hatred, partiality, fear,
faithlessness, envy, factiousness, lust, avarice, pride, sleepiness, and inactivity. In a word, a
large number were striving with insane plans and obstinate inclinations against a few giving
wise counsel: while, in the meantime, the people of God, and all the excellent of the earth
were exposed to mockery and insult.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>Very little is known of the author of the following Treatise. He writes under the assumed
name of Peregrinus, but Gennadius of Marseilles,1 who flourished a.d. 495, some sixty years
after its date, ascribes it to Vincentius, an inmate of the famous monastery of Lérins, in the
island of that name,2 and his ascription has been universally accepted.</p>
<p>Vincentius was of Gallic nationality. In earlier life he had been engaged in secular pursuits,
whether civil or military is not clear, though the term he uses, “secularis militia,” might
possibly imply the latter. He refers to the Council of Ephesus, held in the summer and early
autumn of 431, as having been held some three years previously to the time at which he was
writing “ante triennium ferme.”3 This gives the date of the Commonitory 434. Cyril, bishop
of Alexandria, was still living.4 Sixtus the Third had succeeded to the See of Rome;5 his
predecessor, Celestine, having died in 432. Gennadius says that Vincentius died, “Theodosio
et Valentiniano regnantibus.”6 Theodosius died, leaving Valentinian still reigning, in July,
450. Vincentius’ death, therefore, must have occurred in or before that year.</p>
<p>Baronius places his name in the Roman Martyrology, Tillemont doubts whether with
sufficient reason.7 He is commemorated on the 24th of May.</p>
<p>Vincentius has been charged with Semipelagianism. Whether he actually held the doctrine
which was afterwards called by that name is not clear. Certainly the express enunciation
of it is nowhere to be found in the Commonitory. But it is extremely probable that at least
his sympathies were with those who held it. For not only does he omit the name of St. Au-

<note type="footnote">2 Now St. Honorat, so called from St. Honoratus, the founder of the monastery. The monastery seems at first
to have consisted of an aggregation of separate cells, each of which, according to the usage of that time, would
be called a “monasterium.” “Tota ubique insula, exstructis cellulis, unum velut monasterium evasit.”—Cardinal
Noris, Histor. Pelag. p. 251. “Monasterium potest unius monachi habitaculum nominari.”—Cassian. Collat. xvii.
18. Among its more prominent members, contemporary with Vincentius, were Honoratus and Hilary, afterwards
successively bishops of Arles, and Faustus, afterwards bishop of Riez, all of them in sympathy with the neighbouring
clergy of Marseilles, opposed to St. Augustine’s later teaching, and holding what was afterwards called
Semipelagian doctrine. The adjoining islet of St. Marguérite, one of the Lérins group, has acquired notoriety of
late, from having been the place to which Marshal Bazaine, the betrayer of Metz, was banished in 1873.</note>

gustine, who was especially obnoxious to them, when making honorable mention at any
time of the champions of the faith, but he denounces his doctrine, though under a misrepresentation
of it, as one of the forms of that novel error which he reprobates.8 Indeed,
whoever will compare what he says in § 70 of the heresy which he describes but forbears to
name, with Prosper’s account of the charges brought against Augustine by certain Semipelagian
clergymen of Marseilles,9 will have little doubt that Vincentius and they had the same
teacher in view, and were of the same mind with regard to his teaching. Be this however as
it may, when it is considered that the monks of Lérins, in common with the general body
of the churchmen of Southern Gaul, were strenuous upholders of Semipelagianism, it will
not be thought surprising that Vincentius should have been suspected of at least a leaning
in that direction. Tillemont, who forbears to express himself decidedly, but evidently inclines
to that view, says “L’opinion qui le condamne et l’abandonne aux Semipelagiens passe
aujourd’hui pour la plus commune parmi les savans.”10</p>
<p>It has been matter of question whether Vincentius is to be credited with the authorship
of the “Objectiones Vincentianæ,” a collection of Sixteen Inferences alleged to be deducible
from St. Augustine’s writings, which has come down to us in Prosper’s Reply.</p>
<p>Its date coincides so nearly with that of the Commonitory as to preclude all doubt as to
the identity of authorship on that score,11 and it must be confessed that its animus and that
of the 70th and 86th sections of the Commonitory are too much in keeping to make it difficult
to believe that both are from the same pen.</p>
<p>Vincentius’s object in the following treatise is to provide himself, as he states, with a
general rule whereby to distinguish Catholic truth from heresy; and he commits what he
has learnt, he adds, to writing, that he may have it by him for reference as a Commonitory,
or Remembrancer, to refresh his memory.</p>
<p>This rule, in brief, is the authority of Holy Scripture. By that all questions must be tried
in the first instance. And it would be abundantly sufficient, but that, unfortunately, men
differ in the interpretation of Holy Scripture. The rule, therefore, must be supplemented by
an appeal to that sense of Holy Scripture which is supported by universality, antiquity, and
consent: by universality, when it is the faith of the whole Church; by antiquity, when it is
that which has been held from the earliest times; by consent, when it has been the acknow-

ledged belief of all, or of almost all, whose office and character gave authority to their determinations.
This is the famous “Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus,” with
which Vincentius’s name is associated.12 The body of the work is taken up with its illustration
and application.</p>
<p>The work consisted originally of two books; but unfortunately the second was lost, or
rather, as Gennadius says, was stolen, while the author was still alive; and there remains to
us nothing but a recapitulation of its contents, which the author, unwilling to encounter
the labour of rewriting the whole, has drawn up.13</p>
<p>In prosecution of his purpose Vincentius proceeds to show how his rule applies for the
detection of error in the instances of some of the more notorious heretics and schismatics
who up to his time had made havoc of the Church,—the Donatists and the Arians, for instance,
and the maintainers of the iteration of Baptism; and how the great defenders of the
Faith were guided in their maintenance of the truth by its observance.14</p>
<p>But the perplexing question occurs: Wherefore, in God’s providence, were persons,
eminent for their attainments and their piety, such as Photinus, Apollinaris, and Nestorius,
permitted to fall into heresy?15 To which the answer is, For the Church’s trial. And Vincentius
proceeds to show, in the case of each of these, how great a trial to the Church his fall
was. This leads him to give an account of their erroneous teaching severally,16 from which
he turns aside for a while to expound the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity as opposed to the
heresy of Photinus, and of the Incarnation as opposed to the heresies of Apollinaris and
Nestorius, in an exposition remarkable for its clearness and precision.17 It contains so much
in common with the so-called Athanasian Creed, both as to the sentiments and the language,
that some have inferred from it, that Vincentius was the author of that Formulary.18</p>
<p>Returning from this digression, Vincentius proceeds, after promising to deal with these
subjects more fully on a future occasion,19 to two other very signal instances of heretical
defection caused by the disregard of antiquity and universality; those of Origen20 and Tertullian,
21 of both of whom he draws a vivid picture, contrasting them, such as they were

before their fall with what they became afterwards, and enlarging on the grievous injury to
the Church generally, and the distressing trial to individuals in particular, consequent upon
their defection.</p>
<p>But it will be asked, Is Christian doctrine to remain at a standstill? Is there to be no
progress, as in other sciences?22 Undoubtedly there is to be progress; but it must be real
progress, analogous, for instance, to the growth of the human body from infancy to childhood,
from childhood to mature age; or to the development of a plant from the seed to the
full-grown vegetable or tree; it must be such as the elucidation of what was before obscure,
the following out into detail of what was before expressed only in general terms,23 not the
addition of new doctrine, not the rejection of old.</p>
<p>One difficulty which is not unlikely to perplex a simple Christian is the readiness with
which heretics appeal to Scripture, following therein the example of their arch-leader, who,
in his temptation of our Lord, dared to make use of arms drawn from that armoury.24 This
leads to the question, How are we to ascertain the true sense of Scripture? And, in the answer
to it, to a more detailed exposition of the general rule given at the outset.</p>
<p>Scripture, then, must be interpreted in accordance with the tradition of the Catholic
Church, our guide being antiquity, universality, consent.</p>
<p>With regard to antiquity, that interpretation must be held to which has been handed
down from the earliest times; with regard to universality, that which has always been held,
if not by all, at least by the most part, in preference to that which has been held only by a
few; with regard to consent, the determination of a General Council on any point will of
course be of summary authority, and will hold the first place; next to this, the interpretation
which has been held uniformly and persistently by all those Fathers, or by a majority of
them, who have lived and died in the communion of the Catholic Church. Accordingly,
whatsoever interpretation of Holy Scripture is opposed to an interpretation thus authentic-
<note type="footnote">22 § 55.</note>
<note type="footnote">23 §§ 55–60. For instances in point, he might have referred to the enlargement and expansion of the earlier
Creed, first in the Nicene, afterward in the Constantinopolitan Formulary. Thus, in the Definition of the Faith
of the Council of Chalcedon, the Fathers are careful to explain that they are making no addition to the original
deposit, but amply unfolding and rendering more intelligible what before had been less distinctly set forth:
“Teaching in its fulness the doctrine which from the beginning hath remained unshaken, it decrees, in the first
place that the Creed of the 318 (the original Nicene Creed) remain untouched; and on account of those who
impugn the Holy Spirit, it ratifies and confirms the doctrine subsequently delivered, concerning the essence of
the Holy Spirit, by the hundred and fifty holy Fathers, (the Constantinopolitan Creed), which they promulgated
for universal acceptance, not as though they were supplying some omission of their predecessors, but testifying
in express words in writing their own minds concerning the Holy Spirit.”</note>
<note type="footnote">24 §§ 65 sqq.</note>

<pb n="303"/>
ated, even though supported by the authority of one or another individual teacher, however
eminent, whether by his position, or his attainments, or his piety, or by all of these together,
must be rejected as novel and unsound.</p>
<p>Here the first Commonitory ends; but it ends with a promise of a still further and more
detailed inquiry, to be prosecuted in the Commonitory which is to follow, into the way in
which the opinions of the ancient Fathers are to be collected, and the rule of faith determined
in accordance with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that promise, however fulfilled according to the author’s intention, has
been frustrated to his readers. The second Commonitory, as was said above, was lost, or
rather stolen, and all that remains to us is a brief and apparently partial recapitulation of its
contents and of the contents of the preceding.</p>
<p>In this Vincentius repeats the rule for ascertaining the Catholic doctrine which he had
laid down at the outset, enlarging especially upon the way in which the consent of the
Fathers is to be arrived at, and illustrating what he says by the course pursued by the
Council of Ephesus in the matter of Nestorius,—how the Fathers of the Council, instead of
resting upon their own judgment, eminent as many of them were, collected together the
opinions of the most illustrious of their predecessors, and following their consentient belief,
determined the question before them. To this most noteworthy example he adds the authority
of two bishops of Rome, Sixtus III., then occupying the Papal Chair, and Celestine, his immediate
predecessor,—the gist of the whole being the confirmation of the rule which it had
been his object to enforce throughout the Treatise—that profane novelties must be rejected,
and that faith alone adhered to which the universal Church has held consentiently from the
earliest times, Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus.</p>

<head>The Object of the Following Treatise.</head>
<p><del>1.</del> I, Peregrinus,2 who am the least of all the servants of God, remembering the admonition
of Scripture, “Ask thy fathers and they will tell thee, thine elders and they will declare
unto thee,”3 and again, “Bow down thine ear to the words of the wise,”4 and once more,
“My son, forget not these instructions, but let thy heart keep my words:”5 remembering
these admonitions, I say, I, Peregrinus, am persuaded, that, the Lord helping me, it will be
of no little use and certainly as regards my own feeble powers, it is most necessary, that I
should put down in writing the things which I have truthfully received from the holy Fathers,
since I shall then have ready at hand wherewith by constant reading to make amends for
the weakness of my memory.</p>
<p><del>2.</del> To this I am incited not only by regard to the fruit to be expected from my labour
but also by the consideration of time and the opportuneness of place:
By the consideration of time,—for seeing that time seizes upon all things human, we
also in turn ought to snatch from it something which may profit us to eternal life, especially
since a certain awful expectation of the approach of the divine judgment importunately
demands increased earnestness in religion, while the subtle craftiness of new heretics calls
for no ordinary care and attention.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 COMMONITORY. I HAVE RETAINED THE ORIGINAL TITLE IN ITS ANGLICISED FORM, ALREADY
FAMILIAR TO ENGLISH EARS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NAME OF VINCENTIUS. ITS MEANING

MEANT A PAPER OF INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO A PERSON CHARGED WITH A COMMISSION, TO
ASSIST HIS MEMORY AS TO ITS DETAILS.</note>

Noris evidently agrees, supposes that his object was to avoid openly avowing himself the author of a work which
covertly attacked St. Augustine. Vossius, Histor. Pelag. p. 246. Ego quidem ad Vossii sententiam plane accessissem,

<p>I am incited also by the opportuneness of place, in that, avoiding the concourse and
crowds of cities, I am dwelling in the seclusion of a Monastery, situated in a remote grange,6
where, I can follow without distraction the Psalmist’s7 admonition, “Be still, and know that
I am God.”</p>
<p>Moreover, it suits well with my purpose in adopting this life; for, whereas I was at one
time involved in the manifold and deplorable tempests of secular warfare, I have now at
length, under Christ’s auspices, cast anchor in the harbour of religion, a harbour to all always
most safe, in order that, having there been freed from the blasts of vanity and pride, and
propitiating God by the sacrifice of Christian humility, I may be able to escape not only the
shipwrecks of the present life, but also the flames of the world to come.</p>
<p><del>3.</del> But now, in the Lord’s name, I will set about the object I have in view; that is to say,
to record with the fidelity of a narrator rather than the presumption of an author, the things
which our forefathers have handed down to us and committed to our keeping, yet observing
this rule in what I write, that I shall by no means touch upon everything that might be said,
but only upon what is necessary; nor yet in an ornate and exact style, but in simple and ordinary
language,8 so that the most part may seem to be intimated, rather than set forth in
detail. Let those cultivate elegance and exactness who are confident of their ability or are
moved by a sense of duty. For me it will be enough to have provided a Commonitory (or
Remembrancer) for myself, such as may aid my memory, or rather, provide against my
forgetfulness: which same Commonitory however, I shall endeavor, the Lord helping me,
to amend and make more complete by little and little, day by day, by recalling to mind what
I have learnt. I mention this at the outset, that if by chance what I write should slip out of
my possession and come into the hands of holy men, they may forbear to blame anything
therein hastily, when they see that there is a promise that it will yet be amended and made
more complete.</p>
<note type="footnote">6 Noris, from this word, “villula,” a grange or country house, concludes that Vincentius, at the time of writing,
though a monk, was not a monk of Lérins for there could be no “villula” there then, Honoratus having found
the island desolate and without inhabitant, when he settled on it but a few years previously, “vacantem insulam
ob nimictatem squaloris, et inaccessam venenatorum animalium metu.” Histor. Pelag. p. 251. Why, however,
may not the “villula” have been built subsequently to Honoratus’s settlement and indeed, as a part of it?
Whether Vincentius was an inmate of the monastery of Lérins at the time of writing the Commonitory or not,
he was so eventually, and died there.</note>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>A General Rule for distinguishing the Truth of the Catholic Faith from the Falsehood of
Heretical Pravity.</head>
<p><del>4.</del> I have often then inquired earnestly and attentively of very many men eminent for
sanctity and learning, how and by what sure and so to speak universal rule I may be able to
distinguish the truth of Catholic faith from the falsehood of heretical pravity; and I have
always, and in almost every instance, received an answer to this effect: That whether I or
any one else should wish to detect the frauds and avoid the snares of heretics as they rise,
and to continue sound and complete in the Catholic faith, we must, the Lord helping, fortify
our own belief in two ways; first, by the authority of the Divine Law, and then, by the Tradition
of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p><del>5.</del> But here some one perhaps will ask, Since the canon of Scripture is complete, and
sufficient of itself for everything, and more than sufficient, what need is there to join with
it the authority of the Church’s interpretation? For this reason,—because, owing to the depth
of Holy Scripture, all do not accept it in one and the same sense, but one understands its
words in one way, another in another; so that it seems to be capable of as many interpretations
as there are interpreters. For Novatian expounds it one way, Sabellius another, Donatus
another, Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, another, Photinus, Apollinaris, Priscillian, another,
Iovinian, Pelagius, Celestius, another, lastly, Nestorius another. Therefore, it is very necessary,
on account of so great intricacies of such various error, that the rule for the right understanding
of the prophets and apostles should be framed in accordance with the standard of Ecclesiastical
and Catholic interpretation.</p>
<p><del>6.</del> Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we
hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in
the strictest sense “Catholic,” which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare,
comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity,
consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole
Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations
which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers;
consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and
determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors.</p>

<head>What is to be done if one or more dissent from the rest.</head>
<p><del>7.</del> What then will a Catholic Christian do, if a small portion of the Church have cut
itself off from the communion of the universal faith? What, surely, but prefer the soundness
of the whole body to the unsoundness of a pestilent and corrupt member? What, if some
novel contagion seek to infect not merely an insignificant portion of the Church, but the
whole? Then it will be his care to cleave to antiquity, which at this day cannot possibly be
seduced by any fraud of novelty.</p>
<p><del>8.</del> But what, if in antiquity itself there be found error on the part of two or three men,
or at any rate of a city or even of a province? Then it will be his care by all means, to prefer
the decrees, if such there be, of an ancient General Council to the rashness and ignorance
of a few. But what, if some error should spring up on which no such decree is found to bear?
Then he must collate and consult and interrogate the opinions of the ancients, of those,
namely, who, though living in divers times and places, yet continuing in the communion
and faith of the one Catholic Church, stand forth acknowledged and approved authorities:
and whatsoever he shall ascertain to have been held, written, taught, not by one or two of
these only, but by all, equally, with one consent, openly, frequently, persistently, that he
must understand that he himself also is to believe without any doubt or hesitation.</p>

<p>The evil resulting from the bringing in of Novel Doctrine shown in the instances of the
Donatists and Arians.</p>
<p><del>9.</del> But that we may make what we say more intelligible, we must illustrate it by individual
examples, and enlarge upon it somewhat more fully, lest by aiming at too great
brevity important matters be hurried over and lost sight of.
In the time of Donatus,25 from whom his followers were called Donatists, when great
numbers in Africa were rushing headlong into their own mad error, and unmindful of their
name, their religion, their profession, were preferring the sacrilegious temerity of one man
before the Church of Christ, then they alone throughout Africa were safe within the sacred
precincts of the Catholic faith, who, detesting the profane schism, continued in communion
with the universal Church, leaving to posterity an illustrious example, how, and how well
in future the soundness of the whole body should be preferred before the madness of one,
or at most of a few.</p>
<p><del>10.</del> So also when the Arian poison had infected not an insignificant portion of the
Church but almost the whole world,26 so that a sort of blindness had fallen upon almost all
<note type="footnote">25 There were two persons of this name, both intimately connected with the schism,—the earlier one, bishop
of Casa Nigra in Numidia, the other the successor of Majorinus, whom in the year 311 the party had elected to
be bishop of Carthage in opposition to Cecilian, the Catholic bishop, the ground of the opposition being that
the principal among Cecilian’s consecrators lay under the charge of having delivered up the sacred books to the
heathen magistrates in the Dioclesian persecution, and of having thereby rendered his ministerial acts invalid.
It was from the last-mentioned probably that the sect was called. The Donatists affected great strictness of life,
and ignoring the plain declarations of Scripture, and notably the prophetic representations contained in our
Lord’s parables of the Tares, the Draw-net, and others, they held that no church could be a true church which
endured the presence of evil men in its society. Accordingly they broke off communion with the rest of the
African Church and with all who held communion with it, which was in effect the rest of Christendom, denying
the validity of their sacraments, rebaptizing those who came over to them from other Christian bodies, and reordaining
their clergy. The sect became so powerful that for some time it formed the stronger party in the church
of North Western Africa, its bishops exceeding four hundred in number; but partly checked through the exertions
of Augustine in the first years of the fifth century, and of Pope Gregory the Great at the close of the sixth, and
partly weakened by divisions among themselves, they dwindled away and become extinct.</note>
<note type="footnote">26 The rise of Arianism was nearly contemporaneous with that of Donatism. It originated with Arius, a
presbyter of Alexandria, a man of a subtle wit and a fluent tongue. He began by calling in question the teaching
of his bishop, when discoursing on a certain occasion on the subject of the Trinity. For himself he denied our
blessed Lord’s coeternity and consubstantiality with the Father, which was in effect to deny that He is God in
any true sense, though he made no scruple of giving Him the name. His doctrine may be best inferred from the
anathema directed against it, appended to the original Nicene Creed: “Those who say, that once the Son of God</note>

the bishops27 of the Latin tongue, circumvented partly by force partly by fraud, and was
preventing them from seeing what was most expedient to be done in the midst of so much
confusion, then whoever was a true lover and worshipper of Christ, preferring the ancient
belief to the novel misbelief, escaped the pestilent infection.</p>
<p><del>11.</del> By the peril of which time was abundantly shown how great a calamity the introduction
of a novel doctrine causes. For then truly not only interests of small account, but
others of the very gravest importance, were subverted. For not only affinities, relationships,
friendships, families, but moreover, cities, peoples, provinces, nations, at last the whole
Roman Empire, were shaken to their foundation and ruined. For when this same profane
Arian novelty, like a Bellona or a Fury, had first taken captive the Emperor,28 and had then
subjected all the principal persons of the palace to new laws, from that time it never ceased
to involve everything in confusion, disturbing all things, public and private, sacred and
profane, paying no regard to what was good and true, but, as though holding a position of
authority, smiting whomsoever it pleased. Then wives were violated, widows ravished, virgins
profaned, monasteries demolished, clergymen ejected, the inferior clergy scourged, priests
driven into exile, jails, prisons, mines, filled with saints, of whom the greater part, forbidden
<note type="footnote">did not exist, and that before He was begotten He did not exist, or who affirm that He is of a different substance
or essence (from that of the Father), or that His nature is mutable or alterable, those the Catholic and Apostolic
Church anathematises.” Arianism spread with great rapidity, and though condemned by the Council of Nicæa
in 325, it gained fresh strength on the death of Constantine and the accession of Constantius, so that for many
years thenceforward the history of the Church is occupied with nothing so much as with accounts of its struggle
for supremacy. “Arians and Donatists began both about one time, which heresies, according to the different
strength of their own sinews, wrought, as the hope of success led them, the one with the choicest wits, the other
with the multitude, so far, that after long and troublesome experience, the perfectest view that men could take
of both was hardly able to induce any certain determinate resolution, whether error may do more by the curious
subtlety of sharp discourse, or else by the mere appearance of zeal and devout affection.”—Hooker, Eccles. Pol.
v. 62. § 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">27 The Catholic bishops, in number more than four hundred, who at Ariminum, in 359, after having subscribed
the Creed of Nicæa, were induced, partly by fraud, partly by threats, to repudiate its crucial terms and sign an
Arian Formulary. It was in reference to this that St. Jerome wrote, “Ingemuit orbis, et Arium se esse miratus
est.” “The world groaned and marvelled to find itself Arian.” He continues, “The vessel of the apostles was in
extreme danger. The storm raged, the waves beat upon the ship, all hope was gone. The Lord awakes, rebukes
the tempest, the monster (Constantius) dies, tranquillity is restored. The bishops who had been thrust out from
their sees return, through the clemency of the new emperor. Then did Egypt receive Athanasius in triumph,
then did the Church of Gaul receive Hilary returning from battle, then did Italy put off her mourning garments
at the return of Eusebius (of Vercellæ).”—Advers. Luciferianos, § 10.</note>

to enter into cities, thrust forth from their homes to wander in deserts and caves, among
rocks and the haunts of wild beasts, exposed to nakedness, hunger, thirst, were worn out
and consumed. Of all of which was there any other cause than that, while human superstitions
are being brought in to supplant heavenly doctrine, while well established antiquity is being
subverted by wicked novelty, while the institutions of former ages are being set at naught,
while the decrees of our fathers are being rescinded, while the determinations of our ancestors
are being torn in pieces, the lust of profane and novel curiosity refuses to restrict itself
within the most chaste limits of hallowed and uncorrupt antiquity?29</p>
<note type="footnote">29 Though Vincentius’ account of the Arian persecutions refers to those under Arian emperors, Constantius
and Valens, the former especially, yet he could not but have had in mind the atrocious cruelties which were being
perpetrated, at the time when he was writing, by the Arian Vandals in Africa. Possidius, in his life of St. Augustine,
who lay on his death-bed in Hippo while the fierce Vandal host was encamped round the city (c. xxviii.), gives
a detailed account of them belonging to a date some four years earlier, entirely of a piece with Vincentius’ description
in the text. Victor, bishop of Vite, himself a sufferer, has left a still ampler relation, De Persecutione

<head>The Example set us by the Martyrs, whom no force could hinder from defending the Faith of
their Predecessors.</head>
<p><del>12.</del> But it may be, we invent these charges out of hatred to novelty and zeal for antiquity.
Whoever is disposed to listen to such an insinuation, let him at least believe the blessed
Ambrose, who, deploring the acerbity of the time, says, in the second book of his work addressed
to the Emperor Gratian:30 “Enough now, O God Almighty! have we expiated with
our own ruin, with our own blood, the slaughter of Confessors, the banishment of priests,
and the wickedness of such extreme impiety. It is clear, beyond question, that they who have
violated the faith cannot remain in safety.”</p>
<p>And again in the third book of the same work,31 “Let us observe the precepts of our
predecessors, and not transgress with rude rashness the landmarks which we have inherited
from them. That sealed Book of Prophecy no Elders, no Powers, no Angels, no Archangels,
dared to open. To Christ alone was reserved the prerogative of explaining it.32 Who of us
may dare to unseal the Sacerdotal Book sealed by Confessors, and consecrated already by
the martyrdom of numbers, which they who had been compelled by force to unseal afterwards
resealed, condemning the fraud which had been practised upon them; while they who had
not ventured to tamper with it proved themselves Confessors and martyrs? How can we
deny the faith of those whose victory we proclaim?”</p>
<p><del>13.</del> We proclaim it truly, O venerable Ambrose, we proclaim it, and applaud and admire.
For who is there so demented, who, though not able to overtake, does not at least
earnestly desire to follow those whom no force could deter from defending the faith of their
ancestors, no threats, no blandishments, not life, not death, not the palace, not the Imperial
Guards, not the Emperor, not the empire itself, not men, not demons?—whom, I say, as a
recompense for their steadfastness in adhering to religious antiquity, the Lord counted
worthy of so great a reward, that by their instrumentality He restored churches which had
been destroyed, quickened with new life peoples who were spiritually dead, replaced on the

and the adjoining parts, with the understanding that they should embrace Christianity in its Arian form. They
had now turned against him, and Gratian was on the eve of setting out to carry aid to him. St. Ambrose’s book,
De Fide, was written to confirm Gratian in the Catholic faith, in view especially of the Arian influence to which
he might be subjected in his intercourse with Valens. Valens was killed the following year, 378, at the battle of
Adrianople.</note>

I will not say letters, but blotches (non literas, sed lituras) of novel impiety, with a fountain
of believing tears, which God opened in the hearts of the bishops?—lastly, when almost the
whole world was overwhelmed by a ruthless tempest of unlooked for heresy, recalled it from
novel misbelief to the ancient faith, from the madness of novelty to the soundness of antiquity,
from the blindness of novelty to pristine light?</p>
<p><del>14.</del> But in this divine virtue, as we may call it, exhibited by these Confessors, we must
note especially that the defence which they then undertook in appealing to the Ancient
Church, was the defence, not of a part, but of the whole body. For it was not right that men
of such eminence should uphold with so huge an effort the vague and conflicting notions
of one or two men, or should exert themselves in the defence of some ill-advised combination
of some petty province; but adhering to the decrees and definitions of the universal priesthood
of Holy Church, the heirs of Apostolic and Catholic truth, they chose rather to deliver up
themselves than to betray the faith of universality and antiquity. For which cause they were
deemed worthy of so great glory as not only to be accounted Confessors, but rightly, and
deservedly to be accounted foremost among Confessors.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>The example of Pope Stephen in resisting the Iteration of Baptism.</head>
<p><del>15.</del> Great then is the example of these same blessed men, an example plainly divine,
and worthy to be called to mind, and meditated upon continually by every true Catholic,
who, like the seven-branched candlestick, shining with the sevenfold light of the Holy
Spirit, showed to posterity how thenceforward the audaciousness of profane novelty, in all
the several rantings of error, might be crushed by the authority of hallowed antiquity.
Nor is there anything new in this? For it has always been the case in the Church, that
the more a man is under the influence of religion, so much the more prompt is he to oppose
innovations. Examples there are without number: but to be brief, we will take one, and that,
in preference to others, from the Apostolic See,33 so that it may be clearer than day to every
one with how great energy, with how great zeal, with how great earnestness, the blessed
successors of the blessed apostles have constantly defended the integrity of the religion
which they have once received.</p>
<p><del>16.</del> Once on a time then, Agrippinus,34 bishop of Carthage, of venerable memory,
held the doctrine—and he was the first who held it—that Baptism ought to be repeated,
contrary to the divine canon, contrary to the rule of the universal Church, contrary to the
customs and institutions of our ancestors. This innovation drew after it such an amount of
evil, that it not only gave an example of sacrilege to heretics of all sorts, but proved an occasion
of error to certain Catholics even.</p>
<p>When then all men protested against the novelty, and the priesthood everywhere, each
as his zeal prompted him, opposed it, Pope Stephen of blessed memory, Prelate of the
Apostolic See, in conjunction indeed with his colleagues but yet himself the foremost,
withstood it, thinking it right, I doubt not, that as he exceeded all others in the authority of
his place, so he should also in the devotion of his faith. In fine, in an epistle sent at the time
<note type="footnote">33 “The Apostolic see” (Sedes Apostolica) here means Rome of course. But the title was not restricted to
Rome. It was common to all sees which could claim an apostle as their Founder. Thus St. Augustine, suggesting
a rule for determining what books are to be regarded as Canonical, says, “In Canonicis Scripturis Ecclesiarum
Catholicarum quamplurium auctoritatem sequatur, inter quas sane illæ sint quæ Apostolicas Sedes habere et
Epistolas accipere meruerunt.” “Let him follow the authority of those Catholic Churches which have been
counted worthy to have Apostolic Sees; i.e., to have been founded by Apostles, and to have been the recipients
of Apostolic Epistles.”—De Doctr. Christiana, II. § 13. But the title, even in St. Augustine’s time, had even a
wider meaning. “Anciently every bishop’s see was dignified with the title of Sedes Apostolica, which in those
days was no peculiar title of the bishop of Rome, but given to all bishops in general, as deriving their origin and
counting their succession from the apostles.”—Bingham, Antiq. II., c. 2, § 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">34 Agrippinus. See note 4, below.</note>

<pb n="314"/>
to Africa, he laid down this rule: “Let there be no innovation—nothing but what has been
handed down.”35 For that holy and prudent man well knew that true piety admits no other
rule than that whatsoever things have been faithfully received from our fathers the same are
to be faithfully consigned to our children; and that it is our duty, not to lead religion
whither we would, but rather to follow religion whither it leads; and that it is the part of
Christian modesty and gravity not to hand down our own beliefs or observances to those
who come after us, but to preserve and keep what we have received from those who went
before us. What then was the issue of the whole matter? What but the usual and customary
one? Antiquity was retained, novelty was rejected.</p>
<p><del>17.</del> But it may be, the cause of innovation at that time lacked patronage. On the contrary,
it had in its favor such powerful talent, such copious eloquence, such a number of
partisans, so much resemblance to truth, such weighty support in Scripture (only interpreted
in a novel and perverse sense), that it seems to me that that whole conspiracy could not
possibly have been defeated, unless the sole cause of this extraordinary stir, the very novelty
of what was so undertaken, so defended, so belauded, had proved wanting to it. In the end,
what result, under God, had that same African Council or decree?36 None whatever. The
whole affair, as though a dream, a fable, a thing of no possible account, was annulled, cancelled,
and trodden underfoot.</p>
<p><del>18.</del> And O marvellous revolution! The authors of this same doctrine are judged
Catholics, the followers heretics; the teachers are absolved, the disciples condemned; the
writers of the books will be children of the Kingdom, the defenders of them will have their
portion in Hell. For who is so demented as to doubt that that blessed light among all holy
bishops and martyrs, Cyprian, together with the rest of his colleagues, will reign with Christ;
or, who on the other hand so sacrilegious as to deny that the Donatists and those other pests,
who boast the authority of that council for their iteration of baptism, will be consigned to
eternal fire with the devil?37</p>
<note type="footnote">35 Stephen’s letter has not come down to us, happily perhaps for his credit, judging by the terms in which
Cyprian speaks of it in the letter in which he quotes the passage in the text.—Ad Pompeian, Ep. 74.</note>
<note type="footnote">36 The Council held under the presidency of Cyprian in 256. Its acts are contained in Cyprian’s works, Ed.
Fell. pp. 158, etc. An earlier council had been held in the same city in the beginning of the century under Agrippinus.
Both had affirmed the necessity of rebaptizing heretics, or, as they would rather have said, of baptizing
them. The controversy was set at rest by a decision of the council of Arles, in 314, which ordered, in its Eighth
Canon, that if the baptism had been administered in the name of the Trinity, converts should be admitted simply
by the imposition of hands that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</note>

<head>How Heretics, craftily cite obscure passages in ancient writers in support of their own novelties.</head>
<p><del>19.</del> This condemnation, indeed,38 seems to have been providentially promulgated as
though with a special view to the fraud of those who, contriving to dress up a heresy under
a name other than its own, get hold often of the works of some ancient writer, not very
clearly expressed, which, owing to the very obscurity of their own doctrine, have the appearance
of agreeing with it, so that they get the credit of being neither the first nor the only
persons who have held it. This wickedness of theirs, in my judgment, is doubly hateful: first,
because they are not afraid to invite others to drink of the poison of heresy; and secondly,
because with profane breath, as though fanning smouldering embers into flame, they blow
upon the memory of each holy man, and spread an evil report of what ought to be buried
in silence by bringing it again under notice, thus treading in the footsteps of their father
Ham, who not only forebore to cover the nakedness of the venerable Noah, but told it to
the others that they might laugh at it, offending thereby so grievously against the duty of
filial piety, that even his descendants were involved with him in the curse which he drew
down, widely differing from those blessed brothers of his, who would neither pollute their
own eyes by looking upon the nakedness of their revered father, nor would suffer others to
do so, but went backwards, as the Scripture says, and covered him, that is, they neither approved
nor betrayed the fault of the holy man, for which cause they were rewarded with a
benediction on themselves and their posterity.39</p>
<p><del>20.</del> But to return to the matter in hand: It behoves us then to have a great dread of the
crime of perverting the faith and adulterating religion, a crime from which we are deterred
not only by the Church’s discipline, but also by the censure of apostolical authority. For
every one knows how gravely, how severely, how vehemently, the blessed apostle Paul inveighs
against certain, who, with marvellous levity, had “been so soon removed from him
who had called them to the grace of Christ to another Gospel, which was not another;”40
“who had heaped to themselves teachers after their own lusts, turning away their ears from
the truth, and being turned aside unto fables;”41 “having damnation because they had cast
off their first faith;”42 who had been deceived by those of whom the same apostle writes to
the Roman Christians, “Now, I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. For they that

them: “But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as
theirs also was.”51</p>

<p>Exposition of St. Paul’s Words, Gal. i. 8.</p>
<p><del>21.</del> When therefore certain of this sort wandering about provinces and cities, and
carrying with them their venal errors, had found their way to Galatia, and when the Galatians,
on hearing them, nauseating the truth, and vomiting up the manna of Apostolic and Catholic
doctrine, were delighted with the garbage of heretical novelty, the apostle putting in
exercise the authority of his office, delivered his sentence with the utmost severity, “Though
we,” he says, “or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that which
we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.”52</p>
<p><del>22.</del> Why does he say “Though we”? why not rather “though I”? He means, “though
Peter, though Andrew, though John, in a word, though the whole company of apostles,
preach unto you other than we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Tremendous
severity! He spares neither himself nor his fellow apostles, so he may preserve unaltered the
faith which was at first delivered. Nay, this is not all. He goes on “Even though an angel
from heaven preach unto you any other Gospel than that which we have preached unto you,
let him be accursed.” It was not enough for the preservation of the faith once delivered to
have referred to man; he must needs comprehend angels also. “Though we,” he says, “or an
angel from heaven.” Not that the holy angels of heaven are now capable of sinning. But what
he means is: Even if that were to happen which cannot happen,—if any one, be he who he
may, attempt to alter the faith once for all delivered, let him be accursed.</p>
<p><del>23.</del> But it may be, he spoke thus in the first instance inconsiderately, giving vent to
human impetuosity rather than expressing himself under divine guidance. Far from it. He
follows up what he had said, and urges it with intense reiterated earnestness, “As we said
before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other Gospel to you than that ye have received,
let him be accursed.” He does not say, “If any man deliver to you another message
than that you have received, let him be blessed, praised, welcomed,”—no; but “let him be
accursed,” [anathema] i.e., separated, segregated, excluded, lest the dire contagion of a single
sheep contaminate the guiltless flock of Christ by his poisonous intermixture with them.</p>

<head>His warning to the Galatians a warning to all.</head>
<p><del>24.</del> But, possibly, this warning was intended for the Galatians only. Be it so; then those
other exhortations which follow in the same Epistle were intended for the Galatians only,
such as, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit; let us not be desirous of vain
glory, provoking one another, envying one another,” etc.;53 which alternative if it be absurd,
and the injunctions were meant equally for all, then it follows, that as these injunctions
which relate to morals, so those warnings which relate to faith are meant equally for all; and
just as it is unlawful for all to provoke one another, or to envy one another, so, likewise, it
is unlawful for all to receive any other Gospel than that which the Catholic Church preaches
everywhere.</p>
<p><del>25.</del> Or perhaps the anathema pronounced on any one who should preach another
Gospel than that which had been preached was meant for those times, not for the present.
Then, also, the exhortation, “Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh,”54
was meant for those times, not for the present. But if it be both impious and pernicious to
believe this, then it follows necessarily, that as these injunctions are to be observed by all
ages, so those warnings also which forbid alteration of the faith are warnings intended for
all ages. To preach any doctrine therefore to Catholic Christians other than what they have
received never was lawful, never is lawful, never will be lawful: and to anathematize those
who preach anything other than what has once been received, always was a duty, always is
a duty, always will be a duty.</p>
<p><del>26.</del> Which being the case, is there any one either so audacious as to preach any other
doctrine than that which the Church preaches, or so inconstant as to receive any other
doctrine than that which he has received from the Church? That elect vessel, that teacher
of the Gentiles, that trumpet of the apostles, that preacher whose commission was to the
whole earth, that man who was caught up to heaven,55 cries and cries again in his Epistles
to all, always, in all places, “If any man preach any new doctrine, let him be accursed.” On
the other hand, an ephemeral, moribund set of frogs, fleas, and flies, such as the Pelagians,
call out in opposition, and that to Catholics, “Take our word, follow our lead, accept our
exposition, condemn what you used to hold, hold what you used to condemn, cast aside the
ancient faith, the institutes of your fathers, the trusts left for you by your ancestors and receive
instead,—what? I tremble to utter it: for it is so full of arrogance and self-conceit, that it

<head>Why Eminent Men are permitted by God to become Authors of Novelties in the Church.</head>
<p><del>27.</del> But some one will ask, How is it then, that certain excellent persons, and of position
in the Church, are often permitted by God to preach novel doctrines to Catholics? A proper
question, certainly, and one which ought to be very carefully and fully dealt with, but
answered at the same time, not in reliance upon one’s own ability, but by the authority of
the divine Law, and by appeal to the Church’s determination.</p>
<p>Let us listen, then, to Holy Moses, and let him teach us why learned men, and such as
because of their knowledge are even called Prophets by the apostle, are sometimes permitted
to put forth novel doctrines, which the Old Testament is wont, by way of allegory, to call
“strange gods,” forasmuch as heretics pay the same sort of reverence to their notions that
the Gentiles do to their gods.</p>
<p><del>28.</del> Blessed Moses, then, writes thus in Deuteronomy:56 “If there arise among you a
prophet or a dreamer of dreams,” that is, one holding office as a Doctor in the Church, who
is believed by his disciples or auditors to teach by revelation: well,—what follows? “and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he
spake,”—he is pointing to some eminent doctor, whose learning is such that his followers
believe him not only to know things human, but, moreover, to foreknow things superhuman,
such as, their disciples commonly boast, were Valentinus, Donatus, Photinus, Apollinaris,
and the rest of that sort! What next? “And shall say to thee, Let us go after other gods, whom
thou knowest not, and serve them.” What are those other gods but strange errors which
thou knowest not, that is, new and such as were never heard of before? “And let us serve
them;” that is, “Let us believe them, follow them.” What last? “Thou shalt not hearken to
the words of that prophet or dreamer of dreams.” And why, I pray thee, does not God forbid
to be taught what God forbids to be heard? “For the Lord, your God, trieth you, to know
whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul.” The reason is clearer than
day why Divine Providence sometimes permits certain doctors of the Churches to preach
new doctrines—“That the Lord your God may try you;” he says. And assuredly it is a great
trial when one whom thou believest to be a prophet, a disciple of prophets, a doctor and
defender of the truth, whom thou hast folded to thy breast with the utmost veneration and
love, when such a one of a sudden secretly and furtively brings in noxious errors, which
thou canst neither quickly detect, being held by the prestige of former authority, nor lightly
think it right to condemn, being prevented by affection for thine old master.</p>

<head>Examples from Church History, confirming the words of Moses,—Nestorius, Photinus, Apollinaris.</head>
<p><del>29.</del> Here, perhaps, some one will require us to illustrate the words of holy Moses by
examples from Church History. The demand is a fair one, nor shall it wait long for satisfaction.
For to take first a very recent and very plain case: what sort of trial, think we, was that
which the Church had experience of the other day, when that unhappy Nestorius,57 all at
once metamorphosed from a sheep into a wolf, began to make havoc of the flock of Christ,
while as yet a large proportion of those whom he was devouring believed him to be a sheep,
and consequently were the more exposed to his attacks? For who would readily suppose
him to be in error, who was known to have been elected by the high choice of the Emperor,
and to be held in the greatest esteem by the priesthood? who would readily suppose him to
be in error, who, greatly beloved by the holy brethren, and in high favor with the populace,
expounded the Scriptures in public daily, and confuted the pestilent errors both of Jews and
Heathens? Who could choose but believe that his teaching was Orthodox, his preaching
Orthodox, his belief Orthodox, who, that he might open the way to one heresy of his own,
was zealously inveighing against the blasphemies of all heresies? But this was the very thing
which Moses says: “The Lord your God doth try you that He may know whether you love
Him or not.”</p>
<p><del>30.</del> Leaving Nestorius, in whom there was always more that men admired than they
were profited by, more of show than of reality, whom natural ability, rather than divine
grace, magnified, for a time in the opinion of the common people, let us pass on to speak
of those who, being persons of great attainments and of much industry, proved no small
trial to Catholics. Such, for instance, was Photinus, in Pannonia,58 who, in the memory of
our fathers, is said to have been a trial to the Church of Sirmium, where, when he had been
raised to the priesthood with universal approbation, and had discharged the office for some
<note type="footnote">57 Nestorius was a native of Germanicia, a town in the patriarchate of Antioch, of which Church he became
a Presbyter. On the See of Constantinople becoming vacant by the death of Sisinnius, the Emperor Theodosius
sent for him and caused him to be consecrated Archbishop. He was at first extremely popular, and so eloquent
that people said of him (what was much to be said of a successor of Chrysostom), that there had never before
been such a bishop. He was condemned by the Council of Ephesus, in 431. The emperor, after ordering him to
return to the monastery to which he formally belonged, eventually banished him to the great Oasis, whence he
was harried from place to place till death put an end to his sufferings, in 440. Evagrius, I. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">58 Photinus, bishop of Sirmium in Pannonia, was a native of Galatia, and a disciple of Marcellus of Ancyra.

time as a Catholic, all of a sudden, like that evil prophet or dreamer of dreams whom Moses
refers to, he began to persuade the people whom God had intrusted, to his charge, to follow
“strange gods,” that is, strange errors, which before they knew not. But there was nothing
unusual in this: the mischief of the matter was, that for the perpetration of so great
wickedness he availed himself of no ordinary helps. For he was of great natural ability and
of powerful eloquence, and had a wealth of learning, disputing and writing copiously and
forcibly in both languages, as his books which remain, composed partly in Greek, partly in
Latin, testify. But happily the sheep of Christ committed to him, vigilant and wary for the
Catholic faith, quickly turned their eyes to the premonitory words of Moses, and, though
admiring the eloquence of their prophet and pastor, were not blind to the trial. For from
thenceforward they began to flee from him as a wolf, whom formerly they had followed as
the ram of the flock.</p>
<p><del>31.</del> Nor is it only in the instance of Photinus that we learn the danger of this trial to
the Church, and are admonished withal of the need of double diligence in guarding the
faith. Apollinaris59 holds out a like warning. For he gave rise to great burning questions and
sore perplexities among his disciples, the Church’s authority drawing them one way, their
Master’s influence the opposite; so that, wavering and tossed hither and thither between the
two, they were at a loss what course to take.</p>
<p>But perhaps he was a person of no weight of character. On the contrary, he was so eminent
and so highly esteemed that his word would only too readily be taken on whatsoever
subject. For what could exceed his acuteness, his adroitness, his learning? How many heresies
<note type="footnote">left by the ancients. These agree with Vincentius in representing him as a man of extraordinary ability and of
consummate eloquence. His heresy consisted in the denial of our blessed Lord’s divine nature, whom he regarded
as man, and nothing more, ψιλὸς ἄνθρωπος, and as having had no existence before his birth of the Virgin. He
was condemned in several synods, the fifth of which, a Council of the Western bishops, held at Sirmium, in 350,
deposed him. But in spite of the deposition, so great was his popularity, that he could not even yet be removed.
The following year however he was by another council, held at the same place, again condemned, and sent into
banishment. He died in Galatia in 377. See Cave, Hist. Lit., who refers with praise to a learned dissertation on
Photinus by Larroque.</note>
<note type="footnote">59 Apollinaris the younger (a contemporary of Photinus), bishop of Laodicea in Syria, was one of the most
distinguished men of the age in which he lived. Epiphanius (Hær. lxxvii. 2), referring to his fall into heresy, says
that when it first began to be spoken of, people would hardly credit it, so great was the estimation in which he
was held. His heresy, which consisted in the denial of the verity of our Lord’s human nature, the Divine Word
supplying the place of the rational soul, and in the assertion that his flesh was not derived from the Virgin, but
was brought down from heaven, was condemned by the Council of Constantinople, in 381 (Canon I.). It was
in reference to the latter form of it that the clause “of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary” was inserted in the
Nicene Creed.</note>

did he, in many volumes, annihilate! How many errors, hostile to the faith, did he confute!
A proof of which is that most noble and vast work, of not less than thirty books, in which,
with a great mass of arguments, he repelled the insane calumnies of Porphyry.60 It would
take a long time to enumerate all his works, which assuredly would have placed him on a
level with the very chief of the Church’s builders, if that profane lust of heretical curiosity
had not led him to devise I know not what novelty which as though through the contagion
of a sort of leprosy both defiled all his labours, and caused his teachings to be pronounced
the Church’s trial instead of the Church’s edification.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>A fuller account of the Errors of Photinus, Apollinaris and Nestorius.</head>
<p><del>32.</del> Here, possibly, I may be asked for some account of the above mentioned heresies;
those, namely, of Nestorius, Apollinaris, and Photinus. This, indeed, does not belong to the
matter in hand: for our object is not to enlarge upon the errors of individuals, but to produce
instances of a few, in whom the applicability of Moses’ words may be evidently and clearly
seen; that is to say, that if at any time some Master in the Church, himself also a prophet in
interpreting the mysteries of the prophets, should attempt to introduce some novel doctrine
into the Church of God, Divine Providence permits this to happen in order to try us. It will
be useful, therefore, by way of digression, to give a brief account of the opinions of the abovenamed
heretics, Photinus, Apollinaris, Nestorius.</p>
<p><del>33.</del> The heresy of Photinus, then, is as follows: He says that God is singular and sole,
and is to be regarded as the Jews regarded Him. He denies the completeness of the Trinity,
and does not believe that there is any Person of God the Word, or any Person of the Holy
Ghost. Christ he affirms to be a mere man, whose original was from Mary. Hence he insists
with the utmost obstinacy that we are to render worship only to the Person of God the
Father, and that we are to honour Christ as man only. This is the doctrine of Photinus.</p>
<p><del>34.</del> Apollinaris, affecting to agree with the Church as to the unity of the Trinity, though
not this even with entire soundness of belief,61 as to the Incarnation of the Lord, blasphemes
openly. For he says that the flesh of our Saviour was either altogether devoid of a human
soul, or, at all events, was devoid of a rational soul. Moreover, he says that this same flesh
of the Lord was not received from the flesh of the holy Virgin Mary, but came down from
heaven into the Virgin; and, ever wavering and undecided, he preaches one while that it
was co-eternal with God the Word, another that it was made of the divine nature of the
Word. For, denying that there are two substances in Christ, one divine, the other human,
one from the Father, the other from his mother, he holds that the very nature of the Word
was divided, as though one part of it remained in God, the other was converted into flesh:
so that whereas the truth says that of two substances there is one Christ, he affirms, contrary
to the truth, that of the one divinity of Christ there are become two substances. This, then,
is the doctrine of Apollinaris.</p>
<p><del>35.</del> Nestorius, whose disease is of an opposite kind, while pretending that he holds
two distinct substances in Christ, brings in of a sudden two Persons, and with unheard of
wickedness would have two sons of God, two Christs,—one, God, the other, man, one, begotten
of his Father, the other, born of his mother. For which reason he maintains that Saint
<note type="footnote">61 “Et hoc ipsum non plena fidei sanitate.”—The Cambridge Ed., 1687, with Baluzius’s notes appended, reads,
“et hoc ipsum plena fidei sanctitate.”</note>

<pb n="325"/>
Mary ought to be called, not Theotocos (the mother of God), but Christotocos (the mother
of Christ), seeing that she gave birth not to the Christ who is God, but to the Christ who is
man. But if any one supposes that in his writings he speaks of one Christ, and preaches one
Person of Christ, let him not lightly credit it. For either this is a crafty device, that by means
of good he may the more easily persuade evil, according to that of the apostle, “That which
is good was made death to me,”62—either, I say, he craftily affects in some places in his
writings to believe one Christ and one Person of Christ, or else he says that after the Virgin
had brought forth, the two Persons were united into one Christ, though at the time of her
conception or parturition, and for some short time afterwards, there were two Christs; so
that forsooth, though Christ was born at first an ordinary man and nothing more, and not
as yet associated in unity of Person with the Word of God, yet afterwards the Person of the
Word assuming descended upon Him; and though now the Person assumed remains in the
glory of God, yet once there would seem to have been no difference between Him and all
other men.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity and the Incarnation explained.</head>
<p><del>36.</del> In these ways then do these rabid dogs, Nestorius, Apollinaris, and Photinus, bark
against the Catholic faith: Photinus, by denying the Trinity; Apollinaris, by teaching that
the nature of the Word is mutable, and refusing to acknowledge that there are two substances
in Christ, denying moreover either that Christ had a soul at all, or, at all events, that he had
a rational soul, and asserting that the Word of God supplied the place of the rational soul;
Nestorius, by affirming that there were always or at any rate that once there were two Christs.
But the Catholic Church, holding the right faith both concerning God and concerning our
Saviour, is guilty of blasphemy neither in the mystery of the Trinity, nor in that of the Incarnation
of Christ. For she worships both one Godhead in the plenitude of the Trinity, and
the equality of the Trinity in one and the same majesty, and she confesses one Christ Jesus,
not two; the same both God and man, the one as truly as the other.63 One Person indeed
she believes in Him, but two substances; two substances but one Person: Two substances,
because the Word of God is not mutable, so as to be convertible into flesh; one Person, lest
by acknowledging two sons she should seem to worship not a Trinity, but a Quaternity.</p>
<p><del>37.</del> But it will be well to unfold this same doctrine more distinctly and explicitly again
and again.</p>
<p>In God there is one substance, but three Persons; in Christ two substances, but one
Person. In the Trinity, another and another Person, not another and another substance
(distinct Persons, not distinct substances);64 in the Saviour another and another substance,
not another and another Person, (distinct substances, not distinct Persons). How in the
Trinity another and another Person (distinct Persons) not another and another substance
(distinct substances)?65 Because there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, another
of the Holy Ghost;66 but yet there is not another and another nature (distinct natures)
but one and the same nature. How in the Saviour another and another substance, not another
<note type="footnote">63 Unum Christum Jesum non duos, eundemque Deum pariter atque Hominem confitetur. Compare the
Athanasian Creed, “Est ergo fides recta et credamus et confiteamur, quia Dominus Noster Jesus Christus. Dei
Filius, Deus pariter et Homo est.”</note>

<note type="footnote">65 Aliud atque aliud, non alius atque alius.</note>
<note type="footnote">66 Quia scilicet alia est Persona Patris, alia Filii, alia Spiritus Sancti sed tamen Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
non alia et alia sed una cadunque natura. So the Athanasian Creed, “Alia est enim Persona Patris, alia Filii, alia
Spiritus Sancti, sed Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti una est Divinitas, etc.” The coincidence between the whole
of this context and the Athanasian Creed is very observable, though the agreement is not always exact to the
very letter.</note>

<pb n="327"/>
and another Person (two distinct substances, not two distinct Persons)? Because there is
one substance of the Godhead, another of the manhood. But yet the Godhead and the
manhood are not another and another Person (two distinct Persons), but one and the same
Christ, one and the same Son of God, and one and the same Person of one and the same
Christ and Son of God, in like manner as in man the flesh is one thing and the soul another,
but one and the same man, both soul and flesh. In Peter and Paul the soul is one thing, the
flesh another; yet there are not two Peters,—one soul, the other flesh, or two Pauls, one soul,
the other flesh,—but one and the same Peter, and one and the same Paul, consisting each
of two diverse natures, soul and body. Thus, then, in one and the same Christ there are two
substances, one divine, the other human; one of (ex) God the Father, the other of (ex) the
Virgin Mother; one co-eternal with and co-equal with the Father, the other temporal and
inferior to the Father; one consubstantial with his Father, the other, consubstantial with his
Mother, but one and the same Christ in both substances. There is not, therefore, one Christ
God, the other man, not one uncreated, the other created; not one impassible, the other
passible; not one equal to the Father, the other inferior to the Father; not one of his Father
(ex), the other of his Mother (ex), but one and the same Christ, God and man, the same
uncreated and created, the same unchangeable and incapable of suffering, the same acquainted
by experience with both change and suffering, the same equal to the Father and inferior
to the Father, the same begotten of the Father before time, (“before the world”), the same
born of his mother in time (“in the world”),67 perfect God, perfect Man. In God supreme
divinity, in man perfect humanity. Perfect humanity, I say, forasmuch as it hath both soul
and flesh; the flesh, very flesh; our flesh, his mother’s flesh; the soul, intellectual, endowed
with mind and reason. There is then in Christ the Word, the soul, the flesh; but the whole
is one Christ, one Son of God, and one our Saviour and Redeemer: One, not by I know not
what corruptible confusion of Godhead and manhood, but by a certain entire and singular
unity of Person. For the conjunction hath not converted and changed the one nature into
the other, (which is the characteristic error of the Arians), but rather hath in such wise
compacted both into one, that while there always remains in Christ the singularity of one
and the self-same Person, there abides eternally withal the characteristic property of each
nature; whence it follows, that neither doth God (i.e., the divine nature) ever begin to be
body, nor doth the body ever cease to be body. The which may be illustrated in human
nature: for not only in the present life, but in the future also, each individual man will consist
of soul and body; nor will his body ever be converted into soul, or his soul into body; but
while each individual man will live for ever, the distinction between the two substances will

retain its own characteristic property, yet without prejudice to the unity of Person.</p>

<head>Jesus Christ Man in Truth, not in Semblance.</head>
<p><del>38.</del> But when we use the word “Person,” and say that God became man by means of
a Person, there is reason to fear that our meaning may be taken to be, that God the Word
assumed our nature merely in imitation, and performed the actions of man, being man not
in reality, but only in semblance, just as in a theatre, one man within a brief space represents
several persons, not one of whom himself is. For when one undertakes to sustain the part
of another, he performs the offices, or does the acts, of the person whose part he sustains,
but he is not himself that person. So, to take an illustration from secular life and one in high
favour with the Manichees, when a tragedian represents a priest or a king, he is not really
a priest or a king. For, as soon as the play is over, the person or character whom he represented
ceases to be. God forbid that we should have anything to do with such nefarious and
wicked mockery. Be it the infatuation of the Manichees, those preachers of hallucination,
who say that the Son of God, God, was not a human person really and truly, but that He
counterfeited the person of a man in feigned conversation and manner of life.</p>
<p><del>39.</del> But the Catholic Faith teaches that the Word of God became man in such wise,
that He took upon Him our nature, not feignedly and in semblance, but in reality and truth,
and performed human actions, not as though He were imitating the actions of another, but
as performing His own, and as being in reality the person whose part He sustained. Just as
we ourselves also, when we speak, reason, live, subsist, do not imitate men, but are men.
Peter and John, for instance, were men, not by imitation, but by being men in reality. Paul
did not counterfeit an apostle, or feign himself to be Paul, but was an apostle, was Paul. So,
also, that which God the Word did, in His condescension, in assuming and having flesh, in
speaking, acting, and suffering, through the instrumentality of flesh, yet without any marring
of His own divine nature, came in one word to this:—He did not imitate or feign Himself
to be perfect man, but He shewed Himself to be very man in reality and truth. Therefore,
as the soul united to the flesh, but yet not changed into flesh, does not imitate man, but is
man, and man not feignedly but substantially, so also God the Word, without any conversion
of Himself, in uniting Himself to man, became man, not by confusion, not by imitation,
but by actually being and subsisting. Away then, once and for all, with the notion of His
Person as of an assumed fictitious character, where always what is is one thing, what is
counterfeited another, where the man who acts never is the man whose part he acts. God
forbid that we should believe God the Word to have taken upon Himself the person of a
man in this illusory way. Rather let us acknowledge that while His own unchangeable substance
remained, and while He took upon Himself the nature of perfect man, Himself actually
was flesh, Himself actually was man, Himself actually was personally man; not feignedly,

<pb n="330"/>
but in truth, not in imitation, but in substance; not, finally, so as to cease to be when the
performance was over, but so as to be, and continue to be substantially and permanently.68</p>
<note type="footnote">68 The word “Person” is used in this and the preceding section in a way which might seem at variance with
Catholic truth. Christ did not assume the Person of a man; but, being God, He united in his one divine Person,
the Godhead and the Manhood. This Vincentius himself teaches most explicitly. But his object here is to show
that our blessed Lord, while conversant among us as man, and being to all appearance man, did not personate
man, but was man in deed and in truth. The misconception against which Vincentius seeks to guard arises from
the ambiguity of the Latin Persona, an ambiguity which is not continued in our derived word Person. Persona
signifies not only Person, in our sense of the word, but also an assumed character. Though however we have not
this sense in Person, we have it in Personate.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>The Union of the Divine with the Human Nature took place in the very Conception of the
Virgin. The appellation “The Mother of God.”</head>
<p><del>40.</del> This unity of Person, then, in Christ was not effected after His birth of the Virgin,
but was compacted and perfected in her very womb. For we must take most especial heed
that we confess Christ not only one, but always one. For it were intolerable blasphemy, if
while thou dost confess Him one now, thou shouldst maintain that once He was not one,
but two; one forsooth since His baptism, but two at His birth. Which monstrous sacrilege
we shall assuredly in no wise avoid unless we acknowledge the manhood united to the
Godhead (but by unity of Person), not from the ascension, or the resurrection, or the baptism,
but even in His mother, even in the womb, even in the Virgin’s very conception.69 In consequence
of which unity of Person, both those attributes which are proper to God are ascribed
to man, and those which are proper to the flesh to God, indifferently and promiscuously.70
For hence it is written by divine guidance, on the one hand, that the Son of man came down
from heaven;71 and on the other, that the Lord of glory was crucified on earth.72 Hence it
is also that since the Lord’s flesh was made, since the Lord’s flesh was created, the very Word
of God is said to have been made, the very omniscient Wisdom of God to have been created,
<note type="footnote">69 If the Son of God had taken to Himself a man now made and already perfected, it would of necessity follow
that there are in Christ two persons, the one assuming and the other assumed; whereas, the Son of God did not
assume a man’s person unto His own, but a man’s nature to His own person, and therefore took semen, the seed
of Abraham, the very first original element of our nature, before it was come to have any personal human subsistence.
The flesh, and the conjunction of the flesh with God, began both in one instant. His making and taking
to Himself our flesh was but one act, so that in Christ there is no personal subsistence but one, and that from
everlasting. By taking only the nature of man He still continueth one person, and changeth but the manner of
His subsisting, which was before in the mere glory of the Son of God and is now in the habit of our
flesh.—Hooker, Eccl. Pol. v. 52, § 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">70 “A kind of mutual commutation there is, whereby those concrete names, God and man, when we speak
of Christ, do take interchangeably one another’s room, so that for truth of speech, it skilleth not, whether we
say that the Son of God hath created the world, and the Son of man by His death hath saved it, or else, that the
Son of man did create, and the Son of God die to save the world. Howbeit, as oft as we attribute to God what
the manhood of Christ claimeth, or to man what His Deity hath right unto, we understand by the name of God
and the name of man neither the one nor the other nature, but the whole person of Christ, in whom both natures
are.”—Hooker, Eccl. Polity, v. 53, § 4. This is technically called “The Communication of Properties,” Communicatio
idiomatum.</note>
<note type="footnote">71 St. John iii. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">72 1 Cor. ii. 8.</note>

<pb n="332"/>
just as prophetically His hands and His feet are described as having been pierced.73 From
this unity of Person it follows, by reason of a like mystery, that, since the flesh of the Word
was born of an undefiled mother, God the Word Himself is most Catholicly believed, most
impiously denied, to have been born of the Virgin; which being the case, God forbid that
any one should seek to defraud Holy Mary of her prerogative of divine grace and her special
glory. For by the singular gift of Him who is our Lord and God, and withal, her own son,
she is to be confessed most truly and most blessedly—The mother of God “Theotocos,” but
not in the sense in which it is imagined by a certain impious heresy which maintains, that
she is to be called the Mother of God for no other reason than because she gave birth to that
man who afterwards became God, just as we speak of a woman as the mother of a priest, or
the mother of a bishop, meaning that she was such, not by giving birth to one already a
priest or a bishop, but by giving birth to one who afterwards became a priest or a bishop.
Not thus, I say, was the holy Mary “Theotocos,” the mother of God, but rather, as was said
before, because in her sacred womb was wrought that most sacred mystery whereby, on
account of the singular and unique unity of Person, as the Word in flesh is flesh, so Man in
God is God.74</p>

<head>Recapitulation of what was said of the Catholic Faith and of divers Heresies, Chapters xi–xv.</head>
<p><del>41.</del> But now that we may refresh our remembrance of what has been briefly said concerning
either the afore-mentioned heresies or the Catholic Faith, let us go over it again
more briefly and concisely, that being repeated it may be more thoroughly understood, and
being pressed home more firmly held.</p>
<p>Accursed then be Photinus, who does not receive the Trinity complete, but asserts that
Christ is mere man.</p>
<p>Accursed be Apollinaris, who affirms that the Godhead of Christ is marred by conversion,
and defrauds Him of the property of perfect humanity.</p>
<p>Accursed be Nestorius, who denies that God was born of the Virgin, affirms two Christs,
and rejecting the belief of the Trinity, brings in a Quaternity.</p>
<p>But blessed be the Catholic Church, which worships one God in the completeness of
the Trinity, and at the same time adores the equality of the Trinity in the unity of the Godhead,
so that neither the singularity of substance confounds the propriety of the Persons,
not the distinction of the Persons in the Trinity separates the unity of the Godhead.</p>
<p>Blessed, I say, be the Church, which believes that in Christ there are two true and perfect
substances but one Person, so that neither doth the distinction of natures divide the unity
of Person, nor the unity of Person confound the distinction of substances.
Blessed, I say, be the Church, which understands God to have become Man, not by
conversion of nature, but by reason of a Person, but of a Person not feigned and transient,
but substantial and permanent.</p>
<p>Blessed, I say, be the Church, which declares this unity of Person to be so real and effectual,
that because of it, in a marvellous and ineffable mystery, she ascribes divine attributes
to man, and human to God; because of it, on the one hand, she does not deny that Man, as
God, came down from heaven, on the other, she believes that God, as Man, was created,
suffered, and was crucified on earth; because of it, finally, she confesses Man the Son of God,
and God the Son of the Virgin.</p>
<p>Blessed, then, and venerable, blessed and most sacred, and altogether worthy to be
compared with those celestial praises of the Angelic Host, be the confession which ascribes
glory to the one Lord God with a threefold ascription of holiness. For this reason moreover
she insists emphatically upon the oneness of the Person of Christ, that she may not go beyond
the mystery of the Trinity (that is by making in effect a Quaternity.)</p>
<p>Thus much by way of digression. On another occasion, please God, we will deal with
the subject and unfold it more fully.75 Now let us return to the matter in hand.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>The Error of Origen a great Trial to the Church.</head>
<p><del>42.</del> We said above that in the Church of God the teacher’s error is the people’s trial,
a trial by so much the greater in proportion to the greater learning of the erring teacher.
This we showed first by the authority of Scripture, and then by instances from Church
History, of persons who having at one time had the reputation of being sound in the faith,
eventually either fell away to some sect already in existence, or else founded a heresy of their
own. An important fact truly, useful to be learnt, and necessary to be remembered, and to
be illustrated and enforced again and again, by example upon example, in order that all true
Catholics may understand that it behoves them with the Church to receive Teachers, not
with Teachers to desert the faith of the Church.</p>
<p><del>43.</del> My belief is, that among many instances of this sort of trial which might be pro-
duced, there is not one to be compared with that of Origen,76 in whom there were many
things so excellent, so unique, so admirable, that antecedently any one would readily deem
that implicit faith was to be placed all his assertions. For if the conversation and manner of
life carry authority, great was his industry, great his modesty, his patience, his endurance;
if his descent or his erudition, what more noble than his birth of a house rendered illustrious
by martyrdom? Afterwards, when in the cause of Christ he had been deprived not only of
his father, but also of all his property, he attained so high a standard in the midst of the
straits of holy poverty, that he suffered several times, it is said, as a Confessor. Nor were
these the only circumstances connected with him, all of which afterwards proved an occasion
of trial. He had a genius so powerful, so profound, so acute, so elegant, that there was hardly
<note type="footnote">76 Origen was born of Christian parents, at Alexandria, about the year 186. His father, Leonidas, suffered
martyrdom in the persecution under Severus, in 202; and the family estate having been confiscated, his mother,
with six younger children, became dependent upon him for her support. At the age of eighteen he was appointed
by the bishop Demetrius over the Catechetical School of Alexandria, the duties of which place he discharged
with eminent ability and success. He remained a layman till the age of forty-three, when he was admitted to
priest’s orders at Cæsarea, greatly to the displeasure of Demetrius, by whose hand, according to the Church’s
rule, the office ought to have been conferred, and he was in consequence banished from Alexandria. Returning
to Cæsarea, he taught there with great reputation, and had many eminent persons among his disciples. He
suffered much in the Decian persecution in 250, when he was thrown into prison and subjected to severe tortures.
His works, as Vincentius says, were very numerous, including among them the Hexapla, a revised edition of
the Hebrew Scriptures and of the Septuagint version, together with three other versions, the Hebrew being set
forth in both Hebrew and Greek characters. His writings were corrupted in many instances, so that, as Vincentius
says, opinions were often imputed to him which he would not have acknowledged. He died in his sixtyninth
year at Tyre, and was buried there.</note>

<pb n="335"/>
any one whom he did not very far surpass. The splendour of his learning, and of his erudition
generally, was such that there were few points of divine philosophy, hardly any of human
which he did not thoroughly master. When Greek had yielded to his industry, he made
himself a proficient in Hebrew. What shall I say of his eloquence, the style of which was so
charming, so soft, so sweet, that honey rather than words seemed to flow from his mouth!
What subjects were there, however difficult, which he did not render clear and perspicuous
by the force of his reasoning? What undertakings, however hard to accomplish, which he
did not make to appear most easy? But perhaps his assertions rested simply on ingeniously
woven argumentation? On the contrary, no teacher ever used more proofs drawn from
Scripture. Then I suppose he wrote little? No man more, so that, if I mistake not, his writings
not only cannot all be read through, they cannot all be found;77 for that nothing might be
wanting to his opportunities of obtaining knowledge, he had the additional advantage of a
life greatly prolonged.78 But perhaps he was not particularly happy in his disciples? Who
ever more so? From his school came forth doctors, priests, confessors, martyrs, without
number.79 Then who can express how much he was admired by all, how great his renown,
how wide his influence? Who was there whose religion was at all above the common
standard that did not hasten to him from the ends of the earth? What Christian did not
reverence him almost as a prophet; what philosopher as a master? How great was the veneration
with which he was regarded, not only by private persons, but also by the Court, is declared
by the histories which relate how he was sent for by the mother of the Emperor Alexander,
80 moved by the heavenly wisdom with the love of which she, as he, was inflamed.
To this also his letters bear witness, which, with the authority which he assumed as a
Christian Teacher, he wrote to the Emperor Philip,81 the first Roman prince that was a
Christian. As to his incredible learning, if any one is unwilling to receive the testimony of
Christians at our hands, let him at least accept that of heathens at the hands of philosophers.
For that impious Porphyry says that when he was little more than a boy, incited by his fame,
he went to Alexandria, and there saw him, then an old man, but a man evidently of so great
attainments, that he had reached the summit of universal knowledge.</p>

<p><del>44.</del> Time would fail me to recount, even in a very small measure, the excellencies of
this man, all of which, nevertheless, not only contributed to the glory of religion, but also
increased the magnitude of the trial. For who in the world would lightly desert a man of so
great genius, so great learning, so great influence, and would not rather adopt that saying,
That he would rather be wrong with Origen, than be right with others.82</p>
<p>What shall I say more? The result was that very many were led astray from the integrity
of the faith, not by any human excellencies of this so great man, this so great doctor, this so
great prophet, but, as the event showed, by the too perilous trial which he proved to be.
Hence it came to pass, that this Origen, such and so great as he was, wantonly abusing the
grace of God, rashly following the bent of his own genius, and placing overmuch confidence
in himself, making light account of the ancient simplicity of the Christian religion, presuming
that he knew more than all the world besides, despising the traditions of the Church and
the determinations of the ancients, and interpreting certain passages of Scripture in a novel
way, deserved for himself the warning given to the Church of God, as applicable in his case
as in that of others, “If there arise a prophet in the midst of thee,”… “thou shalt not hearken
to the words of that prophet,”…“because the Lord your God doth make trial of you,
whether you love Him or not.”83 Truly, thus of a sudden to seduce the Church which was
devoted to him, and hung upon him through admiration of his genius, his learning, his
eloquence, his manner of life and influence, while she had no fear, no suspicion for herself,—
thus, I say, to seduce the Church, slowly and little by little, from the old religion to a
new profaneness, was not only a trial, but a great trial.84</p>
<p><del>45.</del> But some one will say, Origen’s books have been corrupted. I do not deny it; nay,
I grant it readily. For that such is the case has been handed down both orally and in writing,
not only by Catholics, but by heretics as well. But the point is, that though himself be not,
yet books published under his name are, a great trial, which, abounding in many hurtful
blasphemies, are both read and delighted in, not as being some one else’s, but as being believed
to be his, so that, although there was no error in Origen’s original meaning, yet Origen’s
authority appears to be an effectual cause in leading people to embrace error.</p>

<head>Tertullian a great Trial to the Church.</head>
<p><del>46.</del> The case is the same with Tertullian.85 For as Origen holds by far the first place
among the Greeks, so does Tertullian among the Latins. For who more learned than he,
who more versed in knowledge whether divine or human? With marvellous capacity of
mind he comprehended all philosophy, and had a knowledge of all schools of philosophers,
and of the founders and upholders of schools, and was acquainted with all their rules and
observances, and with their various histories and studies. Was not his genius of such unrivalled
strength and vehemence that there was scarcely any obstacle which he proposed to
himself to overcome, that he did not penetrate by acuteness, or crush by weight? As to his
style, who can sufficiently set forth its praise? It was knit together with so much cogency of
argument that it compelled assent, even where it failed to persuade. Every word almost was
a sentence; every sentence a victory. This know the Marcions, the Apelleses, the Praxeases,
the Hermogeneses, the Jews, the Heathens, the Gnostics, and the rest, whose blasphemies
he overthrew by the force of his many and ponderous volumes, as with so many thunderbolts.
Yet this man also, notwithstanding all that I have mentioned, this Tertullian, I say, too little
tenacious of Catholic doctrine, that is, of the universal and ancient faith, more eloquent by
far than faithful,86 changed his belief, and justified what the blessed Confessor, Hilary, writes
of him, namely, that “by his subsequent error he detracted from the authority of his approved
writings.”87 He also was a great trial in the Church. But of Tertullian I am unwilling to say
more. This only I will add, that, contrary to the injunction of Moses, by asserting the novel
<note type="footnote">85 Hardly anything is known of Tertullian, besides what may be gathered from his works, in addition to the
following account given by St. Jerome (De Viris Illustribus), which I quote from Bishop Kaye’s work on Tertullian
and his writings: “Tertullian, a presbyter, the first Latin writer after Victor and Apollonius, was a native of the
province of Africa and city of Carthage, the son of a proconsular centurion. He was a man of a sharp and vehement
temper, flourished under Severus and Caracalla, and wrote numerous works which, as they are generally known,
I think it unnecessary to particularize. I saw at Concordia, in Italy, an old man named Paulus who said that,
when young, he had met at Rome with an aged amanuensis of the blessed Cyprian, who told him that Cyprian
never passed a day without reading some portion of Tertullian’s works, and used frequently to say, ‘Give me
my master,’ meaning Tertullian. After remaining a presbyter of the Church till he had attained the middle of
life, Tertullian was by the cruel and contumelious treatment of the Roman clergy driven to embrace the opinions
of Montanus, which he has mentioned in several of his works, under the title of ‘The New Prophecy.’ He is reported
to have lived to a very advanced age.” He was born about the middle of the second century, and flourished,
according to the dates indicated above, between the years 190 and 216.</note>

furies of Montanus88 which arose in the Church, and those mad dreams of new doctrine
dreamed by mad women, to be true prophecies, he deservedly made both himself and his
writings obnoxious to the words, “If there arise a prophet in the midst of thee,”…“thou shalt
not hearken to the words of that prophet. “For why? “Because the Lord your God doth make
trial of you, whether you love Him or not.”</p>
<note type="footnote">88 Montanus, with his two prophetesses, professed that he was intrusted with a new dispensation,—a dispensation
in advance of the Gospel, as the Gospel was in advance of the Law. His system was a protest against the
laxity which had grown up in the Church, as has repeatedly been the case after revivals of religious fervor, verifying
Tertullian’s apophthegm, “Christiani fiunt, non nascuntur” (men become Christians, they are not born
such). Its characteristics were extreme ascetism, rigorous fasting, the exaltation of celibacy, the absolute prohibition
of second marriage, the expectation of our Lord’s second advent as near at hand, the disparagement of the
clergy in comparison with its own Paraclete-inspired teachers. It had its rise in Phrygia, and from thence spread
throughout Asia Minor, thence it found its way to Southern Gaul, to Rome, to North Western Africa, in which
last for a time it had many followers.</note>

<head>The Notes of a true Catholic.</head>
<p><del>48.</del> This being the case, he is the true and genuine Catholic who loves the truth of God,
who loves the Church, who loves the Body of Christ, who esteems divine religion and the
Catholic Faith above every thing, above the authority, above the regard, above the genius,
above the eloquence, above the philosophy, of every man whatsoever; who sets light by all
of these, and continuing steadfast and established in the faith, resolves that he will believe
that, and that only, which he is sure the Catholic Church has held universally and from ancient
time; but that whatsoever new and unheard-of doctrine he shall find to have been
furtively introduced by some one or another, besides that of all, or contrary to that of all
the saints, this, he will understand, does not pertain to religion, but is permitted as a trial,
being instructed especially by the words of the blessed Apostle Paul, who writes thus in his
first Epistle to the Corinthians, “There must needs be heresies, that they who are approved
may be made manifest among you:”89 as though he should say, This is the reason why the
authors of Heresies are not forthwith rooted up by God, namely, that they who are approved
may be made manifest; that is, that it may be apparent of each individual, how tenacious
and faithful and steadfast he is in his love of the Catholic faith.</p>
<p><del>49.</del> And in truth, as each novelty springs up incontinently is discerned the difference
between the weight of the wheat and the lightness of the chaff. Then that which had no
weight to keep it on the floor is without difficulty blown away. For some at once fly off entirely;
others having been only shaken out, afraid of perishing, wounded, half alive, half
dead, are ashamed to return. They have, in fact swallowed a quantity of poison—not enough
to kill, yet more than can be got rid of; it neither causes death, nor suffers to live. O wretched
condition! With what surging tempestuous cares are they tossed about! One while, the error
being set in motion, they are hurried whithersoever the wind drives them; another, returning
upon themselves like refluent waves, they are dashed back: one while, with rash presumption,
they give their approval to what seems uncertain; another, with irrational fear, they are
frightened out of their wits at what is certain, in doubt whither to go, whither to return,
what to seek, what to shun, what to keep, what to throw away.</p>
<p><del>50.</del> This affliction, indeed, of a hesitating and miserably vacillating mind is, if they are
wise, a medicine intended for them by God’s compassion. For therefore it is that outside
the most secure harbour of the Catholic Faith, they are tossed about, beaten, and almost
killed, by divers tempestuous cogitations, in order that they may take in the sails of selfconceit,
which, they had with ill advice unfurled to the blasts of novelty, and may betake
themselves again to, and remain stationary within, the most secure harbour of their placid

and good mother, and may begin by vomiting up those bitter and turbid floods of error
which they had swallowed, that thenceforward they may be able to drink the streams of
fresh and living water. Let them unlearn well what they had learnt not well, and let them
receive so much of the entire doctrine of the Church as they can understand: what they
cannot understand let them believe.</p>

<head>Exposition of St. Paul’s Words.—1 Tim. vi. 20.</head>
<p><del>51.</del> Such being the case, when I think over these things, and revolve them in my mind
again and again, I cannot sufficiently wonder at the madness of certain men, at the impiety
of their blinded understanding, at their lust of error, such that, not content with the rule of
faith delivered once for all, and received from the times of old, they are every day seeking
one novelty after another, and are constantly longing to add, change, take away, in religion,
as though the doctrine, “Let what has once for all been revealed suffice,” were not a heavenly
but an earthly rule,—a rule which could not be complied with except by continual emendation,
nay, rather by continual fault-finding; whereas the divine Oracles cry aloud, “Remove
not the landmarks, which thy fathers have set,”90 and “Go not to law with a Judge,”91 and
“Whoso breaketh through a fence a serpent shall bite him,”92 and that saying of the Apostle
wherewith, as with a spiritual sword, all the wicked novelties of all heresies often have been,
and will always have to be, decapitated, “O Timothy, keep the deposit, shunning profane
novelties of words and oppositions of the knowledge falsely so called, which some professing
have erred concerning the faith.”93</p>
<p><del>52.</del> After words such as these, is there any one of so hardened a front, such anvil-like
impudence, such adamantine pertinacity, as not to succumb to so huge a mass, not to be
crushed by so ponderous a weight, not to be shaken in pieces by such heavy blows, not to
be annihilated by such dreadful thunderbolts of divine eloquence? “Shun profane novelties,”
he says. He does not say shun “antiquity.” But he plainly points to what ought to follow by
the rule of contrary. For if novelty is to be shunned, antiquity is to be held fast; if novelty is
profane, antiquity is sacred. He adds, “And oppositions of science falsely so called.” “Falsely
called” indeed, as applied to the doctrines of heretics, where ignorance is disguised under
the name of knowledge, fog of sunshine, darkness of light. “Which some professing have
erred concerning the faith.” Professing what? What but some (I know not what) new and
unheard-of doctrine. For thou mayest hear some of these same doctors say, “Come, O silly
wretches, who go by the name of Catholics, come and learn the true faith, which no one but
ourselves is acquainted with, which same has lain hid these many ages, but has recently been
revealed and made manifest. But learn it by stealth and in secret, for you will be delighted
with it. Moreover, when you have learnt it, teach it furtively, that the world may not hear,
that the Church may not know. For there are but few to whom it is granted to receive the

secret of so great a mystery.” Are not these the words of that harlot who, in the proverbs of
Solomon, calls to the passengers who go right on their ways, “Whoso is simple let him turn
in hither.” And as for them that are void of understanding, she exhorts them saying: “Drink
stolen waters, for they are sweet, and eat bread in secret for it is pleasant.” What next? “But
he knoweth not that the sons of earth perish in her house.”94 Who are those “sons of earth”?

<head>A more particular Exposition of 1 Tim. vi. 20.</head>
<p><del>53.</del> But it is worth while to expound the whole of that passage of the apostle more
fully, “O Timothy, keep the deposit, avoiding profane novelties of words.”
“O!” The exclamation implies fore-knowledge as well as charity. For he mourned in
anticipation over the errors which he foresaw. Who is the Timothy of to-day, but either
generally the Universal Church, or in particular, the whole body of The Prelacy, whom it
behoves either themselves to possess or to communicate to others a complete knowledge
of religion? What is “Keep the deposit”? “Keep it,” because of thieves, because of adversaries,
lest, while men sleep, they sow tares over that good wheat which the Son of Man had sown
in his field. “Keep the deposit.” What is “The deposit”? That which has been intrusted to
thee, not that which thou hast thyself devised: a matter not of wit, but of learning; not of
private adoption, but of public tradition; a matter brought to thee, not put forth by thee,
wherein thou art bound to be not an author but a keeper, not a teacher but a disciple, not
a leader but a follower. “Keep the deposit.” Preserve the talent of Catholic Faith inviolate,
unadulterate. That which has been intrusted to thee, let it continue in thy possession, let it
be handed on by thee. Thou hast received gold; give gold in turn. Do not substitute one
thing for another. Do not for gold impudently substitute lead or brass. Give real gold, not
counterfeit.</p>
<p>O Timothy! O Priest! O Expositor! O Doctor! if the divine gift hath qualified thee by
wit, by skill, by learning, be thou a Bazaleel of the spiritual tabernacle,95 engrave the precious
gems of divine doctrine, fit them in accurately, adorn them skilfully, add splendor, grace,
beauty. Let that which formerly was believed, though imperfectly apprehended, as expounded
by thee be clearly understood. Let posterity welcome, understood through thy exposition,
what antiquity venerated without understanding. Yet teach still the same truths which thou
hast learnt, so that though thou speakest after a new fashion, what thou speakest may not
be new.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>On Development in Religious Knowledge.</head>
<p><del>54.</del> But some one will say, perhaps, Shall there, then, be no progress in Christ’s Church?
Certainly; all possible progress. For what being is there, so envious of men, so full of hatred
to God, who would seek to forbid it? Yet on condition that it be real progress, not alteration
of the faith. For progress requires that the subject be enlarged in itself, alteration, that it be
transformed into something else. The intelligence, then, the knowledge, the wisdom, as well
of individuals as of all, as well of one man as of the whole Church, ought, in the course of
ages and centuries, to increase and make much and vigorous progress; but yet only in its
own kind; that is to say, in the same doctrine, in the same sense, and in the same meaning.</p>
<p><del>55.</del> The growth of religion in the soul must be analogous to the growth of the body,
which, though in process of years it is developed and attains its full size, yet remains still
the same. There is a wide difference between the flower of youth and the maturity of age;
yet they who were once young are still the same now that they have become old, insomuch
that though the stature and outward form of the individual are changed, yet his nature is
one and the same, his person is one and the same. An infant’s limbs are small, a young man’s
large, yet the infant and the young man are the same. Men when full grown have the same
number of joints that they had when children; and if there be any to which maturer age has
given birth these were already present in embryo, so that nothing new is produced in them
when old which was not already latent in them when children. This, then, is undoubtedly
the true and legitimate rule of progress, this the established and most beautiful order of
growth, that mature age ever develops in the man those parts and forms which the wisdom
of the Creator had already framed beforehand in the infant. Whereas, if the human form
were changed into some shape belonging to another kind, or at any rate, if the number of
its limbs were increased or diminished, the result would be that the whole body would become
either a wreck or a monster, or, at the least, would be impaired and enfeebled.</p>
<p><del>56.</del> In like manner, it behoves Christian doctrine to follow the same laws of progress,
so as to be consolidated by years, enlarged by time, refined by age, and yet, withal, to continue
uncorrupt and unadulterate, complete and perfect in all the measurement of its parts,
and, so to speak, in all its proper members and senses, admitting no change, no waste of its
distinctive property, no variation in its limits.</p>
<p><del>57.</del> For example: Our forefathers in the old time sowed wheat in the Church’s field.
It would be most unmeet and iniquitous if we, their descendants, instead of the genuine
truth of corn, should reap the counterfeit error of tares. This rather should be the result,—
there should be no discrepancy between the first and the last. From doctrine which
was sown as wheat, we should reap, in the increase, doctrine of the same kind—wheat also;
so that when in process of time any of the original seed is developed, and now flourishes

<pb n="346"/>
under cultivation, no change may ensue in the character of the plant. There may supervene
shape, form, variation in outward appearance, but the nature of each kind must remain the
same. God forbid that those rose-beds of Catholic interpretation should be converted into
thorns and thistles. God forbid that in that spiritual paradise from plants of cinnamon and
balsam, darnel and wolfsbane should of a sudden shoot forth.</p>
<p>Therefore, whatever has been sown by the fidelity of the Fathers in this husbandry of
God’s Church, the same ought to be cultivated and taken care of by the industry of their
children, the same ought to flourish and ripen, the same ought to advance and go forward
to perfection. For it is right that those ancient doctrines of heavenly philosophy should, as
time goes on, be cared for, smoothed, polished; but not that they should be changed, not
that they should be maimed, not that they should be mutilated. They may receive proof, illustration,
definiteness; but they must retain withal their completeness, their integrity, their
characteristic properties.</p>
<p><del>58.</del> For if once this license of impious fraud be admitted, I dread to say in how great
danger religion will be of being utterly destroyed and annihilated. For if any one part of
Catholic truth be given up, another, and another, and another will thenceforward be given
up as a matter of course, and the several individual portions having been rejected, what will
follow in the end but the rejection of the whole? On the other hand, if what is new begins
to be mingled with what is old, foreign with domestic, profane with sacred, the custom will
of necessity creep on universally, till at last the Church will have nothing left untampered
with, nothing unadulterated, nothing sound, nothing pure; but where formerly there was a
sanctuary of chaste and undefiled truth, thenceforward there will be a brothel of impious
and base errors. May God’s mercy avert this wickedness from the minds of his servants; be
it rather the frenzy of the ungodly.</p>
<p><del>59.</del> But the Church of Christ, the careful and watchful guardian of the doctrines deposited
in her charge, never changes anything in them, never diminishes, never adds, does
not cut off what is necessary, does not add what is superfluous, does not lose her own, does
not appropriate what is another’s, but while dealing faithfully and judiciously with ancient
doctrine, keeps this one object carefully in view,—if there be anything which antiquity has
left shapeless and rudimentary, to fashion and polish it, if anything already reduced to shape
and developed, to consolidate and strengthen it, if any already ratified and defined, to keep
and guard it. Finally, what other object have Councils ever aimed at in their decrees, than
to provide that what was before believed in simplicity should in future be believed intelligently,
that what was before preached coldly should in future be preached earnestly, that
what was before practised negligently should thenceforward be practised with double solicitude?
This, I say, is what the Catholic Church, roused by the novelties of heretics, has accomplished
by the decrees of her Councils,—this, and nothing else,—she has thenceforward
consigned to posterity in writing what she had received from those of olden times only by

understanding, designating an old article of the faith by the characteristic of a new name.96</p>

<head>Continuation of the Exposition of 1 Tim. vi. 20.</head>
<p><del>60.</del> But let us return to the apostle. “O Timothy,” he says, “Guard the deposit, shunning
profane novelties of words.” “Shun them as you would a viper, as you would a scorpion, as
you would a basilisk, lest they smite you not only with their touch, but even with their eyes
and breath.” What is “to shun”? Not even to eat97 with a person of this sort. What is “shun”?
“If anyone,” says St. John, “come to you and bring not this doctrine.” What doctrine? What
but the Catholic and universal doctrine, which has continued one and the same through
the several successions of ages by the uncorrupt tradition of the truth and so will continue
for ever—“Receive him not into your house, neither bid him Godspeed, for he that biddeth
him Godspeed communicates with him in his evil deeds.”98</p>
<p><del>61.</del> “Profane novelties of words.” What words are these? Such as have nothing sacred,
nothing religious, words utterly remote from the inmost sanctuary of the Church which is
the temple of God. “Profane novelties of words, that is, of doctrines, subjects, opinions, such
as are contrary to antiquity and the faith of the olden time. Which if they be received, it
follows necessarily that the faith of the blessed fathers is violated either in whole, or at all
events in great part; it follows necessarily that all the faithful of all ages, all the saints, the
chaste, the continent, the virgins, all the clergy, Deacons and Priests, so many thousands of
Confessors, so vast an army of martyrs, such multitudes of cities and of peoples, so many
islands, provinces, kings, tribes, kingdoms, nations, in a word, almost the whole earth, incorporated
in Christ the Head, through the Catholic faith, have been ignorant for so long
a tract of time, have been mistaken, have blasphemed, have not known what to believe, what
to confess.</p>
<p><del>62.</del> “Shun profane novelties of words,” which to receive and follow was never the part
of Catholics; of heretics always was. In sooth, what heresy ever burst forth save under a
definite name, at a definite place, at a definite time? Who ever originated a heresy that did
not first dissever himself from the consentient agreement of the universality and antiquity
of the Catholic Church? That this is so is demonstrated in the clearest way by examples. For

author of evil, that is, of our wickednesses, impieties, flagitiousnesses, inasmuch as he asserts
that He created with His own hands a human nature of such a description, that of its own

of vices, it is hurried away by unquenchable lust into the utmost extremes of baseness?</p>
<p><del>63.</del> There are innumerable instances of this kind, which for brevity’s sake, pass over;
by all of which, however, it is manifestly and clearly shown, that it is an established law, in
the case of almost all heresies, that they evermore delight in profane novelties, scorn the
<note type="footnote">held and taught in private. After the sack of Rome, the two friends passed over into Africa, and from thence
Pelagius proceeded to Palestine, where he was in two separate synods acquitted of the charge of heresy which
had been brought against him by Orosius, a Spanish monk, whom Augustine had sent for that purpose. But in
416, two African synods condemned his doctrine, and Zosimus bishop of Rome, whom he had appealed to,
though he had set aside their decision, was eventually obliged to yield to the firmness with which they held their
ground, and not only to condemn Pelagius, but to take stringent measures against his adherents. “In 418, another
African synod of two hundred and fourteen bishops passed nine canons, which were afterwards generally accepted
throughout the Church, and came to be regarded as the most important bulwark against Pelagianism.” The
heresy was formally condemned, in 431, by the General Council of Ephesus. Canons 2 and 4. The Pelagians
denied the corruption of man’s nature, and the necessity of divine grace. They held that infants new-born are
in the same state in which Adam was before his fall; that Adam’s sin injured no one but himself, and affected
his posterity no other wise than by the evil example which it afforded; they held also that men may live without
sin if they will and that some have so lived. Those who were afterwards called semi-Pelagians (they belonged
chiefly to the churches of Southern Gaul) were orthodox except in one particular: In their anxiety to justify, as
they thought, God’s dealings with man, they held that the first step in the way of salvation must be from ourselves:
we must ask that we may receive, seek that we may find, knock that it may be opened to us; thenceforward in
every stage of the road, our strenuous efforts must be aided by divine grace. They did not understand, or did
not grant, that to that same grace must be referred even the disposition to ask, to seek, to knock. See Prosper’s
letter to Augustine, August. Opera, Tom. x. The semi-Pelagian doctrine was condemned in the second Council
of Orange (a.d. 529), the third and fifth canons of which are directed against it.</note>

decisions of antiquity, and, through oppositions of science falsely so called, make shipwreck
of the faith. On the other hand, it is the sure characteristic of Catholics to keep that which
has been committed to their trust by the holy Fathers, to condemn profane novelties, and,
in the apostle’s words, once and again repeated, to anathematize every one who preaches
any other doctrine than that which has been received.100</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Heretics appeal to Scripture that they may more easily succeed in deceiving.</head>
<p><del>64.</del> Here, possibly, some one may ask, Do heretics also appeal to Scripture? They do
indeed, and with a vengeance; for you may see them scamper through every single book of
Holy Scripture,—through the books of Moses, the books of Kings, the Psalms, the Epistles,
the Gospels, the Prophets. Whether among their own people, or among strangers, in private
or in public, in speaking or in writing, at convivial meetings, or in the streets, hardly ever
do they bring forward anything of their own which they do not endeavour to shelter under
words of Scripture. Read the works of Paul of Samosata, of Priscillian, of Eunomius, of
Jovinian, and the rest of those pests, and you will see an infinite heap of instances, hardly a
single page, which does not bristle with plausible quotations from the New Testament or
the Old.</p>
<p><del>65.</del> But the more secretly they conceal themselves under shelter of the Divine Law, so
much the more are they to be feared and guarded against. For they know that the evil stench
of their doctrine will hardly find acceptance with any one if it be exhaled pure and simple.
They sprinkle it over, therefore, with the perfume of heavenly language, in order that one
who would be ready to despise human error, may hesitate to condemn divine words. They
do, in fact, what nurses do when they would prepare some bitter draught for children; they
smear the edge of the cup all round with honey, that the unsuspecting child, having first
tasted the sweet, may have no fear of the bitter. So too do these act, who disguise poisonous
herbs and noxious juices under the names of medicines, so that no one almost, when he
reads the label, suspects the poison.</p>
<p><del>66.</del> It was for this reason that the Saviour cried, “Beware of false prophets who come
to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.”101 What is meant by
“sheep’s clothing”? What but the words which prophets and apostles with the guilelessness
of sheep wove beforehand as fleeces, for that immaculate Lamb which taketh away the sin
of the world? What are the ravening wolves? What but the savage and rabid glosses of
heretics, who continually infest the Church’s folds, and tear in pieces the flock of Christ
wherever they are able? But that they may with more successful guile steal upon the unsuspecting
sheep, retaining the ferocity of the wolf, they put off his appearance, and wrap
themselves, so to say, in the language of the Divine Law, as in a fleece, so that one, having
felt the softness of wool, may have no dread of the wolf’s fangs. But what saith the Saviour?
“By their fruits ye shall know them;” that is, when they have begun not only to quote those
divine words, but also to expound them, not as yet only to make a boast of them as on their
side, but also to interpret them, then will that bitterness, that acerbity, that rage, be under-
<note type="footnote">101 Matt. vii. 15.</note>

<pb n="352"/>
stood; then will the ill-savour of that novel poison be perceived, then will those profane
novelties be disclosed, then may you see first the hedge broken through, then the landmarks
of the Fathers removed, then the Catholic faith assailed, then the doctrine of the Church
torn in pieces.</p>
<p><del>67.</del> Such were they whom the Apostle Paul rebukes in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
when he says, “For of this sort are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
themselves into apostles of Christ.”102 The apostles brought forward instances from Holy
Scripture; these men did the same. The apostles cited the authority of the Psalms; these men
did so likewise. The apostles brought forward passages from the prophets; these men still
did the same. But when they began to interpret in different senses the passages which both
had agreed in appealing to, then were discerned the guileless from the crafty, the genuine
from the counterfeit, the straight from the crooked, then, in one word, the true apostles
from the false apostles. “And no wonder,” he says, “for Satan himself transforms himself
into an angel of light. It is no marvel then if his servants are transformed as the servants of
righteousness.” Therefore, according to the authority of the Apostle Paul, as often as either
false apostles or false teachers cite passages from the Divine Law, by means of which, misinterpreted,
they seek to prop up their own errors, there is no doubt that they are following
the cunning devices of their father, which assuredly he would never have devised, but that
he knew that where he could fraudulently and by stealth introduce error, there is no easier
way of effecting his impious purpose than by pretending the authority of Holy Scripture.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>Heretics, in quoting Scripture, follow the example of the Devil.</head>
<p><del>68.</del> But some one will say, What proof have we that the Devil is wont to appeal to Holy
Scripture? Let him read the Gospels wherein it is written, “Then the Devil took Him (the
Lord the Saviour) and set Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple, and said unto Him: If thou
be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning
thee, that they may keep thee in all thy ways: In their hands they shall bear thee up,
lest perchance thou dash thy foot against a stone.”103 What sort of treatment must men,
insignificant wretches that they are, look for at the hands of him who assailed even the Lord
of Glory with quotations from Scripture? “If thou be the Son of God,” saith he, “cast thyself
down.” Wherefore? “For,” saith he, “it is written.” It behoves us to pay special attention to
this passage and bear it in mind, that, warned by so important an instance of Evangelical
authority, we may be assured beyond doubt, when we find people alleging passages from
the Apostles or Prophets against the Catholic Faith, that the Devil speaks through their
mouths. For as then the Head spoke to the Head, so now also the members speak to the
members, the members of the Devil to the members of Christ, misbelievers to believers,
sacrilegious to religious, in one word, Heretics to Catholics</p>
<p><del>69.</del> But what do they say? “If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down;” that is, If
thou wouldst be a son of God, and wouldst receive the inheritance of the Kingdom of
Heaven, cast thyself down; that is, cast thyself down from the doctrine and tradition of that
sublime Church, which is imagined to be nothing less than the very temple of God. And if
one should ask one of the heretics who gives this advice, How do you prove? What ground
have you, for saying, that I ought to cast away the universal and ancient faith of the Catholic
Church? he has the answer ready, “For it is written;” and forthwith he produces a thousand
testimonies, a thousand examples, a thousand authorities from the Law, from the Psalms,
from the apostles, from the Prophets, by means of which, interpreted on a new and wrong
principle, the unhappy soul may be precipitated from the height of Catholic truth to the
lowest abyss of heresy. Then, with the accompanying promises, the heretics are wont marvellously
to beguile the incautious. For they dare to teach and promise, that in their church,
that is, in the conventicle of their communion, there is a certain great and special and altogether
personal grace of God, so that whosoever pertain to their number, without any labour,
without any effort, without any industry, even though they neither ask, nor seek, nor knock,
have such a dispensation from God, that, borne up by angel hands, that is, preserved by the
protection of angels, it is impossible they should ever dash their feet against a stone, that is,
that they should ever be offended.104</p>

<head>What Rule is to be observed in the Interpretation of Scripture.</head>
<p><del>70.</del> But it will be said, If the words, the sentiments, the promises of Scripture, are appealed
to by the Devil and his disciples, of whom some are false apostles, some false
prophets and false teachers, and all without exception heretics, what are Catholics and the
sons of Mother Church to do? How are they to distinguish truth from falsehood in the sacred
Scriptures? They must be very careful to pursue that course which, in the beginning of this
Commonitory, we said that holy and learned men had commended to us, that is to say, they
must interpret the sacred Canon according to the traditions of the Universal Church and
in keeping with the rules of Catholic doctrine, in which Catholic and Universal Church,
moreover, they must follow universality, antiquity, consent. And if at any time a part opposes
itself to the whole, novelty to antiquity, the dissent of one or a few who are in error to the
consent of all or at all events of the great majority of Catholics, then they must prefer the
soundness of the whole to the corruption of a part; in which same whole they must prefer
the religion of antiquity to the profaneness of novelty; and in antiquity itself in like manner,
to the temerity of one or of a very few they must prefer, first of all, the general decrees, if
such there be, of a Universal Council, or if there be no such, then, what is next best, they
must follow the consentient belief of many and great masters. Which rule having been
faithfully, soberly, and scrupulously observed, we shall with little difficulty detect the noxious
errors of heretics as they arise.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28"> 
<pb n="355"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<head>In what Way, on collating the consentient opinions of the Ancient Masters, the Novelties of
Heretics may be detected and condemned.</head>
<p><del>71.</del> And here I perceive that, as a necessary sequel to the foregoing, I ought to show
by examples in what way, by collating the consentient opinions of the ancient masters, the
profane novelties of heretics may be detected and condemned. Yet in the investigation of
this ancient consent of the holy Fathers we are to bestow our pains not on every minor
question of the Divine Law, but only, at all events especially, where the Rule of Faith is
concerned. Nor is this way of dealing with heresy to be resorted to always, or in every instance,
but only in the case of those heresies which are new and recent, and that on their
first arising, before they have had time to deprave the Rules of the Ancient Faith, and before
they endeavour, while the poison spreads and diffuses itself, to corrupt the writings of the
ancients. But heresies already widely diffused and of old standing are by no means to be
thus dealt with, seeing that through lapse of time they have long had opportunity of corrupting
the truth. And therefore, as to the more ancient schisms or heresies, we ought either to
confute them, if need be, by the sole authority of the Scriptures, or at any rate, to shun them
as having been already of old convicted and condemned by universal councils of the Catholic
Priesthood.</p>
<p><del>72.</del> Therefore, as soon as the corruption of each mischievous error begins to break
forth, and to defend itself by filching certain passages of Scripture, and expounding them
fraudulently and deceitfully, forthwith, the opinions of the ancients in the interpretation of
the Canon are to be collected, whereby the novelty, and consequently the profaneness,
whatever it may be, that arises, may both without any doubt be exposed, and without any
tergiversation be condemned. But the opinions of those Fathers only are to be used for
comparison, who living and teaching, holily, wisely, and with constancy, in the Catholic
faith and communion, were counted worthy either to die in the faith of Christ, or to suffer
death happily for Christ. Whom yet we are to believe on this condition, that that only is to
be accounted indubitable, certain, established, which either all, or the more part, have supported
and confirmed manifestly, frequently, persistently, in one and the same sense,
forming, as it were, a consentient council of doctors, all receiving, holding, handing on the
same doctrine. But whatsoever a teacher holds, other than all, or contrary to all, be he holy
and learned, be he a bishop, be he a Confessor, be he a martyr, let that be regarded as a
private fancy of his own, and be separated from the authority of common, public, general
persuasion, lest, after the sacrilegious custom of heretics and schismatics, rejecting the ancient
truth of the universal Creed, we follow, at the utmost peril of our eternal salvation, the newly
devised error of one man.</p>

<pb n="356"/>
<p><del>73.</del> Lest any one perchance should rashly think the holy and Catholic consent of these
blessed fathers to be despised, the Apostle says, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, “God
hath placed some in the Church, first Apostles,”105 of whom himself was one; “secondly
Prophets,” such as Agabus, of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles;106 “then doctors,”
who are now called Homilists, Expositors,107 whom the same apostle sometimes calls also
“Prophets,” because by them the mysteries of the Prophets are opened to the people. Whosoever,
therefore, shall despise these, who had their appointment of God in His Church in
their several times and places, when they are unanimous in Christ, in the interpretation of
some one point of Catholic doctrine, despises not man, but God, from whose unity in the
truth, lest any one should vary, the same Apostle earnestly protests, “I beseech you, brethren,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.”108 But if any one
dissent from their unanimous decision, let him listen to the words of the same apostle, “God
is not the God of dissension but of peace;”109 that is, not of him who departs from the unity
of consent, but of those who remain steadfast in the peace of consent: “as,” he continues, “I
teach in all Churches of the saints,” that is, of Catholics, which churches are therefore
churches of the saints, because they continue steadfast in the communion of the faith.</p>
<p><del>74.</del> And lest any one, disregarding every one else, should arrogantly claim to be listened
to himself alone, himself alone to be believed, the Apostle goes on to say, “Did the word of
God proceed from you, or did it come to you only?” And, lest this should be thought lightly
spoken, he continues, “If any man seem to be a prophet or a spiritual person, let him acknowledge
that the things which I write unto you are the Lord’s commands.” As to which, unless
a man be a prophet or a spiritual person, that is, a master in spiritual matters, let him be as
observant as possible of impartiality and unity, so as neither to prefer his own opinions to
those of every one besides, nor to recede from the belief of the whole body. Which injunction,
whoso ignores, shall be himself ignored;110 that is, he who either does not learn what he
does not know, or treats with contempt what he knows, shall be ignored, that is, shall be
deemed unworthy to be ranked of God with those who are united to each other by faith,
and equalled with each other by humility, than which I cannot imagine a more terrible evil.

<head>Recapitulation.</head>
<p><del>76.</del> This being the case, it is now time that we should recapitulate, at the close of this
second Commonitory, what was said in that and in the preceding.
We said above, that it has always been the custom of Catholics, and still is, to prove the
true faith in these two ways; first by the authority of the Divine Canon, and next by the tradition
of the Catholic Church. Not that the Canon alone does not of itself suffice for every
question, but seeing that the more part, interpreting the divine words according to their
own persuasion, take up various erroneous opinions, it is therefore necessary that the interpretation
of divine Scripture should be ruled according to the one standard of the Church’s
belief, especially in those articles on which the foundations of all Catholic doctrine rest.</p>
<p><del>77.</del> We said likewise, that in the Church itself regard must be had to the consentient
voice of universality equally with that of antiquity, lest we either be torn from the integrity
of unity and carried away to schism, or be precipitated from the religion of antiquity into
heretical novelties. We said, further, that in this same ecclesiastical antiquity two points are
very carefully and earnestly to be held in view by those who would keep clear of heresy: first,
they should ascertain whether any decision has been given in ancient times as to the matter
in question by the whole priesthood of the Catholic Church, with the authority of a General
Council: and, secondly, if some new question should arise on which no such decision has
been given, they should then have recourse to the opinions of the holy Fathers, of those at
least, who, each in his own time and place, remaining in the unity of communion and of
the faith, were accepted as approved masters; and whatsoever these may be found to have
held, with one mind and with one consent, this ought to be accounted the true and Catholic
doctrine of the Church, without any doubt or scruple.</p>
<p><del>78.</del> Which lest we should seem to allege presumptuously on our own warrant rather
than on the authority of the Church, we appealed to the example of the holy council which
some three years ago was held at Ephesus112 in Asia, in the consulship of Bassus and Antiochus,
where, when question was raised as to the authoritative determining of rules of faith,
lest, perchance, any profane novelty should creep in, as did the perversion of the truth at
Ariminum,113 the whole body of priests there assembled, nearly two hundred in number,
approved of this as the most Catholic, the most trustworthy, and the best course, viz., to
bring forth into the midst the sentiments of the holy Fathers, some of whom it was well

known had been martyrs, some Confessors, but all had been, and continued to the end to
be, Catholic priests, in order that by their consentient determination the reverence due to
ancient truth might be duly and solemnly confirmed, and the blasphemy of profane novelty
condemned. Which having been done, that impious Nestorius was lawfully and deservedly
adjudged to be opposed to Catholic antiquity, and contrariwise blessed Cyril to be in
agreement with it. And that nothing might be wanting to the credibility of the matter, we
recorded the names and the number (though we had forgotten the order) of the Fathers,
according to whose consentient and unanimous judgment, both the sacred preliminaries
of judicial procedure were expounded, and the rule of divine truth established. Whom, that
we may strengthen our memory, it will be no superfluous labour to mention again here also.</p>

<head>The Council of Ephesus.</head>
<p><del>79.</del> These then are the men whose writings, whether as judges or as witnesses, were
recited in the Council: St. Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a most excellent Doctor and most
blessed martyr, Saint Athanasius, bishop of the same city, a most faithful Teacher, and most
eminent Confessor, Saint Theophilus, also bishop of the same city, a man illustrious for his
faith, his life, his knowledge, whose successor, the revered Cyril, now114 adorns the Alexandrian
Church. And lest perchance the doctrine ratified by the Council should be thought
peculiar to one city and province, there were added also those lights of Cappadocia, St.
Gregory of Nazianzus, bishop and Confessor, St. Basil of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, bishop
and Confessor, and the other St. Gregory, St. Gregory of Nyssa, for his faith, his conversation,
his integrity, and his wisdom, most worthy to be the brother of Basil. And lest Greece or
the East should seem to stand alone, to prove that the Western and Latin world also have
always held the same belief, there were read in the Council certain Epistles of St. Felix,
martyr, and St. Julius, both bishops of Rome. And that not only the Head, but the other
parts, of the world also might bear witness to the judgment of the council, there was added
from the South the most blessed Cyprian, bishop of Carthage and martyr, and from the
North St. Ambrose, bishop of Milan.</p>
<p><del>80.</del> These all then, to the sacred number of the decalogue,115 were produced at Ephesus
as doctors, councillors, witnesses, judges. And that blessed council holding their doctrine,
following their counsel, believing their witness, submitting to their judgment without haste,
<note type="footnote">114 This marks Vincentius’s date within very narrow limits, viz. after the Council of Ephesus, and before
Cyril’s death. Cyril died in 444.</note>
<note type="footnote">115 Vincentius’s copy of the acts of the Council appears to have contained extracts from no more than ten
Fathers. But the Fathers from whose writings extracts were read were twelve in number; the two omitted by
Vincentius being Atticus, bishop of Constantinople, and Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium. In Labbe’s Concilia,
where the whole are given, it is remarked that in one manuscript the two last mentioned occupy a different place
from the others. Dean Milman (Latin Christianity, vol. 1, p. 164) speaks of the passages read, “as of very
doubtful bearing on the question raised by Nestorius.” It is true only two, those from Athanasius and Gregory
Nazianzen, contain the crucial term “Theotocos” but all express the truth which “Theotocos” symbolises. That
the word was not of recent introduction, Bishop Pearson (Creed, Art. 3) shows by quotations from other writers
besides those produced at the Council, going back as far as to Origen. The Fathers cited may certainly be said
to fulfil to some extent Vincentius’s requirement of universality. They represent the teaching of Alexandria,
Rome, Carthage, Milan, Constantinople, and Asia Minor; but his appeal would have been more to his purpose
if antiquity had been more expressly represented. With the exception of Cyprian, all the passages cited were
from writers of comparatively recent date at the time, though, as Vincentius truly remarks, others might have</note>

without foregone conclusion, without partiality, gave their determination concerning the
Rules of Faith. A much greater number of the ancients might have been adduced; but it was
needless, because neither was it fit that the time should be occupied by a multitude of witnesses,
nor does any one suppose that those ten were really of a different mind from the rest
of their colleagues.</p>

generally, lays much stress on this omission of citations from earlier Fathers at the Council, as he does also on
similar omissions in the case of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Councils, with what object is sufficiently obvious.
Bishop Bull points out Petavius’s disposition to disparage or misrepresent the teaching of the earlier Fathers, in
another and still more important instance. (Defens. Fid. Nic.) Introd. § 8.</note>

<head>The Constancy of the Ephesine Fathers in driving away Novelty and maintaining Antiquity.</head>
<p><del>81.</del> After the preceding we added also the sentence of blessed Cyril, which is contained
in these same Ecclesiastical Proceedings. For when the Epistle of Capreolus,116 bishop of
Carthage, had been read, wherein he earnestly intreats that novelty may be driven away and
antiquity maintained, Cyril made and carried the proposal, which it may not be out of place
to insert here: For says he, at the close of the proceedings, “Let the Epistle of Capreolus also,
the reverend and very religious bishop of Carthage, which has been read, be inserted in the
acts. His mind is obvious, for he intreats that the doctrines of the ancient faith be confirmed,
such as are novel, wantonly devised, and impiously promulgated, reprobated and condemned.”
All the bishops cried out, “These are the words of all; this we all say, this we all
desire.” What mean “the words of all,” what mean “the desires of all,” but that what has
been handed down from antiquity should be retained, what has been newly devised, rejected
with disdain?</p>
<p><del>82.</del> Next we expressed our admiration of the humility and sanctity of that Council,
such that, though the number of priests was so great, almost the more part of them metropolitans,
so erudite, so learned, that almost all were capable of taking part in doctrinal discussions,
whom the very circumstance of their being assembled for the purpose, might seem
to embolden to make some determination on their own authority, yet they innovated
nothing, presumed nothing, arrogated to themselves absolutely nothing, but used all possible
care to hand down nothing to posterity but what they had themselves received from their
Fathers. And not only did they dispose satisfactorily of the matter presently in hand, but
they also set an example to those who should come after them, how they also should adhere
to the determinations of sacred antiquity, and condemn the devices of profane novelty.</p>
<p><del>83.</del> We inveighed also against the wicked presumption of Nestorius in boasting that
he was the first and the only one who understood holy Scripture, and that all those teachers
were ignorant, who before him had expounded the sacred oracles, forsooth, the whole body
<note type="footnote">116 The letter of Capreolus is given in Labbe’s Concilia, vol. 3, col. 529 sqq. The Emperor Theodosius had
written to Augustine, requiring his presence at the Council which he had summoned to meet at Ephesus in the
matter of Nestorius. But Augustine having died while the letter was on its way, it was brought to Capreolus,
bishop of Carthage and Metropolitan. Capreolus would have summoned a meeting of the African bishops, that
they might appoint a delegate to represent them at the Council; but the presence of the hostile Vandals, who
were laying waste the country in all directions, made it impossible for the bishops to travel to any place of
meeting. Capreolus therefore could do no more than send his deacon Besula to represent him and the African
Church, bearing with him the letter referred to in the text. The letter, after having been read before the Council,

of priests, the whole body of Confessors and martyrs, of whom some had published commentaries
upon the Law of God, others had agreed with them in their comments, or had
acquiesced in them. In a word, he confidently asserted that the whole Church was even now
in error, and always had been in error, in that, as it seemed to him, it had followed, and was
following, ignorant and misguided teachers.</p>

<p>The zeal of Celestine and Sixtus, bishops of Rome, in opposing Novelty.</p>
<p><del>84.</del> The foregoing would be enough and very much more than enough, to crush and
annihilate every profane novelty. But yet that nothing might be wanting to such completeness
of proof, we added, at the close, the twofold authority of the Apostolic See, first, that of holy
Pope Sixtus, the venerable prelate who now adorns the Roman Church; and secondly that
of his predecessor, Pope Celestine of blessed memory, which same we think it necessary to
insert here also.</p>
<p>Holy Pope Sixtus117 then says in an Epistle which he wrote on Nestorius’s matter to the
bishop of Antioch, “Therefore, because, as the Apostle says, the faith is one,—evidently the
faith which has obtained hitherto,—let us believe the things that are to be said, and say the
things that are to be held.” What are the things that are to be believed and to be said? He
goes on: “Let no license be allowed to novelty, because it is not fit that any addition should
be made to antiquity. Let not the clear faith and belief of our forefathers be fouled by any
muddy admixture.” A truly apostolic sentiment! He enhances the belief of the Fathers by
the epithet of clearness; profane novelties he calls muddy.</p>
<p><del>85.</del> Holy Pope Celestine also expresses himself in like manner and to the same effect.
For in the Epistle which he wrote to the priests of Gaul, charging them with connivance
with error, in that by their silence they failed in their duty to the ancient faith, and allowed
profane novelties to spring up, he says: “We are deservedly to blame if we encourage error
by silence. Therefore rebuke these people. Restrain their liberty of preaching.” But here
some one may doubt who they are whose liberty to preach as they list he forbids,—the
preachers of antiquity or the devisers of novelty. Let himself tell us; let himself resolve the
reader’s doubt. For he goes on: “If the case be so (that is, if the case be so as certain persons
complain to me touching your cities and provinces, that by your hurtful dissimulation you
cause them to consent to certain novelties), if the case be so, let novelty cease to assail antiquity.”
This, then, was the sentence of blessed Celestine, not that antiquity should cease
to subvert novelty, but that novelty should cease to assail antiquity.118</p>

<p>The Children of the Catholic Church ought to adhere to the Faith of their Fathers and die for
it.</p>
<p><del>86.</del> Whoever then gainsays these Apostolic and Catholic determinations, first of all
necessarily insults the memory of holy Celestine, who decreed that novelty should cease to
assail antiquity; and in the next place sets at naught the decision of holy Sixtus, whose sentence
was, “Let no license be allowed to novelty, since it is not fit that any addition be made
to antiquity;” moreover, he condemns the determination of blessed Cyril, who extolled with
high praise the zeal of the venerable Capreolus, in that he would fain have the ancient doctrines
of the faith confirmed, and novel inventions condemned; yet more, he tramples upon
the Council of Ephesus, that is, on the decisions of the holy bishops of almost the whole
East, who decreed, under divine guidance, that nothing ought to be believed by posterity
save what the sacred antiquity of the holy Fathers, consentient in Christ, had held, who with
one voice, and with loud acclaim, testified that these were the words of all, this was the wish
of all, this was the sentence of all, that as almost all heretics before Nestorius, despising antiquity
and upholding novelty, had been condemned, so Nestorius, the author of novelty
and the assailant of antiquity, should be condemned also. Whose consentient determination,
inspired by the gift of sacred and celestial grace, whoever disapproves must needs hold the
profaneness of Nestorius to have been condemned unjustly; finally, he despises as vile and
worthless the whole Church of Christ, and its doctors, apostles, and prophets, and especially
the blessed Apostle Paul: he despises the Church, in that she hath never failed in loyalty to
the duty of cherishing and preserving the faith once for all delivered to her; he despises St.
Paul, who wrote, “O Timothy, guard the deposit intrusted to thee, shunning profane novelties
of words;”119 and again, “if any man preach unto you other than ye have received, let him
be accursed.”120 But if neither apostolical injunctions nor ecclesiastical decrees may be violated,
by which, in accordance with the sacred consent of universality and antiquity, all
heretics always, and, last of all, Pelagius, Coelestius, and Nestorius have been rightly and
deservedly condemned, then assuredly it is incumbent on all Catholics who are anxious to
approve themselves genuine sons of Mother Church, to adhere henceforward to the holy
faith of the holy Fathers, to be wedded to it, to die in it; but as to the profane novelties of
profane men—to detest them, abhor them, oppose them, give them no quarter.</p>

<head>Note on Section 41, Page 143.</head>
<p>There is so close an agreement, both in substance and often in the form of expression,
between the preceding sections (36–42) and the so-called Athanasian Creed, that it led
Antelmi (Nova de Symb. Athanas. Disquisitio,) to ascribe that document to Vincentius as
its author, and to suppose that in it we have the fulfilment of the promise here referred to.
If, however, the Creed was the work of Vincentius, it cannot well be the work promised at
the close of § 41, for Vincentius’s words point to a fuller and more explicit treatment of the
subjects referred to, whereas in the Athanasian Creed, though the subjects are the same, the
treatment of them is very much briefer and more concise.</p>
<p>Whoever was the author however, if it was not Vincentius, he must at least, as the subjoined
extracts seem to prove, have been familiar with the Commonitory, as also with St.
Augustine’s writings, of which, as well as of the Commonitory, the Creed bears evident
traces. I subjoin the following instances of agreement between the Commonitory and the
Creed: Antelmi gives several others.</p>
<p>Commonitory: Athanasian Creed:</p>

Deum pariter atque Hominem confitetur.

<head>Note on Section 69, Page 149.</head>
<p>That Vincentius had Augustine and his adherents in view in this description will hardly
be doubted by any one who will compare it with the following extracts, the first from
Prosper’s letter to Augustine,122 giving him an account of the complaints made against his
doctrine by the Massilian clergy; the second from St. Augustine’s treatise, “De dono Perseveranti
”123 written in consequence of it.</p>
<p>Commonitory, § 69.</p>
<p>“Si quis interroget quempiam hæreticorum sibi talia persuadentem, Unde probas, unde
doces quod Ecclesiæ Catholicæ universalem et antiquam fidem dimittere debeam? Statum
ille, ‘Scriptum est enim,’ et continuo mille testimonia, mille exempla, mille auctoritates parat
de Lege, de Psalmis, de Apostolis, de Prophetis, quibus, novo et malo more interpretatis, ex
arce Catholica in hæreseos barathrum infelix anima præcipitetur. Audent enim polliceri et
docere, quod in Ecclesia sua, id est, in communionis suæ conventiculo, magna et specialis
ac plane personalis quædam sit Dei gratia, adeo ut sine ullo labore, sine ullo studio, sine ulla
industria, etiamsi nec petant, nec quærant, nec pulsent, quicunque illi ad numerum suum
pertinent, tamen ita divinitus dispensentur, ut, angelicis evecti manibus, id est, angelica
protectione servati, nunquam possint offendere ad lapidem pedem suum, id est, nunquam
scandalizari.”</p>
<p>Prosper to Augustine.</p>
<p>“The Massilian clergy complain,” he says, “Romoveri omnem industriam, tollique virtutes,
si Dei constitutio humanus præveniat voluntates.” § 3.</p>
<p>Then referring to the teaching of the Massilians themselves, Prosper continues,</p>
<p>“Ad conditionem hanc velint uniuscujusque hominis pertinere, ut ad cognitionem Dei
et ad obedientiam mandatorum Ejus possit suam dirigere voluntatem, et ad hanc gratiam
qua in Christo renascimur pervenire, per naturalem scilicet facultatem, petendo, quærendo,
pulsando.”</p>
<p>Referring to the line of argument pursued by himself and others of Augustine’s friends
and the Massilian way of dealing with it, he says, “Et cum contra eos Scripta Beatitudinis
tuæ validissimis et innumeris testimoniis Divinarum Scriptuarum instructa proferimus,…obstinationem
suam vetustate defendunt.” § 3.</p>

<pb n="369"/>
<p>St. Augustine replies to Prosper not in an ordinary letter, but in two short Treatises,
which must have been written immediately afters its receipt, for he died in August 430, the
first entitled “De Prædestinatione Sanctorum,” the second “De Dono Perseverantiæ.”</p>
<p>The following extract is from the latter:</p>
<p>“Attendant ergo quomodo falluntur qui putant Esse a nobis, non dari nobis, ut petamus,
quæramus, pulsemus. Et hoc esse, dicunt, quod gratia præceditur merito nostro, ut sequatur
illa cum accipimus petentes, et invenimus quærentes, aperiturque pulsantibus. Nec volunt
intelligere etiam hoc divini muneris esse ut oremus, hoc est, petamus, quæramus, atque
pulsamus.”—De Dono Persev. c. 23, § 64.</p>
<p>Vincentius’s language is in keeping with that of others of St. Augustine’s opponents, as
Cassian and Faustus, extracts from whom are given by Noris; only, as he observes, while
Vincentius uses the term “heresy” of the doctrine impugned,—they are content to use the
milder term “error.”—Histor. Pelag. p. 246.</p>

<head>APPENDIX III.</head>
<head>Note on Section 85, Page 156.</head>
<p>Celestine’s letter was addressed to certain Bishops of Southern Gaul, who are particularized
by name.</p>
<p>It appears that Prosper and Hilary had made a journey to Rome, where they then were,
for the purpose of complaining to Celestine of the connivance of certain bishops of Southern
Gaul with the unsound teaching of their clergy. They complained too of the disrespectful
manner in which these same clergy treated the memory of Augustine, then recently deceased.</p>
<p>Celestine writes to these bishops: blames their connivance with a fault, which, says he,
by their silence they make their own, and then proceeds to charge them, as in the passage
quoted in the text, “Rebuke these people: restrain their liberty of preaching. If the case be
so, let novelty cease to assail antiquity, let restlessness cease to disturb the Church’s peace.”
Then, after some further exhortation, he adds, “We cannot wonder at their thus assailing
the living, when they do not shrink from seeking to asperse the memory of the departed.
With Augustine, whom all men everywhere loved and honoured, we ever held communion.
Let a stop be put to this spirit of disparagement, which unhappily is on the increase.”</p>
<p>The manner in which Vincentius deals with this letter has been very commonly thought,
and with reason, to indicate a Semipelagian leaning.124 His “si ita est,” “if the case be so,”
emphasized by being repeated again and again, quite in an excited manner, as we should
say, shows an evident wish to shift the charge of novelty from those against whom it had
been brought, and fix it upon the opposite party. “Who are the introducers of novelty? The
Massilians, as Prosper represents them, or their calumniators? Not the Massilians: they notoriously
appeal to antiquity,—not the Massilians, but Prosper and the rest of Augustine’s
followers.”</p>
<p>The feeling with regard to Augustine, on the part of the Massilian clergy, as indicated
in Celestine’s letter, is quite in accordance with the animus of § 69 above. See the note on
that place, and see Noris’s remarks, pp. 246–248.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>The Life of Cassian.</head>
<p>“Cassianus natione Scytha” is the description given by Gennadius1 of the writer whose
works are now for the first time translated into English. In spite, however, of the precision
of this statement, considerable doubt hangs over Cassian’s nationality, and it is hard to believe
that he was in reality a Scythian. Not only is his language and style free from all trace of
barbarism, but as a boy he certainly received a liberal education; for in his Conferences he
laments that the exertions of his tutor and his own attention to continual study had so
weakened him that his mind was so filled with songs of the poets that even at the hour of
prayer it was thinking of those trifling fables and stories of battles with which it had from
earliest infancy been stored; “and,” he adds, “when singing Psalms or asking forgiveness of
sins, some wanton recollection of the poems intrudes itself or the image of heroes fighting
presents itself before the eyes; and an imagination of such phantoms is always haunting
me.”2 Further evidence of the character of his education is also supplied by the fact that in
his work on the Incarnation against Nestorius he manifests an acquaintance not only with
the works of earlier Christian Fathers, but also with those of such writers as Cicero and
Persius.3</p>
<p>These considerations are sufficient to make us hesitate before accepting the statement
of Gennadius in what would at first sight be its natural meaning; although from the fact of
his connection with Marseilles, where so much of Cassian’s life was spent, as well as the
early date at which he wrote (a.d. 495), it is dangerous to reject his authority altogether. It
is, however, possible that the term “Scytha” is not really intended to denote a Scythian, but
to refer to the desert of Scete, or Scitis,4 in Egypt, where Cassian passed many years of his
life, and with which his fame was closely associated; and, therefore, without going to the
length of rejecting the authority of Gennadius altogether, we are free to look for some other
country as the birthplace of our author. But little light is thrown on this subject by the
statements of other writers. Photius5 (a.d. 800) calls him ῾Ρωμαῖος, which need mean no

speak of the district as Σκήτις, while in Latin writers the name appears as Scythia, or Scythis; and, though the
printed texts of Cassian give the form as Scitium, heremus Scitii, and heremus Scitiotica, yet we learn from
Petschenig that in the mss. of his works it is not seldom written as Scythium. It should be added that in the text
of Gennadius the reading is not absolutely free from doubt, as there is some slight authority for reading “natus
Serta.”</note>

more than born within the Roman Empire; while Honorius of Autun (a.d. 1130) speaks of
him as Afer. The last-mentioned writer is, however, of too late a date to be of any authority;
and it is just possible that the term “Afer,” like the “Scytha” of Gennadius, may be owing to
his lengthy residence in Egypt. 6In the writings of Cassian himself there is nothing to enable
us to identify the country of his birth with certainty; but, in describing the situation of his
ancestral home, he speaks of the delightful pleasantness of the neighbourhood, and the recesses
of the woods, which would not only delight the heart of a monk but would also furnish
him with a plentiful supply of food;7 while in a later passage he says that in his own country
it was impossible to find any one who had adopted the monastic life.8 From these notices,
compared with a passage in the Preface to the Institutes, where the diocese of Apta Julia in
Gallia Narbonensis is spoken of as still without monasteries, some ground is given for the
conjecture that Cassian was really a native of Gaul, whither he returned in mature age after
his wanderings were ended, and where most of his friends of whom we have any knowledge
were settled. On the whole, then, it appears to the present writer to be the most probable
view that Cassian was of Western origin, and, perhaps, a native of Provence, although it
must be freely acknowledged that it is impossible to speak with certainty on this subject.9</p>
<p>Once more: not only is there this doubt about his nationality, but questions have also
been raised concerning his original name. Gennadius and Cassiodorus10 speak of him simply
as Cassianus. In his own writings he represents himself as addressed by the monks in Egypt
more than once by the name of John.11 Prosper of Aquitaine (his contemporary and antagonist)
combines both names, and speaks of him as “Joannes cognomento Cassianus.”12 In
the titles of the majority of the mss. of his own writing he is merely “Cassianus,” though in
one case the work is entitled “Beatissimi Joannis qui et Cassiani.”13 Are we, then, with the
writer of the last-mentioned ms., to suppose that the names John and Cassian are alternatives;
or, with Prosper, that John was his nomen and Cassianus his cognomen, or, more strictly,
<note type="footnote">6 Dr. Gregory Smith (Dictionary of Christian Biography, art. Cassian) thinks that ‘Cassianus’ possibly points
to Casius, a small town in Syria; but, apart from the fact that the name was not uncommon in the West as well
as in the East, the description of his home as being in a country where there were no monasteries is quite fatal
to this idea.</note>

agnomen? The former view is, perhaps, the more probable, as he may well have taken the
name of John at his baptism or at his admission to the monastic life. The theory which has
sometimes been advocated—that he received it at his ordination by S. John Chrysostom—falls
to the ground when we notice that he represents himself as called John during his residence
in Egypt, several years before his ordination and intercourse with S. Chrysostom.</p>
<p>To pass now from the question of his name and nationality to the narrative of Cassian’s
life. Various considerations point to the date of his birth as about the year 360. Of his family
we know nothing, except that in one passage of his writings he incidentally makes mention
of a sister;14 while the language which he uses of his parents would imply that they were
well-to-do and pious.15 As we have already seen, he received a liberal education as a boy,
but while still young forsook the world, and was received, together with his friend Germanus,
into a monastery at Bethlehem,16 where he spent several years and became thoroughly familiar
with the customs and traditions of the monasteries of Syria. Eager, however, to make
further progress in the perfect life, the two friends finally determined to visit Egypt,17 where,
as it was the country in which the monastic life originated, the most famous monasteries
existed, and the most illustrious Anchorites were to be found. Permission to undertake the
journey was sought and obtained from their superiors, a pledge being required of a speedy
return when the object of their visit was gained.18 Sailing from some port of Syria, perhaps
Joppa, the friends arrived at Thennesus, a town at the mouth of the Tanitic branch of the
Nile, near Lake Menzaleh. Here they fell in with a celebrated Anchorite named Archebius,
bishop of the neighbouring town of Panephysis, who had come to Thennesus on business
connected with the election of a bishop. He, on hearing the object of their visit to Egypt, at
once offered them an introduction to some celebrated Anchorites in his own neighbourhood.
The offer was gladly accepted, and under his guidance they made their way through a dreary
district of salt marshes, many of the villages being in ruins and deserted by their inhabitants
owing to the floods which had inundated the country and turned the rising grounds into
islands, “and thus afforded the desired solitudes to the holy Anchorites, among whom three

of 386, by which time Cassian himself must have been already in Egypt; nor does he anywhere in his writings

old men—Chæremon, Nesteros, and Joseph—were famed as the Anchorites of the longest
standing.”19 Archebius brought them first to Chæremon, who had already passed his hundredth
year, and was so far bent with age and constant prayer that he could no longer walk
upright, but crawled upon his hands and knees. The saint’s hesitation at allowing himself
to be thus interviewed by strangers was soon overcome, and he finally gratified their curiosity
by delivering three discourses, on the subjects of Perfection, Chastity, and the Protection
of God.20 From the cell of Chæremon Cassian and his companion proceeded to that of
Abbot Nesteros, who honoured them with two discourses, on Spiritual Knowledge, and
Divine Gifts;21 and from him they repaired to Joseph, who belonged to a noble family, and
before his renunciation of the world had been “primarius” of his native city, Thmuis. He
was naturally better educated than the others, and was able to converse with them in Greek
instead of being obliged to have recourse to the help of an interpreter, as had been the case
with Chæremon and Nesteros.22 His first question referred to the relationship between
Cassian and Germanus: were they brothers? And their reply—that the brotherhood was
spiritual and not carnal—furnished the old man with a text for his first discourse, which
was on Friendship, and which was followed up on the next day by one on the Obligation of
Promises,23 called forth by the perplexity in which the travellers found themselves owing
to their promise to return to Bethlehem,—a promise which they were loth to break, and
which yet they could not fulfil without losing a grand opportunity of making progress in
the spiritual life. In their difficulty they consulted Joseph; and, fortified by his authority and
advice, they determined to break the letter of their promise and make a longer stay in Egypt,
where they accordingly remained for seven years in spite of their brethren at Bethlehem,
whose displeasure at their conduct, Cassian tells us, was not removed by their frequent letters
home.24</p>
<p>It was while Cassian and his fellow-traveller were still in the neighbourhood of Panephysis
that these energetic precursors of the modern “interviewers” paid a visit to Abbot
Pinufius, a priest who presided over a large monastery. This man was an old friend of theirs,
whose acquaintance they had previously made at Bethlehem, whither (after an ineffectual
attempt to conceal himself in a monastery in the island of Tabenna) he had fled in order to
escape the responsibilities of his office. There he had been received as a novice, and had
been assigned by the abbot as an inmate of Cassian’s cell, until he was recognized by a visitor

from Egypt and brought back in triumph to his own monastery.25 To him, therefore, Cassian
and Germanus made their way; and by him they were warmly welcomed; the old man repaying
their former hospitality by giving them quarters in his own cell. While staying in this
monastery they were so fortunate as to be present at the admission of a novice, and heard
the charge which Pinufius made to the new-comer on the occasion;26 and afterwards the
abbot favoured them with a discourse “on the end of penitence and the marks of satisfaction.”
27 After this, resisting his pressing invitation to remain with him in the monastery,
they proceeded once more on their travels, and, crossing the river, came to Diolcos, a town
hard by the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile. Here was a barren tract of land between the river
and the sea, rendered unfit for cultivation by the saltness of the soil and the dryness of the
sand. It was, therefore, eagerly seized upon by the monks, who congregated here in great
numbers in spite of the absence of water; the river from which it had to be fetched being
some three miles distant.28 In this neighbourhood they made the acquaintance of Abbot
Piamun, a most celebrated Anchorite, who explained to them with great care the characteristics
of the three kinds of monks; viz., the Coenobites, the Anchorites, and the Sarabaites.29
This discourse had the effect of exciting their desire more keenly than ever for the Anchorites’
life in preference to that of the Coenobite,—a desire which was afterwards confirmed by
what they saw and heard in the desert of Scete. They next visited a large monastery in the
same neighbourhood, which was governed by the Abbot Paul, and which ordinarily accommodated
two hundred monks, but was at that moment filled with a much larger number,
who had come from the surrounding monasteries to celebrate the “depositio” of the late
abbot.30 Here they met a certain Abbot John, whose humility had led him to give up the life
of an Anchorite for that of a Coenobite, in order that he might have the opportunity of
practising the virtues of obedience and subjection, which seemed out of the reach of the
solitary. He was accordingly well qualified to speak of the subject which he selected for his
discourse; viz., the aims of the Anchorite and Coenobite life.31 Another well-known abbot,
whose acquaintance they now made, was Theonas, who, when quite a young man, had been
married by his parents, and later on, on failing to obtain the consent of his wife to a separa-

tion, in order that they might devote themselves to the monastic life, had deserted her and
fled away into a monastery, where after a time he had been promoted to the office of almoner.
From him they heard a discourse on the relaxation of the fast during Eastertide and Pentecost,
32 and, later on, one concerning Nocturnal Illusions,33 and another on Sinlessness.34
By these various discourses the two friends were rendered more desirous than ever of adopting
the Anchorite life, and less inclined than before to return to the subjection of the monastery
at Bethlehem. A far better course seemed to them to return to their own home,
probably (as we have seen) in Gaul, where they would be free to practice what austerities
they pleased without let or hindrance.35 In their perplexity they consulted Abbot Abraham,
who threw cold water on their plan in a discourse on Mortification,36 which was entirely
successful in persuading them to relinquish their half-formed intention. They, therefore,
remained in Egypt for some years longer; and it is to the time of their stay in the neighbourhood
of Diolcos that their acquaintance with Abbot Archebius must be assigned. This man,
so Cassian tells us,37 having discovered their desire to make some stay in the place, offered
them the use of his cell, pretending that he was about to go off on a journey. They gladly
accepted his offer. He went away for a few days, collected materials, and then returned and
proceeded to build a new cell for himself. Shortly afterwards some more brethren came. He
at once gave up to them his newly built cell, and once more set to work to build another for
himself.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine whether a stay in the desert of Scete was comprised in the
seven years which the two friends now spent in Egypt, or whether they visited it for the first
time during their second tour, after their return from Bethlehem. On the one hand, the
language used in Conference XVIII. cc. i. and xvi. would almost suggest that they made their
way into this remote district during their first sojourn in Egypt; and, on the other hand, that
employed in Conference I. c. i. might imply a distinct journey to Egypt for the sake of visiting
this region: and in XVII. xxx. Cassian distinctly asserts that they did visit Scete after their
return to Bethlehem in fulfilment of their promise. On the whole, it appears the more natural
view to suppose that their first tour was not extended beyond the Delta, more distant
expeditions being reserved for a future occasion. Adopting, then, this view, we follow the
travellers, after a seven years’ absence, back to the monastery at Bethlehem, where they
managed to pacify the irate brethren, and, strange to say, obtained leave to return to Egypt

a second time.38 On this occasion they penetrated farther into the country than they had
previously done. The region which they now visited was the desert of Scete, or Scitis; that
is, the southern part of the famous Nitrian Valley, a name which is well known to all students
from the rich treasure of Syrian mss. brought home from thence by the Hon. Robert Curzon
and Archdeacon Tattam now more than forty years ago. The district lies “to the northwest
of Cairo, three days’ journey in the Libyan desert,”39 and gains its name of Nitria from the
salt lakes which still furnish abundance of nitre, which has been worked for fully two thousand
years. The valley has some claims to be considered the original home of monasticism.
Some have thought that a colony of Therapeutæ was settled here in the earliest days; and
hither S. Frontonius is said to have retired with seventy brethren, to lead the life of ascetics,
about the middle of the second century.40 Less doubtful is the fact that S. Ammon, a contemporary
and friend of S. Antony, organized the monastic system here in the fourth century,
and “filled the same place in lower Egypt as Antony in the Thebaid.”41 Towards the close
of the fourth century the valley was crowded with cells and monasteries. Rufinus, who visited
it about 372, mentions fifty monasteries;42 and the same number is given by Sozomen, who
says that “some were inhabited by monks who live together in society, others by monks who
have adopted a solitary mode of existence.”43 About twenty years later Palladius passed a
considerable time here, and reckons the total number of monks and ascetics at five thousand.
44 They were also visited by S. Jerome about the same time, and various details of the
life of the monks are given by him in his Epistles.45 Some few monks still linger on to the
present day to keep up the traditions of nearly eighteen centuries. They were visited (among
others) by the Hon. Robert Curzon in 1833; and an interesting account of them is given by
him in his volume on “the monasteries of the Levant:”46 but the latest and best account of
them is that given by Mr. A. J. Butler, who succeeded in gaining permission to visit them
in 1883, and has described his journey in his excellent work on “the ancient Coptic Churches
of Egypt.”47 Four monasteries alone remain; known as Dair Abu Makâr, Dair Anba Bishôi,

Dair es Sûrianî, and Dair al Baramûs; but the ruins of many others may still be traced in the
desert tracts on the west side of the Natron lakes, and the valley of the waterless river which
at some very remote period is supposed to have formed the bed of one of the branches of
the Nile.”48 The monasteries are all built on the same general plan, so that, as Mr. Butler
tells us, a description of one will more or less accurately describe the others. Dair Abu Makâr
(the monastery of S. Macarius), the first which he visited, which lies strictly within the desert
of Scete, is spoken of as “a veritable fortress, standing about one-hundred and fifty yards
square, with blind, lofty walls rising sheer out of the sand.” “Each monastery has also, either
detached or not, a large keep, or tower, standing four-square, and approached only by a
draw-bridge. The tower contains the library, store-rooms for the vestments and sacred
vessels, cellars for oil and corn, and many strange holes and hiding-places of the monks in
the last resort, if their citadel should be taken by the enemy. Within the monastery is enclosed
one principal and one or two smaller court-yards, around which stand the cells of the monks,
domestic buildings, such as the mill-room, the oven, the refectory, and the like, and the
churches.”49 The outward aspect can have changed but little since the fourth century. The
buildings are perhaps stronger and more adapted to resist hostile attacks, but the general
plan is probably identical with that adopted in the earliest monasteries erected in this remote
region. Such, then, was the district to which Cassian and Germanus now made their way.
Here they first sought and obtained an interview with Abbot Moses, who had formerly dwelt
in the Thebaid near S. Antony, and was now living at a spot in the desert of Scete known as
Calamus,50 and was famous not only for practical goodness but also for contemplative excellence.
After much persuasion he yielded to their entreaties and discoursed to them “on
the goal or aim of a monk,”51 and, on the following day, on Discretion.52 They next visited
Abbot Paphnutius, or “the Buffalo,” as he was named, from his love of solitude. He was an
aged priest who had lived for years the life of an Anchorite, only leaving his cell for the
purpose of going to the church, which was five miles off, on Saturday and Sunday, and returning
with a large bucket of water on his shoulders to last him for the week. From him
they heard of the “three kinds of renunciation” necessary for a monk.53 They also visited
his disciple Daniel, who had been ordained priest through the instrumentality of Paphnutius,
but was so humble that he would never perform priestly functions in the presence of his
master. The subject of his discourse in answer to the inquiry of the two friends was “the lust

of the flesh and the spirit.”54 The next ascetic interviewed was Serapion, who spoke of the
“eight principal faults” to which a monk was exposed; viz., gluttony, fornication, covetousness,
anger, dejection, “accidie,” vain glory, and pride.55 After this they proceeded on a journey
of some eighty miles to Cellæ, a place that lay between the desert of Scete (properly so called)
and the Nitrian Valley, in order to consult Abbot Theodore on a difficulty which the recent
massacre of a number of monks in Palestine by the Saracens had brought forcibly before
them; viz., why was it that men of such illustrious merits and so great virtues should be slain
by robbers, and why should God permit so great a crime to be committed? The difficulty
was solved by Abbot Theodore in a discourse on “the death of the saints;”56 and thus the
journey was not taken in vain. Two other celebrated monks were also visited by the friends,
whose discourses are recorded by Cassian: viz., Abbot Serenus, who spoke of “Inconstancy
of mind, and Spiritual wickedness,”57 as well as of the nature of evil spirits, in a Conference
on “Principalities;”58 and Abbot Isaac, who delivered two discourses on the subject of
Prayer.59 A few days after the first of these was delivered there arrived in the desert the
“festal letters” of Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, in which he denounced the heresy of
the Anthropomorphites. This caused a great commotion among the monks of Scete; and
Abbot Paphnutius, who presided over the monastery where Cassian was staying, was the
only one who would allow the letters to be publicly read in the congregation. Finally, however,
owing to the conciliatory firmness of Paphnutius, the great body of the monks was won
over to a sounder and less materia</p>
<p>These are all the details that can be gathered from Cassian’s writings of his stay in Scete,
further than which he does not appear to have penetrated, as, when he speaks of the Thebaid
and the monasteries there, it is only from hearsay and not from personal knowledge, although
his original intention had certainly been to visit this district among others.61</p>
<p>In considering the date of Cassian’s visit to Egypt there are various indications to guide
us. In Conference XVIII. c. xiv., S. Athanasius is spoken of by Abbot Piamun as “of blessed
memory;” and the language used of the Emperor Valens in c. vii. is such as to imply that he
was already dead. The former died in 373, and the latter in 378. Again, in Conference XXIV.

c. xxvi. Abbot Abraham is made to speak of John of Lycopolis as so famous that he was
consulted by the very lords of creation, who sought his advice, and entrusted to his prayers
and merits the crown of their empire and the fortunes of war. These expressions evidently
allude to John’s announcement to Theodosius of his victory over Maxentius in 388, and his
success against Eugenius in 395.62 If they stood alone, we could scarcely rely on these indications
of date with any great confidence because the Conferences were not written till many
years later, and it is impossible to determine with certainty how far they really represent the
discourses actually spoken by the Egyptian Fathers, or how far they are the ideal compositions
of Cassian himself. But, as we have seen, it is certain that Cassian was actually in Egypt at
the time of the Anthropomorphite controversy raised by the letters of Theophilus in 399;
and, as the other notices of events previously mentioned coincide very fairly with this, we
cannot be far wrong in placing the two visits to Egypt between 380 and 400. About the lastnamed
date Cassian must have finally left the country; and we next hear of him in Constantinople,
where he was ordained deacon by S. Chrysostom,63 and, together with his friend
Germanus, put in charge of the treasury, the only part of the Cathedral which escaped the
flames in the terrible conflagration of 404. Thus Cassian was a witness of all the troublous
scenes which attended the persecution of S. Chrysostom, whose side he warmly espoused
in the controversy which rent the East asunder. And when the Saint was violently deposed
and removed from Constantinople, the two friends—Germanus, who was by this time raised
to the priesthood, and Cassian, who was still in deacon’s orders—were chosen as the bearers
of a letter to Pope Innocent I. from the clergy who adhered to Chrysostom, detailing the
scandalous scenes that had taken place, and the trials to which they had been exposed.64 Of
the length of Cassian’s stay in Rome we have no information, but it is likely that it was of
some considerable duration; and it may have been at this time that he was ordained priest
by Innocent. Possibly, also, it was now that he made the acquaintance of one who was then
quite young, but was destined afterwards to become famous as Pope Leo the Great; for some
years afterwards (a.d. 430) it was at the request of Leo, then Archdeacon of Rome, that
Cassian wrote his work on the Incarnation against Nestorius. Leaving Rome, Cassian is next
found in Gaul,65 which (if we are right in the supposition that it was his birthplace) he must
have quitted when scarcely more than a child. When he left it monasticism was a thing almost
if not quite unknown there, but during his absence in the East a few monasteries had been

founded in the district of the Loire by S. Martin and S. Hilary of Poictiers. Ligugé was
founded shortly after 360, and Marmoutier rather later, after 371; and about the time of his
return similar institutions were beginning to spring up in Provence. In 410 S. Honoratus
founded the monastery which will ever be associated with his name, in the island of Lérins,
and, in the eloquent words of the historian of the monks of the West, “opened the arms of
his love to the sons of all countries who desired to love Christ. A multitude of disciples of
all nations joined him. The West could no longer envy the East; and shortly that retreat,
destined in the intentions of its founder to renew upon the coasts of Provence the austerities
of the Thebaid, became a celebrated school of theology and Christian philosophy, a citadel
inaccessible to the waves of barbarian invasion, an asylum for literature and science, which
had fled from Italy invaded by the Goths;—in short, a nursery of bishops and saints, who
were destined to spread over the whole of Gaul the knowledge of the gospel and the glory
of Lérins.”66</p>
<p>It must have been about the same time—a little earlier or a little later—that Cassian
settled at Marseilles; and there, “in the midst of those great forests which had supplied the
Phoenician navy, which in the time of Cæsar reached as far as the sea-coast, and the mysterious
obscurity of which had so terrified the Roman soldiers that the conqueror, to embolden
them, had himself taken an axe and struck down an old oak,”67 two monasteries were now
established,—one for men, built it is said over the tomb of S. Victor, a martyr in the persecution
of Diocletian,68 and the other for women. Cassian’s long residence in the East and
his intimate knowledge of the monastic system in vogue in Egypt made him at once looked
up to as an authority, and practically as the head of the movement which was so rapidly
taking root in Provence; and, although his fame has been overshadowed by that of the
greatest of Western monks, S. Benedict of Nursia, yet his is really the credit of being, not
indeed the actual founder, but the first organizer and systematizer, of Western monachism:
and it is hoped that the copious illustrations from the Benedictine rule given in the notes
to the first four books of the Institutes will serve to show how much the founder of the
greatest order in the West was really indebted to his less-known predecessor. “He brought
to bear upon the organization of Gallic monasteries lessons learnt in the East. Although S.
Martin and others were before him, yet his life must be regarded as a new departure for
monasticism in the land. The religious communities of S. Martin and S. Victricius in the

centre of France were doubtless rudimentary and half-developed in discipline when compared
with that established by Cassian at Marseilles, and with the many others which speedily
arose modelled upon his elaborate rules.”69 The high estimation in which his work was held
throughout the Middle Ages is shown not only by the immense number of mss. of the Institutes
and Conferences which still remain scattered throughout the libraries of Europe, but
also by the recommendation of them by Cassiodorus, and by S. Benedict himself, who enjoins
that the Conferences should be read daily by the monks of his order.</p>
<p>At Marseilles, then, Cassian settled; and here it was that he wrote his three great
works,—the Institutes, the Conferences, and On the Incarnation against Nestorius; the two
former being written for the express purpose of encouraging and developing the monastic
life. Of these the Institutes was the earliest, being composed in “twelve books on the institutes
of the monasteries and the remedies for the eight principal faults,”70 at the request of Castor,
Bishop of Apta Julia, some forty miles due north of Marseilles, who was desirous of introducing
the monastic life into his diocese, where it was still a thing unknown.71 As Castor died
in 426,72 and the work is dedicated to him, it must have been written some time between
the years 419 and 426. When it was first undertaken Cassian’s design already was to follow
it up by a second treatise containing the Conferences of the Fathers, to which he several
times alludes in the Institutes as a forthcoming work,73 and which, like the companion
volume, was undertaken at Castor’s instigation. But, before even the first part of it was ready
for publication, the Bishop of Apta was dead; and thus, to Cassian’s sorrow, he was unable
to dedicate it to him, as he had hoped to do. He therefore dedicated Conferences I.–X. (the
first portion of the work) to Leontius, Bishop (probably) of Fréjus, and Helladius, who is
termed “frater” in the Preface to this work, though, as we see from the Preface to Conference
XVIII., he was afterwards raised to the episcopate.74</p>
<p>This portion of Cassian’s work must have been completed shortly after the death of
Castor in 426. It was speedily followed by Part II., containing Conferences XI. to XVII. This
is dedicated to Honoratus and Eucherius, who are styled “fratres.” Eucherius did not become
Bishop of Lyons till 434; but, as Honoratus was raised to the see of Arles in 426, the volume

must have been published not later than that year, or he would have been termed “Episcopus,”
as he is in the Preface to Conference XVIII., instead of “frater.”</p>
<p>The third and last part of the work, containing Conferences XVIII. to XXIV., is dedicated
to Jovinian, Minervius, Leontius, and Theodore, who are collectively styled “fratres.” Leontius
must, therefore, be a different person from the bishop to whom Conferences I.–X. were
dedicated; and nothing further is known of him, or of Minervius and Jovinian. Theodore
was afterwards raised to the Episcopate, and succeeded Leontius in the see of Fréjus in 432.
This third part of Cassian’s work was ready before the death of Honoratus, Bishop of Arles,
who is spoken of in the Preface as if still living; and, therefore, its publication cannot be later
than 428, as Honoratus died in January, 429.</p>
<p>Thus the whole work was completed between the years 426 and 428; and now Cassian,
who was growing old, was desirous of rest, feeling as if his life’s work was nearly over.75 But
the repose which he sought was not to be granted to him, for the remaining years of his life
were troubled by two controversies,—the Nestorian, and the Pelagian,—or, rather, its offshoot,
the Semi-Pelagian. Into the history of the former of these there is no need to enter
here in detail. It broke out at Constantinople, where Nestorius had become bishop in succession
to Sisinnius, in 428. The immediate occasion which gave rise to the controversy was
a sermon by Anastasius, the Bishop’s chaplain, in which he inveighed against the title
Theotocos, as given to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This at once created a great sensation, as
Nestorius warmly supported his chaplain, and proceeded to develop the heresy connected
with his name, in a course of sermons. News of the controversy was brought to Egypt, and
Cyril of Alexandria at once entered into the fray. After some correspondence between the
two bishops, both parties endeavoured to gain the adherence of the Church of Rome early
in the year 430; and now it was that Cassian became mixed up with the dispute. Greek
learning was evidently at a low ebb in the Roman Church at this time;76 and it was, perhaps,
partly owing to Cassian’s familiar acquaintance with this language, as well as owing to his
connexion with Constantinople, where the trouble had now arisen, that Celestine’s Archdeacon
Leo turned to him at this crisis for help. Anyhow, whatever was the reason, an
earnest appeal from Rome reached him, begging him to write a refutation of the new heresy.
After some hesitation he consented, and the result of his labours is seen in the seven books
on the Incarnation against Nestorius. The work was evidently done in haste, and published
in 430, before the Council of Ephesus (for Cassian speaks of Nestorius throughout as still
Bishop of Constantinople), and, judging from the way in which Augustine is spoken of in
VII. xxvii., before the death of that Father, which took place in August, 430. A great part of

<pb n="386"/>
the work is occupied with Scripture proof of our Lord’s Divinity and unity of Person; but,
taken as a whole, the treatise is distinctly of less value than Cassian’s earlier writings, and
betrays the haste in which it was composed by the occasional use of inaccurate language on
the subject of the Incarnation, and of terms and phrases which the mature judgment of the
Church has rejected. But the writer’s keen penetration is seen by the quickness with which
he connects the new heresy with the teaching of Pelagius, the connecting link between the
two being found in the errors of Leporius of Trêves, who, in propagating Pelagian views of
man’s sufficiency and strength, had applied them to the case of our Lord, not shrinking
from the conclusion that He was a mere man who had used his free will so well as to have
lived without sin, and had only been made Christ in virtue of His baptism, whereby the
Divine and human were associated in such manner that virtually there were two Christs.77
The connexion between Nestorianism and Pelagianism has often been noticed by later
writers, but to Cassian belongs the credit of having been the first to point it out. Of the impression
produced by his book we have no record. He appears to have taken no further part
in the controversy, which, indeed, must have been to him an episode, coming in the midst
of that other controversy with which his name is inseparably associated; viz., that on Semi-
Pelagianism, on which something must now be said.</p>
<p>The controversy arose in the following way. During the struggle with Pelagianism
between the years 410 and 420, Augustine’s views on the absolute need of grace were
gradually hardening into a theory that grace was irresistible and therefore indefectible.
“Intent above all things on magnifying the Divine Sovereignty, he practically forgot the
complexity of the problem in hand and failed to do justice to the human element in the
mysterious process of man’s salvation.”78 The view of an absolute predestination irrespective
of foreseen character, and of the irresistible and indefectible character of grace, was put
forward by him, in a letter to a Roman priest, Sixtus, in the year 418.79 Some years afterwards
this letter fell into the hands of the monks of Adrumetum, some of whom were puzzled by
its teaching; and, in order to allay the disputes among them, the matter was referred to Augustine
himself. Thinking that the monks had misunderstood his teaching, he not only explained
the letter but also wrote a fresh treatise,—“De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio” (426); and,
when that failed to satisfy the malcontents, he followed it up with his work “De Correptione
et Gratia” (426), which, so far as the monks of Adrumetum were concerned, seems to have
ended the controversy. Elsewhere, however, hesitation was felt in going the full length of
Augustine’s teaching; and, in the South of Gaul especially, many were seriously disturbed

<pb n="387"/>
at the turn which the controversy had lately taken, and were prepared to reject Augustine’s
teaching, as not merely novel, but also practically dangerous. “They said, in effect,” to quote
Canon Bright’s lucid summary of their position, “to treat predestination as irrespective of
foreseen conduct, and to limit the Divine good-will to a fixed number of persons thus selected,
who, as such, are assured of perseverance, is not only to depart from the older theology, and
from the earlier teaching of the Bishop of Hippo himself, but to cut at the root of religious
effort, and to encourage either negligence or despair. They insisted that whatever theories
might be devised concerning this mystery, which was not a fit subject for popular discussion,
the door of salvation should be regarded as open to all, because the Saviour ‘died for all.’ To
explain away the Scriptural assurance was, they maintained, to falsify the Divine promise
and to nullify human responsibility. They believed in the doctrine of the Fall; they acknowledged
the necessity of real grace in order to man’s restoration; they even admitted that this
grace must be ‘prevenient’ to such acts of will as resulted in Christian good works: but some
of them thought—and herein consisted the error called Semi-Pelagian—that nature, unaided,
could take the first step towards its recovery, by desiring to be healed through faith in Christ.
If it could not,—if the very beginning of all good were strictly a Divine act,—exhortations
seemed to them to be idle, and censure unjust, in regard to those on whom no such act had
been wrought, and who, therefore, until it should be wrought, were helpless, and so far
guiltless, in the matter.”80 Of the party which took up this position Cassian was the recognized
head. True, he did not directly enter into the controversy himself, nor is he the author of
any polemical works upon the subject; but it is impossible to doubt that the thirteenth
Conference, containing the teaching of Abbot Chæremon on the Protection of God, was
intended to meet what he evidently regarded as a serious error; viz., the implicit denial by
the Augustinians of the need of effort on man’s part.</p>
<p>Augustine was informed of the teaching of the School of Marseilles, as it was called, by
one Hilary (a layman, not to be confounded with his namesake, the Bishop of Arles), who
wrote to him two letters, of which the former is lost. The latter is still existing, and contains
a careful account of what was maintained at Marseilles. Towards the close of it Hilary says
that, as he was pressed for time, he had prevailed upon a friend to write as well, and would
attach his letter to his own. This friend was Prosper of Aquitaine, also a layman and an ardent
Augustinian, whose epistle has been preserved as well as Hilary’s.81 From these letters, and
from the works which Augustine wrote in reply, we learn that the “Massilians” had been
first disturbed by some of Augustine’s earlier writings, as the Epistle to Paulinus; and that
their distrust of his teaching on the subjects of Grace, Predestination, and Freewill had been
increased by the receipt of his work “De Correptione et Gratia,” although in other matters

they agreed with him entirely, and were great admirers of his.82 Personally, they are spoken
of with great respect as men of no common virtue, and of wide influence; and, though
Cassian’s name is never mentioned in the correspondence, yet it is easy to read between the
lines and see that he is referred to.83</p>
<p>Augustine replied to his correspondents by writing what proved to be almost his latest
works,—the treatises “De Prædestinatione Sanctorum” and “De dono Perseverantiæ.” In
these volumes Augustine, while freely acknowledging the great difference between his opponents
and the Pelagians, yet maintained as strongly as ever his own position, and “did
not abate an iota of the contention that election and rejection were arbitrary, and that salvation
was not really within the reach of all Christians.”84 Thus the books naturally failed to
satisfy the recalcitrant party, or to convince those who thought that the denial of the freedom
of the will tended to destroy man’s responsibility. Prosper, however, was delighted with the
treatises, and proceeded to follow them up with a work of his own, a poem of a thousand
lines, “De Ingratis,” by which he designates the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians, whose opinions
he speaks of as spreading with alarming rapidity. The date of this publication was probably
the early part of 430. It was certainly written before the death of Augustine, which took place
on August 28 of the same year. The removal from this life of the great champion of Grace
did not bring to an end the controversy to which his writings had given birth. The school
of Marseilles continued to propagate its views with unabated vigour, in spite of the protests
of Prosper and Hilary, who finally took the important step of appealing to Pope Celestine,
from whom they succeeded in obtaining a letter addressed to the Gallican Bishops, Venerius
of Marseilles, Leontius of Fréjus, Marinus, Auxonius, Arcadius, Filtanius, and the rest.85
Celestine speaks strongly of their negligence in not having suppressed what he regarded as
a public scandal, and says that “priests ought not to teach so as to invade the episcopal
prerogative,” an expression in which we may well see an allusion to Cassian, the leading
presbyter, of the diocese of Marseilles, whose Bishop is named first in the opening salutation;
<note type="footnote">82 Cassian himself quotes Augustine as an authority for the Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation in his work
against Nestorius, VII. xxvii. But it is remarkable that, whereas on all the other authorities quoted (Hilary,
Ambrose, Jerome, Rufinus, Gregory, Nazianzen, Athanasius, and Chrysostom) a high encomium is passed,
Augustine alone is alluded to with no words of praise, being simply spoken of as priest (sacerdos) of Hippo Regius.

and the letter concludes with some words of eulogium on Augustine “of holy memory.”
Never, perhaps, was Gallican independence shown in a more striking manner than in the
sturdy way in which the Massilians clung to their views in spite of the authority of the Pope
now brought to bear upon them. Prosper and Hilary on their return found the obnoxious
teaching daily spreading, so that the former of them finally determined to put down, if
possible, the upholders of the objectionable tenets by a direct criticism of Cassian’s Conferences.
This was the origin of Prosper’s work “Contra Collatorem,” against the author of the
Conferences, a treatise of considerable power and force, although not scrupulously fair.86
The respect in which Cassian was held is strikingly shown by the fact that his antagonist
never once names him directly, but merely speaks of him as a man of priestly rank who
surpassed all his companions in power of arguing. The work consists of an examination of
the thirteenth Conference, that of Abbot Chæremon, on the Protection of God, from which
Prosper extracts twelve propositions, the first of which he says is orthodox while all the
others are erroneous.87 He concludes by warning his antagonist of the danger of Pelagianism,
and expresses a hope that his doctrine may be condemned by Pope Sixtus as it had been by
<note type="footnote">86 The treatise is given in Gazet’s edition of Cassian.</note>
<note type="footnote">87 The propositions extracted by Prosper are the following:— (1) That the initiative not only of our actions
but also of our good thoughts comes from God, who inspires us with a good will to begin with, and supplies us
with the opportunity of carrying out what we rightly desire; for “every good gift and every perfect gift cometh
down from above, from the Father of light,” who both begins what is good, and continues it and completes it
in us. c. iii. This proposition Prosper allows to be catholic and orthodox. (2) The Divine protection is inseparably
present with us, and so great is the kindness of the Creator towards His creatures that His Providence not only
accompanies it, but even constantly precedes it, as the prophet experienced and plainly confessed, saying, “My
God will prevent me with His mercy.” And when He sees in us some beginnings of a good will, He at once enlightens
and strengthens it, and urges it on towards salvation, increasing that which He Himself implanted, or
which He sees to have arisen from our own efforts. c. viii. (3) Only in all these there is a declaration of the grace
of God and the freedom of the will, because even of his own motion a man can be led to the quest of virtue, but
always stands in need of the help of the Lord. For neither does any one enjoy good health whenever he likes,
nor is he of his own will and pleasure set free from disease and sickness. c. ix. (4) That it may be still clearer that,
through the excellence of nature, which is granted by the goodness of the Creator, sometimes the first beginnings
of a good will arise, which, however, cannot attain to the complete performance of what is good unless they are
guided by the Lord, the apostle bears witness, and says, “For to will is present with me, but to perform what is
good I find not.” Ib. (5) And so these are somehow mixed up and indiscriminately confused, so that, among
many persons, the question which depends upon the other is involved in great difficulty; i.e., does God have
compassion upon us because we have shown the beginning of a good will, or does the beginning of a good will
follow because God has had compassion upon us? For many, believing each of these alternatives, and asserting</note>

Celestine and his predecessors. The last statement fixes the date of the book as not earlier
than 432; for Celestine only died in April in that year.</p>
<note type="footnote">them more broadly than is right, are entangled in all kinds of opposite errors. For if we say that the beginning
of free will is in our own power, what about Paul the persecutor, what about Matthew the publican, of whom
the one was drawn to salvation while eager for bloodshed and the punishment of the innocent, the other while
eager for violence and rapine? But, if we say that the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration
of the grace of God, what about the faith of Zacchæus, or what are we to say of the goodness of the thief on the
cross, who by their own desires brought violence to bear on the kingdom of heaven, and prevented the special
leadings of their vocation? c. xi. (6) These two, then, viz., the grace of God and Free-will, seem opposed to each
other, but really are in harmony; and we gather from natural piety that we ought to have both alike, lest if we
withdraw one of them from men we should seem to have broken the rule of the Church’s faith. Ib. (7) Adam,
therefore, after the fall, conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge
of good which he already possessed. c. xii. (8) Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the
saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature. Ib. (9) It
cannot be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness implanted by the kindness of the Creator,
but unless they are quickened by the assistance of God they cannot attain an increase of perfection. Ib. (10) And
for this, too, we read that in the case of Job, his well-tried athlete, when the Devil had challenged him to single
combat, the Divine righteousness had made provision. For, if he had advanced against his foe not with his own
strength, but solely with the protection of God’s grace, and, supported only by Divine aid, without any virtue
of patience on his own part, had borne that manifold weight of temptations and losses, contrived with all the
cruelty of his foe, might not the Devil have repeated with some justice that slanderous speech which he had
previously uttered, “Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast Thou not hedged him in, and all his substance round
about? But take away thine hand,” i.e., allow him to fight with me in his own strength, “and he will curse Thee
to Thy face.” But, as after the struggle the slanderous foe dared not give vent to any such murmur as this, he
admitted that he was vanquished by his (i.e., Job’s) strength, and not by that of God: although, too, we must not
hold that the grace of God was altogether wanting to him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in
proportion to that which he had of resisting. c. xiv. (11) The Lord marvelled at him (viz., the centurion), and
praised him, and put him before all those of the people of Israel who had believed, saying, “Verily, I say unto
you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.” For there would have been no ground for praise or merit if Christ
had only preferred in him what He Himself had given. Ib. (12) Hence it comes that in our prayers we proclaim
God as not only our protector and Saviour, but actually as our helper and sponsor. For whereas He first calls us
to Him, and while we are still ignorant and unwilling draws us towards salvation, He is our protector and Saviour;
but whereas, when we are already striving, He is wont to bring us help, and to receive and defend those who fly
to Him for refuge, He is deemed our sponsor and refuge. c. xvii. This last extract is in itself perfectly orthodox,
and might be thought merely to express the distinction between “preventing” and “co-operating” grace; but the
context makes it clear that Cassian means that in some cases grace “prevents,” while in others the initial movement
towards salvation comes from man, and grace is only needed to “co-operate.”</note>

<pb n="391"/>
<p>Cassian was evidently still living when this attack upon him was made; but, so far as we
know, he made no reply to it. Its publication is the last event in his life of which we have
any knowledge. He probably died shortly afterwards, as the expression used by Gennadius
in speaking of his work against Nestorius would seem to imply that it preceded his death
by no long interval; for he says that with this he brought to a close his literary labours and
his life in the reign of Theodosius and Valentinian.88</p>
<p>The controversy on Grace and Freewill lingered on for nearly a century longer, and was
only finally disposed of by the wise moderation shown by Cæsarius of Arles and those who
acted with him at the Council of Orange (Arausio), in the year 529.89</p>
<p>While it cannot be denied that the teaching of Cassian and his school in denying the
necessity of initial and prevenient grace is erroneous and opens a door at which Pelagianism
may easily creep in, yet it was an honest attempt to vindicate human responsibility; and it
must be frankly admitted that the teaching of Augustine was one-sided and required to be
balanced: nor would the question have ever been brought into prominence had it not been
for the hard and rigorous way in which the doctrine of Predestination was taught, and the
denial that the possibility of salvation lay within the reach of all men. While, then, it is
granted that a verdict of guilty must be returned on the charge of Semi-Pelagianism in
Cassian’s case, we are surely justified in claiming that a recommendation to mercy be attached
to it on the plea of extenuating circumstances. Since his death Cassian has ever occupied a
somewhat ambiguous position in the mind of the Church. Never formally canonized, his
name is not found in the Calendars of the West; nor is he honoured with the title of “Saint.”
He is, however, generally spoken of as “the blessed Cassian,” holding in this respect the
same position as Theodoret, of whom Dr. Newman says that, though he “has the responsibility
of acts which have forfeited to him that oecumenical dignity,” yet he is “not without
honorary title in the Church’s hagiology; for he has ever been known as the ‘blessed
Theodoret.’”90 In the East Cassian’s position is somewhat better. He is there regarded as a
saint, and may possibly be intended by the Cassian who is commemorated on February
29.91 It is only natural that this difference should be made, for the Eastern Church has always

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The History of Cassian’s Writings, MSS., and Editions.</head>
<p>The literary history of Cassian’s works is not without an interest of its own. We have
already seen the estimation in which they were held in spite of their Semi-Pelagian doctrines.
These were naturally accounted a blemish, and it is not surprising that those who most admired
their excellences were anxious to avoid propagating their errors. Hence they were
often “expurgated,” and in many mss. the text has suffered considerably from the changes
made by copyists in the interests of orthodoxy. As early as the fifth century we find two re-
vised versions of portions of his works existing. His friend Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons, was
the author of an epitome of the Institutes, which still exists;92 and although this was compiled
for convenience’ sake because of the length of the original work, rather than from any suspicion
of his teaching, the case is different with a recension made for use in Africa by Victor,
Bishop of Martyrites. This is no longer extant, but Cassiodorus distinctly tells us that it was
made in the interests of orthodoxy by means of expurgation as well as addition of what was
wanting.93 Yet another epitome of three of the Conferences (I., II., VII.) was made at some
time before the tenth century. It was translated into Greek, and known to Photius, who
speaks94 of three works of Cassian as translated into Greek: viz., (1) an Epitome of the Institutes,
Books I.–IV.; (2) Epitome of the Institutes, Books V.–XII.; and (3) one of the Conferences
I., II., VII.</p>
<p>Thus in very early days the fashion was set of expurgating and emending the writings
of Cassian; and Leuwis de Ryckel, better known as Dionysius Carthusianus, might have
quoted several precedents for his method of dealing with the text. This famous divine,—the
doctor exstaticus of the fifteenth century,—shocked as others had been before him at the
Semi-Pelagianism of the Conferences, and yet sensible of their real value in spite of sundry
blemishes, took in hand to correct them, and gave to the world a free paraphrase both of
the Institutes and of the Conferences, in a somewhat simple style and one more easy to be
understood than the original. The greatest alterations, as might be expected, are visible in
the thirteenth Conference; as Dionysius, in his endeavour to make Cassian orthodox, omits
<note type="footnote">92 Gennadius, Catal. lxiv. In the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, art. Eucherius, this is said to be lost. But
see Migne, Vol. L. p. 867 sq.; and cf. Petschenig’s Introduction to Cassian, p. xcvi.</note>

<pb n="394"/>
all that savours of Semi-Pelagianism; and from c. viii. onward there are large omissions and
various suggestive alterations in the text.95</p>
<p>Incidental mention has been already made of the esteem in which the Institutes and
Conferences were held by S. Benedict and Cassiodorus. In the Rule of the former (c. xlii.)
it is ordered that after supper the brethren should assemble together, and one of them should
read the Conferences, or Lives of the Fathers, or any other book calculated to edify. And
again, in the closing chapter of the same rule, the study of them is recommended to those
who are desirous of perfection; for “what are the Conferences of the Fathers, the Institutes,
and the lives of them; what, too, the Rule of our holy father, S. Basil, but examples of virtuous
and obedient monks, and helps to the attainment of virtue?” Equally strong is the recommendation
of Cassiodorus: “Sedulo legite, frequenter audite;” but at the same time he reminds
his readers that Cassian was very properly censured by Prosper for his teaching on Freewill,
and that, therefore, he is to be read with caution whenever he touches on this subject. With
testimonies such as these to their value it is no wonder that copies were rapidly multiplied,
so that scarcely a monastery was without a copy of some part of them; and existing mss. of
the Institutes and Conferences are very numerous. But none of the oldest mss. contain the
complete work. The institutes were often regarded as made up of two separate treatises,—(1)
the Institutes of the Coenobia, containing Books I.–IV., and (2) On the Eight Principal Faults,
comprising Books V.–XII. So, too, with the Conferences, and their three divisions: they are
often found separately in different mss.</p>
<p>The mss. being so numerous, it was found impossible to collate them all for the latest
edition of Cassian’s works; viz., that edited by Petschenig for the Vienna Corpus Scriptorum
Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum. The Editor therefore confined his attention to a limited number,
of which the following is the list.</p>
<p>I. The Institutes.</p>
<p>1. Codex Casinensis Rescriptus, 295. A Palimpsest with the Epistles of S. Jerome written
over Cassian’s work. The date of this ms. is the seventh or eighth century, and it contains
portions only of the Institutes, nothing remaining of Books I.–IV., or of VIII. and IX.</p>
<p>2. Codex Majoris Seminarii OEduensis (Autun), 24. Seventh century, containing portions
of Books V.–XII.</p>
<p>3. Caroliruhensis, 87. Eighth century, containing all twelve books.</p>
<note type="footnote">95 The “Doctrina Catholica Beati Dionysii Richelii Carthusiani precedenti Collationi ab ipso substituta,”
given in Gazet’s edition, and hence in Migne’s, as c. xix., is only the latter part of the paraphrase of this Conference,
beginning in c. viii., with the words, “Adest igitur inseparabiliter nobis,” etc. The paraphrase may be found in
Vol. III. of the edition of the works of Dionysius, published at Cologne in 1540. Of this there is a copy in the
British Museum which was formerly in the possession of Archbishop Cranmer, and which still contains his
autograph.</note>

<p>Passing now from the Institutes and Conferences to the work “On the Incarnation
against Nestorius,” we are no longer encumbered by the number of mss. There was not the
same reason for the multiplication of copies of it as there was in the case of those writings
which bore on the monastic life. It appears never to have obtained any special popularity,
and, so far as is known, only seven mss. of it are still in existence. The following are those
of which Petschenig made use for his edition:—</p>

<pb n="396"/>
<p>1. Codex Bibl. Armentarii Parisiensis (Bibl. de l’Arsenal), 483. Cent. 10–11.</p>
<p>2. British Museum addl., 16414. Cent. 11–12.</p>
<p>3. Parisinus, Bibl. Nat., 14860. Thirteenth century.</p>
<p>4. Bibl. Coloniensium Augustinianorum. This ms. is now lost, but was used by Cuyck
for his edition of Cassian, and from this Petschenig is able to give selected readings.</p>
<p>The remaining mss. known to exist, but not used by Petschenig, are these:—</p>
<p>1. Matritensis, Bibl. Nat., Q. 106. Twelfth century.</p>
<p>2. Laurentianus (Laurentian Library at Florence), XXVI., 13. Fifteenth century.</p>
<p>3. Bibl. Leop. Medici Foesulanæ (also at Florence), 48. Fifteenth century.</p>
<p>4. Parisinus, 2143. Fourteenth century.96</p>
<p>It only remains to give some account of the various editions of the printed text.</p>
<p>It has generally been stated that the earliest edition of the Institutes was that printed at
Venice in 1481, of which only a single copy is known to exist, viz., in the Laurentian Library
at Florence; and that the first edition which included the Conferences was that published
by Amerbach at Basle in 1485. This statement, however, appears to be erroneous, as there
still exists in the British Museum a single copy of a very early black-letter edition of the
Conferences. The title-page is gone, and there is no colophon; and, therefore, the date cannot
be given with certainty, but the work is assigned by the authorities of the Museum to the
year 1476, and is thought to have proceeded from the press of the Brothers of the Common
life at Brussels. The first page of the work begins as follows: “Ut Valeas cor in opere isto citius
invenire qd requiris hæc tibi concapitulatio breviter demostrabit quis unde in singulis
collationibus disputaverit.” Then follows a list of the twenty-four Conferences with their
authors, and the page ends with these words: “Prologus cassiani sup. collationes patru ad
leontiu et elladiu epos. In nomine Domini ihu cristi dei nostri feliciter.”</p>
<p>This, then, in all probability was the first edition of the Latin text of the Conferences.
But it is a curious fact that at a still earlier date a free German translation or paraphrase of
them had already been published. This, like the work just mentioned, has been overlooked
by all the editors of Cassian, but two copies of it still remain in the British Museum, beginning
as follow: “Hic liber a quodam egregio sacrarum literarum professore magistro Johane Nide
ordis pdicatorum fratre de latino in vulgarem Nuremberge translatus est.” The colophon
in one copy gives the date as 1472, and the place at which it was printed as Augsberg. The
other copy has no date but is assigned by the authorities of the Museum to a still earlier
year; viz., 1470.</p>
<p>The Basle edition of 1485 was reprinted at the press of Amerbach in 1497; and at Venice
there was issued a second edition of the Institutes, to which the Conferences were added,
<note type="footnote">96 On all these mss. see Petschenig’s introduction, Cassian, Vol. I. pp. xiv.–lxxviii.</note>

<pb n="397"/>
in 1491.97 Subsequent early editions are those of Lyons, in 1516 and 1525, and Bologna
1521. But not till 1534 were the seven books on the Incarnation against Nestorius published.
They appear for the first time in the edition which was issued in this year from the press of
Cratander at Basle.</p>
<p>Far superior to all these early editions, which were very faulty, was that published by
Christopher Plantin at Antwerp in 1578, edited by H. Cuyck, Professor at Louvain and afterward
Bishop of Ruremonde. It was undertaken at the suggestion of Cardinal Carafa, and
its full title is the following: “D. Ioannis Cassiani Eremitæ Monasticarum Institutionum

<p>Cuyck’s work was supplemented, also at Carafa’s desire, by Petrus Ciacconius, a priest
of Toledo, who died in 1581, before it was ready for the press. A new edition was, however,
published at Rome in 1588 “ex Edibus Dominicæ Basæ,” in which the notes and emendations
of Ciacconius were embodied. Unfortunately this edition does not contain the books on the
Incarnation. Its full title is as follows: “Ioannis Cassiani Eremitæ de institutis renuntiantium
Libri XII. Collationes Sanctorum Patrum XXIIII. Adiectæ sunt quarundam obscurarum
dictionum interpretationes ordine alphabeti dispositæ: et observationes in loca ambigua et
minus tuta. Præterea Indices duo testimoniorum sacræ Scripturæ, quæ a Cassiano vel explicantur,
vel aliter quam vulgata editio habet, citantur: ac postremo verum memorabilium
Index copiosissimus. Accedit Regula S. Pachomii, quæ a S. Hieronymo in Latinum sermonem
conversa est: Omnia multo quam antehac, auxilio vetustissimorum codicum, emendatiora,
et ad suam integritatem restituta.” This edition, as well as the previous one, contained a
dissertation on a number of passages (some thirty in all) of doubtful orthodoxy, in order to
put the reader on his guard against following Cassian in his errors.</p>
<p>In 1616 there was published at Douay in two volumes what has remained until the
present day the standard edition of Cassian’s works, prepared with loving care by a Benedictine
monk of the Abbey of St. Vaast at Arras, named Gazet. This edition is enriched
throughout with copious annotations, containing an immense amount of illustrative matter;
and besides the text of Cassian’s works it contains several other documents of importance
for a right understanding of them. The full title is this: “Ioannis Cassiani presbyteri, quem

<p>Besides the Institutes, Conferences, and the work on the Incarnation against Nestorius,
these volumes contained the following among other material:—</p>
<p>The Rule of St. Pachomius.</p>
<p>The Catholic doctrine substituted for the latter part of Conference XIII. by Dionysius
Carthusianus.</p>
<p>Prosper “Contra Collatorem.”</p>
<p>This edition has been frequently reprinted,98 some of the later reprints containing still
more illustrative material. It still remains indispensable to the student of Cassian’s works
by reason of the valuable commentary with which it is throughout enriched. But for the
mere text it is now altogether superseded by the fine edition prepared by Petschenig for the
Vienna Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, in two volumes.</p>
<p>Vol. I.—Ioannis Cassiani De Institutis Coenobiorum et de octo Principalium Vitiorum
Remediis Libri XII. De Incarnatione Domini Contra Nestorium Libri VII. recensuit et

1888).</p>
<p>Vol. II.—Ioannis Cassiani Conlationes XXIIII. (Vindobonæ, 1886). Petschenig’s work
is admirably done, and the text of this edition is vastly superior to that of all its predecessors.
In the present translation it has been used throughout the Conferences. The volume containing
the Institutes and the work on the Incarnation unfortunately appeared too late for
the translation to be made from it. It has, however, been carefully compared with the text
of Ciacconius, which Gazet merely repeats,99 and attention is called to the chief variations
in the notes.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of the early German paraphrase or translation, dating
from 1470 or 1472; and the popularity of the Cassian’s works is evinced by the number of
other early translations made into the various languages of Europe. Of these next in order
of time is one in Flemish. In the copy of this in the British Museum the title is wanting, the
book beginning as follows: “Hier beghint der ouder vader collacie. Hi hyetede Ioannes
Cassianus die dese vieretwintich navolgende vad, collacien ghemaect hevet.” The colophon
is this: “Hier eyndet een seer goede en profitelike leeringhe. En is ghenoemt der ouder vaders
collacien. Michiel hiller van Hoochstraten. Tantwerpen 1506. fol.”</p>
<note type="footnote">98 Gazet himself prepared a revised edition, which was brought out after his death, at Arras, in 1628.</note>
<note type="footnote">99 The edition used is that published at Leipsic in 1733. It cannot, however, be recommended, as it is full of
misprints.</note>

<pb n="399"/>
<p>Very little later is the first of several French translations, with the following curious title:
“Les Collacions des sains Peres anciens translateez de Grec en latin. Par Cassiodorus tres
sainct docteur en theologie et translateez de latin en francoys par maistre ieha gosein aussy
docteur en theologie de l’ordre des freres de la Montaigne du carme et imprimees nouvellement
a paris.” No date is given, but the work is assigned by the Museum authorities to the
year 1510.</p>
<p>Later French translations are the following:—</p>
<p>Paris. Chez Charles Savreux. 8° les Conférences de Cassien traduites en françois par De
Saligny. 1663. (This edition altogether omits the thirteenth Conference.)
Paris. Chez Charles Savreux. 8° les Institutions de Cassien traduites en françois par De
Saligny. 1667.</p>
<p>Institutions de Cassien traduites par E. Cartier. Paris, Tours, 1872.
There are also two Italian translations, one as early as 1563 (Opera. Tradotta per B.
Buffi. Venetia. 1563. 4°), and one of the present century,—Volgarizzamento delle collazioni
dei SS. Padri del venerabile G. C. <del>By Bartolommeo da San Concordio?</del> Testo di lingua in
edito <del>edited by T. Bini</del>. Lucca. 1854. 8°.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that England has till now stood almost alone in possessing no translation,
Cassian’s works having never yet appeared in an English press. It is hoped that the version
now offered to the reader may do something to make the works of this interesting and most
instructive writer more widely known than they appear to be at present.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>The history of the Old Testament tells us that the most wise Solomon received from
heaven “wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart even as the
sand that is on the seashore that cannot be counted;”100 so that by the Lord’s testimony we
may say that no one either has arisen in time past equal to him or will arise after him: and
afterward, when wishing to raise that magnificent temple to the Lord, we are told that he
asked the help of a foreigner, the king of Tyre. And when there was sent to him one Hiram,
the son of a widow woman,101 it was by his means and ministration that he executed all the
glorious things which he devised by the suggestion of the Divine wisdom either for the
temple of the Lord or for the sacred vessels. If, then, that power that was higher than all the
kingdoms of the earth, and that noble and illustrious scion of the race of Israel, and that
divinely inspired wisdom which excelled the training and customs of all the Easterns and
Egyptians, by no means disdained the advice of a poor man and a foreigner, rightly also do
you, most blessed Pope102 Castor, taught by these examples, deign to call in me, a worthless
creature though I am, and in every respect as poor as possible, to a share in so great a work.
When you are planning to build a true and reasonable temple for God, not with inanimate
stones but with a congregation of saints, and no temporal or corruptible building, but one
that is eternal and cannot be shaken; and desiring also to consecrate to the Lord most precious
vessels not forged of dumb103 metal, of gold or silver, which a Babylonish monarch may
afterwards take and devote to the pleasures of his concubines and princes,104 but fashioned
of holy souls which shine with the uprightness of innocence, righteousness, and purity, and
bear about Christ abiding in themselves as King;—since, then, you are anxious that the institutions
of the East and especially of Egypt should be established in your province, which
is at present without monasteries,105 although you are yourself perfect in all virtues and
knowledge and so filled with all spiritual riches that not only your talk but even your life
alone is amply sufficient for an example to those who are seeking perfection,—yet you ask
me, not knowing what to say, and feeble in speech and knowledge, to contribute something
from the scanty supply of my thoughts toward the satisfaction of your desire; and you charge
me to declare, although with inexpert pen, the customs of the monasteries which we have

seen observed throughout Egypt and Palestine, as they were there delivered to us by the
Fathers; not looking for graceful speech, in which you yourself are especially skilled, but
wanting the simple life of holy men to be told in simple language to the brethren in your
new monastery. But in proportion as a dutiful desire of granting your request urges me to
obey, so do manifold difficulties and embarrassments deter me when wishing to comply.
First, because my merits are not so proportioned to my age as for me to trust that I can
worthily comprehend with my mind and heart matters so difficult, so obscure, and so sacred.
Secondly, because that which we either tried to do or learnt or saw when from our earliest
youth we lived among them and were urged on by their daily exhortations and examples,—
this we can scarcely retain in its entirety when we have been for so many years
withdrawn from intercourse with them and from following their mode of life; especially as
the method of these things cannot possibly be taught or understood or kept in the memory
by idle meditation and verbal teaching, for it depends entirely upon experience and practice.
And, as these things cannot be taught save by one who has had experience of them, so they
cannot even be learnt or understood except by one who has tried with equal care and pains
to grasp them; while, unless they are often discussed and well worn in frequent conferences
with spiritual men, they quickly fade away through carelessness of mind. Thirdly, because
a discourse that is lacking in skill cannot properly expound those things which we can recall
to mind, not as the things themselves deserve, but as our condition allows us. To this it must
be added that on this very subject men who were noble in life and eminent for speech and
knowledge have already put forth several little books, I mean Basil and Jerome, and some
others, the former of whom, when the brethren asked about various rules and questions,
replied in language that was not only eloquent but rich in testimonies from Holy Scripture;
while the latter not only published works that were the offspring of his own genius, but also
translated into Latin works that had been written in Greek.106 And, after such abundant
streams of eloquence, I might not unfairly be accused of presumption for trying to produce
this feeble rill, were it not that the confidence of your holiness encouraged me, and the assurance
that these trifles would be acceptable to you, whatever they were like, and that you
would send them to the congregation of the brethren dwelling in your newly founded
monastery. And if by chance I have said anything without sufficient care, may they kindly
overlook it and endure it with a somewhat indulgent pardon, asking rather for trustworthiness
of speech than for grace of style on my part. Wherefore, most blessed Pope, remarkable example
of religion and humility, encouraged by your prayers, I will to the best of my ability
approach the work which you enjoin; and those masters which were altogether left untouched
<note type="footnote">106 The reference is to Basil’s ὅροι κατὰ πλάτος (the greater monastic rules), and ὅροι κατὰ ἐπιτομήν (the

by those who preceded us, since they endeavoured to describe what they had heard rather
than what they had experienced, these things I will tell as to an inexperienced monastery,
and to men who are indeed107 athirst. Nor certainly shall I try to weave a tale of God’s
miracles and signs, although we have not only heard of many such among our elders, and
those past belief, but have also seen them fulfilled under our very eyes; yet, leaving out all
these things which minister to the reader nothing but astonishment and no instruction in
the perfect life, I shall try, so far as I can, with the help of God, faithfully to explain only
their institutions and the rules of their monasteries, and especially the origin and causes of
the principal faults, of which they reckon eight, and the remedies for them according to
their traditions,—since my purpose is to say a few words not about God’s miracles, but
about the way to improve our character, and the attainment of the perfect life, in accordance
with that which we received from our elders. In this, too, I will try to satisfy your directions,
so that, if I happen to find that anything has been either withdrawn or added in those
countries not in accordance with the example of the elders established by ancient custom,
but according to the fancy of any one who has founded a monastery, I will faithfully add it
or omit it, in accordance with the rule which I have seen followed in the monasteries anciently
founded throughout Egypt and Palestine, as I do not believe that a new establishment in
the West, in the parts of Gaul could find anything more reasonable or more perfect than
are those customs, in the observance of which the monasteries that have been founded by
holy and spiritually minded fathers since the rise of apostolic preaching endure even to our
own times. I shall, however, venture to exercise this discretion in my work,—that where I
find anything in the rule of the Egyptians which, either because of the severity of the climate,
or owing to some difficulty or diversity of habits, is impossible in these countries, or hard
and difficult, I shall to some extent balance it by the customs of the monasteries which are
found throughout Pontus and Mesopotamia; because, if due regard be paid to what things
are possible, there is the same perfection in the observance although the power may be unequal.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.108</head>
<head>Of the Monk’s Girdle.</head>
<p>As we are going to speak of the customs and rules of the monasteries, how by God’s
grace can we better begin than with the actual dress of the monks, for we shall then be able
to expound in due course their interior life when we have set their outward man before your
eyes. A monk, then, as a soldier of Christ ever ready for battle, ought always to walk with
his loins girded. For in this fashion, too, the authority of Holy Scripture shows that they
walked who in the Old Testament started the original of this life,—I mean Elijah and Elisha;
and, moreover, we know that the leaders and authors of the New Testament, viz., John,
Peter, and Paul, and the others of the same rank, walked in the same manner. And of these
the first-mentioned, who even in the Old Testament displayed the flowers of a virgin life
and an example of chastity and continence, when he had been sent by the Lord to rebuke
the messengers of Ahaziah, the wicked king of Israel, because when confined by sickness
he had intended to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, on the state of his health, and
thereupon the said prophet had met them and said that he should not come down from the
bed on which he lay,—this man was made known to the bed-ridden king by the description
of the character of his clothing. For when the messengers returned to him and brought back
the prophet’s message, he asked what the man who had met them and spoken such words
was like and how he was dressed. “An hairy man,” they said, “and girt with a girdle of
leather about his loins;” and by this dress the king at once saw that it was the man of God,
and said: “It is Elijah the Tishbite:”109 i.e., by the evidence of the girdle and the look of the
hairy and unkempt body he recognized without the slightest doubt the man of God, because
this was always attached to him as he dwelt among so many thousands of Israelites, as if it
were impressed as some special sign of his own particular style. Of John also, who came as
a sort of sacred boundary between the Old and New Testament, being both a beginning and
an ending, we know by the testimony of the Evangelist that “the same John had his raiment
of camel’s hair and a girdle of skin about his loins.”110 When Peter also had been put in
prison by Herod and was to be brought forth to be slain on the next day, when the angel
stood by him he was charged: “Gird thyself and put on thy shoes.”111 And the angel of the
Lord would certainly not have charged him to do this had he not seen that for the sake of
his night’s rest he had for a while freed his wearied limbs from the girdle usually tied round

them. Paul also, going up to Jerusalem and soon to be put in chains by the Jews, was met at
Cæsarea by the prophet Agabus, who took his girdle and bound his hands and feet to show
by his bodily actions the injuries which he was to suffer, and said: “So shall the Jews in Jerusalem
bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.”112
And surely the prophet would never have brought this forward, or have said “the man whose
girdle this is,” unless Paul had always been accustomed to fasten it round his loins.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the Monk’s Robe.</head>
<p>Let the robe also of the monk be such as may merely cover the body and prevent the
disgrace of nudity, and keep off harm from cold, not such as may foster the seeds of vanity
and pride; for the same apostle tells us: “Having food and covering, with these let us be
content.”113 “Covering,” he says, not “raiment,” as is wrongly found in some Latin copies:
that is, what may merely cover the body, not what may please the fancy by the splendour
of the attire; commonplace, so that it may not be thought remarkable for novelty of colour
or fashion among other men of the same profession; and quite free from anxious carefulness,
yet not discoloured by stains acquired through neglect. Lastly, let them be so far removed
from this world’s fashions as to remain altogether common property for the use of the servants
of God. For whatever is claimed by one or a few among the servants of God and is not
the common property of the whole body of the brethren alike is either superfluous or vain,
and for that reason to be considered harmful, and affording an appearance of vanity rather
than virtue. And, therefore, whatever models we see were not taught either by the saints of
old who laid the foundations of the monastic life, or by the fathers of our own time who in
their turn keep up at the present day their customs, these we also should reject as superfluous
and useless: wherefore they utterly disapproved of a robe of sackcloth as being visible to all
and conspicuous, and what from this very fact will not only confer no benefit on the soul
but rather minister to vanity and pride, and as being inconvenient and unsuitable for the
performance of necessary work for which a monk ought always to go ready and unimpeded.
But even if we hear of some respectable persons who have been dressed in this garb, a rule
for the monasteries is not, therefore, to be passed by us, nor should the ancient decrees of
the holy fathers be upset because we do not think that a few men, presuming on the possession
of other virtues, are to be blamed even in regard of those things which they have practised
not in accordance with the Catholic rule. For the opinion of a few ought not to be
preferred to or to interfere with the general rule for all. For we ought to give unhesitating
allegiance and unquestioning obedience, not to those customs and rules which the will of
a few have introduced, but to those which a long standing antiquity and numbers of the
holy fathers have passed on by an unanimous decision to those that come after. Nor, indeed,
ought this to influence us as a precedent for our daily life, that Joram, the wicked king of

Israel, when surrounded by bands of his foes, rent his clothes, and is said to have had sackcloth
inside them;114 or that the Ninevites, in order to mitigate the sentence of God, which
had been pronounced against them by the prophet, were clothed in rough sackcloth.115 The
former is shown to have been clothed with it secretly underneath, so that unless the upper
garment had been rent it could not possibly have been known by any one, and the latter
tolerated a covering of sackcloth at a time when, since all were mourning over the approaching
destruction of the city and were clothed with the same garments, none could be accused
of ostentation. For where there is no special difference and all are alike no harm is done.116</p>

<head>Of the Hoods of the Egyptians.</head>
<p>There are some things besides in the dress of the Egyptians which concern not the care
of the body so much as the regulation of the character, that the observance of simplicity and
innocence may be preserved by the very character of the clothing. For they constantly use
both by day and by night very small hoods coming down to the end of the neck and shoulders,
which only cover the head, in order that they may constantly be moved to preserve the
simplicity and innocence of little children by imitating their actual dress.117 And these men
have returned to childhood in Christ and sing at all hours with heart and soul: “Lord, my
heart is not exalted nor are mine eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters nor in
wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: as a child that
is weaned is towards his mother.”118</p>

<p>They wear also linen tunics119 which scarcely reach to the elbows, and for the rest leave
their hands bare, that the cutting off of the sleeves may suggest that they have cut off all the
deeds and works of this world, and the garment of linen teach that they are dead to all earthly
conversation, and that hereby they may hear the Apostle saying day by day to them: “Mortify
your members which are upon the earth;” their very dress also declaring this: “For ye
are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God;” and again: “And I live, yet now not I but
Christ liveth in me. To me indeed the world is crucified, and I to the world.”120</p>

down over the top of the neck and divided on either side of the throat go round the folds
(of the robe) at the armpits and gather them up on either side, so that they can draw up and
tuck in close to the body the wide folds of the dress, and so with their arms girt they are
made active and ready for all kinds of work, endeavouring with all their might to fulfil the
Apostle’s charge: “For these hands have ministered not only to me but to those also who
are with me,” “Neither have we eaten any man’s bread for nought, but with labour and toil
working night and day that we should not be burdensome to any of you.” And: “If any will

<p>The last article of their dress is the goat-skin, which is called melotes, or pera,129 and a
staff, which they carry in imitation of those who foreshadowed the lines of the monastic life
in the Old Testament, of whom the Apostle says: “They wandered about in sheepskins and
goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted; of whom the world was not worthy; wandering
in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and in caves of the earth.”130 And this garment
of goatskin signifies that having destroyed all wantonness of carnal passions they ought to
continue in the utmost sobriety of virtue, and that nothing of the wantonness or heat of
youth, or of their old lightmindedness, should remain in their bodies.</p>

<head>Of the Staff of the Egyptians.</head>
<p>For Elisha, himself one of them, teaches that the same men used to carry a staff; as he
says to Gehazi, his servant, when sending him to raise the woman’s son to life: “Take my
staff and run and go and place it on the lad’s face that he may live.”131 And the prophet
would certainly not have given it to him to take unless he had been in the habit of constantly
carrying it about in his hand. And the carrying of the staff spiritually teaches that they ought
never to walk unarmed among so many barking dogs of faults and invisible beasts of spiritual
wickedness (from which the blessed David, in his longing to be free, says: “Deliver not,
O Lord, to the beasts the soul that trusteth in Thee”),132 but when they attack them they
ought to beat them off with the sign of the cross and drive them far away; and when they
rage furiously against them they should annihilate them by the constant recollection of the
Lord’s passion and by following the example of His mortified life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of their Shoes.</head>
<p>But refusing shoes, as forbidden by the command of the gospel, if bodily weakness or
the morning cold in winter or the scorching heat of midday compels them, they merely
protect their feet with sandals, explaining that by the use of them and the Lord’s permission
it is implied that if, while we are still in this world we cannot be completely set free from
care and anxiety about the flesh, nor can we be altogether released from it, we should at
least provide for the wants of the body with as little fuss and as slight an entanglement as
possible: and as for the feet of our soul which ought to be ready for our spiritual race and
always prepared for preaching the peace of the gospel (with which feet we run after the
odour of the ointments of Christ, and of which David says: “I ran in thirst,” and Jeremiah:
“But I am not troubled, following Thee”),133 we ought not to suffer them to be entangled
in the deadly cares of this world, filling our thoughts with those things which concern not
the supply of the wants of nature, but unnecessary and harmful pleasures. And this we shall
thus fulfil if, as the Apostle advises, we “make not provision for the flesh with its lusts.”134
But though lawfully enough they make use of these sandals, as permitted by the Lord’s
command, yet they never suffer them to remain on their feet when they approach to celebrate
or to receive the holy mysteries, as they think that they ought to observe in the letter that
which was said to Moses and to Joshua, the son of Nun: “Loose the latchet of thy shoe: for
the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”135</p>

<head>Of the modification in the observances which may be permitted in accordance with the character
of the climate or the custom of the district.</head>
<p>So much may be said, that we may not appear to have left out any article of the dress of
the Egyptians. But we need only keep to those which the situation of the place and the customs
of the district permit. For the severity of the winter does not allow us to be satisfied
with slippers137 or tunics or a single frock; and the covering of tiny hoods or the wearing
of a sheepskin would afford a subject for derision instead of edifying the spectators.
Wherefore we hold that we ought to introduce only those things which we have described
above, and which are adapted to the humble character of our profession and the nature of
the climate, that the chief thing about our dress may be not the novelty of the garb, which
might give some offence to men of the world, but its honourable simplicity.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the Spiritual Girdle and its Mystical Meaning.138</head>
<p>Clad, therefore, in these vestments, the soldier of Christ should know first of all that he
is protected by the girdle tied round him, not only that he may be ready in mind for all the
work and business of the monastery, but also that he may always go without being hindered
by his dress. For he will be proved to be the more ardent in purity of heart for spiritual
progress and the knowledge of Divine things in proportion as he is the more earnest in his
zeal for obedience and work. Secondly, he should realize that in the actual wearing of the
girdle there is no small mystery declaring what is demanded of him. For the girding of the
loins and binding them round with a dead skin signifies that he bears about the mortification
of those members in which are contained the seeds of lust and lasciviousness, always
knowing that the command of the gospel, which says, “Let your loins be girt about,”139 is
applied to him by the Apostle’s interpretation; to wit, “Mortify your members which are
upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence.”140 And so we find in
Holy Scripture that only those were girt with the girdle in whom the seeds of carnal lust are
found to be destroyed, and who sing with might and main this utterance of the blessed
David: “For I am become like a bottle in the frost,”141 because when the sinful flesh is destroyed
in the inmost parts they can distend by the power of the spirit the dead skin of the
outward man. And therefore he significantly adds “in the frost,” because they are never
satisfied merely with the mortification of the heart, but also have the motions of the outward
man and the incentives of nature itself frozen by the approach of the frost of continence
from without, if only, as the Apostle says, they no longer allow any reign of sin in their
mortal body, nor wear a flesh that resists the spirit.142</p>

in cold than in hot countries. Hence we leave this to the abbot to determine. However, in temperate climates
we are of the opinion that it will be enough for each monk to have a hood and a frock, a rough one for the winter,
and in the summer a simple or old one; a scapular also for work; and the cover of the feet, shoes and socks. And
the monks are not to complain of the colour or size of these articles, but to be satisfied with whatever can be

<p>Girt, therefore, with this twofold girdle of which we have spoken,143 the soldier of Christ
should next learn the system of the canonical prayers and Psalms which was long ago arranged
by the holy fathers in the East. Of their character, however, and of the way in which
we can pray, as the Apostle directs, “without ceasing,”144 we shall treat, as the Lord may

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the difference of the number of Psalms appointed to be sung in all the provinces.</head>
<p>For we have found that many in different countries, according to the fancy of their mind
(having, indeed, as the Apostle says, “a zeal, for God but not according to knowledge”145),
have made for themselves different rules and arrangements in this matter. For some have
appointed that each night twenty or thirty Psalms should be said, and that these should be
prolonged by the music of antiphonal singing146, and by the addition of some modulations
as well. Others have even tried to go beyond this number. Some use eighteen. And in this
way we have found different rules appointed in different places, and the system and regulations
that we have seen are almost as many in number as the monasteries and cells which
we have visited. There are some, too, to whom it has seemed good that in the day offices of
prayer, viz., Tierce, Sext, and Nones,147 the number of Psalms and prayers should be made
to correspond exactly to the number of the hours at which the services are offered up to the
Lord.148 Some have thought fit that six Psalms should be assigned to each service of the day.
And so I think it best to set forth the most ancient system of the fathers which is still observed
by the servants of God throughout the whole of Egypt, so that your new monastery in its
untrained infancy in Christ149 may be instructed in the most ancient institutions of the
earliest fathers.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of the observance of one uniform rule throughout the whole of Egypt, and of the election of
those who are set over the brethren.</head>
<p>And so throughout the whole of Egypt and the Thebaid, where monasteries are not
founded at the fancy of every man who renounces the world, but through a succession of
fathers and their traditions last even to the present day, or are founded so to last, in these
we have noticed that a prescribed system of prayers is observed in their evening assemblies
and nocturnal vigils. For no one is allowed to preside over the assembly of the brethren, or
even over himself, before he has not only deprived himself of all his property but has also
learnt the fact that he is not his own maker and has no authority over his own actions. For
one who renounces the world, whatever property or riches he may possess, must seek the
common dwelling of a Coenobium, that he may not flatter himself in any way with what he
has forsaken or what he has brought into the monastery. He must also be obedient to all,
so as to learn that he must, as the Lord says,150 become again a little child, arrogating
nothing to himself on the score of his age and the number of the years which he now counts
as lost while they were spent to no purpose in the world and, as he is only a beginner, and
because of the novelty of the apprenticeship, which he knows he is serving in Christ’s service,
he should not hesitate to submit himself even to his juniors. Further, he is obliged to habituate
himself to work and toil, so as to prepare with his own hands, in accordance with the Apostle’s
command,151 daily supply of food, either for his own use or for the wants of strangers; and
that he may also forget the pride and luxury of his past life, and gain by grinding toil humility
of heart. And so no one is chosen to be set over a congregation of brethren before that he
who is to be placed in authority has learnt by obedience what he ought to enjoin on those
who are to submit to him, and has discovered from the rules of the Elders what he ought to
teach to his juniors. For they say that to rule or to be ruled well needs a wise man, and they
call it the greatest gift and grace of the Holy Spirit, since no one can enjoin salutary precepts
on those who submit to him but one who has previously been trained in all the rules of virtue;
nor can any one obey an Elder but one who has been filled with the love of God and perfected
in the virtue of humility. And so we see that there is a variety of rules and regulations in use
throughout other districts, because we often have the audacity to preside over a monastery
without even having learnt the system of the Elders, and appoint ourselves Abbots before
we have, as we ought, professed ourselves disciples, and are readier to require the observance
of our own inventions than to preserve the well-tried teaching of our predecessors. But,
while we meant to explain the best system of prayers to be observed, we have in our eagerness

for the institutions of the fathers anticipated by a hasty digression the account which we
were keeping back for its proper place. And so let us now return to the subject before us.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How throughout the whole of Egypt and the Thebaid the number of Psalms is fixed at twelve.</head>
<p>So, as we said, throughout the whole of Egypt and the Thebaid the number of Psalms
is fixed at twelve both at Vespers and in the office of Nocturns,152 in such a way that at the
close two lessons follow, one from the Old and the other from the New Testament.153 And
this arrangement, fixed ever so long ago, has continued unbroken to the present day
throughout so many ages, in all the monasteries of those districts, because it is said that it
was no appointment of man’s invention, but was brought down from heaven to the fathers
by the ministry of an angel.</p>
<note type="footnote">152 The rule of Cæsarius also prescribes twelve Psalms on every Sabbath, Lord’s day, and festival (c. 25); so
also, according to the Benedictine rule, there are twelve Psalms at mattins, besides the fixed ones, iii. and xcv.
(see c. 9 and 10), as there are still in the Roman Breviary on ordinary week-days.</note>
<note type="footnote">153 The custom of having two lessons only appears to have been peculiar to Egypt. Most of the early Western
rules give three, e.g., those of Cæsarius and Benedict, while in the Eastern daily offices there are no lections from
Holy Scripture.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
<pb n="424"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How the fact that the number of the Psalms was to be twelve was received from the teaching
of an angel.</head>
<p>For in the early days of the faith when only a few, and those the best of men, were known
by the name of monks, who, as they received that mode of life from the Evangelist Mark of
blessed memory, the first to preside over the Church of Alexandria as Bishop, not only
preserved those grand characteristics for which we read, in the Acts of the Apostles, that
the Church and multitude of believers in primitive times was famous (“The multitude of
believers had one heart and one soul. Nor did any of them say that any of the things which
he possessed was his own: but they had all things common; for as many as were owners of
lands or houses sold them, and brought the price of the things which they sold, and laid it
at the feet of the Apostles, and distribution was made to every man as he had need”),154 but
secluded spots outside the cities they led a life marked by such rigorous abstinence that even
to those of another creed the exalted character of their life was a standing marvel. For they
gave themselves up to the reading of Holy Scripture and to prayers and to manual labour
night and day with such fervour that they had no desire or thoughts of food—unless on the
second or third day bodily hunger155 reminded them, and they took their meat and drink
not so much because they wished for it as because it was necessary for life; and even then
they took it not before sunset, in order that they might connect the hours of daylight with
the practice of spiritual meditations, and the care of the body with the night, and might
perform other things much more exalted than these. And about these matters, one who has
never heard anything from one who is at home in such things, may learn from ecclesiastical
history.156 At that time, therefore, when the perfection of the primitive Church remained
unbroken, and was still preserved fresh in the memory by their followers and successors,
and when the fervent faith of the few had not yet grown lukewarm by being dispersed among
the many, the venerable fathers with watchful care made provision for those to come after
them, and met together to discuss what plan should be adopted for the daily worship
throughout the whole body of the brethren; that they might hand on to those who should
succeed them a legacy of piety and peace that was free from all dispute and dissension, for
they were afraid that in regard of the daily services some difference or dispute might arise
among those who joined together in the same worship, and at some time or other it might
send forth a poisonous root of error or jealousy or schism among those who came after.

<note type="footnote">156 Cf. Eusebius, Book II. c. xv., xvi. Sozomen, Book I. c. xii., xiii.</note>

<pb n="425"/>
And when each man in proportion to his own fervour—and unmindful of the weakness of
others—thought that that should be appointed which he judged was quite easy by considering
his own faith and strength, taking too little account of what would be possible for the great
mass of the brethren in general (wherein a very large proportion of weak ones is sure to be
found); and when in different degrees they strove, each according to his own powers, to fix
an enormous number of Psalms, and some were for fifty, others sixty, and some, not content
with this number, thought that they actually ought to go beyond it,—there was such a holy
difference of opinion in their pious discussion on the rule of their religion that the time for
their Vesper office came before the sacred question was decided; and, as they were going to
celebrate their daily rites and prayers, one rose up in the midst to chant the Psalms to the
Lord. And while they were all sitting (as is still the custom in Egypt157), with their minds
intently fixed on the words of the chanter, when he had sung eleven Psalms, separated by
prayers introduced between them, verse after verse being evenly enunciated,158 he finished
the twelfth with a response of Alleluia,159 and then, by his sudden disappearance from the
eyes of all, put an end at once to their discussion and their service.160</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the Custom of having Twelve Prayers.</head>
<p>Whereupon the venerable assembly of the Fathers understood that by Divine Providence
a general rule had been fixed for the congregations of the brethren through the angel’s direction,
and so decreed that this number should be preserved both in their evening and in
their nocturnal services; and when they added to these two lessons, one from the Old and
one from the New Testament, they added them simply as extras and of their own appointment,
only for those who liked, and who were eager to gain by constant study a mind well
stored with Holy Scripture. But on Saturday and Sunday they read them both from the New
Testament; viz., one from the Epistles161 or the Acts of the Apostles, and one from the
Gospel.162 And this also those do whose concern is the reading and the recollection of the
Scriptures, from Easter to Whitsuntide.163</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of their Method of Praying.</head>
<p>These aforesaid prayers, then, they begin and finish in such a way that when the Psalm
is ended they do not hurry at once to kneel down, as some of us do in this country, who,
before the Psalm is fairly ended, make haste to prostrate themselves for prayer, in their hurry
to finish the service164 as quickly as possible. For though we have chosen to exceed the
limit which was anciently fixed by our predecessors, supplying the number of the remaining
Psalms, we are anxious to get to the end of the service, thinking of the refreshment of the
wearied body rather than looking for profit and benefit from the prayer. Among them,
therefore, it is not so, but before they bend their knees they pray for a few moments, and
while they are standing up spend the greater part of the time in prayer. And so after this,
for the briefest space of time, they prostrate themselves to the ground, as if but adoring the
Divine Mercy, and as soon as possible rise up, and again standing erect with outspread
hands—just as they had been standing to pray before—remain with thoughts intent upon
their prayers. For when you lie prostrate for any length of time upon the ground you are
more open to an attack, they say, not only of wandering thoughts but also slumber. And
would that we too did not know the truth of this by experience and daily practice—we who
when prostrating ourselves on the ground too often wish for this attitude to be prolonged
for some time, not for the sake of our prayer so much as for the sake of resting. But when
he who is to “collect” the prayer165 rises from the ground they all start up at once, so that
no one would venture to bend the knee before he bows down, nor to delay when he has risen
from the ground, lest it should be thought that he has offered his own prayer independently
instead of following the leader to the close.</p>
<note type="footnote">164 Ad celeritatem missæ. The word “missa” is here used for the breaking up of the congregation after service,
as it is again in Book III. c. vii., where Cassian says that one who came late for prayer had to wait, standing before
the door, for the “missa” of the whole assembly. Cf. III. c. viii., “post vigiliarum missam,” and the rule of S. Benedict
(c. xvii.): “After the three Psalms are finished let one lesson be read, a verse, and Kyrie Eleison: et missæ
fiant.” A full account of the various meanings given to the word will be found in the Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities, Vol. II. p. 1193 sq.</note>
<note type="footnote">165 Colligere orationem. The phrase corresponds to the Greek συνάπτειν, but Ducange gives but few instances
of its use in Latin. It is found, however, in Canon xxx. of the Council of Agde. “Plebs collecta oratione ad vesperam
ab Episcopo cum benedictione dimittatur.”</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
<pb n="428"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the Prayer which follows the Psalm.</head>
<p>That practice too which we have observed in this country—viz., that while one sings to
the end of the Psalm, all standing up sing together with a loud voice, “Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost”—we have never heard anywhere throughout the
East, but there, while all keep silence when the Psalm is finished, the prayer that follows is
offered up by the singer. But with this hymn in honour of the Trinity only the whole
Psalmody166 is usually ended.167</p>
<note type="footnote">166 Antiphona. The word must certainly be used here not in the later sense of “antiphon,” but as descriptive
of the whole of the Psalmody of the office. Cf. note on c. i.</note>
<note type="footnote">167 In the Eastern offices the Psalter is divided into twenty sections called καθίσματα, each of which is subdivided
into three στάσεις, at the close of each of which the Gloria is said, and not, as in the West, after every
Psalm. This Western custom which Cassian here notices seems to have originated in Gaul, and thence spread
to other churches as, according to Walafrid Strabo, at Rome it was used but rarely after the Psalms in the ninth
century. See Walafrid Strabo, c. xxv. ap. Hittorp. 688. The earliest certain indications of the use of the hymn itself
are found in the fourth century. See S. Basil De Spiritu Sancto, c. xxix.; Theodoret, Eccl. Hist., II. xxiv., Sozomen,
Eccl. Hist., III. xx. The Greek form is Δὁξα πατρὶ καὶ ὑἱῷ καὶ ἁγίῳ πνευμάτι καὶ νῦν καὶ ἀεὶ καὶ ἐις τοὺς ἀιῶνας
τῶν ἀιωνῶν, ἀμήν. The additional words in use in the West, “sicut erat in principio,” were first adopted in the
sixth century, being ordered by the Council of Vaison, a.d. 529, “after the example of the apostolic see.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of the characteristics of the prayer, the fuller treatment of which is reserved for the Conferences
of the Elders.</head>
<p>And as the plan of these Institutes leads us to the system of the canonical prayers, the
fuller treatment of which we will however reserve for the Conferences of the Elders (where
we shall speak of them at greater length when we have begun to tell in their own words of
the character of their prayers, and how continuous they are), still I think it well, as far as the
place and my narrative permit, as the occasion offers itself, to glance briefly for the present
at a few points, so that by picturing in the meanwhile the movements of the outer man, and
by now laying the foundations, as it were, of the prayer, we may afterwards, when we come
to speak of the inner man, with less labour build up the complete edifice of his prayers;
providing, above all, for this, that if the end of life should overtake us and cut us off from
finishing the narration which we are anxious (D.V.) fitly to compose, we may at least leave
in this work the beginnings of so necessary a matter to you, to whom everything seems a
delay, by reason of the fervour of your desire: so that, if a few more years of life are granted
to us, we may at least mark out for you some outlines of their prayers, that those above all
who live in monasteries may have some information about them; providing also, at the same
time, that those who perhaps may meet only with this book, and be unable to procure the
other, may find that they are supplied with some sort of information about the nature of
their prayers; and as they are instructed about the dress and clothing of the outer man, so
too they may not be ignorant what his behaviour ought to be in offering spiritual sacrifices.
Since, though these books, which we are now arranging with the Lord’s help to write, are
mainly taken up with what belongs to the outer man and the customs of the Coenobia, yet
those will rather be concerned with the training of the inner man and the perfection of the
heart, and the life and doctrine of the Anchorites.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Of the silence and conciseness with which the Collects are offered up by the Egyptians.</head>
<p>When, then, they meet together to celebrate the aforementioned rites, which they term
synaxes,168 they are all so perfectly silent that, though so large a number of the brethren is
assembled together, you would not think a single person was present except the one who
stands up and chants the Psalm in the midst; and especially is this the case when the prayer
is offered up,169 for then there is no spitting, no clearing of the throat, or noise of coughing,
no sleepy yawning with open mouths, and gaping, and no groans or sighs are uttered, likely
to distract those standing near. No voice is heard save that of the priest concluding the
prayer, except perhaps one that escapes the lips through aberration of mind and unconsciously
takes the heart by surprise, inflamed as it is with an uncontrollable and irrepressible
fervour of spirit, while that which the glowing mind is unable to keep to itself strives through
a sort of unutterable groaning to make its escape from the inmost chambers of the breast.
But if any one infected with coldness of mind prays out loud or emits any of those sounds
we have mentioned, or is overcome by a fit of yawning, they declare that he is guilty of a
double fault.</p>
<p>He is blameworthy, first, as regards his own prayer because he offers it to God in a
careless way; and, secondly, because by his unmannerly noise he disturbs the thoughts of
another who would otherwise perhaps have been able to pray with greater attention. And
so their rule is that the prayer ought to be brought to an end with a speedy conclusion, lest
while we are lingering over it some superfluity of spittle or phlegm should interfere with
the close of our prayer. And, therefore, while it is still glowing the prayer is to be snatched
as speedily as possible out of the jaws of the enemy, who, although he is indeed always hostile
to us, is yet never more hostile than when he sees that we are anxious to offer up prayers to
God against his attacks; and by exciting wandering thoughts and all sorts of rheums he endeavours
to distract our minds from attending to our prayers, and by this means tries to
make it grow cold, though begun with fervour. Wherefore they think it best for the prayers
to be short and offered up very frequently:170 on the one hand that by so often praying to

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the system according to which the Psalms are said among the Egyptians.</head>
<p>And, therefore, they do not even attempt to finish the Psalms, which they sing in the
service, by an unbroken and continuous recitation. But they repeat them separately and bit
by bit, divided into two or three sections, according to the number of verses, with prayers
in between.171 For they do not care about the quantity of verses, but about the intelligence
of the mind; aiming with all their might at this: “I will sing with the spirit: I will sing also
with the understanding.”172 And so they consider it better for ten verses to be sung with
understanding and thought173 than for a whole Psalm to be poured forth with a bewildered
mind. And this is sometimes caused by the hurry of the speaker, when, thinking of the
character and number of the remaining Psalms to be sung, he takes no pains to make the
meaning clear to his hearers, but hastens on to get to the end of the service. Lastly, if any of
the younger monks, either through fervour of spirit or because he has not yet been properly
taught, goes beyond the proper limit of what is to be sung, the one who is singing the Psalm
is stopped by the senior clapping his hands where he sits in his stall, and making them all
rise for prayer. Thus they take every possible care that no weariness may creep in among
them as they sit through the length of the Psalms, as thereby not only would the singer
himself lose the fruits of understanding, but also loss would be incurred by those whom he
made to feel the service a weariness by going on so long. They also observe this with the
greatest care; viz., that no Psalm should be said with the response of Alleluia except those
which are marked with the inscription of Alleluia in their title.174 But the aforesaid number
of twelve Psalms they divide in such a way that, if there are two brethren they each sing six;
if there are three, then four; and if four, three each. A smaller number than this they never
sing in the congregation, and accordingly, however large a congregation is assembled, not
more than four brethren sing in the service.175</p>
<note type="footnote">171 This plan of dividing some of the longer Psalms (as is still done with the 119th in the English Psalter) was
adopted sometimes in the West also. Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict, c. xviii., and the Third Council of Narbonne
(a.d. 589), Canon 2: “Ut in psallendis ordinibus per quemque Psalmum Gloria dicatur Omnipotenti Deo, per
majores vero Psalmos, prout fuerint prolixius, pausationes fiant, et per quamque pausationem Gloria Trinitatis
Domino decantetur.” Further, the rule that prayers should be intermingled with Psalms which was perhaps introduced
into the West by Cassian, was widely adopted both in Gaul and in Spain.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Of the reason why while one sings the Psalms the rest sit down during the service; and of the
zeal with which they afterwards prolong their vigils in their cells till daybreak.</head>
<p>This canonical system of twelve Psalms, of which we have spoken, they render easier
by such bodily rest that when, after their custom, they celebrate these services, they all, except
the one who stands up in the midst to recite the Psalms, sit in very low stalls and follow the
voice of the singer with the utmost attention of heart. For they are so worn out with fasting
and working all day and night that, unless they were helped by some such indulgence, they
could not possibly get through this number standing up. For they allow no time to pass idly
without the performance of some work, because not only do they strive with all earnestness
to do with their hands those things which can be done in daylight, but also with anxious
minds they examine into those sorts of work which not even the darkness of night can put
a stop to, as they hold that they will gain a far deeper insight into subjects of spiritual contemplation
with purity of heart, the more earnestly that they devote themselves to work and
labour. And therefore they consider that a moderate allowance of canonical prayers was
divinely arranged in order that for those who are very ardent in faith room might be left in
which their never-tiring flow of virtue might spend itself, and notwithstanding no loathing
arise in their wearied and weak bodies from too large a quantity. And so, when the offices
of the canonical prayers have been duly finished, every one returns to his own cell (which
he inhabits alone, or is allowed to share with only one other whom partnership in work or
training in discipleship and learning has joined with him, or perhaps similarity of character
has made his companion), and again they offer with greater earnestness the same service of
prayer, as their special private sacrifice, as it were; nor do any of them give themselves up
any further to rest and sleep till when the brightness of day comes on the labours of the day
succeed the labours and meditations of the night.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13"> 
<pb n="434"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The reason why they are not allowed to go to sleep after the night service.176</head>
<p>And these labours they keep up for two reasons, besides this consideration,—that they
believe that when they are diligently exerting themselves they are offering to God a sacrifice
of the fruit of their hands. And, if we are aiming at perfection; we also ought to observe this
with the same diligence. First, lest our envious adversary, jealous of our purity against which
he is always plotting, and ceaselessly hostile to us, should by some illusion in a dream pollute
the purity which has been gained by the Psalms and prayers of the night: for after that satisfaction
which we have offered for our negligence and ignorance, and the absolution implored
with profuse sighs in our confession, he anxiously tries, if he finds some time given to repose,
to defile us; then above all endeavouring to overthrow and weaken our trust in God when
he sees by the purity of our prayers that we are making most fervent efforts towards God:
so that sometimes, when he has been unable to injure some the whole night long, he does
his utmost to disgrace them in that short hour. Secondly, because, even if no such dreaded
illusion of the devil arises, even a pure sleep in the interval produces laziness in the case of
the monk who ought soon to wake up; and, bringing on a sluggish torpor in the mind, it
dulls his vigour throughout the whole day, and deadens that keenness of perception and
exhausts that energy177 of heart which would be capable of keeping us all day long more
watchful against all the snares of the enemy and more robust. Wherefore to the Canonical
Vigils there are added these private watchings, and they submit to them with the greater
care, both in order that the purity which has been gained by Psalms and prayers may not
be lost, and also that a more intense carefulness to guard us diligently through the day may
be secured beforehand by the meditation of the night.</p>
<note type="footnote">176 Missæ. The use of this word for the offices of the Canonical Hours, though not common, is found also
in the Thirtieth Canon of the Council of Agde, a.d. 506. “At the end of the morning and evening missoe, after
the hymns, let the little chapters from the Psalms be said.”</note>

<head>Of the way in which they devote themselves in their cells equally to manual labour and to
prayer.</head>
<p>And therefore they supplement their prayer by the addition of labour, lest slumber
might steal upon them as idlers. For as they scarcely enjoy any time of leisure, so there is
no limit put to their spiritual meditations. For practising equally the virtues of the body and
of the soul, they balance what is due to the outer by what is profitable to the inner man;178
steadying the slippery motions of the heart and the shifting fluctuations of the thoughts by
the weight of labour, like some strong and immoveable anchor, by which the changeableness
and wanderings of the heart, fastened within the barriers of the cell, may be shut up in some
perfectly secure harbour, and so, intent only on spiritual meditation and watchfulness over
the thoughts, may not only forbid the watchful mind to give a hasty consent to any evil
suggestions, but may also keep it safe from any unnecessary and idle thoughts: so that it is
not easy to say which depends on the other—I mean, whether they practise their incessant
manual labour for the sake of spiritual meditation, or whether it is for the sake of their
continuous labours that they acquire such remarkable spiritual proficiency and light of
knowledge.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Of the discreet rule by which every one must retire to his cell after the close of the prayers;
and179 of the rebuke to which any one who does otherwise is subject.</head>
<p>And so, when the Psalms are finished, and the daily assembly, as we said above, is broken
up, none of them dares to loiter ever so little or to gossip with another: nor does he presume
even to leave his cell throughout the whole day, or to forsake the work which he is wont to
carry on in it, except when they happen to be called out for the performance of some necessary
duty, which they fulfil by going out of doors so that there may not be any chattering at
all among them. But every one does the work assigned to him in such a way that, by repeating
by heart some Psalm or passage of Scripture, he gives no opportunity or time for dangerous
schemes or evil designs, or even for idle talk, as both mouth and heart are incessantly taken
up with spiritual meditations. For they are most particular in observing this rule, that none
of them, and especially of the younger ones, may be caught stopping even for a moment or
going anywhere together with another, or holding his hands in his. But, if they discover any
who in defiance of the discipline of this rule have perpetrated any of these forbidden things,
they pronounce them guilty of no slight fault, as contumacious and disobedient to the rules;
nor are they free from suspicion of plotting and nefarious designs. And, unless they expiate
their fault by public penance when all the brethren are gathered together, none of them is
allowed to be present at the prayers of the brethren.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>How no one is allowed to pray with one who has been suspended from prayer.</head>
<p>Further, if one of them has been suspended from prayer for some fault which he has
committed, no one has any liberty of praying with him before he performs his penance on
the ground,180 and reconciliation and pardon for his offence has been publicly granted to
him by the Abbot before all the brethren. For by a plan of this kind they separate and cut
themselves off from fellowship with him in prayer for this reason—because they believe that
one who is suspended from prayer is, as the Apostle says, “delivered unto Satan:”181 and if
any one, moved by an ill-considered affection, dares to hold communion with him in
prayer before he has been received by the elder, he makes himself partaker of his damnation,
and delivers himself up of his own free will to Satan, to whom the other had been consigned
for the correction of his guilt. And in this he falls into a more grievous offence because, by
uniting with him in fellowship either in talk or in prayer, he gives him grounds for still
greater arrogance, and only encourages and makes worse the obstinacy of the offender. For,
by giving him a consolation that is only hurtful, he will make his heart still harder, and not
let him humble himself for the fault for which he was excommunicated; and through this
he will make him hold the Elder’s rebuke as of no consequence, and harbour deceitful
thoughts about satisfaction and absolution.</p>

<head>How he who rouses them for prayer ought to call them at the usual time.</head>
<p>But he who has been entrusted with the office of summoning the religious assembly
and with the care of the service should not presume to rouse the brethren for their daily vigils
irregularly, as he pleases, or as he may wake up in the night, or as the accident of his own
sleep or sleeplessness may incline him. But, although daily habit may constrain him to wake
at the usual hour, yet by often and anxiously ascertaining by the course of the stars the right
hour for service, he should summon them to the office of prayer, lest he be found careless
in one of two ways: either if, overcome with sleep, he lets the proper hour of the night go
by, or if, wanting to go to bed and impatient for his sleep, he anticipates it, and so may be
thought to have secured is own repose instead of attending to the spiritual office and the
rest of all the others.182</p>

<head>How they do not kneel from the evening of Saturday till the evening of Sunday.</head>
<p>This, too, we ought to know,—that from the evening of Saturday which precedes the
Sunday,183 up to the following evening, among the Egyptians they never kneel, nor from
Easter to Whitsuntide;184 nor do they at these times observe a rule of fasting,185 the reason
for which shall be explained in its proper place in the Conferences of the Elders,186 if the
Lord permits. At present we only propose to run through the causes very briefly, lest our

abstained from kneeling on Sunday in token of the resurrection. For later testimonies see Ambrose, Ep. 119, ad

<head>Of the services of the third, sixth, and ninth hours, which are observed in the regions of Syria.</head>
<p>The nocturnal system of prayers and Psalms as observed throughout Egypt has been, I
think, by God’s help, explained so far as our slender ability was able; and now we must speak
of the services of Tierce, Sext, and None, according to the rule of the monasteries of Palestine
and Mesopotamia,187 as we said in the Preface, and must moderate by the customs of these
the perfection and inimitable rigour of the discipline of the Egyptians.</p>
<note type="footnote">187 According to S. Jerome, Hilarion was the first to introduce the monastic life into Palestine (Vita Hilar.).
His work was carried on by his companion and pupil Hesycas and Epiphanius, afterwards Bishop of Salamis in
Cyprus. In Asia Minor S. Basil was the greater organizer of monasticism, though, as he tells us, there were already
many monks, not only in Egypt but also in Palestine, Coelosyria, and Mesopotamia (Ep. ccxxiii.). See also on

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>How among the Egyptians they apply themselves all day long to prayer and Psalm continually,
with the addition of work, without distinction of hours.</head>
<p>For among them (viz., the Egyptians) these offices which we are taught to render to the
Lord at separate hours and at intervals of time, with a reminder from the convener, are cel-
ebrated continuously throughout the whole day, with the addition of work, and that of their
own free will. For manual labour is incessantly practised by them in their cells in such a way
that meditation on the Psalms and the rest of the Scriptures is never entirely omitted. And
as with it at every moment they mingle suffrages and prayers, they spend the whole day in
those offices which we celebrate at fixed times. Wherefore, except Vespers and Nocturns,
there are no public services among them in the day except on Saturday and Sunday, when
they meet together at the third hour for the purpose of Holy Communion.188 For that which
is continuously offered is more than what is rendered at intervals of time; and more acceptable
as a free gift than the duties which are performed by the compulsion of a rule: as David for
this rejoices somewhat exultingly when he says, “Freely will I sacrifice unto Thee;” and, “Let
the free will offerings of my mouth be pleasing to Thee, O Lord.”189</p>
<note type="footnote">188 The Saturday Communion (in addition to that of Wednesday and Friday, as well as Sunday) is also
mentioned by S. Basil (Ep. xciii.), and cf. the Forty-ninth Canon of the Council of Laodicæa (circa 360 a.d.):
“During Lent the bread shall not be offered except on Saturday and Sunday.” In the West there is no trace of a
special Saturday celebration of the Holy Communion. The third hour was the ordinary time for Holy Communion,
as may be seen from the decree (falsely) ascribed to Pope Telesphorus (a.d. 127–138), in the Liber Pontificalis:
“Ut nullus ante horam tertiam sacrificium offere præsumeret,” and many other testimonies.</note>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How throughout all the East the services of Tierce, Sext, and None are ended with only three
Psalms and prayers each; and the reason why these spiritual offices are assigned more
particularly to those hours.</head>
<p>And so in the monasteries of Palestine and Mesopotamia and all the East the services
of the above-mentioned hours are ended each day with three Psalms apiece, so that constant
prayers may be offered to God at the appointed times, and yet, the spiritual duties being
completed with due moderation, the necessary offices of work may not be in any way interfered
with: for at these three seasons we know that Daniel the prophet also poured forth
his prayers to God day by day in his chamber with the windows open.190 Nor is it without
good reasons that these times are more particularly assigned to religious offices, since at
them what completed the promises and summed up our salvation was fulfilled. For we can
show that at the third hour the Holy Spirit, who had been of old promised by the prophets,
descended in the first instance on the Apostles assembled together for prayer. For when in
their astonishment at the speaking with tongues, which proceeded from them through the
outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon them, the unbelieving people of the Jews mocked and
said that they were full of new wine, then Peter, standing up in the midst of them, said: “Men
of Israel, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and consider my
words. For these men are not, as ye imagine, drunk, since it is the third hour of the day; but
this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days,
saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams.
And indeed upon my servants and my handmaids in those days I will pour out of my Spirit,
and they shall prophesy.”191 And all of this was fulfilled at the third hour, when the Holy
Spirit, announced before by the prophets, came at that hour and abode upon the Apostles.
But at the sixth hour the spotless Sacrifice, our Lord and Saviour, was offered up to the
Father, and, ascending the cross for the salvation of the whole world, made atonement for
the sins of mankind, and, despoiling principalities and powers, led them away openly; and
all of us who were liable to death and bound by the debt of the handwriting that could not
be paid, He freed, by taking it away out of the midst and affixing it to His cross for a
trophy.192 At the same hour, too, to Peter, in an ecstasy of mind, there was divinely revealed
<note type="footnote">190 Cf. Daniel vi. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">191 Acts ii. 14–18.</note>
<note type="footnote">192 The whole passage is alluding to Col. ii. 14, 15, which runs as follows in the Vulgate: “Delens quad adversum

principatus et potestates traduxit confidenter, palam triumphans illos in semet ipso.”</note>

both the calling of the Gentiles by the letting down of the Gospel vessel from heaven, and
also the cleansing of all the living creatures contained in it, when a voice came to him and
said to him: “Rise, Peter; kill and eat;”193 which vessel, let down from heaven by the four
corners, is plainly seen to signify nothing else than the Gospel. For although, as it is divided
by the fourfold narrative of the Evangelists, it seems to have “four corners” (or beginnings),
yet the body of the Gospel is but one; embracing, as it does, the birth as well as the Godhead,
and the miracles as well as the passion of one and the same Christ. Excellently, too, it says
not “of linen” but “as if of linen.” For linen signifies death. Since, then, our Lord’s death and
passion were not undergone by the law of human nature, but of His own free will, it says
“as if of linen.” For when dead according to the flesh He was not dead according to the
spirit, because “His soul was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see corruption.”194 And
again He says: “No man taketh My life from Me but I lay it down of Myself. I have power
to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”195 And so in this vessel of the Gospels let
down from heaven, that is written by the Holy Ghost, all the nations which were formerly
outside the observance of the law and reckoned as unclean now flow together through belief
in the faith that they may to their salvation be turned away from the worship of idols and
be serviceable for health-giving food, and are brought to Peter and cleansed by the voice of
the Lord. But at the ninth hour, penetrating to hades, He there by the brightness of His
splendour extinguished the indescribable darkness of hell, and, bursting its brazen gates
and breaking the iron bars brought away with Him to the skies the captive band of saints
which was there shut up and detained in the darkness of inexorable hell,196 and, by taking
away the fiery sword, restored to paradise its original inhabitants by his pious confession.
At the same hour, too, Cornelius, the centurion, continuing with his customary devotion
in his prayers, is made aware through the converse of the angel with him that his prayers
and alms are remembered before the Lord, and at the ninth hour the mystery197 of the
calling of the Gentiles is clearly shown to him, which had been revealed to Peter in his ecstasy

<note type="footnote">196 The belief that by the descent into hell our Lord released some who were there detained was almost, if
not quite, universal in the early ages, and is recognized by a large number of the Fathers. It is alluded to by so

of mind at the sixth hour. In another passage, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, we are told
as follows about the same time: “But Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of
prayer, the ninth hour.”198 And by these notices it is clearly proved that these hours were
not without good reason consecrated with religious services by holy and apostolic men, and
ought to be observed in like manner by us, who, unless we are compelled, as it were, by some
rule to discharge these pious offices at least at stated times, either through sloth or through
forgetfulness, or being absorbed in business, spend the whole day without engaging in
prayer. But concerning the evening sacrifices what is to be said, since even in the Old Testament
these are ordered to be offered continually by the law of Moses? For that the morning
whole-burnt offerings and evening sacrifices were offered every day continually in the
temple, although with figurative offerings, we can show from that which is sung by David:
“Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be
an evening sacrifice,”199 in which place we can understand it in a still higher sense of that
true evening sacrifice which was given by the Lord our Saviour in the evening to the Apostles
at the Supper, when He instituted the holy mysteries of the Church, and of that evening
sacrifice which He Himself, on the following day, in the end of the ages, offered up to the
Father by the lifting up of His hands for the salvation of the whole world; which spreading
forth of His hands on the Cross is quite correctly called a “lifting up.” For when we were all
lying in hades He raised us to heaven, according to the word of His own promise when He
says: “When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.”200 But concerning
Mattins, that also teaches us which it is customary every day to sing at it: “O God, my God,
to Thee do I watch at break of day;” and “I will meditate on Thee in the morning;” and “I
prevented the dawning of the day and cried;” and again, “Mine eyes to Thee have prevented
the morning, that I might meditate on Thy words.”201 At these hours too that householder
in the Gospel hired labourers into his vineyard. For thus also is he described as having hired
them in the early morning, which time denotes the Mattin office; then at the third hour;

<note type="footnote">204 It will be noticed that in this chapter Cassian alludes to five offices: (1) A morning office; (2) the third
hour; (3) the sixth; (4) the ninth; and (5) Vespers; and gives the grounds for their observance. Similar grounds
are given by Cyprian, De Orat. Dominica sub fine: “For upon the disciples, at the third hour, the Holy Spirit
descended, who fulfilled the grace of the Lord’s promise. Moreover at the sixth hour, Peter, going up to the
housetop, was instructed as well by the sign as by the word of God, admonishing him to receive all to the grace
of salvation, whereas he was previously doubtful of the receiving of the Gentiles to baptism. And from the sixth
hour to the ninth the Lord, being crucified, washed away our sins by His blood; and that He might redeem and
quicken us, He then accomplished His victory by His passion. But for us, beloved brethren besides the hours of
prayer observed of old, both the times and the sacraments have now increased in number. For we must also
pray in the morning, that the Lord’s resurrection may be celebrated by morning prayer.…Also at the sun-setting
and decline of day we must pray again. For since Christ is the true Sun and the true Day, as the worldly sun and
day depart, when we pray and ask that light may return to us again, we pray for the advent of Christ, which shall
give us the grace of everlasting light.” Cf. also S. Basil, The Greater Monastic Rules, Q. xxxvii., where the same
subject is discussed, and Apost. Const. Book VIII. c. xxxiv. In later times the Seven Canonical Hours were all
connected with the events of our Lord’s Passion, and supposed to commemorate His sufferings, as the following
stanzas show:— At Mattins bound, at Prime reviled, Condemned to death at Tierce, Nailed to the Cross at Sext,
at Nones His blessed side they pierce. They take Him down at Vesper-tide, In grave at Compline lay; Who
thenceforth bids His Church observe Her sevenfold hours alway.</note>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How the Mattin office was not appointed by an ancient tradition but was started in our own
day for a definite reason.</head>
<p>But you must know that this Mattins, which is now very generally observed in Western
countries, was appointed as a canonical office in our own day, and also in our own monastery,
where our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin and deigned to submit to growth in infancy
as man, and where by His Grace He supported our own infancy, still tender in religion, and,
as it were, fed with milk.205 For up till that time we find that when this office of Mattins
(which is generally celebrated after a short interval after the Psalms and prayers of Nocturns
in the monasteries of Gaul) was finished, together with the daily vigils, the remaining hours
were assigned by our Elders to bodily refreshment. But when some rather carelessly abused
this indulgence and prolonged their time for sleep too long, as they were not obliged by the
requirements of any service to leave their cells or rise from their beds till the third hour; and
when, as well as losing their labour, they were drowsy from excess of sleep in the daytime,
when they ought to have been applying themselves to some duties, (especially on those days
when an unusually oppressive weariness was caused by their keeping watch from the evening
till the approach of morning), a complaint was brought to the Elders by some of the brethren
who were ardent in spirit and in no slight measure disturbed by this carelessness, and it was
determined by them after long discussion and anxious consideration that up till sunrise,
when they could without harm be ready to read or to undertake manual labour, time for
rest should be given to their wearied bodies, and after this they should all be summoned to
the observance of this service and should rise from their beds, and by reciting three Psalms
and prayers (after the order anciently fixed for the observance of Tierce and Sext, to signify
the confession of the Trinity)206 should at the same time by an uniform arrangement put
an end to their sleep and make a beginning to their work. And this form, although it may
seem to have arisen out of an accident and to have been appointed within recent memory
for the reason given above, yet it clearly makes up according to the letter that number which
the blessed David indicates (although it can be taken spiritually): “Seven times a day do I
praise Thee because of Thy righteous judgments.”207 For by the addition of this service we
certainly hold these spiritual assemblies seven times a day, and are shown to sing praises to
<note type="footnote">205 The allusion is to the monastery at Bethlehem, where Cassian had himself been educated. See the introduction.</note>
<note type="footnote">206 Trinæ confessionis exemplo. The words appear to mean that the three Psalms used at these offices are
significant of the Persons of the Holy Trinity. So somewhat similarly Cyprian (on the Lord’s Prayer) speaks of
the third, sixth, and ninth hours being observed as a sacrament of the Trinity.</note>
<note type="footnote">207 Ps. cxviii. (cxix.) 164.</note>

<pb n="448"/>
God seven times in it.208 Lastly, though this same form, starting from the East, has most
beneficially spread to these parts, yet still in some long-established monasteries in the East,
which will not brook the slightest violation of the old rules of the Fathers, it seems never to
have been introduced.209</p>
<note type="footnote">208 This second “Mattins” of which Cassian has been speaking is the service which the later Church called
Prime, Cassian’s first Mattins corresponding to Lauds, and his Nocturns, or “Vigiliæ,” to Mattins. Thus the
“seven hours” are made up as follows: (1) Nocturns or Mattins, (2) Lauds, (3) Prime, (4) Tierce, (5) Sext, (6
None, (7) Vespers. Compline, it will be noticed, had not yet been introduced. This appears for the first time in
the Rule of S. Benedict (c. xvi.), a century later. By its introduction the “day hours” were made up to seven
Nocturns belonging strictly to the night, and answering to the Psalmist’s words, “At midnight will I rise to give
thanks to Thee.” Ps. cxix. 62.</note>
<note type="footnote">209 The introduction of Prime appears to have been very gradual even in the West, for, though an office for
it is prescribed in S. Benedict (c. xix.), yet there is no mention of it in the Rule of Cæsarius of Arles for monks
nor in that of Isidore of Seville, and it is omitted by Cassiodorus in his enumeration of the seven hours observed
by the monks. After Benedict the next to mention it appears to be Aurelius, a successor of Cæsarius at Arles,
and by degrees it made its way to universal adoption in the West. In the Greek Church the office for it is said
continuously with Lauds (τὸ ὄρθρον).</note>

<head>How they ought not to go back to bed again after the Mattin prayers.</head>
<p>But some in this province, not knowing the reason why this office was appointed and
introduced, go back again to bed after their Mattin prayers are finished, and in spite of it
fall into that very habit to check which our Elders instituted this service. For they are eager
to finish it at that hour, that an opportunity maybe given, to those who are inclined to be
indifferent and not careful enough, to go back to bed again, which most certainly ought not
to be done (as we showed more fully in the previous book when describing the service of
the Egyptians),210 for fear lest the force of our natural passions should be aroused and stain
that purity of ours which was gained by humble confession and prayers before the dawn,
or some illusion of the enemy pollute us, or even the repose of a pure and natural sleep interfere
with the fervour of our spirit and make us lazy and slothful throughout the whole
day, as we are chilled by the sluggishness caused by sleep. And to avoid this the Egyptians,
and especially as they are in the habit of rising at fixed times even before the cock-crow,
when the canonical office211 has been celebrated, afterwards prolong their vigils even to
daylight, that the morning light when it comes on them may find them established in fervour
of spirit, and keep them still more careful and fervent all through the day, as it has found
them prepared for the conflict and strengthened against their daily struggle with the devil
by the practice of nocturnal vigils and spiritual meditation.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>How no change was made by the Elders in the ancient system of Psalms when the Mattin office
was instituted.</head>
<p>But this too we ought to know, viz., that no change was made in the ancient arrangement
of Psalms by our Elders who decided that this Mattin service should be added;212 but that
office213 was always celebrated in their nocturnal assemblies according to the same order
as it had been before. For the hymns which in this country they used at the Mattin service
at the close of the nocturnal vigils, which they are accustomed to finish after the cockcrowing
and before dawn, these they still sing in like manner; viz., Ps. 148, beginning “O
praise the Lord from heaven,” and the rest which follow; but the 50th Psalm and the 62nd,
and the 89th have, we know, been assigned to this new service. Lastly, throughout Italy at
this day, when the Mattin hymns are ended, the 50th Psalm is sung in all the churches, which
I have no doubt can only have been derived from this source.</p>
<note type="footnote">212 I.e., Prime. Some confusion is likely to be caused by the fact that Cassian speaks of both “Lauds” and
“Prime” by the same title of Mattins. Immediately below, where he speaks of the “Mattin service at the close of
the nocturnal vigils” he is referring to Lauds, which always followed immediately (or after a very short interval)
after Nocturns, or Mattins. At this service Pss. cxlviii.–cl. have always been sung, indeed, they form the characteristic
feature which gives the service its name of “Lauds” (οἱ ἆινοι). Of the other three Psalms, l. (li.), lxii.
(lxiii.), and lxxxix. (xc.), which Cassian says had been transferred from Lauds to the newly instituted service of
Prime, lxii. has been already spoken of as a morning hymn of the early Church (see the notes on c. iii.), and we
learn from S. Basil that in his day Ps. l. (ὁ τἠς ἐξομολογήσεως ψαλμός) was regularly sung after Mattins when
the day began to break (Ep. ccvii. ad clericos Neo-Cæs.), and it is still a Lauds Psalm in both East and West. lxxxix.
(xc.) is now one of the fixed Psalms at Prime in the East, but in the West it is, according to the Roman rule, sung
at Lauds on Thursdays only. Thus it would appear that the transfer of these three Psalms from Lauds to Prime,
of which Cassian speaks, never obtained widely, but that the older arrangement, whereby, at any rate, l. and lxii.
were assigned to Lauds, has generally been adhered to both in the East and West. Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict,
according to which Ps. l. is sung daily at Lauds, and lxii. as well on Sundays (c. xii., xiii.).</note>

<head>How one who does not come to the daily prayer before the end of the first Psalm is not allowed
to enter the Oratory; but at Nocturnes a late arrival up to the end of the second Psalm
can be overlooked.</head>
<p>But one who at Tierce, Sext, or None has not come to prayer before the Psalm is begun
and finished does not venture further to enter the Oratory nor to join himself to those
singing the Psalms; but, standing outside, he awaits the breaking-up of the congregation,214
and while they are all coming out does penance lying on the ground, and obtains absolution
for his carelessness and lateness, knowing that he can in no other way expiate the fault of
his sloth, nor can ever be admitted to the service which will follow three hours later, unless
he has been quick to make satisfaction at once for his present negligence by the help of true
humility. But in the nocturnal assemblies a late arrival up to the second Psalm is allowed,
provided that before the Psalm is finished and the brethren bow down in prayer he makes
haste to take his place in the congregation and join them; but he will most certainly be subjected
to the same blame and penance which we mentioned before if he has delayed ever so
little beyond the hour permitted for a late arrival.215</p>
<note type="footnote">214 Congregationis missam.</note>
<note type="footnote">215 The Rule of S. Benedict has similar provisions, allowing a late arrival at Mattins till the Gloria after the
Venite (the second Psalm, as it is preceded by Ps. iii.), and at the other services till the Gloria after the first Psalm.
“If any come later than this, he is not to take his usual place in the choir, but stand last of all, or take whatever
place the Abbot may have appointed for those who are guilty of a similar neglect, so that he may be seen of all;
and in this place he is to remain until he shall have made public satisfaction, at the end of the office. We deem
it necessary,” the Rule proceeds, “to place such offenders thus apart, that, being thus exposed to the view of all
their brethren, they may be shamed into a sense of duty. Moreover, if such were allowed to remain outside the
church, they might either sit down at their ease, or while away their time in chatting, or perhaps return to the
dormitory and compose themselves to sleep and thus expose themselves to the temptations of the enemy.” Rule
of S. Benedict, c. xliii.</note>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the Vigil service which is celebrated on the evening preceding the Sabbath; of its length,
and the manner in which it is observed.</head>
<p>In the winter time, however, when the nights are longer, the Vigils,216 which are celebrated
every week on the evening at the commencing the Sabbath, are arranged by the elders
in the monasteries to last till the fourth cock-crowing, for this reason, viz., that after the
watch through the whole night they may, by resting their bodies for the remaining time of
nearly two hours, avoid flagging through drowsiness the whole day long, and be content
with repose for this short time instead of resting the whole night. And it is proper for us,
too, to observe this with the utmost care, that we may be content with the sleep which is allowed
us after the office of Vigils up to daybreak,—i.e., till the Mattin Psalms,217—and afterwards
spend the whole day in work and necessary duties, lest through weariness from
the Vigils, and feebleness, we might be forced to take by day the sleep which we cut off from
the night, and so be thought not to have cut short our bodily rest so much as to have changed
our time for repose and nightly retirement. For our feeble flesh could not possibly be defrauded
of the whole night’s rest and yet keep its vigour unshaken throughout the following
day without sleepiness of mind and heaviness of spirit, as it will be hindered rather than
helped by this unless after Vigils are over it enjoys a short slumber. And, therefore, if, as we
have suggested, at least an hour’s sleep is snatched before daybreak, we shall save all the
hours of Vigils which we have spent all through the night in prayer, granting to nature what
is due to it, and having no necessity of taking back by day what we have cut off from the
night. For a man will certainly have to give up everything to this flesh if he tries, not in a
rational manner to withhold a part only, but to refuse the whole, and (to speak candidly) is
anxious to cut off not what is superfluous but what is necessary. Wherefore Vigils have to
be made up for with greater interest if they are prolonged with ill-considered and unreasonable
length till daybreak. And so they divide them into an office in three parts, that by this
variety the effort may be distributed and the exhaustion of the body relieved by some
agreeable relaxation. For when standing they have sung three Psalms antiphonally,218 after
this, sitting on the ground or in very low stalls, one of them repeats three Psalms, while the
rest respond, each Psalm being assigned to one of the brethren, who succeed each other in
<note type="footnote">216 Vigiliæ is here used as the equivalent of Nocturns.</note>

<pb n="453"/>
turn; and to these they add three lessons while still sitting quietly. And so, by lessening their
bodily exertion, they manage to observe their Vigils with greater attention of mind.219</p>
<note type="footnote">219 In this chapter Cassian describes two of the different methods of Psalmody employed in the ancient
Church: (1) Antiphonal singing, where the congregation was divided into two parts, or choirs, which sang alternate
verses; (2) the method according to which one voice alone sang the first part of the verse, and the rest
of the congregation joined in at the close. Both methods are described in a well-known passage in an Epistle of
S. Basil (Ep. ccvii. ad clericos Neocoes), where he tells us that in the morning service, at one time the people divide
themselves into two parties and sing antiphonally to each other (ἀντιψάλλουσιν ἀλλήλοις), while at another
time they entrust to one person the duty of beginning the strain, and the rest respond (ὐπηχοῦσι). This latter
method seems to have been a very favourite one, the Psalms which were thus sung being called Responsoria. See
Isidore, De Offic., i. 8; and compare the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Vol. II. p. 1745; and Bingham, Antiquities,
Book XIV. c. i. A third method has been already described by Cassian in Book II. c. xi.; viz., that called
Tractus, where the Psalm was executed by a single voice, while all the rest of the congregation listened.</note>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>The reason why a Vigil is appointed as the Sabbath day dawns, and why a dispensation from
fasting is enjoyed on the Sabbath all through the East.</head>
<p>And throughout the whole of the East it has been settled, ever since the time of the
preaching of the Apostles, when the Christian faith and religion was founded, that these
Vigils should be celebrated as the Sabbath dawns,220 for this reason,—because, when our
Lord and Saviour had been crucified on the sixth day of the week, the disciples, overwhelmed
by the freshness of His sufferings, remained watching throughout the whole night, giving
no rest or sleep to their eyes. Wherefore, since that time, a service of Vigils has been appointed
for this night, and is still observed in the same way up to the present day all through the
East. And so, after the exertion of the Vigil, a dispensation from fasting, appointed in like
manner for the Sabbath by apostolic men,221 is not without reason enjoined in all the
churches of the East, in accordance with that saying of Ecclesiastes, which, although it has
another and a mystical sense, is not misapplied to this, by which we are charged to give to
both days—that is, to the seventh and eighth equally—the same share of the service, as it
says: “Give a portion to these seven and also to these eight.”222 For this dispensation from
fasting must not be understood as a participation in the Jewish festival by those above all
who are shown to be free from all Jewish superstition, but as contributing to that rest of the
wearied body of which we have spoken; which, as it fasts continually for five days in the
week all through the year, would easily be worn out and fail, unless it were revived by an
interval of at least two days.</p>
<note type="footnote">220 The observance of a vigil for the whole or greater part of the night was a regular part of the preparation
for the greater festivals, and as such was usual in the East before the Sabbath (Saturday) and Lord’s Day, as well
as Pentecost and Easter. See Socrates, H. E. VI. viii., where there is an allusion to this.</note>
<note type="footnote">221 Saturday, as well as Sunday, was long regarded as a festival in the East, and, indeed, originally in most
churches of the West as well. See the Apost. Const. II. lix. 1; VIII. xxxiii. 1. Apost. Canons lxvi.; Council of
Laodicæa, Canons xvi., xlix., li.</note>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>How it was brought about that they fast on the Sabbath in the city.</head>
<p>But some people in some countries of the West, and especially in the city,223 not
knowing the reason of this indulgence, think that a dispensation from fasting ought certainly
not to be allowed on the Sabbath, because they say that on this day the Apostle Peter fasted
before his encounter with Simon.224 But from this it is quite clear that he did this not in
accordance with a canonical rule, but rather through the needs of his impending struggle.
Since there, too, for the same purpose, Peter seems to have imposed on his disciples not a
general but a special fast, which he certainly would not have done if he had known that it
was wont to be observed by canonical rule: just as he would surely have been ready to appoint
it even on Sunday, if the occasion of his struggle had fallen upon it: but no canonical rule
of fasting would have been made general from this, because it was no general observance
that led to it, but a matter of necessity, which forced it to be observed on a single occasion.</p>
<note type="footnote">223 Viz., Rome.</note>
<note type="footnote">224 The Saturday fast was observed at Rome in very early days, being noticed by Tertullian, who seems to
suggest that it originated in the prolongation of the Friday fast (on Fasting, c. xiv). But it seems to have been almost
peculiar to Rome, and at Milan, in the time of S. Ambrose, the Eastern custom prevailed. See the important letter
of Augustine to Casulanus (Ep. xxxvi.), where the whole subject of the difference of usage on this matter is fully
discussed. The reason here given by Cassian for the origin of the local Roman custom (viz., that S. Peter’s traditional
encounter with Simon Magus took place on Sunday, and was prepared for by the apostle with a Saturday
fast) is also there alluded to by Augustine as being the opinion of very many, though he tells us candidly that
most of the Romans thought it false. “Est quidem et hæc opinio plurimorum, quamvis eam perhibeant esse falsam
plerique Romani, quod Apostolus Petrus cum Simone Mago die dominico certaturo, propter ipsum magnæ
tentationis periculum, pridie cum ejusdem urbis ecclesia jejunaverit, et consecuto tam prospero gloriosoque
successu, eundem morem tenuerit, eumque imitatæ sunt nonnullæ Occidentis ecclesiæ.” Cf. also Augustine,

<head>Of the points in which the service held on Sunday differs from what is customary on other
days.</head>
<p>But we ought to know this, too, that on Sunday only one office225 is celebrated before
dinner, at which, out of regard for the actual service226 and the Lord’s communion, they
use a more solemn and a longer service of Psalms and prayers and lessons, and so consider
that Tierce and Sext are included in it. And hence it results that, owing to the addition of
the lessons, there is no diminution of the amount of their devotions, and yet some difference
is made, and an indulgence over other times seems to be granted to the brethren out of
reverence for the Lord’s resurrection; and this seems to lighten the observance all through
the week, and, by reason of the difference which is interposed, it makes the day to be looked
forward to more solemnly as a festival, and owing to the anticipation of it the fasts of the
coming week are less felt. For any weariness is always borne with greater equanimity, and
labour undertaken without aversion, if some variety is interposed or change of work succeeds.</p>

<head>Of the days on which, when supper is provided for the brethren, a Psalm is not said as they
assemble for the meals as is usual at dinner.</head>
<p>Lastly, also, on those days,—i.e., on Saturday and Sunday,—and on holy days, on which
it is usual for both dinner and supper to be provided for the brethren, a Psalm is not said
in the evening, either when they come to supper or when they rise from it, as is usual at
their ordinary dinner227 and the canonical refreshment on fast days, which the customary
Psalms usually precede and follow. But they simply make a plain prayer and come to supper,
and again, when they rise from it, conclude with prayer alone; because this repast is something
special among the monks: nor are they all obliged to come to it, but it is only for strangers
who have come to see the brethren, and those whom bodily weakness or their own inclination
invites to it.</p>
<note type="footnote">227 In sollemnibus prandiis. The phrase must here refer to their dinner on ordinary days (cf. solemnitatem
ciborum, “their usual food,” Book IV. c. xxi.). Among the early monks it was the custom ordinarily to have but
one meal a day on the fast days (viz., Wednesday and Friday); this was at the ninth hour; on other days, at the
sixth (i.e., midday). Cf. the Conferences XXI. c. xxiii. On festivals (viz., Saturday, Sunday, and holy days), beside
the midday meal a supper was allowed as well. And on these days, as we learn from the passage before us, the
ordinary grace before and after meat was shortened by the omission of the customary Psalms at other times included
in it. On the meals of the monks, cf. S. Jerome’s Preface to the Rule of Pachomius and the Rule of S. Benedict,
cc. xxxix.–xli., the former of which tells us that, except on Wednesday and Friday, dinner was at midday,
and a table was also set for labourers, old men, and children, and (apparently) for all, in the height of summer.

<p>From the canonical system of Psalms and prayers which ought to be observed in the

the training of one who renounces this world; endeavouring first, as well as we can, to embrace,
in a short account, the terms on which those who desire to turn to the Lord can be
received in the monasteries; adding some things from the rule of the Egyptians, some from
that of the monks of Tabenna,228 whose monastery in the Thebaid is better filled as regards
numbers, as it is stricter in the rigour of its system, than all others, for there are in it more
than five thousand brethren under the rule of one Abbot; and the obedience with which the
whole number of monks is at all times subject to one Elder is what no one among us would
render to another even for a short time, or would demand from him.</p>

before he gives, by lying outside the doors for ten days or even longer, an evidence of his
perseverance and desire, as well as of humility and patience. And when, prostrate at the feet
of all the brethren that pass by, and of set purpose repelled and scorned by all of them, as if
he was wanting to enter the monastery not for the sake of religion but because he was obliged;
and when, too, covered with many insults and affronts, he has given a practical proof of his
steadfastness, and has shown what he will be like in temptations by the way he has borne
the disgrace; and when, with the ardour of his soul thus ascertained, he is admitted, then
they enquire with the utmost care whether he is contaminated by a single coin from his
former possessions clinging to him. For they know that he cannot stay for long under the
discipline of the monastery, nor ever learn the virtue of humility and obedience, nor be
content with the poverty and difficult life of the monastery, if he knows that ever so small
a sum of money has been kept hid; but, as soon as ever a disturbance arises on some occasion
or other, he will at once dart off from the monastery like a stone from a sling, impelled to
this by trusting in that sum of money.229</p>
<note type="footnote">229 Cf. the Rule of Pachomius, c. xxvi.: “If any or comes to the door of the monastery wanting to renounce
the world and to join the number of the brethren, he shall not be allowed to enter, but the Abbot of the monastery
must first be told, and he shall stay for a few days outside before the gate, and shall be taught the Lord’s Prayer
and as many Psalms as he can learn, and shall diligently give proof of himself that he has not done any thing
wrong and fled in trouble for the time, and that he is not in any one’s power, and that he can forsake his relations
and disregard his property. And if they see that he is apt for everything, then he shall be taught the rest of the
rules of the monastery,—what he ought to do, whom he is to obey,” etc.; and, finally, he is to be admitted. See
also the Rule of S. Benedict, c. lviii., which is to much the same effect, and S. Basil’s Longer Monastic Rules, Q.
x.</note>

<head>The reason why those who are received in the monastery are not allowed to bring anything
in with them.</head>
<p>And for these reasons they do not agree to take from him money to be used even for
the good of the monastery: First, in case he may be puffed up with arrogance, owing to this
offering, and so not deign to put himself on a level with the poorer brethren; and next, lest
he fail through this pride of his to stoop to the humility of Christ, and so, when he cannot
hold out under the discipline of the monastery, leave it, and afterwards, when he has cooled
down, want in a bad spirit to receive and get back—not without loss to the monastery—what
he had contributed in the early days of his renunciation, when he was aglow with spiritual
fervour. And that this rule should always be kept they have been frequently taught by many
instances. For in some monasteries where they are not so careful some who have been received
unreservedly have afterwards tried most sacrilegiously to demand a return of that
which they had contributed and which had been spent on God’s work.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>The reason why those who give up the world, when they are received in the monasteries, must
lay aside their own clothes and be clothed in others by the Abbot.</head>
<p>Wherefore each one on his admission is stripped of all his former possessions, so that
he is not allowed any longer to keep even the clothes which he has on his back: but in the
council of the brethren he is brought forward into the midst and stripped of his own clothes,
and clad by the Abbot’s hands in the dress of the monastery, so that by this he may know
not only that he has been despoiled of all his old things, but also that he has laid aside all
worldly pride, and come down to the want and poverty of Christ, and that he is now to be
supported not by wealth sought for by the world’s arts, nor by anything reserved from his
former state of unbelief, but that he is to receive out of the holy and sacred funds of the
monastery his rations for his service; and that, as he knows that he is thence to be clothed
and fed and that he has nothing of his own, he may learn, nevertheless, not to be anxious
about the morrow, according to the saying of the Gospel, and may not be ashamed to be on
a level with the poor, that is with the body of the brethren, with whom Christ was not
ashamed to be numbered, and to call himself their brother, but that rather he may glory
that he has been made to share the lot of his own servants.230</p>
<note type="footnote">230 So the Rule of Pachomius (c. xxvi.) orders that on the admission of a monk “they shall strip him of his
secular dress, and put on him the garb of the monks;” and that of S. Benedict (c. lviii.), “He shall then be clothed
in the religious habit, and his secular clothes deposited in the wardrobe, that if, at the instigation of the devil,
he should ever leave the monastery, they may be given back to him, and the religious dress be taken from him.”</note>

<head>The reason why the clothes of the renunciants with which they joined the monastery are preserved
by the steward.</head>
<p>But those clothes, which he laid aside, are consigned to the care of the steward and kept
until by different sorts of temptations and trials they can recognize the excellence of his
progress and life and endurance. And if they see that he can continue therein as time goes
on, and remain in that fervour with which he began, they give them away to the poor. But
if they find that he has been guilty of any fault of murmuring, or of even the smallest piece
of disobedience, then they strip off from him the dress of the monastery in which he had
been clad, and reclothe him in his old garments which had been confiscated, and send him
away.231 For it is not right for him to go away with those which he had received, nor do
they allow any one to be any longer dressed in them if they have seen him once grow cold
in regard to the rule of their institution. Wherefore, also, the opportunity of going out openly
is not given to any one, unless he escapes like a runaway slave by taking advantage of the
thickest shades of night, or is judged unworthy of this order and profession and lays aside
the dress of the monastery and is expelled with shame and disgrace before all the brethren.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>The reason why those who are admitted to a monastery are not permitted to mix at once with
the congregation of the brethren, but are first committed to the guest house.</head>
<p>When, then, any one has been received and proved by that persistence of which we have
spoken, and, laying aside his own garments, has been clad in those of the monastery, he is
not allowed to mix at once with the congregation of the brethren, but is given into the charge
of an Elder, who lodges apart not far from the entrance of the monastery, and is entrusted
with the care of strangers and guests, and bestows all his diligence in receiving them kindly.
And when he has served there for a whole year without any complaint, and has given evidence
of service towards strangers,232 being thus initiated in the first rudiments of humility and
patience, and by long practice in it acknowledged, when he is to be admitted from this into
the congregation of the brethren he is handed over to another Elder, who is placed over ten
of the juniors, who are entrusted to him by the Abbot, and whom he both teaches and governs
in accordance with the arrangement which we read of in Exodus as made by Moses.233</p>
<note type="footnote">232 In the same way the Rule of S. Benedict (c. lviii.) directs that the novice is to be placed in the guest house
for a few days, while that of S. Isidore is more precise in ordering him to be placed there “for three months,”
and to wait on the guests there. Two months is the period fixed by other rules, but a few days was all that was
ultimately required, and Cassian stands alone in mentioning a full year as the duration of this service, though
Sozomen speaks of the monks of Tabenna as having to undergo a probation of three years. H. E., III. xiv.</note>
<note type="footnote">233 Cf. Exod. xviii. 25. The office of “Dean” (Decanus) which is here spoken of by Cassian, is also referred to
by Augustine (De Mor. Eccl. xxxi.) and Jerome (Ep. xxii. ad Eustoch.), and recognized by the Rule of S. Benedict,
c. xxi., where directions for his appointment are given.</note>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the practices in which the juniors are first exercised that they may become proficient in
overcoming all their desires.</head>
<p>And his anxiety and the chief part of his instruction—through which the juniors brought
to him may be able in due course to mount to the greatest heights of perfection—will be to
teach him first to conquer his own wishes; and, anxiously and diligently practising him in
this, he will of set purpose contrive to give him such orders as he knows to be contrary to
his liking; for, taught by many examples, they say that a monk, and especially the younger
ones, cannot bridle the desire of his concupiscence unless he has first learnt by obedience
to mortify his wishes. And so they lay it down that the man who has not first learnt to
overcome his desires cannot possibly stamp out anger or sulkiness, or the spirit of fornication;
nor can he preserve true humility of heart, or lasting unity with the brethren, or a stable and
continuous concord; nor remain for any length of time in the monastery.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"> 
<pb n="467"/>
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>The reason why the juniors are enjoined not to keep back any of their thoughts from the
senior.</head>
<p>By these practices, then, they hasten to impress and instruct those whom they are
training with the alphabet, as it were, and first syllables in the direction of perfection, as
they can clearly see by these whether they are grounded in a false and imaginary or in a true
humility. And, that they may easily arrive at this, they are next taught not to conceal by a
false shame any itching thoughts in their hearts, but, as soon as ever such arise, to lay them
bare to the senior, and, in forming a judgment about them, not to trust anything to their
own discretion, but to take it on trust that that is good or bad which is considered and pronounced
so by the examination of the senior. Thus it results that our cunning adversary
cannot in any way circumvent a young and inexperienced monk, or get the better of his ignorance,
or by any craft deceive one whom he sees to be protected not by his own discretion
but by that of his senior, and who cannot be persuaded to hide from his senior those suggestions
of his which like fiery darts he has shot into his heart; since the devil, subtle as he is,
cannot ruin or destroy a junior unless he has enticed him either through pride or through
shame to conceal his thoughts. For they lay it down as an universal and clear proof that a
thought is from the devil if we are ashamed to disclose it to the senior.234</p>
<note type="footnote">234 Compare the Conferences, Book II. c. x., where Cassian returns to the same subject. A similar rule that
the brethren are to lay bare all the secrets of their hearts to their superior is given, by S. Basil in the Longer
Monastic Rules, Q. xxvi., and in the Rule of S. Isaiah (cc. vi., xliii.), printed in Holsten’s Codex Regularum, Vol.
I.</note>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>How thorough is the obedience of the juniors even in those things which are matters of common
necessity.</head>
<p>Next, the rule is kept with such strict obedience that, without the knowledge and permission
of their superior, the juniors not only do not dare to leave their cell but on their
own authority do not venture to satisfy their common and natural needs. And so they are
quick to fulfil without any discussion all those things that are ordered by him, as if they were
commanded by God from heaven;235 so that sometimes, when impossibilities are commanded
them, they undertake them with such faith and devotion as to strive with all their powers
and without the slightest hesitation to fulfil them and carry them out; and out of reverence
for their senior they do not even consider whether a command is an impossibility.236 But
of their obedience I omit at present to speak more particularly, for we propose to speak of
it in the proper place a little later on, with instances of it, if through your prayers the Lord
carry us safely through. We now proceed to the other regulations, passing over all account
of those which cannot be imposed on or kept in the monasteries in this country, as we
promised to do in our Preface; for instance, how they never use woollen garments, but only
cotton, and these not double, changes of which each superior gives out to the ten monks
under his care when he sees that those which they are wearing are dirty.</p>
<note type="footnote">235 Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict, c. v., where it is said that “the first degree of humility is ready obedience. This
is peculiar to those who…prefer nothing to Christ, and fulfil the injunctions of their superiors as promptly as
if God Himself had given them the command,” etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">236 The Rule of S. Benedict has a chapter to explain what is to be done if a brother is commanded to perform
impossibilities (c. lxviii.). “If a brother is commanded to do anything that is difficult, or even impossible, let him
receive the command with all meekness and obedience; meanwhile, should he see that he is utterly unequal to
the task laid upon him, let him represent the matter to his superior calmly and respectfully, without pride, resistance,
or contradiction. If the superior, after hearing what he has to say, still insists on the execution of the
command, let the junior be persuaded that it is for his spiritual good, and accordingly trusting in God’s assistance,
let him for His love undertake the work.”</note>

water, is set on the table for the repast of the brethren; and many other things like this, which
in this country neither the climate nor the weakness of our constitution would permit. And

<head>How they leave off every kind of work at the sound of some one knocking at the door, in their
eagerness to answer at once.</head>
<p>And so, sitting in their cells and devoting their energies equally to work and to meditation,
when they hear the sound of some one knocking at the door and striking on the cells
of each, summoning them to prayer or some work, every one eagerly dashes out from his
cell, so that one who is practising the writer’s art, although he may have just begun to form
a letter, does not venture to finish it, but runs out with the utmost speed, at the very moment
when the sound of the knocking reaches his ears, without even waiting to finish the letter
he has begun; but, leaving the lines of the letter incomplete, he aims not at abridging and
saving his labour, but rather hastens with the utmost earnestness and zeal to attain the virtue
of obedience, which they put not merely before manual labour and reading and silence and
quietness in the cell, but even before all virtues, so that they consider that everything should
be postponed to it, and are content to undergo any amount of inconvenience if only it may
be seen that they have in no way neglected this virtue.238</p>
<note type="footnote">238 Cf. the Rule of S. Benedict, c. v.: “Those who choose to tread the path that leads to life eternal immediately
quit their private occupations at the call of obedience, and, renouncing their own will so far as to cast away unfinished
out of their hands whatever they may be occupied with, hasten to execute the orders of their superiors,”

<head>How wrong it is considered for any one to say that anything, however trifling, is his own.</head>
<p>Among their other practices I fancy that it is unnecessary even to mention this virtue,
viz., that no one is allowed to possess a box or basket as his special property, nor any such
thing which he could keep as his own and secure with his own seal, as we are well aware
that they are in all respects stripped so bare that they have nothing whatever except their
shirt, cloak, shoes, sheepskin, and rush mat;239 for in other monasteries as well, where some
indulgence and relaxation is granted, we see that this rule is still most strictly kept, so that
no one ventures to say even in word that anything is his own: and it is a great offence if there
drops from the mouth of a monk such an expression as “my book,” “my tablets,” “my pen,”
“my coat,” or “my shoes;” and for this he would have to make satisfaction by a proper penance,
if by accident some such expression escaped his lips through thoughtlessness or ignorance.</p>
<note type="footnote">239 Psiathium. The rush mats which served as a seat by day and a bed by night for the monks. See Book V.
xxxv., and the Conferences I. xxiii.; XV. i.; XVII. iii.; XVIII. xi. S. Jerome mentions it in his preface to the Rule
of Pachomius as one of the very few articles contained in the cells of the monks of Tabenna. “They have nothing
in their cells except a mat and what is described below: two ‘lebitonaria,’ a kind of garment without sleeves which
the Egyptian monks use (the colobium, or shirt), one old one for sleeping or working, a linen garment and two
hoods, a sheepskin, a linen girdle, shoes, and a staff.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How, even if a large sum of money is amassed by the labour of each, still no one may venture
to exceed the moderate limit of what is appointed as adequate.</head>
<p>And although each one of them may bring in daily by his work and labour so great a
return to the monastery that he could out of it not only satisfy his own moderate demands
but could also abundantly supply the wants of many, yet he is no way puffed up, nor does
he flatter himself on account of his toil and this large gain from his labour, but, except two
biscuits,240 which are sold there for scarcely threepence, no one thinks that he has a right
to anything further. And among them there is nothing (and I am ashamed to say this, and
heartily wish it was unknown in our own monasteries) which is claimed by any of them, I
will not say in deed but even in thought, as his special property. And though he believes
that the whole granary of the monastery forms his substance, and, as lord of all, devotes his
whole care and energy to it all, yet nevertheless, in order to maintain that excellent state of
want and poverty which he has secured and which he strives to preserve to the very last in
unbroken perfection, he regards himself as a foreigner and an alien to them all, so that he
conducts himself as a stranger and a sojourner in this world, and considers himself a pupil
of the monastery and a servant instead of imagining that he is lord and master of anything.</p>
<note type="footnote">240 Paxamatium, a biscuit. The word comes from the Greek παξαμάδιον, and is said to be derived from the
name of a baker, Παξαμός (see Liddell and Scott, c. v.). These biscuits formed an important part of the diet of
the Egyptian monks, as we see from the Conferences, where they are often mentioned; e.g., II. xi, xix., xxiv.,

<head>Of the excessive desire of possession among us.</head>
<p>To this what shall we wretched creatures say, who though living in Coenobia and established

trampling under foot all feeling of shame and disgrace which should spring from our profession,
are not ashamed actually to wear openly upon our fingers rings with which to seal
what we have stored up; and in whose case not merely boxes and baskets, but not even chests
and closets are sufficient for those things which we collect or which we reserved when we
forsook the world; and who sometimes get so angry over trifles and mere nothings (to which
however we lay claim as if they were our own) that if any one dares to lay a finger on any
of them, we are so filled with rage against him that we cannot keep the wrath of our heart
from being expressed on our lips and in bodily excitement. But, passing by our faults and
treating with silence those things of which it is a shame even to speak, according to this
saying: “My mouth shall not speak the deeds of men,”241 let us in accordance with the
method of our narration which we have begun proceed to those virtues which are practised
among them, and which we ought to aim at with all earnestness; and let us briefly and
hastily set down the actual rules and systems that afterwards, coming to some of the deeds
and acts of the elders which we propose carefully to preserve for recollection, we may support

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>On the rules for various rebukes.</head>
<p>If then any one by accident breaks an earthenware jar (which they call “baucalis”), he
can only expiate his carelessness by public penance; and when all the brethren are assembled
for service he must lie on the ground and ask for absolution until the service of the prayers
is finished; and will obtain it when by the Abbot’s command he is bidden to rise from the
ground. The same satisfaction must be given by one who when summoned to some work
or to the usual service comes rather late, or who when singing a Psalm hesitates ever so little.
Similarly if he answers unnecessarily or roughly or impertinently, if he is careless in carrying
out the services enjoined to him, if he makes a slight complaint, if preferring reading to
work or obedience he is slow in performing his appointed duties, if when service is over he
does not make haste to go back at once to his cell, if he stops for ever so short a time with
some one else, if he goes anywhere else even for a moment, if he takes any one else by the
hand, if he ventures to discuss anything however small with one who is not the joint-occupant
of his cell,242 if he prays with one who is suspended from prayer, if he sees any of his relations
or friends in the world and talks with them without his senior, if he tries to receive a letter
from any one or to write back without his Abbot’s leave.243 To such an extent does spiritual
censure proceed and in such matters and faults like these. But as for other things which
when indiscriminately committed among us are treated by us too as blameworthy, viz.: open
<note type="footnote">242 From this passage we gather that in Egypt two monks were often the joint occupants of a single cell. Cf.
II. xii. and Conference XX. i., ii.</note>
<note type="footnote">243 Many of these faults are noticed in the Rule of Pachomius as deserving censure, e.g., unpunctuality at or
carelessness in service (c. viii. ix.), breaking anything (c. cxxv.), murmuring (lxxxvii.), taking the hand of another
(xliv.). So also in the Rule of S. Benedict (cc. xliii.–xlvi.) similar directions are given, while in c. xliv. the nature
of the penance is more fully described. He who in punishment of a grievous fault has been excluded from the
Refectory and the Church, shall lie prostrate at the door of the latter at the end of each office, and shall there
remain in silence with his forehead touching the ground, until the brethren retiring from church have all walked
over him. This penance he shall continue to perform till it be announced to him that he has made due satisfaction.
When commended by the Abbot to appear before him, he shall go and cast himself at his feet and then at the
feet of all the brethren, begging of them to pray for him. He shall then be admitted to the choir, if the Abbot so
order, and shall take there whatever place he may assign him: but let him not presume to intone a Psalm, read
a lesson or perform any similar duty, without the special permission of the Abbot. He shall, moreover, prostrate
himself in his place in choir at the end of every office, until the Abbot tells him to discontinue this penance.
Those who for light faults are excluded merely from the common table, shall make satisfaction in the church
according as the Abbot shall direct, and shall continue to do so until he gives them his blessing and tells them
that they have made sufficient atonement.</note>

wrangling, manifest contempt, arrogant contradictions, going out from the monastery freely
and without check, familiarity with women, wrath, quarrelling, jealousies, disputes, claiming
something as one’s own property, the infection of covetousness, the desire and acquisition
of unnecessary things which are not possessed by the rest of the brethren, taking food
between meals and by stealth, and things like these—they are dealt with not by that spiritual

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Of those who introduced the plan that the holy Lessons should be read in the Coenobia while
the brethren are eating, and of the strict silence which is kept among the Egyptians.</head>
<p>But we have been informed that the plan that, while the brethren are eating, the holy
lessons should be read in the Coenobia did not originate in the Egyptian system but in the
Cappadocian. And there is no doubt that they meant to establish it not so much for the sake
of the spiritual exercise as for the sake of putting a stop to unnecessary and idle conversation,
and especially discussions, which so often arise at meals; since they saw that these could not
be prevented among them in any other way.244 For among the Egyptians and especially
those of Tabenna so strict a silence is observed by all that when so large a number of the
brethren has sat down together to a meal, no one ventures to talk even in a low tone except
the dean, who however if he sees that anything is wanted to be put on or taken off the table,
signifies it by a sign rather than a word. And while they are eating, the rule of this silence is
so strictly kept that with their hoods drawn down over their eyelids (to prevent their roving
looks having the opportunity of wandering inquisitively) they can see nothing except the
table, and the food that is put on it, and which they take from it; so that no one notices what
another is eating.245</p>
<note type="footnote">244 It is quite in keeping with what is here said by Cassian that in the Rule of Pachomius there is no mention
of reading at meals, but only of the strict silence observed, so that anything wanted might not be asked for but
only indicated by a sign (cc. xxxi., xxxiii.), while in the shorter Monastic Rules of S. Basil the custom of reading
at meals is distinctly alluded to (Q. clxxx.). It is of course also ordered in most of the later monastic rules, e.g.
that of Cesarius of Arles “ad Monachos” c. xlix., “ad Virgines” c. xvi.; that of S. Aurelian, c. xlix.; S. Isidore, c.
x., and S. Benedict, c. xxxviii. The regulations in the last mentioned are as follows:—“A book should be read in
the Refectory while the brethren are at meals. Let no one presume to read of his own accord; but let there be
one appointed to perform that duty, who, commencing on Sunday, will read during the entire week…Profound
silence shall be observed during meals, so that no voice save that of the reader may be heard. The brethren will
so help each other to what is necessary as regards food and drink that no one may have occasion to ask for
anything; should, however, anything be wanted, let it be asked for by sign rather than word. Let no one presume
to make any observation either on what is being read or on any other subject, lest occasion be given to the enemy.
The Prior, however, should he think fit, may say a few words to edify the brethren.”</note>

heads.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>How it is against the rule for any one to take anything to eat or drink except at the common
table.</head>
<p>In between their regular meals in common they are especially careful that no one should
presume to gratify his palate with any food:246 so that when they are walking casually through
gardens or orchards, when the fruit hanging enticingly on the trees not only knocks against
their breasts as they pass through, but is also lying on the ground and offering itself to be
trampled under foot, and (as it is all ready to be gathered) would easily be able to entice
those who see it to gratify their appetite, and by the chance offered to them and the quantity
of the fruit, to excite even the most severe and abstemious to long for it; still they consider
it wrong not merely to taste a single fruit, but even to touch one with the hand, except what
is put on the table openly for the common meal of all, and supplied publicly by the steward’s
catering through the service of the brethren, for their enjoyment.</p>
<note type="footnote">246 Similarly we find in the Rule of Pachomius that no one is allowed to keep any food in his cell besides what
he receives from the steward (c. lxxix.): and the Benedictine Rule also says: “Let no one presume to take any
food or drink out of the regular hours of meals” (c. xliii). Cf. also the Rule of Pachomius cc. lxxv. and lxxviii., S.
Basil’s longer Monastic Rules Q. xv., ῞Αψατο βρωμάτων παρὰ καιρόν; ἐπὶ πλεῖστον τῆς ἡμέρας ἀπόσιτος ἔστω,

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>How throughout Palestine and Mesopotamia a daily service is undertaken by the brethren.</head>
<p>In order that we may not appear to omit any of the Institutes of the Coenobia I think
that it should be briefly mentioned that in other countries as well there is a daily service
undertaken by the brethren. For throughout the whole of Mesopotamia, Palestine, and
Cappadocia and all the East the brethren succeed one another in turn every week for the
performance of certain duties, so that the number serving is told off according to the whole
number of monks in the Coenobium. And they hasten to fulfil these duties with a zeal and
humility such as no slave bestows on his service even to a most harsh and powerful master;
so that not satisfied only with these services which are rendered by canonical rule, they actually
rise by night in their zeal and relieve those whose special duty this is; and secretly
anticipating them try to finish those duties which these others would have to do. But each
one who undertakes these weeks is on duty and has to serve until supper on Sunday, and
when this is done, his duty for the whole week is finished, so that, when all the brethren
come together to chant the Psalms (which according to custom they sing before going to
bed) those whose turn is over wash the feet of all in turn, seeking faithfully from them the
reward of this blessing for their work during the whole week, that the prayers offered up by
all the brethren together may accompany them as they fulfil the command of Christ, the
prayer, to wit, that intercedes for their ignorances and for their sins committed through
human frailty, and may commend to God the complete service of their devotion like some
rich offering. And so on Monday after the Mattin hymns they hand over to others who take
their place the vessels and utensils with which they have ministered, which these receive
and keep with the utmost care and anxiety, that none of them may be injured or destroyed,
as they believe that even for the smallest vessels they must give an account, as sacred things,
not only to a present steward, but to the Lord, if by chance any of them is injured through
their carelessness. And what limit there is to this discipline, and what fidelity and care there
is in keeping it up, you may see from one instance which I will give as an example. For while
we are anxious to satisfy that fervour of yours through which you ask for a full account of
everything, and want even what you know perfectly well to be repeated to you in this treatise,
we are also afraid of exceeding the limits of brevity.247</p>
<note type="footnote">247 The weekly officers here spoken of were termed “Hebdomadarii” (see the next chapter). According to
most rules their duties included cooking, serving, and reading at meals. They are mentioned in S. Jerome’s
preface to the Rule of Pachomius (cf. also Ep. xxii. ad Eustochium), but it would appear from what Cassian says
below in c. xxii. that in Egypt the office of cook was assigned to some one brother and not undertaken by all in
turn. According to Cassian they entered upon office on Monday morning but the Benedictine (c. xxxv.) and
other rules speak of them as beginning their duties on Sunday morning. The custom of washing the feet of the
brethren, which Cassian here describes, is also mentioned by S. Benedict. l. c.</note>

<head>Of the three lentil beans which the Steward found.</head>
<p>During the week of a certain brother the steward passing by saw lying on the ground
three lentil beans which had slipped out of the hand of the monk on duty for the week248
as he was hastily preparing them for cooking, together with the water in which he was
washing them; and immediately he consulted the Abbot on the subject; and by him the
monk was adjudged a pilferer and careless about sacred property, and so was suspended
from prayer. And the offence of his negligence was only pardoned when he had atoned for
it by public penance. For they believe not only that they themselves are not their own, but
also that everything that they possess is consecrated to the Lord. Wherefore if anything
whatever has once been brought into the monastery they hold that it ought to be treated
with the utmost reverence as an holy thing. And they attend to and arrange everything with
great fidelity, even in the case of things which are considered unimportant or regarded as
common and paltry, so that if they change their position and put them in a better place, or
if they fill a bottle with water, or give anybody something to drink out of it, or if they remove
a little dust from the oratory or from their cell they believe with implicit faith that they will
receive a reward from the Lord.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of the spontaneous service of some of the brethren.</head>
<p>We have been told of brethren in whose week there was such a scarcity of wood that
they had not enough to prepare the usual food for the brethren; and when it had been
ordered by the Abbot’s authority that until more could be brought and fetched, they should
content themselves with dried food,249 though this was agreed to by all and no one could
expect any cooked food; still these men as if they were cheated of the fruit and reward of
their labour and service, if they did not prepare the food for their brethren according to
custom in the order of their turn—imposed upon themselves such uncalled-for labour and
care that in those dry and sterile regions where wood cannot possibly be procured unless it
is cut from the fruit trees (for there are no wild shrubs found there as with us), they wander
about through the wide deserts, and traversing the wilderness which stretches towards the
Dead Sea,250 collect in their lap and the folds of their dress the scanty stubble and brambles
which the wind carries hither and thither, and so by their voluntary service prepare all their
usual food for the brethren, so that they suffer nothing to be diminished of the ordinary
supply; discharging these duties of theirs towards their brethren with such fidelity that
though the scarcity of wood and the Abbot’s order would be a fair excuse for them, yet still
out of regard for their profit and reward they will not take advantage of this liberty.</p>

<head>The system of the Egyptians, which is appointed for the daily service of the brethren.</head>
<p>These things have been told in accordance with the system, as we remarked before, of
the whole East, which also we say should be observed as a matter of course in our own
country. But among the Egyptians whose chief care is for work there is not the mutual
change of weekly service, for fear lest owing to the requirements of office they might all be
hindered from keeping the rule of work. But one of the most approved brethren is given
the care of the larder and kitchen, and he takes charge of that office for good and all as long
as his strength and years permit. For he is exhausted by no great bodily labour, because no
great care is expended among them in preparing food or in cooking, as they so largely make
use of dried and uncooked food,251 and among them the leaves of leeks cut each month,
and cherlock, table salt,252 olives, tiny little salt fish which they call sardines,253 form the
greatest delicacy.</p>
<note type="footnote">251 The distinction between the xerophagia and omophagia is shown by the following passage from S. Jerome’s
Life of Hilarion describing his food: “From his twenty-first year to his twenty-seventh for three years.…his food
was dry bread and water (xerophagia). Further from his twenty-seventh to his thirtieth year he supported himself
on wild herbs, and the raw roots of certain plants (omophagia).”</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>The obedience of Abbot John by which he was exalted even to the grace of prophecy.</head>
<p>And since this book is about the training of one who renounces this world, whereby,
making a beginning of true humility and perfect obedience, he may be enabled to ascend
the heights of the other virtues as well, I think it well to set down just by way of specimen,
as we promised, some of the deeds of the elders whereby they excelled in this virtue, selecting
a few only out of many instances, that, if any are anxious to aim at still greater heights, they
may not only receive from these an incitement towards the perfect life, but may also be
furnished with a model of what they purpose. Wherefore, to make this book as short as
possible we will produce and set down two or three out of the whole number of the Fathers;
and first of all Abbot John who lived near Lycon254 which is a town in the Thebaid; and
who was exalted even to the grace of prophecy for his admirable obedience, and was so
celebrated all the world over that he was by his merits rendered famous even among kings
of this world. For though, as we said, he lived in the most remote parts of the Thebaid, still
the Emperor Theodosius did not venture to declare war against the most powerful tyrants
before he was encouraged by his utterances and replies: trusting in which as if they had been
brought to him from heaven he gained victories over his foes in battles which seemed
hopeless.255</p>
<note type="footnote">254 Lycon or Lycopolis in the Thebaid is the modern El Syout on the west banks of the Nile, S. E. of Hermopolis
( = Minieh).</note>
<note type="footnote">255 This John of Lycopolis was one of the most celebrated hermits of the fourth century. Originally a carpenter,
he retired at the age of twenty-five into the wilderness, and after the death of his instructor settled near Lycopolis.
Here, as Cassian tells us, he received as reward for his obedience the gift of prophecy, and was consulted by
crowds who came to him for this purpose and among others by the Emperor Theodosius, to whom he foretold
(1) his victory over the usurper Maximus (a.d. 388), and (2) his success against Eugenius in a.d. 395. He is
mentioned again by Cassian in the Conferences I. xxi., XXIV. xxvi., etc. A full account of him is given by Rufinus
in his history of the monks c. i. and by Palladius in the Lausiac History 43–60; he is also mentioned by Augustine
De Civitate Dei, Book V. c. xxvi, De Cura pro mortius gerenda, c. xvii., and Jerome Ep. cxxxiii. ad Ctesiphontem,
as well as by Theodoret H. E. V. xxiv, and Sozomen H. E. VI. xxviii.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>Of the dry stick which, at the bidding of his senior, Abbot John kept on watering as if it would
grow.</head>
<p>And so this blessed John from his youth up even to a full and ripe age of manhood was
subject to his senior as long as he continued living in this world, and carried out his commands
with such humility that his senior himself was utterly astounded at his obedience;
and as he wanted to make sure whether this virtue came from genuine faith and profound
simplicity of heart, or whether it was put on and as it were constrained and only shown in
the presence of the bidder, he often laid upon him many superfluous and almost unnecessary
or even impossible commands. From which I will select three to show to those who wish to
know how perfect was his disposition and subjection. For the old man took from his
woodstack a stick which had previously been cut and got ready to make the fire with, and
which, as no opportunity for cooking had come, was lying not merely dry but even mouldy
from the lapse of time. And when he had stuck it into the ground before his very eyes, he
ordered him to fetch water and to water it twice a day that by this daily watering it might
strike roots and be restored to life as a tree, as it was before, and spread out its branches and
afford a pleasant sight to the eyes as well as a shade for those who sat under it in the heat of
summer. And this order the lad received with his customary veneration, never considering
its impossibility, and day by day carried it out so that he constantly carried water for nearly
two miles and never ceased to water the stick; and for a whole year no bodily infirmity, no
festival services, no necessary business (which might fairly have excused him from carrying
out the command), and lastly no severity of winter could interfere and hinder him from
obeying this order. And when the old man had watched this zeal of his on the sly without
saying anything for several days and had seen that he kept this command of his with simple
willingness of heart, as if it had come from heaven, without any change of countenance or
consideration of its reasonableness—approving the unfeigned obedience of his humility
and at the same time commiserating his tedious labour which in the zeal of his devotion he
had continued for a whole year—he came to the dry stick, and “John,” said he, “has this tree
put forth roots or no?” And when the other said that he did not know, then the old man as
if seeking the truth of the matter and trying whether it was yet depending on its roots, pulled
up the stick before him with a slight disturbance of the earth, and throwing it away told him
that for the future he might stop watering it.256</p>
<note type="footnote">256 A somewhat similar story is told by Sulpitius Severus (Dialogi I. c. xiii.) of an Egyptian monk, only in
that case the story terminates in a more satisfactory manner, as in the third year the stick took root and sprouted!</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Of the unique vase of oil thrown away by Abbot John at his senior’s command.</head>
<p>Thus the youth, trained up by exercises of this sort, daily increased in this virtue of
obedience, and shone forth more and more with the grace of humility; and when the sweet
odour of his obedience spread throughout all the monasteries, some of the brethren, coming
to the elder for the sake of testing him or rather of being edified by him, marvelled at his
obedience of which they had heard; and so the older called him suddenly, and said, “Go up
and take this cruse of oil”257 (which was the only one in the desert and which furnished a
very scanty supply of the rich liquid for their own use and for that of strangers) “and throw
it down out of window.” And he flew up stairs when summoned and threw it out of window
and cast it down to the ground and broke it in pieces without any thought or consideration
of the folly of the command, or their daily wants, and bodily infirmity, or of their poverty,
and the trials and difficulties of the wretched desert in which, even if they had got the money
for it, oil of that quality, once lost, could not be procured or replaced.</p>

<head>How Abbot John obeyed his senior by trying to roll a huge stone, which a large number of men

<p>Again, when some others were anxious to be edified by the example of his obedience,
the elder called him and said: “John, run and roll that stone hither as quickly as possible;”
and he forthwith, applying now his neck, and now his whole body, tried with all his might
and main to roll an enormous stone which a great crowd of men would not be able to move,
so that not only were his clothes saturated with sweat from his limbs, but the stone itself
was wetted by his neck; in this too never weighing the impossibility of the command and
deed, out of reverence for the old man and the unfeigned simplicity of his service, as he believed
implicitly that the old man could not command him to do anything vain or without
reason.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>Of the humility and obedience of Abbot Patermucius,258 which he did not hesitate to make
perfect by throwing his little boy into the river at the command of his senior.</head>
<p>So far let it suffice for me to have told a few things out of many concerning Abbot John:
now I will relate a memorable deed of Abbot Patermucius. For he, when anxious to renounce
the world, remained lying before the doors of the monastery for a long time until by his
dogged persistence he induced them—contrary to all the rules of the Coenobia—to receive
him together with his little boy who was about eight years old. And when they were at last
admitted they were at once not only committed to the care of different superiors, but also
put to live in separate cells that the father might not be reminded by the constant sight of
the little one that out of all his possessions and carnal treasures, which he had cast off and
renounced, at least his son remained to him; and that as he was already taught that he was
no longer a rich man, so he might also forget the fact that he was a father. And that it might
be more thoroughly tested whether he would make affection and love259 for his own flesh
and blood of more account than obedience and Christian mortification (which all who renounce
the world ought out of love to Christ to prefer), the child was on purpose neglected
and dressed in rags instead of proper clothes; and so covered and disfigured with dirt that
he would rather disgust than delight the eyes of his father whenever he saw him. And further,
he was exposed to blows and slaps from different people, which the father often saw inflicted
without the slightest reason on his innocent child under his very eyes, so that he never saw
his cheeks without their being stained with the dirty marks of tears. And though the child
was treated thus day after day before his eyes, yet still out of love for Christ and the virtue
of obedience the father’s heart stood firm and unmoved. For he no longer regarded him as
his own son, as he had offered him equally with himself to Christ; nor was he concerned
about his present injuries, but rather rejoiced because he saw that they were endured, not
without profit; thinking little of his son’s tears, but anxious about his own humility and
perfection. And when the Superior of the Coenobium saw his steadfastness of mind and
immovable inflexibility, in order thoroughly to prove the constancy of his purpose, one day
when he had seen the child crying, he pretended that he was annoyed with him and told the
father to throw him into the river. Then he, as if this had been commanded him by the Lord,
at once snatched up the child as quickly as possible, and carried him in his arms to the river’s
bank to throw him in. And straightway in the fervour of his faith and obedience this would
<note type="footnote">258 Patermucius (Petschenig) or Mucius (Gazæus); probably a different person from the man of this name
of whom we read in Rufinus, History of the Monks, c. ix., as there is no allusion there to the narrative which
Cassian gives here, nor any hint that that Patermucius had a son.</note>

<pb n="487"/>
have been carried out in act, had not some of the brethren been purposely set to watch the
banks of the river very carefully, and when the child was thrown in, had somehow snatched
him from the bed of the stream, and prevented the command, which was really fulfilled by
the obedience and devotion of the father, from being consummated in act and result.</p>

<head>How it was revealed to the Abbot concerning Patermucius that he had done the deed of Abraham;
and how when the same Abbot died, Patermucius succeeded to the charge of the
monastery.</head>
<p>And this man’s faith and devotion was so acceptable to God that it was immediately
approved by a divine testimony. For it was forthwith revealed to the Superior that by this
obedience of his he had copied the deed of the patriarch Abraham. And when shortly afterwards
the same Abbot of the monastery departed out of this life to Christ, he preferred him
to all the brethren, and left him as his successor and as Abbot to the monastery.</p>

<head>Of the obedience of a brother who at the Abbot’s bidding carried about in public ten baskets
and sold them by retail.</head>
<p>We will also not be silent about a brother whom we knew, who belonged to a high
family according to the rank of this world, for he was sprung from a father who was a count
and extremely wealthy, and had been well brought up with a liberal education. This man,
when he had left his parents and fled to the monastery, in order to prove the humility of his
disposition and the ardour of his faith was at once ordered by his superior to load his
shoulders with ten baskets (which there was no need to sell publicly), and to hawk them
about through the streets for sale: this condition being attached, so that he might be kept
longer at the work, viz.: that if any one should chance to want to buy them all together, he
was not to allow it, but was to sell them to purchasers separately. And this he carried out
with the utmost zeal, and trampling under foot all shame and confusion, out of love for
Christ, and for His Name’s sake, he put the baskets on his shoulders and sold them by retail
at the price fixed and brought back the money to the monastery; not in the least upset by
the novelty of so mean and unusual a duty, and paying no attention to the indignity of the
thing and the splendour of his birth, and the disgrace of the sale, as he was aiming at gaining
through the grace of obedience that humility of Christ which is the true nobility.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
<head>Of the humility of Abbot Pinufius, who left a very famous Coenobium over which he presided
as Presbyter, and out of the love of subjection sought a distant monastery where he could
be received as a novice.</head>
<p>The limits of the book compel us to draw to a close; but the virtue of obedience, which
holds the first place among other good qualities, will not allow us altogether to pass over in
silence the deeds of those who have excelled by it. Wherefore aptly combining these two
together, I mean, consulting brevity as well as the wishes and profit of those who are in
earnest, we will only add one example of humility, which, as it was shown by no novice but
one already perfect and an Abbot, may not only instruct the younger, but also incite the
elders to the perfect virtue of humility, as they read it. Thus we saw Abbot Pinufius260 who
when he was presbyter of a huge Coenobium which is in Egypt not far from the city of
Panephysis,261 was held in honour and respect by all men out of reverence either for his life
or for his age or for his priesthood; and when he saw that for this reason he could not
practise that humility which he longed for with all the ardour of his disposition, and had
no opportunity of exercising the virtue of subjection which he desired, he fled secretly from
the Coenobium and withdrew alone into the furthest parts of the Thebaid, and there laid
aside the habit of the monks and assumed a secular dress, and thus sought the Coenobium
of Tabenna, which he knew to be the strictest of all, and in which he fancied that he would
not be known owing to the distance of the spot, or else that he could easily lie hid there in
consequence of the size of the monastery and the number of brethren. There he remained
for a long time at the entrance, and as a suppliant at the knees of the brethren sought with
most earnest prayers to gain admission. And when he was at last with much scorn admitted
as a feeble old man who had lived all his life in the world, and had asked in his old age to
be allowed to enter a Coenobium when he could no longer gratify his passions,—as they
said that he was seeking this not for the sake of religion but because he was compelled by
hunger and want, they gave him the care and management of the garden, as he seemed an
old man and not specially fitted for any particular work. And this he performed under another
and a younger brother who kept him by him as intrusted to him, and he was so subordinate
to him, and cultivated the desired virtue of humility so obediently that he daily
performed with the utmost diligence not only everything that had to do with the care and
<note type="footnote">260 Cassian repeats this story in the Conferences XX. c. i., as an introduction to the Conference “On the End
of Penitence and the Marks of Satisfaction,” which he gives as the work of the said Abbot Pinufius.</note>
<note type="footnote">261 Panephysis is more fully described in the Conferences VII. xxvi.; XI. iii. It is mentioned by Ptolemy (IV.
v. § 52), but not by any other ancient writers. It was situated in the Delta between the Champollion with the
modern Menzaleh.</note>

<pb n="491"/>
management of the garden, but also all those duties which were looked on by the other as
hard and degrading, and disagreeable. Rising also by night he did many things secretly,
without any one looking on or knowing it, when darkness concealed him so that no one
could discover the author of the deed. And when he had hidden himself there for three years
and had been sought for high and low by the brethren all through Egypt, he was at last seen
by one who had come from the parts of Egypt, but could scarcely be recognized owing to
the meanness of his dress and the humble character of the duty he was performing. For he
was stooping down and hoeing the ground for vegetables and bringing dung on his shoulders
and laying it about their roots. And seeing this the brother for a long time hesitated about
recognizing him, but at last he came nearer, and taking careful note not only of his looks
but also of the tone of his voice, straightway fell at his feet: and at first all who saw it were
struck with the greatest astonishment why he should do this to one who was looked upon
by them as the lowest of all, as being a novice and one who had but lately forsaken the world:
but afterwards they were struck with still greater wonder when he forthwith announced his
name, which was one that had been well known amongst them also by repute. And all the
brethren asking his pardon for their former ignorance because they had for so long classed
him with the juniors and children, brought him back to his own Coenobium, against his
will and in tears because by the envy of the devil he had been cheated out of a worthy mode
of life and the humility which he was rejoicing in having discovered after his long search,
and because he had not succeeded in ending his life in that state of subjection which he had
secured. And so they guarded him with the utmost care lest he should slip away again in
the same sort of way and escape from them also.</p>

<head>How when Abbot Pinufius was brought back to his monastery he stayed there for a little while
and then fled again into the regions of Syrian Palestine.</head>
<p>And when he had stopped there for a little while, again he was seized with a longing
and desire for humility, and, taking advantage of the silence of night, made his escape in
such a way that this time he sought no neighbouring district, but regions which were unknown
and strange and separated by a wide distance. For embarking in a ship he managed
to travel to Palestine, believing that he would more securely lie hid if he betook himself to
those places in which his name had never been heard. And when he had come thither, at
once he sought out our own monastery262 which was at no great distance from the cave263
in which our Lord vouchsafed to be born of a virgin. And though he concealed himself here
for some time, yet like “a city set on an hill”264 (to use our Lord’s expression) he could not
long be hid. For presently some of the brethren who had come to the holy places from Egypt
to pray there recognized him and recalled him with most fervent prayers to his own Coenobium.</p>

<head>The charge which the same Abbot Pinufius gave to a brother whom he admitted into his

<p>This old man, then, we afterwards diligently sought out in Egypt because we had been
intimate with him in our own monastery; and I propose to insert in this work of mine an
exhortation which he gave in our presence to a brother whom he admitted into the monastery,
because I think that it may be useful. You know, said he, that after lying for so many days
at the entrance you are to-day to be admitted. And to begin with you ought to know the
reason of the difficulty put in your way. For it may be of great service to you in this road on
which you are desirous to enter, if you understand the method of it and approach the service
of Christ accordingly, and as you ought.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<head>How it is that, just as a great reward is due to the monk who labours according to the regulations
of the fathers, so likewise punishment must he inflicted on an idle one; and therefore
no one should be admitted into a monastery too easily.</head>
<p>For as unbounded glory hereafter is promised to those who faithfully serve God and
cleave to Him according to the rule of this system; so the severest penalties are in store for
those who have carried it out carelessly and coldly, and have failed to show to Him fruits of
holiness corresponding to what they professed or what they were believed by men to be.
For “it is better,” as Scripture says, “that a man should not vow rather than that he should
vow and not pay;” and “Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord carelessly.”265 Therefore
you were for a long while declined by us, not as if we did not desire with all our hearts to
secure your salvation and the salvation of all, nor as if we did not care to go to meet even
afar off those who are longing to be converted to Christ; but for fear lest if we received you
rashly we might make ourselves guilty in the sight of God of levity, and make you incur a
yet heavier punishment, if, when you had been too easily admitted by us without realizing
the responsibility of this profession, you had afterwards turned out a deserter or lukewarm.
Wherefore you ought in the first instance to learn the actual reason for the renunciation of

<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
<head>Of the way in which our renunciation is nothing but mortification and the image of the Crucified.</head>
<p>Renunciation is nothing but the evidence of the cross and of mortification. And so you
must know that to-day you are dead to this world and its deeds and desires, and that, as the
Apostle says, you are crucified to this world and this world to you.266 Consider therefore
the demands of the cross under the sign267 of which you ought henceforward to live in this
life; because you no longer live but He lives in you who was crucified for you.268 We must
therefore pass our time in this life in that fashion and form in which He was crucified for
us on the cross so that (as David says) piercing our flesh with the fear of the Lord,269 we
may have all our wishes and desires not subservient to our own lusts but fastened to His
mortification. For so shall we fulfil the command of the Lord which says: “He that taketh
not up his cross and followeth me is not worthy of me.”270 But perhaps you will say: How
can a man carry his cross continually? or how can any one who is alive be crucified? Hear
briefly how this is.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
<head>How the fear of the Lord is our cross.</head>
<p>The fear of the Lord is our cross. As then one who is crucified no longer has the power
of moving or turning his limbs in any direction as he pleases, so we also ought to affix our
wishes and desires—not in accordance with what is pleasant and delightful to us now, but
in accordance with the law of the Lord, where it constrains us. And as he who is fastened
to the wood of the cross no longer considers things present, nor thinks about his likings,
nor is perplexed by anxiety and care for the morrow, nor disturbed by any desire of possession,
nor inflamed by any pride or strife or rivalry, grieves not at present injuries, remembers
not past ones, and while he is still breathing in the body considers that he is dead to all
earthly things,271 sending the thoughts of his heart on before to that place whither he doubts
not that he is shortly to come: so we also, when crucified by the fear of the Lord ought to
be dead indeed to all these things, i.e. not only to carnal vices but also to all earthly things,272
having the eye of our minds fixed there whither we hope at each moment that we are soon
to pass. For in this way we can have all our desires and carnal affections mortified.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
<head>How our renunciation of the world is of no use if we are again entangled in those things which
we have renounced.</head>
<p>Beware therefore lest at any time you take again any of those things which you renounced
and forsook, and, contrary to the Lord’s command, return from the field of evangelical
work, and be found to have clothed yourself again in your coat which you had stripped
off;273 neither sink back to the low and earthly lusts and desires of this world, and in defiance
of Christ’s word come down from the rod of perfection and dare to take up again any of
those things which you have renounced and forsaken. Beware that you remember nothing
of your kinsfolk or of your former affections, and that you are not called back to the cares
and anxieties of this world, and (as our Lord says) putting your hand to the plough and
looking back be found unfit for the kingdom of heaven.274 Beware lest at any time, when
you have begun to dip into the knowledge of the Psalms and of this life, you be little by little
puffed up and think of reviving that pride which now at your beginning you have trampled
under foot in the ardour of faith and in fullest humility; and thus (as the Apostle says)
building again those things which you had destroyed, you make yourself a backslider.275
But rather take heed to continue even to the end in that state of nakedness of which you
made profession in the sight of God and of his angels. In this humility too and patience,
with which you persevered for ten days before the doors and entreated with many tears to
be admitted into the monastery, you should not only continue but also increase and go
forward. For it is too bad that when you ought to be carried on from the rudiments and
beginnings, and go forward to perfection, you should begin to fall back from these to worse
things. For not he who begins these things, but he who endures in them to the end, shall be
saved.276</p>

<head>How the devil always lies in wait for our end, and how we ought continually to watch his
head.277</head>
<p>For the subtle serpent is ever “watching our heel,” that is, is lying in wait for the close,
and endeavouring to trip us up right to the end of our life. And therefore it will not be of
any use to have made a good beginning and to have eagerly taken the first step towards renouncing
the world with all fervour, if a corresponding end does not likewise set it off and
conclude it, and if the humility and poverty of Christ, of which you have now made profession
in His sight, are not preserved by you even to the close of your life, as they were first secured.
And that you may succeed in doing this, do you ever “watch his head,” i.e. the first rise of
thoughts, by bringing them at once to your superior. For thus you will learn to “bruise” his
dangerous beginnings, if you are not ashamed to disclose any of them to your superior.</p>
<note type="footnote">277 All through this chapter Cassian is alluding to Gen. iii. 15: “I will put enmity between thee and the woman
and between thy seed and her seed; it shalt bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel:” the last clause of

<head>Of the renunciant’s preparation against temptation, and of the few who are worthy of imitation.</head>
<p>Wherefore, as Scripture says, “when you go forth to serve the Lord stand in the fear of
the Lord, and prepare your mind”278 not for repose or carelessness or delights, but for
temptations and troubles. For “through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom
of God.” For “strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there
be which find it.”279 Consider therefore that you belong to the few and elect; and do not
grow cold after the examples of the lukewarmness of many: but live as the few, that with the
few you may be worthy of a place in the kingdom of God: for “many are called, but few
chosen,” and it is a “little flock to which it is the Father’s good pleasure to give”280 an inheritance.
You should therefore realize that it is no light sin for one who has made profession
of perfection to follow after what is imperfect. And to this state of perfection you may attain
by the following steps and in the following way.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
<head>Of the way in which we shall mount towards perfection, whereby we may afterwards ascend
from the fear of God up to love.</head>
<p>“The beginning” of our salvation and the safeguard of it is, as I said, “the fear of the
Lord.”281 For through this those who are trained in the way of perfection can gain a start
in conversion as well as purification from vices and security in virtue. And when this has
gained an entrance into a man’s heart it produces contempt of all things, and begets a forgetfulness
of kinsfolk and an horror of the world itself. But by the contempt for the loss of
all possessions humility is gained. And humility is attested by these signs: First of all if a
man has all his desires mortified; secondly, if he conceals none of his actions or even of his
thoughts from his superior; thirdly, if he puts no trust in his own opinion, but all in the
judgment of his superior, and listens eagerly and willingly to his directions; fourthly, if he
maintains in everything obedience and gentleness and constant patience; fifthly, if he not
only hurts nobody else, but also is not annoyed or vexed at wrongs done to himself; sixthly,
if he does nothing and ventures on nothing to which he is not urged by the Common Rule
or by the example of our elders; seventhly, if he is contented with the lowest possible position,
and considers himself as a bad workman and unworthy in the case of everything enjoined
to him; eighthly, if he does not only outwardly profess with his lips that he is inferior to all,
but really believes it in the inmost thoughts of his heart; ninthly, if he governs his tongue,
and is not over talkative; tenthly, if he is not easily moved or too ready to laugh. For by such
signs and the like is true humility recognised. And when this has once been genuinely secured,
then at once it leads you on by a still higher step to love which knows no fear;282 and through
this you begin, without any effort and as it were naturally, to keep up everything that you
formerly observed not without fear of punishment; no longer now from regard of punishment
or fear of it but from love of goodness itself, and delight in virtue.283</p>

<head>That the monk should seek for examples of perfection not from many instances but from one
or a very few.</head>
<p>And that you may the more easily arrive at this, the examples of the perfect life of one
dwelling in the congregation, which you may imitate, should be sought from a very few or
indeed from one or two only and not from too many. For apart from the fact that a life
which is tested and refined and purified is only to be found in a few, there is this also to be
gained, viz.: that a man is more thoroughly instructed and formed by the example of some
one, towards the perfection which he sets before him, viz.: that of the Coenobite life.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41"> 
<pb n="502"/>
<head>CHAPTER XLI.</head>
<head>The appearance of what infirmities one who lives in a Coenobium ought to exhibit.284</head>
<p>And that you may be able to attain all this, and continually remain subject to this spiritual
rule, you must observe these three things in the congregation: viz.: that as the Psalmist
says: “I was like a deaf man and heard not and as one that is dumb who doth not open his
mouth; and I became as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth there are no reproofs,”
285 so you also should walk as one that is deaf and dumb and blind, so that—putting
aside the contemplation of him who has been rightly chosen by you as your model of perfection—
you should be like a blind man and not see any of those things which you find to
be unedifying, nor286 be influenced by the authority or fashion of those who do these things,
and give yourself up to what is worse and what you formerly condemned. If you hear any
one disobedient or insubordinate or disparaging another or doing anything different from
what was taught to you, you should not go wrong and be led astray by such an example to
imitate him; but, “like a deaf man,” as if you had never heard it, you should pass it all by. If
insults are offered to you or to any one else, or wrongs done, be immovable, and as far as
an answer in retaliation is concerned be silent “as one that is dumb,” always singing in your
heart this verse of the Psalmist: “I said I will take heed to my ways that I offend not with my
tongue. I set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood before me. I was dumb and was
humbled and kept silence from good things.”287 But cultivate above everything this fourth
thing which adorns and graces those three of which we have spoken above; viz.: make
yourself, as the Apostle directs,288 a fool in this world that you may become wise, exercising
no discrimination and judgment of your own on any of those matters which are commanded
to you, but always showing obedience with all simplicity and faith, judging that alone to be
holy, useful, and wise which God’s law or the decision of your superior declares to you to
be such. For built up on such a system of instruction you may continue forever under this
discipline, and not fall away from the monastery in consequence of any temptations or
devices of the enemy.</p>

<head>Recapitulation of the explanation how a monk can mount up towards perfection.</head>
<p>And in order that all these things which have been set forth in a somewhat lengthy discourse
may be more easily stamped on your heart and may stick in your thoughts with all
tenacity, I will make a summary of them so that you may be able to learn all the changes by
heart by reason of their brevity and conciseness. Hear then in few words how you can mount
up to the heights of perfection without an effort or difficulty. “The beginning” of our salvation
and “of wisdom” is, according to Scripture, “the fear of the Lord.”289 From the fear of the
Lord arises salutary compunction. From compunction of heart springs renunciation, i.e.
nakedness and contempt of all possessions. From nakedness is begotten humility; from
humility the mortification of desires. Through mortification of desires all faults are extirpated
and decay. By driving out faults virtues shoot up and increase. By the budding of virtues
purity of heart is gained. By purity of heart the perfection of apostolic love is acquired.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="506"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>The transition from the Institutes of the monks to the struggle against the eight principal faults.</head>
<p>This fifth book of ours is now by the help of God to be produced. For after the four
books which have been composed on the customs of the monasteries, we now propose, being
strengthened by God through your prayers, to approach the struggle against the eight
principal faults, i.e. first, Gluttony or the pleasures of the palate; secondly, Fornication;
thirdly, Covetousness, which means Avarice, or, as it may more properly be called, the love
of money, fourthly, Anger; fifthly, Dejection; sixthly, “Accidie,”290 which is heaviness or
weariness of heart; seventhly, κενοδοξία which means foolish or vain glory; eighthly, pride.
And on entering upon this difficult task we need your prayers, O most blessed Pope Castor,
more than ever; that we may be enabled in the first place worthily to investigate the nature
of these in all points however trifling or hidden or obscure: and next to explain with sufficient
clearness the causes of them and thirdly to bring forward fitly the cures and remedies for
them.</p>
<note type="footnote">290 Acedia. It is much to be regretted that the old English word “Accidie” has entirely dropped out of use. It
is used by Chaucer and other early writers for the sin of spiritual sloth or sluggishness. See “The Persone’s Tale,”
where it is thus described: “After the sinne of wrath, now wol I speke of the sinne of accidie or slouth: for envie
blindeth the herte of a man, and ire troubleth a man, and accidie maketh him hevy, thoughtful, and wrawe.
Envie and ire maken bitternesse in herte, which bitternesse is mother of accidie, and benimeth him the love of
alle goodnesse; than is accidie the anguish of a troubled herte.” The English word lingered on till the seventeenth
century, as it is used by Bishop Hall (Serm.V. 140), in the form “Acedy,” which is etymologically more correct
as being nearer the Latin Acedia and the Greek ᾽Ακηδία, a word which occurs in the LXX. version of the Old
Testament in Isaiah lxi. 3; Ps. cxviii. (cxix.) 28; Baruch iii. 1; Ecclus. xxix. 6 (cf. the use of the verb ἀκηδιάζω in
Ps. lx. (lxi.) 2; ci. (cii.) 1; cxlii. (cxliii.) 4; Ecclus. xxii. 14). In ecclesiastical writers the term Acedia is a favourite
one to denote primarily the mental prostration induced by fasting and other physical causes, and afterwards
spiritual sloth and sluggishness in general. It forms the subject of the tenth book of the Institutes, and is treated
of again by Cassian in the Conferences V. iii. sq., cf. also the “Summa” of S. Thomas, II. ii. q. xxxv., where there
is a full discussion of its nature and character.—cf. Dr. Paget’s essay “Concerning Accidie” in “The Spirit of
Discipline.”</note>

<head>How the occasions of these faults, being found in everybody, are ignored by everybody; and
how we need the Lord’s help to make them plain.</head>
<p>And of these passions as the occasions are recognized by everybody as soon as they are
laid open by the teaching of the elders, so before they are revealed, although we are all
overcome by them, and they exist in every one, yet nobody knows of them. But we trust
that we shall be able in some measure to explain them, if by your prayers that word of the
Lord, which was announced by Isaiah, may apply to us also—“I will go before thee, and
bring low the mighty ones of the land, I will break the gates of brass, and cut asunder the
iron bars, and I will open to thee concealed treasures and hidden secrets”291—so that the
word of the Lord may go before us also, and first may bring low the mighty ones of our land,
i.e. these same evil passions which we are desirous to overcome, and which claim for
themselves dominion and a most horrible tyranny in our mortal body; and may make them
yield to our investigation and explanation, and thus breaking the gates of our ignorance,
and cutting asunder the bars of vices which shut us out from true knowledge, may lead to
the hidden things of our secrets, and reveal to us who have been illuminated, according to
the Apostle’s word, “the hidden things of darkness, and may make manifest the counsels of
the hearts,”292 that thus penetrating with pure eyes of the mind to the foul darkness of vices,
we may be able to disclose them and drag them forth to light; and may succeed in explaining
their occasions and natures to those who are either free from them, or are still tied and
bound by them, and so passing as the prophet says,293 through the fire of vices which terribly
inflame our minds, we may be able forthwith to pass also through the water of virtues which
extinguish them unharmed, and being bedewed (as it were) with spiritual remedies may be
found worthy to be brought in purity of heart to the consolations of perfection.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>The testimony of Abbot Antony in which he teaches that each virtue ought to be sought for
from him who professes it in a special degree.</head>
<p>For it is an ancient and excellent saying of the blessed Antony294 that when a monk is
endeavouring after the plan of the monastic life to reach the heights of a more advanced
perfection, and, having learned the consideration of discretion, is able now to stand in his
own judgment, and to arrive at the very summit of the anchorite’s life, he ought by no means
to seek for all kinds of virtues from one man however excellent. For one is adorned with
flowers of knowledge, another is more strongly fortified with methods of discretion, another
is established in the dignity of patience, another excels in the virtue of humility, another in
that of continence, another is decked with the grace of simplicity. This one excels all others
in magnanimity, that one in pity, another in vigils, another in silence, another in earnestness
of work. And therefore the monk who desires to gather spiritual honey, ought like a most
careful bee, to suck out virtue from those who specially possess it, and should diligently
store it up in the vessel of his own breast: nor should he investigate what any one is lacking
in, but only regard and gather whatever virtue he has. For if we want to gain all virtues from
some one person, we shall with great difficulty or perhaps never at all find suitable examples
for us to imitate. For though we do not as yet see that even Christ is made “all things in all,”
as the Apostle says;295 still in this way we can find Him bit by bit in all. For it is said of Him,
“Who was made of God to you wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.”
296 While then in one there is found wisdom, in another righteousness, in another
sanctification, in another kindness, in another chastity, in another humility, in another patience,
Christ is at the present time divided, member by member, among all of the saints.
But when all come together into the unity of the faith and virtue, He is formed into the
“perfect man,”297 completing the fulness of His body, in the joints and properties of all His
members. Until then that time arrives when God will be “all in all,” for the present God can
in the way of which we have spoken be “in all,” through particular virtues, although He is
not yet “all in all” through the fulness of them. For although our religion has but one end
and aim, yet there are different ways by which we approach God, as will be more fully shown
in the Conferences of the Elders.298 And so we must seek a model of discretion and contin-
<note type="footnote">294 S. Antony, the “founder of asceticism” and one of the most famous of the early monks, was born about
250 a.d. at Coma, on the borders of Egypt, and died about 355, at the great age of 105. He is frequently mentioned

ence more particularly from those from whom we see that those virtues flow forth more
abundantly through the grace of the Holy Spirit; not that any one can alone acquire those
things which are divided among many, but in order that in those good qualities of which
we are capable we may advance towards the imitation of those who especially have acquired
them.</p>

<head>That one and the same rule of fasting cannot be observed by everybody.</head>
<p>And so on the manner of fasting a uniform rule cannot easily be observed, because
everybody has not the same strength; nor is it like the rest of the virtues, acquired by steadfastness
of mind alone. And therefore, because it does not depend only on mental firmness,
since it has to do with the possibilities of the body, we have received this explanation concerning
it which has been handed down to us, viz.: that there is a difference of time, manner,
and quality of the refreshment in proportion to the difference of condition of the body, the
age, and sex: but that there is one and the same rule of restraint to everybody as regards
continence of mind, and the virtue of the spirit. For it is impossible for every one to prolong
his fast for a week, or to postpone taking refreshment during a two or three days’ abstinence.
By many people also who are worn out with sickness and especially with old age, a fast even
up to sunset cannot be endured without suffering. The sickly food of moistened beans does
not agree with everybody: nor does a sparing diet of fresh vegetables suit all, nor is a scanty
meal of dry bread permitted to all alike. One man does not feel satisfied with two pounds,
for another a meal of one pound, or six ounces, is too much; but there is one aim and object
of continence in the case of all of these, viz.: that no one may be overburdened beyond the
measure of his appetite, by gluttony. For it is not only the quality, but also the quantity of
food taken which dulls the keenness of the mind, and when the soul as well as the flesh is
surfeited, kindles the baneful and fiery incentive to vice.</p>

<head>That the mind is not intoxicated by wine alone.</head>
<p>The belly when filled with all kinds of food gives birth to seeds of wantonness, nor can
the mind, when choked with the weight of food, keep the guidance and government of the
thoughts. For not only is drunkenness with wine wont to intoxicate the mind, but excess of
all kinds of food makes it weak and uncertain, and robs it of all its power of pure and clear
contemplation. The cause of the overthrow and wantonness of Sodom was not drunkenness
through wine, but fulness of bread. Hear the Lord rebuking Jerusalem through the prophet.
“For how did thy sister Sodom sin, except in that she ate her bread in fulness and abundance?”
299 And because through fulness of bread they were inflamed with uncontrollable
lust of the flesh, they were burnt up by the judgment of God with fire and brimstone from
heaven. But if excess of bread alone drove them to such a headlong downfall into sin through
the vice of satiety, what shall we think of those who with a vigorous body dare to partake of
meat and wine with unbounded licence, taking not just what their bodily frailty demands,
but what the eager desire of the mind suggests.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How bodily weakness need not interfere with purity of heart.</head>
<p>Bodily weakness is no hindrance to purity of heart, if only so much food is taken as the
bodily weakness requires, and not what pleasure asks for. It is easier to find men who altogether
abstain from the more fattening kinds of foods than men who make a moderate use
of what is allowed to our necessities; and men who deny themselves everything out of love
of continence than men who taking food on the plea of weakness preserve the due measure
of what is sufficient.300 For bodily weakness has its glory of self-restraint, where though
food is permitted to the failing body, a man deprives himself of his refreshment. although
he needs it, and only indulges in just so much food as the strict judgment of temperance
decides to be sufficient for the necessities of life, and not what the longing appetite asks for.
The more delicate foods, as they conduce to bodily health, so they need not destroy the
purity of chastity, if they are taken in moderation. For whatever strength301 is gained by
partaking of them is used up in the toil and waste of care. Wherefore as no state of life can
be deprived of the virtue of abstinence, so to none is the crown of perfection denied.</p>
<note type="footnote">300 Petschenig’s text in this passage is as follows: “Facilius vidimus viros qui ab escis corpulentioribus omnimodis
temperarent, quam moderate usos pro necessitate concessis, et qui totum sibi pro amore continentiæ
denegarent, quam qui eas sub infirmitatis occasione sumentes mensuram sufficientiæ custodirent.” Gazæus
gives something quite different: “Facilius vidimus victos qui ab escis corpulentioribus omnimodis temperarent,
quas moderate usus pro necessitate concedit, et qui totum sibi pro continentiæ amore denegarent; quam qui
eas sub infirmitatis occasione sumentes mensuram sufficientiæ custodirent.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How food should be taken with regard to the aim at perfect continence.302</head>
<p>And so it is a very true and most excellent saying of the Fathers that the right method
of fasting and abstinence lies in the measure of moderation and bodily chastening; and that
this is the aim of perfect virtue for all alike, viz.: that though we are still forced to desire it,
yet we should exercise self-restraint in the matter of the food, which we are obliged to take
owing to the necessity of supporting the body. For even if one is weak in body, he can attain
to a perfect virtue and one equal to that of those who are thoroughly strong and healthy, if
with firmness of mind he keeps a check upon the desires and lusts which are not due to
weakness of the flesh. For the Apostle says: “And take not care for the flesh in its lusts.”303
He does not forbid care for it in every respect: but says that care is not to be taken in regard
to its desires and lusts. He cuts away the luxurious fondness for the flesh: he does not exclude
the control necessary for life: he does the former, lest through pampering the flesh we should
be involved in dangerous entanglements of the desires; the latter lest the body should be
injured by our fault and unable to fulfil its spiritual and necessary duties.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of the measure of the chastisement to be undertaken, and the remedy of fasting.</head>
<p>The perfection then of abstinence is not to be gathered from calculations of time alone,
nor only from the quality of the food; but beyond everything from the judgment of conscience.
For each one should impose such a sparing diet on himself as the battle of his bodily
struggle may require. The canonical observance of fasts is indeed valuable and by all means
to be kept. But unless this is followed by a temperate partaking of food, one will not be able
to arrive at the goal of perfection. For the abstinence of prolonged fasts—where repletion
of body follows—produces weariness for a time rather than purity and chastity. Perfection
of mind indeed depends upon the abstinence of the belly. He has no lasting purity and
chastity, who is not contented always to keep to a well-balanced and temperate diet. Fasting,
although severe, yet if unnecessary relaxation follows, is rendered useless, and presently
leads to the vice of gluttony. A reasonable supply of food partaken of daily with moderation,
is better than a severe and long fast at intervals. Excessive fasting has been known not only
to undermine the constancy of the mind, but also to weaken the power of prayers through
sheer weariness of body.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>That abstinence from food is not of itself sufficient for preservation of bodily and mental purity.</head>
<p>In order to preserve the mind and body in a perfect condition abstinence from food is
not alone sufficient: unless the other virtues of the mind as well are joined to it. And so humility
must first be learned by the virtue of obedience, and grinding toil304 and bodily exhaustion.
The possession of money must not only be avoided, but the desire for it must be
utterly rooted out. For it is not enough not to possess it,—a thing which comes to many as
a matter of necessity: but we ought, if by chance it is offered, not even to admit the wish to
have it. The madness of anger should be controlled; the downcast look of dejection be
overcome; vainglory should be despised, the disdainfulness of pride trampled under foot,
and the shifting and wandering thoughts of the mind restrained by continual recollection
of God. And the slippery wanderings of our heart should be brought back again to the
contemplation of God as often as our crafty enemy, in his endeavour to lead away the mind
a captive from this consideration, creeps into the innermost recesses of the heart.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>That bodily lusts are not extinguished except by the entire rooting out of vice.</head>
<p>For it is an impossibility that the fiery motions of the body can be extinguished, before
the incentives of the other chief vices are utterly rooted out: concerning which we will speak
in their proper place, if God permits, separately, in different books. But now we have to
deal with Gluttony, that is the desire of the palate, against which our first battle is. He then
will never be able to check the motions of a burning lust, who cannot restrain the desires of
the appetite. The chastity of the inner man is shown by the perfection of this virtue. For you
will never feel sure that he can strive against the opposition of a stronger enemy, whom you
have seen overcome by weaker ones in a higher conflict. For of all virtues the nature is but
one and the same, although they appear to be divided into many different kinds and names:
just as there is but one substance of gold, although it may seem to be distributed through
many different kinds of jewelry according to the skill of the goldsmith. And so he is proved
to possess no virtue perfectly, who is known to have broken down in some part of them.
For how can we believe that that man has extinguished the burning heats of concupiscence
(which are kindled not only by bodily incitement but by vice of the mind), who could not
assuage the sharp stings of anger which break out from intemperance of heart alone? Or
how can we think that he has repressed the wanton desires of the flesh and spirit, who has
not been able to conquer the simple fault of pride? Or how can we believe that one has
trampled under foot a wantonness which is ingrained in the flesh, who has not been able to
disown the love of money, which is something external and outside our own substance? In
what way will he triumph in the war of flesh and spirit, who has not been man enough to
cure the disease of dejection? However great a city may be protected by the height of its
walls and the strength of its closed gates, yet it is laid waste by the giving up of one postern
however small. For what difference does it make whether a dangerous foe makes his way
into the heart of the city over high walls, and through the wide spaces of the gate, or through
secret and narrow passages?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>That in our spiritual contest we ought to draw an example from the carnal contests.</head>
<p>“One who strives in the games is not crowned unless he has contended lawfully.”305
One who wants to extinguish the natural desires of the flesh, should first hasten to overcome
those vices whose seat is outside our nature. For if we desire to make trial of the force of the
Apostle’s saying, we ought first to learn what are the laws and what the discipline of the
world’s contest, so that finally by a comparison with these, we may be able to know what
the blessed Apostle meant to teach to us who are striving in a spiritual contest by this illustration.
For in these conflicts, which, as the same Apostle says, hold out “a corruptible
crown”306 to the victors, this rule is kept, that he who aims at preparing himself for the
crown of glory, which is embellished with the privilege of exemption, and who is anxious
to enter the highest struggle in the contest, should first in the Olympic and Pythian games
give evidence of his abilities as a youth, and his strength in its first beginnings; since in these
the younger men who want to practise this training are tested as to whether they deserve or
ought to be admitted to it, by the judgment both of the president of the games and of the
whole multitude. And when any one has been carefully tested, and has first been proved to
be stained by no infamy of life, and then has been adjudged not ignoble through the yoke
of slavery, and for this reason unworthy to be admitted to this training and to the company
of those who practise it, and when thirdly he produces sufficient evidence of his ability and
prowess and by striving with the younger men and his own compeers has shown both his
skill and valour as a youth, and going forward from the contests of boys has been by the
scrutiny of the president permitted to mix with full-grown men and those of approved experience,
and has not only shown himself their equal in valour by constant striving with
them, but has also many a time carried off the prize of victory among them, then at last he
is allowed to approach the most illustrious conflict of the games, permission to contend in
which is granted to none but victors and those who are decked with many crowns and prizes.
If we understand this illustration from a carnal contest, we ought by a comparison with it
to know what is the system and method of our spiritual conflict as well.</p>

<head>That we cannot enter the battle of the inner man unless we have been set free from the vice of

<p>We also ought first to give evidence of our freedom from subjection to the flesh. For
“of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he the slave.”307 And “every one that doeth sin
is the slave of sin.”308 And when the scrutiny of the president of the contest finds that we
are stained by no infamy of disgraceful lust, and when we are judged by him not to be slaves
of the flesh, and ignoble and unworthy of the Olympic struggle against our vices, then we
shall be able to enter the lists against our equals, that is the lusts of the flesh and the motions
and disturbances of the soul. For it is impossible for a full belly to make trial of the combat
of the inner man: nor is he worthy to be tried in harder battles, who can be overcome in a
slight skirmish.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How gluttonous desires can be overcome.</head>
<p>First then we must trample under foot gluttonous desires, and to this end the mind
must be reduced not only by fasting, but also by vigils, by reading, and by frequent compunction
of heart for those things in which perhaps it recollects that it has been deceived or
overcome, sighing at one time with horror at sin, at another time inflamed with the desire
of perfection and saintliness: until it is fully occupied and possessed by such cares and
meditations, and recognizes the participation of food to be not so much a concession to
pleasure, as a burden laid upon it; and considers it to be rather a necessity for the body than
anything desirable for the soul. And, preserved by this zeal of mind and continual compunction,
we shall beat down the wantonness of the flesh (which becomes more proud and
haughty by being fomented with food) and its dangerous incitement, and so by the copiousness
of our tears and the weeping of our heart we shall succeed in extinguishing the fiery
furnace of our body, which is kindled by the Babylonish king309 who continually furnishes
us with opportunities for sin, and vices with which we burn more fiercely, instead of naphtha
and pitch—until, through the grace of God, instilled like dew by His Spirit in our hearts,
the heats of fleshly lusts can be altogether deadened. This then is our first contest, this is as
it were our first trial in the Olympic games, to extinguish the desires of the palate and the
belly by the longing for perfection. On which account we must not only trample down all
unnecessary desire for food by the contemplation of the virtues, but also must take what is
necessary for the support of nature, not without anxiety of heart, as if it were opposed to
chastity. And so at length we may enter on the course of our life, so that there may be no
time in which we feel that we are recalled from our spiritual studies, further than when we
are obliged by the weakness of the body to descend for the needful care of it. And when we
are subjected to this necessity—of attending to the wants of life rather than the desires, of
the soul—we should hasten to withdraw as quickly as possible from it, as if it kept us back
from really health-giving studies. For we cannot possibly scorn the gratification of food
presented to us, unless the mind is fixed on the contemplation of divine things, and is the
rather entranced with the love of virtue and the delight of things celestial. And so a man
will despise all things present as transitory, when he has securely fixed his mental gaze on,
those things which are immovable and eternal, and already contemplates in heart—though
still in the flesh—the blessedness of his future life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>How a monk must always be eager to preserve his purity of heart.</head>
<p>It is like the case when one endeavours to strike some mighty prize of virtue on high,
pointed out by some very small mark; with the keenest eyesight he points the aim of his
dart, knowing that large rewards of glory and prizes depend on his hitting it; and he turns
away his gaze from every other consideration, and must direct it thither, where he sees that
the reward and prize is placed, because he would be sure to lose the prize of his skill and the
reward of his prowess if the keenness of his gaze should be diverted ever so little.310</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>How, after the fashion of the Olympic games, a monk should not attempt spiritual conflicts
unless he has won battles over the flesh.</head>
<p>And so when the desires of the belly and of the palate have been by these considerations
overcome, and when we have been declared, as in the Olympic contests, neither slaves of
the flesh nor infamous through the brand of sin, we shall be adjudged to be worthy of the
contest in higher struggles as well, and, leaving behind lessons of this kind, may be believed
capable of entering the lists against spiritual wickednesses, against which only victors and
those who are allowed to contend in a spiritual conflict are deemed worthy to struggle. For
this is so to speak a most solid foundation of all the conflicts, viz.: that in the first instance
the impulses of carnal desires should be destroyed. For no one can lawfully strive unless his
own flesh has been overcome. And one who does not strive lawfully certainly cannot take
a share in the contest, nor win a crown of glory and the grace of victory. But if we have been
overcome in this battle, having been proved as it were slaves of carnal lusts, and thus displaying
the tokens neither of freedom nor of strength, we shall be straightway repulsed from
the conflicts with spiritual hosts, as unworthy and as slaves, with every mark of confusion.
For “every one that doeth sin is the servant of sin.”311 And this will be addressed to us by
the blessed Apostle, together with those among whom fornication is named. “Temptation
does not overtake you, except such as is human.”312 For if we do not seek for strength of
mind313 we shall not deserve to make trial of severer contest against wickedness on high, if
we have been unable to subdue our weak flesh which resists the spirit. And some not understanding
this testimony of the Apostle, have read the subjunctive instead of the indicative
mood, i.e., “Let no temptation overcome you, except such as is human.”314 But it is clear
that it is rather said by him with the meaning not of a wish but of a declaration or rebuke.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>That the foundation and basis of the spiritual combat must be laid in the struggle against
gluttony.</head>
<p>Would you like to hear a true athlete of Christ striving according to the rules and laws
of the conflict? “I,” said he, “so run, not as uncertainly; I so fight, not as one that beateth the
air: but I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest by any means when I have
preached to others I myself should be a castaway.”315 You see how he made the chief part
of the struggle depend upon himself, that is upon his flesh, as if on a most sure foundation,
and placed the result of the battle simply in the chastisement of the flesh and the subjection
of his body. “I then so run not as uncertainly.” He does not run uncertainly, because,316
looking to the heavenly Jerusalem, he has a mark set, towards which his heart is swiftly
directed without swerving. He does not run uncertainly, because, “forgetting those things
which are behind, he reaches forth to those that are before, pressing towards the mark for
the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,”317 whither he ever directs his mental
gaze, and hastening towards it with all speed318 of heart, proclaims with confidence, “I have
fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.”319 And because he
knows he has run unweariedly “after the odour of the ointment”320 of Christ with ready
devotion of heart, and has won the battle of the spiritual combat by the chastisement of the
flesh, he boldly concludes and says, “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me in that day.” And that he might
open up to us also a like hope of reward, if we desire to imitate him in the struggle of his
course, he added: “But not to me only, but to all also who love His coming;”321 declaring
that we shall be sharers of his crown in the day of judgment, if we love the coming of
Christ—not that one only which will be manifest to men even against their will; but also
this one which daily comes to pass in holy souls—and if we gain the victory in the fight by
chastising the body. And of this coming it is that the Lord speaks in the Gospel. “I,” says
He, “and my Father will come to him, and will make our abode with him.”322 And again:

<head>Of the number of different conflicts and victories through which the blessed Apostle ascended
to the crown of the highest combat.</head>
<p>But he does not mean that he has only finished the contest of a race when he says “I so
run, not as uncertainly” (a phrase which has more particularly to do with the intention of
the mind and fervour of his spirit, in which he followed Christ with all zeal, crying out with
the Bride, “We will run after thee for the odour of thine ointments;”324 and again, “My soul
cleaveth unto thee:”325 but he also testifies that he has conquered in another kind of contest,
saying, “So fight I, not as one that beateth the air, but I chastise my body and bring it into
subjection.” And this properly has to do with the pains of abstinence, and bodily fasting
and affliction of the flesh: as he means by this that he is a vigorous bruiser of his own flesh,
and points out that not in vain has he planted his blows of continence against it; but that
he has gained a battle triumph by mortifying his own body; for when it is chastised with the
blows of continence and struck down with the boxing-gloves of fasting, he has secured for
his victorious spirit the crown of immortality and the prize of incorruption. You see the
orthodox method of the contest, and consider the issue of spiritual combats: how the athlete
of Christ having gained a victory over the rebellious flesh, having cast it as it were under his
feet, is carried forward as triumphing on high. And therefore “he does not run uncertainly,”
because he trusts that he will forthwith enter the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem. He “so
fights,” that is with fasts and humiliation of the flesh, “not as one that beateth the air,” that
is, striking into space with blows of continence, through which he struck not the empty air,
but those spirits who inhabit it, by the chastisement of his body. For one who says “not as
one that beateth the air,” shows that he strikes—not empty and void air, but certain beings
in the air. And because he had overcome in this kind of contest, and marched on enriched
with the rewards of many crowns, not undeservedly does he begin to enter the lists against
still more powerful foes, and having triumphed over his former rivals, he boldly makes
proclamation and says, “Now our striving is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness
in heavenly places.”326</p>

<head>That the athlete of Christ, so long as he is in the body, is never without a battle.</head>
<p>The athlete of Christ, as long as he is in the body, is never in want of a victory to be
gained in contests: but in proportion as he grows by triumphant successes, so does a severer
kind of struggle confront him. For when the flesh is subdued and conquered, what swarms
of foes, what hosts of enemies are incited by his triumphs and rise up against the victorious
soldier of Christ! for fear lest in the ease of peace the soldier of Christ might relax his efforts
and begin to forget the glorious struggles of his contests, and be rendered slack through the
idleness which is caused by immunity from danger, and be cheated of the reward of his
prizes and the recompense of his triumphs. And so if we want to rise with ever-growing
virtue to these stages of triumph we ought also in the same way to enter the lists of battle
and begin by saying with the Apostle: “I so fight, not as one that beateth the air, but I chastise
my body and bring it into subjection,”327 that when this conflict is ended we may once more
be able to say with him: “we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places.”328 For otherwise we cannot possibly join battle with them nor deserve to make trial
of spiritual combats if we are baffled in a carnal contest, and smitten down in a struggle
with the belly: and deservedly will it be said of us by the Apostle in the language of blame:
“Temptation does not overtake you, except what is common to man.”329</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>How a monk should not overstep the proper hours for taking food, if he wants to proceed to
the struggle of interior conflicts.</head>
<p>A monk therefore who wants to proceed to the struggle of interior conflicts should lay
down this as a precaution for himself to begin with: viz.: that he will not in any case allow
himself to be overcome by any delicacies, or take anything to eat or drink before the fast330
is over and the proper hour for refreshment has come, outside meal times;331 nor, when
the meal is over, will he allow himself to take a morsel however small; and likewise that he
will observe the canonical time and measure of sleep. For that self-indulgence must be cut
off in the same way that the sin of unchastity has to be rooted out. For if a man is unable to
check the unnecessary desires of the appetite how will he be able to extinguish the fire of
carnal lust? And if a man is not able to control passions, which are openly manifest and are
but small, how will he be able with temperate discretion to fight against those which are
secret, and excite him, when none are there to see? And therefore strength of mind is tested
in separate impulses and in any sort of passion: and if it is overcome in the case of very small
and manifest desires, how it will endure in those that are really great and powerful and
hidden, each man’s conscience must witness for himself.</p>
<note type="footnote">330 Statio. This is properly the term for the weekly fasts on Wednesday and Friday, observed by the early
Church in memory of our Lord’s betrayal and crucifixion. See Tertullian on Prayer c. xix.; on Fasting c. i. x. In
this place the word appears to be used by Cassian for the close of the fast; while elsewhere he uses it for fasting
generally (not specially on Wednesday and Friday,) as in c. xxiv. of the present book, and in the Conferences,
II. xxv.; XXI. xxi. The origin of the word is somewhat uncertain (a) because the fast was observed on stated days
(stasis diebus); or (b), as S. Ambrose suggests, because “our fasts are our encampments which protect us from
the devil’s attacks: in short, they are called stationes, because standing (stantes) and staying in them we repel
our plotting foe” (Serm. 25). See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 1928.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of the inward peace of a monk, and of spiritual abstinence.</head>
<p>For it is not an external enemy whom we have to dread. Our foe is shut up within
ourselves: an internal warfare is daily waged by us: and if we are victorious in this, all external
things will be made weak, and everything will be made peaceful and subdued for the soldier
of Christ. We shall have no external enemy to fear, if what is within is overcome and subdued
to the spirit. And let us not believe that that external fast from visible food alone can possibly
be sufficient for perfection of heart and purity of body unless with it there has also been
united a fast of the soul. For the soul also has its foods which are harmful, fattened on which,
even without superfluity of meats, it is involved in a downfall of wantonness. Slander is its
food, and indeed one that is very dear to it. A burst of anger also is its food, even if it be a
very slight one; yet supplying it with miserable food for an hour, and destroying it as well
with its deadly savour. Envy is a food of the mind, corrupting it with its poisonous juices
and never ceasing to make it wretched and miserable at the prosperity and success of another.
Kenodoxia, i.e., vainglory is its food, which gratifies it with a delicious meal for a time; but
afterwards strips it clear and bare of all virtue, and dismisses it barren and void of all spiritual
fruit, so that it makes it not only lose the rewards of huge labours, but also makes it
incur heavier punishments. All lust and shifty wanderings of heart are a sort of food for the
soul, nourishing it on harmful meats, but leaving it afterwards without share of the heavenly
bread and of really solid food. If then, with all the powers we have, we abstain from these
in a most holy fast, our observance of the bodily fast will be both useful and profitable. For
labour of the flesh, when joined with contrition of the spirit, will produce a sacrifice that is
most acceptable to God, and a worthy shrine of holiness in the pure and undefiled inmost
chambers of the heart. But if, while fasting as far as the body is concerned, we are entangled
in the most dangerous vices of the soul, our humiliation of the flesh will do us no good
whatever, while the most precious part of us is defiled: since we go wrong through that
substance by virtue of which we are made a shrine of the Holy Ghost. For it is not so much
the corruptible flesh as the clean heart, which is made a shrine for God, and a temple of the
Holy Ghost. We ought therefore, whenever the outward man fasts, to restrain the inner
man as well from food which is bad for him: that inner man, namely, which the blessed
Apostle above all urges us to present pure before God, that it may be found worthy to receive
Christ as a guest within, saying “that in the inner man Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith.”332</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>That we should for this reason practise bodily abstinence that we may by it attain to a spiritual
fast.</head>
<p>And so we know that we ought therefore to bestow attention on bodily abstinence, that
we may by this fasting attain to purity of heart. Otherwise our labours will be spent in vain,
if we endure this without weariness, in contemplating the end, but are unable to reach the
end for which we have endured such trials; and it would have been better to have abstained
from the forbidden foods of the soul than to have fasted with the body from things indifferent
and harmless, for in the case of these latter there is a simple and harmless reception of a
creature of God, which in itself has nothing wrong about it: but in the case of the former
there is at the very first a dangerous tendency to devour the brethren; of which it is said,
“Do not love backbiting lest thou be rooted out.”333 And concerning anger and jealousy the
blessed Job says: “For anger slayeth a fool, and envy killeth a child.”334 And at the same time
it should be noticed that he who is angered is set down as a fool; and he who is jealous, as
a child. For the former is not undeservedly considered a fool, since of his own accord he
brings death upon himself, being goaded by the stings of anger; and the latter, while he is
envious, proves that he is a child and a minor, for while he envies another he shows that the
one at whose prosperity he is vexed, is greater than he.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>What should be the character of the monk’s food.</head>
<p>We should then choose for our food, not only that which moderates the heat of burning
lust, and avoids kindling it; but what is easily got ready, and what is recommended by its
cheapness, and is suitable to the life of the brethren and their common use. For the nature
of gluttony is threefold: first, there is that which forces us to anticipate the proper hour for
a meal, next that which delights in stuffing the stomach, and gorging all kinds of food;
thirdly, that which takes pleasure in more refined and delicate feasting. And so against it a
monk should observe a threefold watch: first, he should wait till the proper time for breaking
the fast; secondly, he should not give way to gorging; thirdly, he should be contented with
any of the commoner sorts of food. For anything that is taken over and above what is customary
and the common use of all, is branded by the ancient tradition of the fathers as defiled
with the sin of vanity and glorying and ostentation. Nor of those whom we have seen to be
deservedly eminent for learning and discretion, or whom the grace of Christ has singled
out as shining lights for every one to imitate, have we known any who have abstained from
eating bread which is accounted cheap and easily to be obtained among them; nor have we
seen that any one who has rejected this rule and given up the use of bread and taken to a
diet of beans or herbs or fruits, has been reckoned among the most esteemed, or even acquired
the grace of knowledge and discretion. For not only do they lay it down that a monk ought
not to ask for foods which are not customary for others, lest his mode of life should be exposed
publicly to all and rendered vain and idle and so be destroyed by the disease of vanity;
but they insist that the common chastening discipline of fasts ought not lightly to be disclosed
to any one, but as far as possible concealed and kept secret. But when any of the brethren
arrive they rule that we ought to show the virtues of kindness and charity instead of observing
a severe abstinence and our strict daily rule: nor should we consider what our own wishes
and profit or the ardour of our desires may require, but set before us and gladly fulfil whatever
the refreshment of the guest, or his weakness may demand from us.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>How in Egypt we saw that the daily fast was broken without scruple on our arrival.</head>
<p>When we had come from the region of Syria and had sought the province of Egypt, in
our desire to learn the rules of the Elders, we were astonished at the alacrity of heart with
which we were there received so that no rule forbidding refreshment till the appointed hour
of the fast was over was observed, such as we had been brought up to observe in the monas-
teries of Palestine; but except in the case of the regular days, Wednesdays and Fridays,
wherever we went the daily fast335 was broken:336 and when we asked why the daily fast
was thus ignored by them without scruple one of the elders replied: “The opportunity for
fasting is always with me. But as I am going to conduct you on your way, I cannot always
keep you with me. And a fast, although it is useful and advisable, is yet a free-will offering.
But the exigencies of a command require the fulfilment of a work of charity. And so receiving
Christ in you I ought to refresh Him but when I have sent you on your way I shall be able
to balance the hospitality offered for His sake by a stricter fast on my own account. For ‘the
children of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them:’337 but when he
has departed, then they will rightly fast.”</p>
<note type="footnote">335 Statio.</note>
<note type="footnote">336 The allusion is here to the sparing diet and voluntary fasts of the monks, among whom but one meal a
day was usual (see the note on III. xiii.), and though this was ordinarily taken at midday, yet many of the more
celebrated anchorites never broke their fast till the evening; e.g. S. Antony is said never to have eaten till sunset
(Vita Anton.) and S. Jerome gives a similar account of Hilarion (Vita Hil. § 4), while other instances of voluntary
fasts are given by Cassian in the following chapters, xxv.–xxvii. The “station” days, however, viz., Wednesday
and Friday, being of ecclesiastical authority, were strictly observed as a matter of rule, but these other voluntary
fasts at other times were to be freely broken through on account of the arrival of visitors. See the Conferences
II. xxvi., XXI. xiv., XXIV. xxi., and cf. Rufinus, History of the Monks II. vii., Palladius, the Lausiac History, c.
lii. So the Rule of S. Benedict (c. liii.) orders that on the arrival of visitors the Superior is to sit at table with them
and break his fast, unless it be a special fast day which may not be broken; but the brethren are to observe the
regular fasts.</note>

<head>Of the abstinence of one old man who took food six times so sparingly that he was still hungry.</head>
<p>When one of the elders was pressing me to eat a little more as I was taking refreshment,
and I said that I could not, he replied: “I have already laid my table six times for different
brethren who had arrived, and, pressing each of them, I partook of food with him, and am
still hungry, and do you, who now partake of refreshment for the first time, say that you
cannot eat any more?”</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>Of another old man, who never partook of food alone in his cell.</head>
<p>We have seen another who lived alone, who declared that he had never enjoyed food
by himself alone, but that even if for five days running none of the brethren came to his cell
he constantly put off taking food until on Saturday or Sunday he went to church for service
and found some stranger whom he brought home at once to his cell, and together with him
partook of refreshment for the body not so much by reason of his own needs, as for the sake
of kindness and on his brother’s account. And so as they know that the daily fast is broken
without scruple on the arrival of brethren, when they leave, they compensate for the refreshment
which has been enjoyed on their account by a greater abstinence, and sternly make
up for the reception of even a very little food by a severer chastisement not only as regards
bread, but also by lessening their usual amount of sleep.</p>

<head>What the two Abbots Pæsius and John said of the fruits of their zeal.</head>
<p>When the aged John, who was superior of a large monastery and of a quantity of brethren,
had come to visit the aged Pæsius, who was living in a vast desert, and had been asked of
him as of a very old friend, what he had done in all the forty years in which he had been
separated from him and had scarcely ever been disturbed in his solitude by the brethren:
“Never,” said he, “has the sun seen me eating,” “nor me angry,” said the other.338</p>
<note type="footnote">338 There is a Pæsius mentioned by Palladius in the Lausiac History, but it is not clear whether he is the same

would leave them, as a sort of legacy, some special charge by which they could attain to the
height of perfection, the more easily from the brevity of the charge: he sighed and said, “I
never did my own will, nor taught any one what I had not first done myself.”</p>

<head>Of Abbot Machetes, who never slept during the spiritual conferences, but always went to sleep
during earthly tales.</head>
<p>We knew an old man, Machetes by name, who lived at a distance from the crowds of
the brethren, and obtained by his daily prayers this grace from the Lord, that as often as a
spiritual conference was held, whether by day or by night, he never was at all overcome by
sleep: but if any one tried to introduce a word of detraction, or idle talk, he dropped off to
sleep at once as if the poison of slander could not possibly penetrate to pollute his ears.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
<head>A saying of the same old man about not judging any one.</head>
<p>The same old man, when he was teaching us that no one ought to judge another, remarked
that there were three points on which he had charged and rebuked the brethren,
viz.: because some allowed their uvula to be cut off, or kept a cloak in their cell, or blessed
oil and gave it to those dwelling in the world who asked for it: and he said that he had done
all these things himself. For having contracted some malady of the uvula, I wasted away,
said he, for so long, through its weakness, that at last I was driven by stress of the pain, and
by the persuasion of all the elders, to allow it to be cut off. And I was forced too by reason
of this illness, to keep a cloak. And I was also compelled to bless oil and give it to those who
prayed for it—a thing which I execrated above everything, since that I thought that it proceeded
from great presumption of heart—when suddenly many who were living in the world
surrounded me, so that I could not possibly escape them in any other way, had they not
extorted from me with no small violence, and entreaties that I would lay my hand on a
vessel offered by them, and sign it with the sign of the cross: and so believing that they had
secured blessed oil, at last they let me go. And by these things I plainly discovered that a
monk was in the same case and entangled in the same faults for which he had ventured to
judge others. Each one therefore ought only to judge himself, and to be on the watch, with
care and circumspection in all things not to judge the life and conduct of others in accordance
with the Apostle’s charge, “But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? to his own master
he standeth or falleth.” And this: “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment
ye judge, ye shall be judged.”339 For besides the reason of which we have spoken, it is for
this cause also dangerous to judge concerning others because in those matters in which we
are offended—as we do not know the need or the reason for which they are really acting
either rightly in the sight of God, or at any rate in a pardonable manner—we are found to
have judged them rashly and in this commit no light sin, by forming an opinion of our
brethren different from what we ought.</p>

<head>The same old man’s rebuke when he saw how the brethren went to sleep during the spiritual
conferences, and woke up when some idle story was told.</head>
<p>The same old man made clear by this proof that it was the devil who encouraged idle
tales, and showed himself always as the enemy of spiritual conferences. For when he was
discoursing to some of the brethren on necessary matters and spiritual things, and saw that
they were weighed down with a sound slumber, and could not drive away the weight of
sleep from their eyes, he suddenly introduced an idle tale. And when he saw that at once
they woke up, delighted with it, and pricked up their ears, he groaned and said, “Up till now
we were speaking of celestial things and all your eyes were overpowered with a sound
slumber; but as soon as an idle tale was introduced, we all woke up and shook off the
drowsiness of sleep which had overcome us. And from this therefore consider who is the
enemy of that spiritual conference, and who has shown himself the suggester of that useless
and carnal talk. For it is most evidently shown that it is he who, rejoicing in evil, never ceases
to encourage the latter and to oppose the former.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
<head>Of the letters which were burnt without being read.</head>
<p>Nor do I think it less needful to relate this act of a brother who was intent on purity of
heart, and extremely anxious with regard to the contemplation of things divine. When after
an interval of fifteen years a large number of letters had been brought to him from his
father and mother and many friends in the province of Pontus, he received the huge packet
of letters, and turning over the matter in his own mind for some time, “What thoughts,”
said he, “will the reading of these suggest to me, which will incite me either to senseless joy
or to useless sadness! for how many days will they draw off the attention of my heart from
the contemplation I have set before me, by the recollection of those who wrote them! How
long will it take for the disturbance of mind thus created to be calmed, and what an effort
will it cost for that former state of peacefulness to be restored, if the mind is once moved by
the sympathy of the letters, and by recalling the words and looks of those whom it has left
for so long begins once more in thought and spirit to revisit them, to dwell among them
and to be with them. And it will be of no use to have forsaken them in the body, if one begins
to look on them with the heart, and readmits and revives that memory which on renouncing
this world every one gave up, as if he were dead.” Turning this over in his mind, he determined
not only not to read a single letter, but not even to open the packet, for fear lest, at the
sight of the names of the writers, or on recalling their appearance, the purpose of his spirit
might give way. And so he threw it into the fire to be burnt, all tied up just as he had received
it, crying, “Away, O ye thoughts of my home, be ye burnt up, and try no further to recall
me to those things from which I have fled.”</p>

<head>Of the solution of a question which Abbot Theodore obtained by prayer.</head>
<p>We knew also Abbot Theodore,340 a man gifted with the utmost holiness and with
perfect knowledge not only in practical life, but also in understanding the Scriptures, which
he had not acquired so much by study and reading, or worldly education, as by purity of
heart alone: since he could with difficulty understand and speak but a very few words of the
Greek language. This man when he was seeking an explanation of some most difficult
question, continued without ceasing for seven days and nights in prayer until he discovered
by a revelation from the Lord the solution of the question propounded.</p>
<note type="footnote">340 Nothing further is known for certain of this Theodore. He may be the author of the VIth of the Conferences;

<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
<head>Of the saying of the same old man, through which he taught by what efforts a monk can acquire
a knowledge of the Scriptures.</head>
<p>This man therefore, when some of the brethren were wondering at the splendid light
of his knowledge and were asking of him some meanings of Scripture, said that a monk who
wanted to acquire a knowledge of the Scriptures ought not to spend his labour on the works
of commentators, but rather to keep all the efforts of his mind and intentions of his heart
set on purifying himself from carnal vices: for when these are driven out, at once the eyes
of the heart, as if the veil of the passions were removed, will begin as it were naturally to
gaze on the mysteries341 of Scripture: since they were not declared to us by the grace of the
Holy Spirit in order that they should remain unknown and obscure; but they are rendered
obscure by our fault, as the veil of our sins covers the eyes of the heart, and when these are
restored to their natural state of health, the mere reading of Holy Scripture is by itself amply
sufficient for beholding the true knowledge, nor do they need the aid of commentators, just
as these eyes of flesh need no man’s teaching how to see, provided that they are free from
dimness or the darkness of blindness. For this reason there have arisen so great differences
and mistakes among commentators because most of them, paying no sort of attention towards
purifying the mind, rush into the work of interpreting the Scriptures, and in proportion to
the density or impurity of their heart form opinions that are at variance with and contrary
to each other’s and to the faith, and so are unable to take in the light of truth.</p>

<head>A rebuke of the same old man, when he had come to my cell in the middle of the night.</head>
<p>The same Theodore came unexpectedly to my cell in the dead of night, with paternal
inquisitiveness seeking what I—an unformed anchorite as I was—might be doing by myself;
and when he had found me there already, as I had finished my vesper office, beginning to
refresh my wearied body, and lying down on a mat, he sighed from the bottom of his heart,
and calling me by name, said, “How many, O John, are at this hour communing with God,
and embracing Him, and detaining Him with them, while you are deprived of so great light,
enfeebled as you are with lazy sleep!”</p>
<p>And since the virtues of the fathers and the grace given to them have tempted us to turn
aside to a story like this, I think it well to record in this volume a noteworthy deed of charity,
which we experienced from the kindness of that most excellent man Archebius, that the
purity of continence grafted on to a work of charity may more readily shine forth, being
embellished with a pleasing variety. For the duty of fasting is then rendered acceptable to
God, when it is made perfect by the fruits of charity.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
<head>A description of the desert in Diolcos, where the anchorites live.</head>
<p>And so when we had come, while still beginners, from the monasteries of Palestine, to
a city of Egypt called Diolcos,342 and were contemplating a large number of monks bound
by the discipline of the Coenobium, and trained in that excellent system of monasteries,
which is also the earliest, we were also eager to see with all wisdom of heart another system
as well which is still better, viz.: that of the anchorites, as we were incited thereto by the
praises of it by everybody. For these men, having first lived for a very long time in Coenobia,
and having diligently learnt all the rules of patience and discretion, and acquired the virtues
of humility and renunciation, and having perfectly overcome all their faults, in order to
engage in most fearful conflicts with devils, penetrate the deepest recesses of the desert.
Finding then that men of this sort were living near the river Nile in a place which is surrounded
on one side by the same river, on the other by the expanse of the sea, and forms an island,
habitable by none but monks seeking such recesses, since the saltness of the soil and dryness
of the sand make it unfit for any cultivation—to these men, I say, we eagerly hastened, and
were beyond measure astonished at their labours which they endure in the contemplation
of the virtues and their love of solitude. For they are hampered by such a scarcity even of
water that the care and exactness with which they portion it out is such as no miser would
bestow in preserving and hoarding the most precious kind of wine. For they carry it three
miles or even further from the bed of the above-mentioned river, for all necessary purposes;
and the distance, great as it is, with sandy mountains in between, is doubled by the very
great difficulty of the task.</p>

<head>Of the cells which Abbot Archebius gave up to us with their furniture.</head>
<p>Having then seen this, as we were inflamed with the desire of imitating them, the
aforesaid Archebius, the most famous among them for the grace of kindness, drew us into
his cell, and having discovered our desire, pretended that he wanted to leave the place, and
to offer his cell to us, as if he were going away, declaring that he would have done it, even
if we had not come. And we, inflamed with the desire of remaining there, and putting unhesitating
faith in the assertions of so great a man, willingly agreed to this, and took over
his cell with all its furniture and belongings. And so having succeeded in his pious fraud,
he left the place for a few days in which to procure the means for constructing a cell, and
after this returned, and with the utmost labour built another cell for himself. And after some
little time, when some other brethren came inflamed with the same desire to stay there, he
deceived them by a similar charitable falsehood, and gave this one up with everything pertaining
to it. But he, unweariedly persevering in his act of charity, built for himself a third
cell to dwell in.343</p>

<head>The same Archebius paid a debt of his mother’s by the labour of his own hands.</head>
<p>It seems to me worth while to hand down another charitable act of the same man, that
the monks of our land may be taught by the example of one and the same man to maintain
not only a rigorous continence, but also the most unfeigned affection of love. For he, sprung
from no ignoble family, while yet a child, scorning the love of this world and of his kinsfolk,
fled to the monastery which is nearly four miles distant from the aforementioned town,
where he so passed all his life, that never once throughout the whole of fifty years did he
enter or see the village from which he had come, nor even look upon the face of any woman,
not even his own mother. In the mean while his father was overtaken by death, and left a
debt of a hundred solidi. And though he himself was entirely free from all annoyances, since
he had been disinherited of all his father’s property, yet he found that his mother was excessively
annoyed by the creditors. Then he through consideration of duty somewhat moderated
that gospel severity through which formerly, while his parents were prosperous, he did not
recognize that he possessed a father or mother on earth; and acknowledged that he had a
mother, and hastened to relieve her in her distress, without relaxing anything of the austerity
he had set himself. For remaining within the cloister of the monastery he asked that the task
of his usual work might be trebled. And there for a whole year toiling night and day alike
he paid to the creditors the due measure of the debt secured by his toil and labour, and relieved
his mother from all annoyance and anxiety; ridding her of the burden of the debt in
such a way as not to suffer aught of the severity he had set himself to be diminished on plea
of duteous necessity. Thus did he preserve his wonted austerities, without ever denying to
his mother’s heart the work which duty demanded, as, though he had formerly disregarded
her for the love of Christ, he now acknowledged her again out of consideration of duty.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
<head>Of the device of a certain old man by which some work was found for Abbot Simeon when he
had nothing to do.</head>
<p>When a brother who was very dear to us, Simeon by name, a man utterly ignorant of
Greek, had come from the region of Italy, one of the elders, anxious to show to him, as he
was a stranger, a work of charity, with some pretence of the benefit being mutual, asked
him why he sat doing nothing in his cell, guessing from this that he would not be able to
stay much longer in it both because of the roving thoughts which idleness produces and
because of his want of the necessities of life; well knowing that no one can endure the assaults
made in solitude, but one who is contented to procure food for himself by the labour of his
hands. And when the other replied that he could not do or manage any of the things which
were usually done by the brethren there, except write a good hand, if any one in Egypt
wanted a Latin book for his use, then he at length seized the opportunity to secure the long
wished for work of charity, under colour of its being a mutual benefit; and said, “From God
this opportunity comes, for I was just looking for some one to write out for me the Epistles344
in Latin; for I have a brother who is bound in the chains of military service, and is a good
Latin scholar, to whom I want to send something from Scripture for him to read for his
edification.” And so when Simeon gratefully took this as an opportunity offered to him by
God, the old man also gladly seized the pretext, under colour of which he could freely carry
out his work of charity, and at once not only brought him as a matter of business everything
he could want for a whole year, but also conveyed to him parchment and everything requisite
for writing, and received afterwards the manuscript, which was not of the slightest use (since
in those parts they were all utterly ignorant of this language), and did no good to anybody
except that which resulted from this device and large outlay, as the one, without shame or
confusion, procured his necessary food and sustenance by the reward of his work and labour,
and the other carried out his kindness and bounty as it were by the compulsion of a debt:
securing for himself a more abundant reward proportioned to the zeal with which he procured
for his foreign brother not only his necessary food, but materials for writing, and an
opportunity of work.</p>

<head>Of the boys who when bringing to a sick man some figs, died in the desert from hunger, without
having tasted them.</head>
<p>But since in the section in which we proposed to say something about the strictness of
fasting and abstinence, kindly acts and deeds of charity seem to have been intermingled,
again returning to our design we will insert in this little book a noteworthy deed of some
who were boys in years though not in their feelings. For when, to their great surprise, some
one had brought to Abbot John, the steward in the desert of Scete, some figs from Libya
Mareotis,345 as being a thing never before seen in those districts,—(John) who had the
management of the church in the days of the blessed Presbyter Paphnutius,346 by whom it
had been intrusted to him, at once sent them by the hands of two lads to an old man who
was laid up in ill health in the further parts of the desert, and who lived about eighteen miles
from the church. And when they had received the fruit, and set off for the cell of the abovementioned
old man, they lost the right path altogether—a thing which there easily happens
even to elders—as a thick fog suddenly came on. And when all day and night they had
wandered about the trackless waste of the desert, and could not possibly find the sick man’s
cell, worn out at last both by weariness from their journey, and from hunger and thirst, they
bent their knees and gave up their souls to God in the very act of prayer. And afterwards,
when they had been for a long while sought for by the marks of their footsteps which in
those sandy regions are impressed as if on snow, until a thin coating of sand blown about
even by a slight breeze covers them up again, it was found that they had preserved the figs
untouched, just as they had received them; choosing rather to give up their lives, than their
fidelity to their charge, and to lose their life on earth than to violate the commands of their
senior.</p>
<note type="footnote">345 The Mareotic nome is the district round Lake Mareotis, a lake in the north of the delta bordering upon

<p>There is still one valuable charge of the blessed Macarius to be brought forward by us,
so that a saying of so great a man may close this book of fasts and abstinence. He said then
that a monk ought to bestow attention on his fasts, just as if he were going to remain in the
flesh for a hundred years; and to curb the motions of the soul, and to forget injuries, and to
loathe sadness, and despise sorrows and losses, as if he were daily at the point of death. For
in the former case discretion is useful and proper as it causes a monk always to walk with
well-balanced care, and does not suffer him by reason of a weakened body to fall from the
heights over most dangerous precipices: in the other high-mindedness is most valuable as
it will enable him not only to despise the seeming prosperity of this present world, but also
not to be crushed by adversity and sorrow, and to despise them as small and paltry matters,
since he has the gaze of his mind continually fixed there, whither daily at each moment he
believes that he is soon to be summoned.347</p>
<note type="footnote">347 Socrates (H.E. Book IV. c. xxiii.) gives an account of two monks of the name of Macarius, one of whom
was from Upper Egypt, and the other from Alexandria. Compare also Rufinus History of the Monks, cc. xxviii.,
xxix. It is not certain to which of them Cassian’s stories refer, here and in the Conferences V. xii. VII. xxvii.,
XXIV. xiii. The story told in Conference XV. iii, refers to the “Egyptian” Macarius (cf. Sozomen H. E. III. xiv.,
where the miracle is expressly assigned to him): that in XIV. iv. evidently belongs to the “Alexandrian” Macarius.
The two are mentioned together in Conference XIX. ix., and by various other writers.</note>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How our warfare with covetousness is a foreign one, and how this fault is not a natural one
in man, as the other faults are.</head>
<p>Our third conflict is against covetousness which we can describe as the love of money;
a foreign warfare, and one outside of our nature, and in the case of a monk originating only
from the state of a corrupt and sluggish mind, and often from the beginning of his renunciation
being unsatisfactory, and his love towards God being lukewarm at its foundation. For
the rest of the incitements to sin planted in human nature seem to have their commencement
as it were congenital with us, and somehow being deeply rooted in our flesh, and almost
coeval with our birth, anticipate our powers of discerning good and evil, and although in
very early days they attack a man, yet they are overcome with a long struggle.</p>

<head>How dangerous is the disease of covetousness.</head>
<p>But this disease coming upon us at a later period, and approaching the soul from with
out, as it can be the more easily guarded against and resisted, so, if it is disregarded and once
allowed to gain an entrance into the heart, is the more dangerous to every one, and with the
greater difficulty expelled. For it becomes “a root of all evils,”348 and gives rise to a multiplicity
of incitements to sin.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="553"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>What is the usefulness of those vices which are natural to us.</head>
<p>For example, do not we see those natural impulses of the flesh not only in boys in whom
innocence still anticipates the discernment of good and evil, but even in little children and
infants, who although they have not even the slightest approach to lust within them, yet
show that the impulses of the flesh exist in them and are naturally excited? Do not we also
see that the deadly pricks of anger already exist in full vigour likewise in little children? and
before they have learnt the virtue of patience, we see that they are disturbed by wrongs, and
feel affronts offered to them even by way of a joke; and sometimes, although strength is
lacking to them, the desire to avenge themselves is not wanting, when anger excites them.
Nor do I say this to lay the blame on their natural state, but to point out that of these impulses
which proceed from us, some are implanted in us for a useful purpose, while some are introduced
from without, through the fault of carelessness and the desire of an evil will. For
these carnal impulses, of which we spoke above, were with a useful purpose implanted in
our bodies by the providence of the Creator, viz.: for perpetuating the race, and raising up
children for posterity: and not for committing adulteries and debaucheries, which the authority
of the law also condemns. The pricks of anger too, do we not see that they have been
most wisely given to us, that being enraged at our sins and mistakes, we may apply ourselves
the rather to virtues and spiritual exercises, showing forth all love towards God, and patience
towards our brethren? We know too how great is the use of sorrow, which is reckoned
among the other vices, when it is turned to an opposite use. For on the one hand, when it
is in accordance with the fear of God it is most needful, and on the other, when it is in accordance
with the world, most pernicious; as the Apostle teaches us when he says that “the
sorrow which is according to God worketh repentance that is steadfast unto salvation, but
the sorrow of the world worketh death.”349</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>That we can say that there exist in us some natural faults, without wronging the Creator.</head>
<p>If then we say that these impulses were implanted in us by the Creator, He will not on
that account seem blameworthy, if we choose wrongly to abuse them, and to pervert them
to harmful purposes, and are ready to be made sorry by means of the useless Cains of this
world, and not by means of showing penitence and the correction of our faults: or at least
if we are angry not with ourselves (which would be profitable) but with our brethren in defiance
of God’s command. For in the case of iron, which is given us for good and useful
purposes, if any one should pervert it for murdering the innocent, one would not therefore
blame the maker of the metal because man had used to injure others that which he had
provided for good and useful purposes of living happily.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of the faults which are contracted through our own fault, without natural impulses.</head>
<p>But we affirm that some faults grow up without any natural occasion giving birth to
them, but simply from the free choice of a corrupt and evil will, as envy and this very sin of
covetousness; which are caught (so to speak) from without, having no origination in us
from natural instincts. But these, in proportion as they are easily guarded against and
readily avoided, just so do they make wretched the mind that they have got hold of and
seized, and hardly do they suffer it to get at the remedies which would cure it: either because
these who are wounded by persons whom they might either have ignored, or avoided, or
easily overcome, do not deserve to be healed by a speedy cure, or else because, having laid
the foundations badly, they are unworthy to raise an edifice of virtue and reach the summit
of perfection.</p>

<head>How difficult the evil of covetousness is to drive away when once it has been admitted.</head>
<p>Wherefore let not this evil seem of no account or unimportant to anybody: for as it can
easily be avoided, so if it has once got hold of any one, it scarcely suffers him to get at the
remedies for curing it. For it is a regular nest of sins, and a “root of all kinds of evil,” and
becomes a hopeless incitement to wickedness, as the Apostle says, “Covetousness,” i.e. the
love of money, “is a root of all kinds of evil.”350</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7"> 
<pb n="557"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of the source from which covetousness springs, and of the evils of which it is itself the mother.</head>
<p>When then this vice has got hold of the slack and lukewarm soul of some monk, it begins
by tempting him in regard of a small sum of money, giving him excellent and almost reasonable
excuses why he ought to retain some money for himself. For he complains that what
is provided in the monastery is not sufficient, and can scarcely be endured by a sound and
sturdy body. What is he to do if ill health comes on, and he has no special store of his own
to support him in his weakness? He says that the allowance of the monastery is but meagre,
and that there is the greatest carelessness about the sick: and if he has not something of his
own so that he can look after the wants of his body, he will perish miserably. The dress which
is allowed him is insufficient, unless he has provided something with which to procure another.
Lastly, he says that he cannot possibly remain for long in the same place and monastery,
and that unless he has secured the money for his journey, and the cost of his removal over
the sea, he cannot move when he wants to, and, detained by the compulsion of want, will
henceforth drag out a wretched and wearisome existence without making the slightest advance:
that he cannot without indignity be supported by another’s substance, as a pauper
and one in want. And so when he has bamboozled himself with such thoughts as these, he
racks his brains to think how he can acquire at least one penny. Then he anxiously searches
for some special work which he can do without the Abbot knowing anything about it. And
selling it secretly, and so securing the coveted coin, he torments himself worse and worse
in thinking how he can double it: puzzled as to where to deposit it, or to whom to intrust
it. Then he is oppressed with a still weightier care as to what to buy with it, or by what
transaction he can double it. And when this has turned out as he wished, a still more greedy
craving for gold springs up, and is more and more keenly excited, as his store of money
grows larger and larger. For with the increase of wealth the mania of covetousness increases.
Then next he has forebodings of a long life, and an enfeebled old age, and infirmities of all
sorts, and long drawn out, which will be insupportable in old age, unless a large store of
money has been laid by in youth. And so the wretched soul is agitated, and held fast, as it
were, in a serpent’s toils, while it endeavours to add to that heap which it has unlawfully
secured, by still more unlawful care, and itself gives birth to plagues which inflame it more
sorely, and being entirely absorbed in the quest of gain, pays attention to nothing but how
to get money with which to fly351 as quickly as possible from the discipline of the monastery,
never keeping faith where there is a gleam of hope of money to be got. For this it shrinks
not from the crime of lying, perjury, and theft, of breaking a promise, of giving way to injur-
<note type="footnote">351 The same danger is strongly spoken of by S. Basil in the “Monastic Constitutions” c. xxxiv., a passage
which should be compared with the one above.</note>

<pb n="558"/>
ious bursts of passion. If the man has dropped away at all from the hope of gain, he has no
scruples about transgressing the bounds of humility, and through it all gold and the love of
gain become to him his god, as the belly does to others. Wherefore the blessed Apostle,
looking out on the deadly poison of this pest, not only says that it is a root of all kinds of
evil, but also calls it the worship of idols, saying “And covetousness (which in Greek is called
φιλαργυρία ) which is the worship of idols.”352 You see then to what a downfall this madness
step by step leads, so that by the voice of the Apostle it is actually declared to be the worship
of idols and false gods, because passing over the image and likeness of God (which one who
serves God with devotion ought to preserve undefiled in himself), it chooses to love and
care for images stamped on gold instead of God.</p>

<p>With such strides then in a downward direction he goes from bad to worse, and at last

and now having cast off all reverence, like a bad-tempered horse, dashes off headlong and
unbridled: and discontented with his daily food and usual clothing, announces that he will
not put up with it any longer. He declares that God is not only there, and that his salvation
is not confined to that place, where, if he does not take himself off pretty quickly from it,
he deeply laments that he will soon die.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>How a monk who has money cannot stay in the monastery.</head>
<p>And so having money to provide for his wanderings, with the assistance of which he
has fitted himself as it were with wings, and now being quite ready for his move, he answers
impertinently to all commands, and behaves himself like a stranger and a visitor, and
whatever he sees needing improvement, he despises and treats with contempt. And though
he has a supply of money secretly hidden, yet he complains that he has neither shoes nor
clothes, and is indignant that they are given out to him so slowly. And if it happens that
through the management of the superior some of these are given first to one who is known
to have nothing whatever, he is still more inflamed with burning rage, and thinks that he is
despised as a stranger; nor is he contented to turn his hand to any work, but finds fault with
everything which the needs of the monastery require to be done. Then of set purpose he
looks out for opportunities of being offended and angry, lest he might seem to have gone
forth from the discipline of the monastery for a trivial reason. And not content to take his
departure by himself alone, lest it should be thought that he has left as it were from his own
fault, he never stops corrupting as many as he can by clandestine conferences. But if the
severity of the weather interferes with his journey and travels, he remains all the time in
suspense and anxiety of heart, and never stops sowing and exciting discontent; as he thinks
that he will only find consolation for his departure and an excuse for his fickleness in the
bad character and defects of the monastery.</p>

which when it is acquired, never allows a monk either to remain in a monastery or to live
under the discipline of a rule. And when separating him like some wild beast from the rest
of the herd, it has made him through want of companions an animal fit for prey, and caused
him to be easily eaten up, as he is deprived of fellow lodgers, it forces him, who once thought
it beneath him to perform the slight duties of the monastery, to labour without stopping
night and day, through hope of gain; it suffers him to keep no services of prayer, no system
of fasting, no rule of vigils; it does not allow him to fulfil the duties of seemly intercession,
if only he can satisfy the madness of avarice, and supply his daily wants; inflaming the more
the fire of covetousness, while believing that it will be extinguished by getting.</p>

or which by a bad beginning they kept back, they seek for women to dwell with them, to
preserve what they have unjustifiably amassed or retained. And they implicate themselves
in so many harmful and dangerous occupations, that they are cast down even to the depths
of hell, while they refuse to acquiesce in that saying of the Apostle, that “having food and
clothing they should be content” with that which the thrift of the monastery supplied, but
“wishing to become rich they fall into temptation and the snare of the devil, and many unprofitable
and hurtful desires, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love
of money,” i.e. covetousness, “is a root of all kinds of evil, which some coveting have erred
from the faith, and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.”353</p>

to turn his thoughts back to those things which he had given up and renounced, but to free
himself from covetousness, the root of all kinds of evil, and from earthly snares; and when
told that if he wished to be cleansed from his former passions, by which he saw that he was
from time to time grievously oppressed, he should cease from caring about those things
which even formerly were not his own, entangled in the chains of which he certainly could
not make progress towards purifying himself of his faults: with an angry expression he did
not hesitate to answer, “If you have that with which you can support others, why do you
forbid me to have it as well?”354</p>

kinds of sins are first explained, and the origin and causes of diseases traced out, the proper
healing remedies cannot be applied to the sick, nor can the preservation of perfect health
be secured by the strong. For both these matters and many others besides these are generally
put forward for the instruction of the younger brethren by the elders in their conferences,
as they have had experience of numberless falls and the ruin of all sorts of people. And often
recognizing in ourselves many of these things, when the elders explained and showed them,
as men who were themselves disquieted355 by the same passions, we were cured without
any shame or confusion on our part, since without saying anything we learnt both the
remedies and the causes of the sins which beset us, which we have passed over and said
nothing about, not from fear of the brethren, but lest our book should chance to fall into
the hands of some who have had no instruction in this way of life, and might disclose to
inexperienced persons what ought to be known only to those who are toiling and striving
to reach the heights of perfection.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Instances to show that the disease of covetousness is threefold.</head>
<p>And so this disease and unhealthy state is threefold, and is condemned with equal abhorrence
by all the fathers. One feature is this, of which we described the taint above, which
by deceiving wretched folk persuades them to hoard though they never had anything of
their own when they lived in the world. Another, which forces men afterwards to resume
and once more desire those things which in the early days of their renunciation of the world
they gave up. A third, which springing from a faulty and hurtful beginning and making a
bad start, does not suffer those whom it has once infected with this lukewarmness of mind
to strip themselves of all their worldly goods, through fear of poverty and want of faith; and
those who keep back money and property which they certainly ought to have renounced
and forsaken, it never allows to arrive at the perfection of the gospel. And we find in Holy
Scripture instances of these three catastrophes which were visited with no light punishment.
For when Gehazi wished to acquire what he had never had before, not only did he fail to
obtain the gift of prophecy which it would have been his to receive from his master by
hereditary succession, but on the contrary he was covered by the curse of the holy Elisha
with a perpetual leprosy: while Judas, wanting to resume the possession of the wealth which
he had formerly cast away when he followed Christ, not only fell into betraying the Lord,
and lost his apostolic rank, but also was not allowed to close his life with the common lot
of all but ended it by a violent death. But Ananias and Sapphira, keeping back a part of that
which was formerly their own, were at the Apostle’s word punished with death.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Of the difference between one who renounces the world badly and one who does not renounce
it at all.</head>
<p>Of those then who say that they have renounced this world, and afterwards being
overcome by want of faith are afraid of losing their worldly goods, a charge is given mystically
in Deuteronomy. “If any man is afraid and of a fearful heart let him not go forth to war: let
him go back and return home, lest he make the hearts of his brethren to fear as he himself
is timid and frightened.”356 What can one want plainer than this testimony? Does not
Scripture clearly prefer that they should not take on them even the earliest stages of this
profession and its name, rather than by their persuasion and bad example turn others back
from the perfection of the gospel, and weaken them by their faithless terror. And so they
are bidden to withdraw from the battle and return to their homes, because a man cannot
fight the Lord’s battle with a double heart. For “a double-minded man is unstable in all his
ways.”357 And thinking, according to that Parable in the Gospel,358 that he who goes forth
with ten thousand men against a king who comes with twenty thousand, cannot possibly
fight, they should, while he is yet a great way off, ask for peace; that is, it is better for them
not even to take the first step towards renunciation, rather than afterwards following it up
coldly, to involve themselves in still greater dangers. For “it is better not to vow, than to vow
and not pay.”359 But finely is the one described as coming with ten thousand and the other
with twenty. For the number of sins which attack us is far larger than that of the virtues
which fight for us. But “no man can serve God and Mammon.”360 And “no man putting
his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.”361</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>Of the authority under which those shelter themselves who object to stripping themselves of
their goods.</head>
<p>These then try to make out a case for their original avarice, by some authority from
Holy Scripture, which they interpret with base ingenuity, in their desire to wrest and pervert
to their own purposes a saying of the Apostle or rather of the Lord Himself: and, not adapting
their own life or understanding to the meaning of the Scripture, but making the meaning
of Scripture bend to the desires of their own lust, they try to make it to correspond to their
own views, and say that it is written, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”362 And by
an entirely wrong interpretation of this they think that they can weaken the force of that
saying of the Lord in which he says: “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”363 And they
think that under colour of this they need not deprive themselves of their riches: declaring
indeed that they are more blessed if, supported by that which originally belonged to them,
they give to others also out of their superabundance. And while they are shy of embracing
with the Apostle that glorious state of abnegation for Christ’s sake, they will not be content
either with manual labour or the sparing diet of the monastery. And the only thing is that
these must either know that they are deceiving themselves, and have not really renounced
the world while they are clinging to their former riches; or, if they really and truly want to
make trial of the monastic life, they must give up and forsake all these things and keep back
nothing of that which they have renounced, and, with the Apostle, glory “in hunger and
thirst, in cold and nakedness.”364</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Of the renunciation of the apostles and the primitive church.</head>
<p>As if he (who, by his assertion that he was endowed with the privileges of a Roman citizen
from his birth, testifies that he was no mean person according to this world’s rank) might
not likewise have been supported by the property which formerly belonged to him! And as
if those men who were possessors of lands and houses in Jerusalem and sold everything and
kept back nothing whatever for themselves, and brought the price of them and laid it at the
feet of the apostles, might not have supplied their bodily necessities from their own property,
had this been considered the best plan by the apostles, or had they themselves deemed it
preferable! But they gave up all their property at once, and preferred to be supported by
their own labour, and by the contributions of the Gentiles, of whose collection the holy
Apostle speaks in writing to the Romans, and declaring his own office in this matter to them,
and urging them on likewise to make this collection: “But now I go to Jerusalem to minister
to the saints. For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution
for the poor saints who are at Jerusalem: it has pleased them indeed, and their debtors they
are. For if the Gentiles are made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also to minister
to them in carnal things.”365 To the Corinthians also he shows the same anxiety about this,
and urges them the more diligently to prepare before his arrival a collection, which he was
intending to send for their needs. “But concerning the collection for the saints, as I appointed
to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. Let each one of you on the first day of the week put
apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him, that when I come the collections
be not then to be made. But when I come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters,
them I will send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.” And that he may stimulate them to make
a larger collection, he adds, “But if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me:”366
meaning if your offering is of such a character as to deserve to be taken there by my ministration.
To the Galatians too, he testifies that when he was settling the division of the ministry
of preaching with the apostles, he had arranged this with James, Peter, and John: that he
should undertake the preaching to the Gentiles, but should never repudiate care and anxious
thought for the poor who were at Jerusalem, who for Christ’s sake gave up all their goods,
and submitted to voluntary poverty. “And when they saw,” said he, “the grace of God which
was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and to
Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should preach to the Gentiles, but they to
those of the circumcision: only they would that we should be mindful of the poor.” A matter
which he testifies that he attended to most carefully, saying, “which also I was anxious of
<note type="footnote">365 Rom. xv. 25–27.</note>
<note type="footnote">366 1 Cor. xvi. 1–4.</note>

<pb n="569"/>
myself to do.”367 Who then are the more blessed, those who but lately were gathered out of
the number of the heathen, and being unable to climb to the heights of the perfection of the
gospel, clung to their own property, in whose case it was considered a great thing by the
Apostle if at least they were restrained from the worship of idols, and from fornication, and
from things strangled, and from blood,368 and had embraced the faith of Christ, with their
goods and all: or those who live up to the demands of the gospel, and carry the Lord’s cross
daily, and want nothing out of their property to remain for their own use? And if the blessed
Apostle himself, bound with chains and fetters, or hampered by the difficulties of travelling,
and for these reasons not being able to provide with his hands, as he generally did, for the
supply of his food, declares that he received that which supplied his wants from the brethren
who came from Macedonia; “For that which was lacking to me,” he says, “the brethren who
came from Macedonia supplied:”369 and to the Philippians he says: “For ye Philippians
know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came from Macedonia, no church
communicated with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; because even
in Thessalonica once and again you sent to supply my needs:”370 (if this was so) then, according
to the notion of these men, which they have formed in the coldness of their heart,
will those men really be more blessed than the Apostle, because it is found that they have
ministered to him of their substance? But this no one will venture to assert, however big a

<head>That if we want to imitate the apostles we ought not to live according to our own prescriptions,
but to follow their example.</head>
<p>Wherefore if we want to obey the gospel precept, and to show ourselves the followers
of the Apostle and the whole primitive church, or of the fathers who in our own days succeeded
to their virtues and perfection, we should not acquiesce in our own prescriptions,
promising ourselves perfection from this wretched and lukewarm condition of ours: but
following their footsteps, we should by no means aim at looking after our own interests, but
should seek out the discipline and system of a monastery, that we may in very truth renounce
this world; preserving nothing of those things which we have despised through the
temptation of want of faith; and should look for our daily food, not from any store of money
of our own, but from our own labours.</p>

<head>A saying of S. Basil, the Bishop, directed against Syncletius.371</head>
<p>There is current a saying of S. Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea, directed against a certain Syncletius,
who was growing indifferent with the sort of lukewarmness of which we have spoken;
who, though he professed to have renounced this world, had yet kept back for himself some
of his property, not liking to be supported by the labour of his own hands, and to acquire
true humility by stripping himself and by grinding toil, and the subjection of the monastery:
“You have,” said he, “spoilt Syncletius, and not made a monk.”</p>
<note type="footnote">371 Petschenig’s text has Syncletium as a proper name. Gazæus, however, thinks that it should be Syncleticum;
i.e. Συγκλητικός or Senator: and in the saying of S. Basil at the close of the chapter actually reads (apparently
without any ms. authority), Et Senatorem, inquit, perdidisti.</note>

<head>How contemptible it is to be overcome by covetousness.</head>
<p>And so if we want to strive lawfully in our spiritual combat, let us expel this dangerous
enemy also from our hearts. For to overcome him does not so much show great virtue, as
to be beaten by him is shameful and disgraceful. For when you are overpowered by a strong
man, though there is grief in being overthrown, and distress at the loss of victory, yet some
consolation may be derived by the vanquished from the strength of their opponent. But if
the enemy is a poor creature, and the struggle a feeble one, besides the grief for defeat there
is confusion of a more disgraceful character, and a shame which is worse than loss.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>How covetousness can be conquered.</head>
<p>And in this case it will be the greatest victory and a lasting triumph, if, as is said, the
conscience of the monk is not defiled by the possession of the smallest coin. For it is an
impossibility for him who, overcome in the matter of a small possession, has once admitted
into his heart a root of evil desire, not to be inflamed presently with the heat of a still greater
desire. For the soldier of Christ will be victorious and in safety, and free from all the attacks
of desire, so long as this most evil spirit does not implant in his heart a seed of this desire.
Wherefore, though in the matter of all kinds of sins we ought ordinarily to watch the serpent’s
head,372 yet in this above all we should be more keenly on our guard. For if it has been admitted
it will grow by feeding on itself, and will kindle for itself a worse fire. And so we must
not only guard against the possession of money, but also must expel from our souls the desire
for it. For we should not so much avoid the results of covetousness, as cut off by the roots
all disposition towards it. For it will do no good not to possess money, if there exists in us
the desire for getting it.</p>

<head>That one who actually has no money may still be deemed covetous.</head>
<p>For it is possible even for one who has no money to be by no means free from the malady
of covetousness, and for the blessing of penury to do him no good, because he has not been
able to root out the sin of cupidity: delighting in the advantages of poverty, not in the merit
of the virtue, and satisfied with the burden of necessity, not without coldness of heart. For
just as the word of the gospel declares of those who are not defiled in body, that they are
adulterers in heart;373 so it is possible that those who are in no way pressed down with the
weight of money may be condemned with the covetous in disposition and intent. For it was
the opportunity of possessing which was wanting in their case, and not the will for it: which
latter is always crowned by God, rather than compulsion. And so we must use all diligence
lest the fruits of our labours should be destroyed to no purpose. For it is a wretched thing
to have endured the effects of poverty and want, but to have lost their fruits, through the
fault of a shattered will.</p>

<head>An example drawn from the case of Judas.</head>
<p>Would you like to know how dangerously and harmfully that incitement, unless it has
been carefully eradicated, will shoot up for the destruction of its owner, and put forth all
sorts of branches of different sins? Look at Judas, reckoned among the number of the apostles,
and see how because he would not bruise the deadly head of this serpent it destroyed him
with its poison, and how when he was caught in the snares of concupiscence, it drove him
into sin and a headlong downfall, so that he was persuaded to sell the Redeemer of the world
and the author of man’s salvation for thirty pieces of silver. And he could never have been
impelled to this heinous sin of the betrayal if he had not been contaminated by the sin of
covetousness: nor would he have made himself wickedly guilty of betraying374 the Lord,
unless he had first accustomed himself to rob the bag intrusted to him.</p>

<head>That covetousness cannot be overcome except by stripping one’s self of everything.</head>
<p>This is a sufficiently dreadful and clear instance of this tyranny, which, when once the
mind is taken prisoner by it, allows it to keep to no rules of honesty, nor to be satisfied with
any additions to its gains. For we must seek to put an end to this madness, not by riches,
but by stripping ourselves of them. Lastly, when he (viz. Judas) had received the bag set
apart for the distribution to the poor, and intrusted to his care for this purpose, that he
might at least satisfy himself with plenty of money, and set a limit to his avarice, yet his
plentiful supply only broke out into a still greedier incitement of desire, so that he was ready
no longer secretly to rob the bag, but actually to sell the Lord Himself. For the madness of
this avarice is not satisfied with any amount of riches.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Of the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira, and Judas, which they underwent through the impulse
of covetousness.</head>
<p>Lastly, the chief of the apostles, taught by these instances, and knowing that one who
has any avarice cannot bridle it, and that it cannot be put an end to by a large or small sum
of money, but only by the virtue of renunciation of everything, punished with death
Ananias and Sapphira, who were mentioned before, because they had kept back something
out of their property, that that death which Judas had voluntarily met with for the sin of
betraying the Lord, they might also undergo for their lying avarice.375 How closely do the
sin and punishment correspond in each case! In the one case treachery, in the other falsehood,
was the result of covetousness. In the one case the truth is betrayed, in the other the sin of
lying is committed. For though the issues of their deeds may appear different, yet they coincide
in having one and the same aim. For the one, in order to escape poverty, desired to take
back what he had forsaken; the others, for fear lest they might become poor, tried to keep
back something out of their property, which they should have either offered to the Apostle
in good faith, or have given entirely to the brethren. And so in each case there follows the
judgment of death; because each sin sprang from the root of covetousness. And so if against
those who did not covet other persons’ goods, but tried to be sparing of their own, and had
no desire to acquire, but only the wish to retain, there went forth so severe a sentence, what
should we think of those who desire to amass wealth, without ever having had any of their
own, and, making a show of poverty before men, are before God convicted of being rich,
through the passion of avarice?</p>

<head>Scripture proofs by which one who is aiming at perfection is taught not to take back again
what he has given up and renounced.</head>
<p>If then through the desire of perfection you have forsaken all things and followed Christ
who says to thee, “Go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven: and come follow me,”376 why, having put your hand to the plough, do
you look back, so that you will be declared by the voice of the same Lord not to be fit for
the kingdom of heaven?377 When secure on the top of the gospel roof, why do you descend
to carry away something from the house, from those things, namely, which beforetime you
despised? When you are out in the field and working at the virtues, why do you run back
and try to clothe yourself again with what belongs to this world, which you stripped off
when you renounced it?378 But if you were hindered by poverty from having anything to
give up, still less ought you to amass what you never had before. For by the grace of the Lord
you were for this purpose made ready that you might hasten to him the more readily, being
hampered by no snares of wealth. But let no one who is wanting in this be disappointed; for
there is no one who has not something to give up. He has renounced all the possessions of
this world, whoever has thoroughly eradicated the desire to possess them.</p>

possessed. Moreover also dreading both the fault and the death of Judas, let us with all the
power that we have avoid taking back any of that wealth which once we cast away from us.
Above all, considering the state of our weak and shifty nature, let us beware lest the day of
the Lord come upon us as a thief in the night,380 and find our conscience defiled even by a
single penny; for this would make void all the fruits of our renunciation of the world, and
cause that which was said to the rich man in the gospel to be directed towards us also by
the voice of the Lord: “Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose
shall those things be which thou hast prepared?”381 And taking no thought for the morrow,
let us never allow ourselves to be enticed away from the rule of the Coenobium.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="585"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How our fourth conflict is against the sin of anger, and how many evils this passion produces.</head>
<p>In our fourth combat the deadly poison of anger has to be utterly rooted out from the
inmost comers of our soul. For as long as this remains in our hearts, and blinds with its
hurtful darkness the eye of the soul, we can neither acquire right judgment and discretion,
nor gain the insight which springs from an honest gaze, or ripeness of counsel, nor can we
be partakers of life, or retentive of righteousness, or even have the capacity for spiritual and
true light: “for,” says one, “mine eye is disturbed by reason of anger.”382 Nor can we become
partakers of wisdom, even though we are considered wise by universal consent, for “anger
rests in the bosom of fools.”383 Nor can we even attain immortal life, although we are accounted
prudent in the opinion of everybody, for “anger destroys even the prudent.”384
Nor shall we be able with clear judgment of heart to secure the controlling power of righteousness,
even though we are reckoned perfect and holy in the estimation of all men, for
“the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”385 Nor can we by any possibility
acquire that esteem and honour which is so frequently seen even in worldlings, even though
we are thought noble and honourable through the privileges of birth, because “an angry
man is dishonoured.”386 Nor again can we secure any ripeness of counsel, even though we
appear to be weighty, and endowed with the utmost knowledge; because “an angry man acts
without counsel.”387 Nor can we be free from dangerous disturbances, nor be without sin,
even though no sort of disturbances be brought upon us by others; because “a passionate
man engenders quarrels, but an angry man digs up sins.”388</p>

since, say they, God Himself is said to rage and to be angry with those who either will not
know Him, or, knowing Him, spurn Him, as here: “And the anger of the Lord was kindled
against His people;”389 or where the prophet prays and says, “O Lord, rebuke me not in
thine anger, neither chasten me in thy displeasure;”390 not understanding that, while they
want to open to men an excuse for a most pestilent sin, they are ascribing to the Divine Infinity

slumber nor sleep.”392 And He stands and sits, since He says, “Heaven is my seat, and earth
the footstool for my feet:”393 though He “measure out the heaven with his hand, and holdeth
the earth in his fist.”394 And He is “drunken with wine” as it is said, “The Lord awoke
like a sleeper, a mighty man, drunken with wine;”395 He “who only hath immortality and
dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto:”396 not to say anything of the “ignorance”
and “forgetfulness,” of which we often find mention in Holy Scripture: nor lastly
of the outline of His limbs, which are spoken of as arranged and ordered like a man’s; e.g.,
the hair, head, nostrils, eyes, face, hands, arms, fingers, belly, and feet: if we are willing to
take all of which according to the bare literal sense, we must think of God as in fashion with
the outline of limbs, and a bodily form; which indeed is shocking even to speak of, and must
be far from our thoughts.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>In what sense we should understand the passions and human arts which are ascribed to the
unchanging and incorporeal God.</head>
<p>And so as without horrible profanity these things cannot be understood literally of Him
who is declared by the authority of Holy Scripture to be invisible, ineffable, incomprehensible,
inestimable, simple, and uncompounded, so neither can the passion of anger and wrath be
attributed to that unchangeable nature without fearful blasphemy. For we ought to see that
the limbs signify the divine powers and boundless operations of God, which can only be
represented to us by the familiar expression of limbs: by the mouth we should understand
that His utterances are meant, which are of His mercy continually poured into the secret
senses of the soul, or which He spoke among our fathers and the prophets: by the eyes we
can understand the boundless character of His sight with which He sees and looks through
all things, and so nothing is hidden from Him of what is done or can be done by us, or even
thought. By the expression “hands,” we understand His providence and work, by which He
is the creator and author of all things; the arms are the emblems of His might and government,
with which He upholds, rules and controls all things. And not to speak of other things,
what else does the hoary hair of His head signify but the eternity and perpetuity of Deity,
through which He is without any beginning, and before all times, and excels all creatures?
So then also when we read of the anger or fury of the Lord, we should take it not
ἀνθρωποπαθῶς ; i.e., according to an unworthy meaning of human passion,397 but in a
sense worthy of God, who is free from all passion; so that by this we should understand that
He is the judge and avenger of all the unjust things which are done in this world; and by
reason of these terms and their meaning we should dread Him as the terrible rewarder of
our deeds, and fear to do anything against His will. For human nature is wont to fear those
whom it knows to be indignant, and is afraid of offending: as in the case of some most just
judges, avenging wrath is usually feared by those who are tormented by some accusation of
their conscience; not indeed that this passion exists in the minds of those who are going to
judge with perfect equity, but that, while they so fear, the disposition of the judge towards
them is that which is the precursor of a just and impartial execution of the law. And this,
with whatever kindness and gentleness it may be conducted, is deemed by those who are
justly to be punished to be the most savage wrath and vehement anger. It would be tedious
and outside the scope of the present work were we to explain all the things which are spoken
metaphorically of God in Holy Scripture, with human figures. Let it be enough for our
present purpose, which is aimed against the sin of wrath, to have said this that no one may
through ignorance draw down upon himself a cause of this evil and of eternal death, out of

<p>And so a monk aiming at perfection, and desiring to strive lawfully in his spiritual
combat, should be free from all sin of anger and wrath, and should listen to the charge which
the “chosen vessel” gives him. “Let all anger,” says he, “and wrath, and clamour, and evil
speaking, be taken away from among you, with all malice.”398 When he says, “Let all anger
be taken away from you,” he excepts none whatever as necessary or useful for us. And if
need be, he should at once treat an erring brother in such a way that, while he manages to
apply a remedy to one afflicted with perhaps a slight fever, he may not by his wrath involve
himself in a more dangerous malady of blindness. For he who wants to heal another’s wound
ought to be in good health and free from every affection of weakness himself, lest that saying
of the gospel should be used to him, “Physician, first heal thyself;”399 and lest, seeing a mote
in his brother’s eye, he see not the beam in his own eye, for how will he see to cast out the
mote from his brother’s eye, who has the beam of anger in his own eye?400</p>

against the lustful emotions of our heart, and are vexed that the things which we are ashamed

<head>Instances from the life of the blessed David in which anger was rightly felt.</head>
<p>And at any rate (this is the case), when we are agitated against this very anger, because
it has stolen on us against our brother, and when in wrath we expel its deadly incitements,
nor suffer it to have a dangerous lurking place in the recesses of our heart. To be angry in
this fashion even that prophet teaches us who had so completely expelled it from his own
feelings that he would not retaliate even on his enemies and those delivered by God into his
hands: when he says “Be ye angry and sin not.”401 For he, when he had longed for water
from the well of Bethlehem, and had been given it by his mighty men, who had brought it
through the midst of the hosts of the enemy, at once poured it out on the ground: and thus
in his anger extinguished the delicious feeling of his desire, and poured it out to the Lord,
without satisfying the longing that he had expressed, saying: “That be far from me that I
should do this! Shall I drink the blood of those men who went forth on the danger of their
souls?”402 And when Shimei threw stones at King David and cursed him, in his hearing,
before everybody, and Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the captain of the host, wished to cut off
his head and avenge the insult to the king, the blessed David moved with pious wrath against
this dreadful suggestion of his, and keeping the due measure of humility and a strict patience,
said with imperturbable gentleness, “What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let
him alone that he may curse. For the Lord hath commanded him to curse David. And who
is he who shall dare to say, Why hast thou done this? Behold my son, who came forth from
my loins, seeks my life, and how much more this son of Benjamin? Let him alone, that he
may curse, according to the command of the Lord. It may be the Lord will look upon my
affliction, and return to me good for this cursing to-day.”403</p>

Finally, the next verse explains this to be the meaning more clearly: “The things you say in
your hearts, be sorry for them on your beds:”404 i.e., whatever you think of in your hearts
when sudden and nervous excitements rush in on you, correct and amend with wholesome
sorrow, lying as it were on a bed of rest, and removing by the moderating influence of
counsel all noise and disturbance of wrath. Lastly, the blessed Apostle, when he made use
of the testimony of this verse, and said, “Be ye angry and sin not,” added, “Let not the sun
go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.”405 If it is dangerous for the sun
of righteousness to go down upon our wrath, and if when we are angry we straightway give
place to the devil in our hearts, how is it that above he charges us to be angry, saying, “Be
ye angry, and sin not”? Does he not evidently mean this: be ye angry with your faults and
your tempers, lest, if you acquiesce in them, Christ, the sun of righteousness, may on account
of your anger begin to go down on your darkened minds, and when He departs you may
furnish a place for the devil in your hearts?</p>

<head>Of the sun, of which it is said that it should not go down upon your wrath.</head>
<p>And of this sun God clearly makes mention by the prophet, when He says, “But to those
that fear my name the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings.”406 And
this again is said to “go down” at midday on sinners and false prophets, and those who are
angry, when the prophet says, “Their sun is gone down at noon.”407 And at any rate “tropically”
408 the mind, that is the νοῦς or reason, which is fairly called the sun because it looks
over all the thoughts and discernings of the heart, should not be put out by the sin of anger:
lest when it “goes down” the shadows of disturbance, together with the devil their author,
fill all the feelings of our hearts, and, overwhelmed by the shadows of wrath, as in a murky
night, we know not what we ought to do. In this sense it is that we have brought forward
this passage of the Apostle, handed down to us by the teaching of the elders, because it was
needful, even at the risk of a somewhat lengthy discourse, to show how they felt with regard
to anger, for they do not permit it even for a moment to effect an entrance into our heart:
observing with the utmost care that saying of the gospel: “Whosoever is angry with his
brother is in danger of the judgment.”409 But if it be lawful to be angry up till sunset, the
surfeit of our wrath and the vengeance of our anger will be able to give full play to passion
and dangerous excitement before that sun inclines towards its setting.410</p>

<head>Of those to whose wrath even the going down of the sun sets no limit.</head>
<p>But what am I to say of those (and I cannot say it without shame on my own part) to
whose implacability even the going down of the sun sets no bound: but prolonging it for
several days, and nourishing rancorous feelings against those against whom they have been
excited, they say in words that they are not angry, but in fact and deed they show that they
are extremely disturbed? For they do not speak to them pleasantly, nor address them with
ordinary civility, and they think that they are not doing wrong in this, because they do not
seek to avenge themselves for their upset. But since they either do not dare, or at any rate
are not able to show their anger openly, and give place to it, they drive in, to their own detriment,
the poison of anger, and secretly cherish it in their hearts, and silently feed on it in
themselves; without shaking off by an effort of mind their sulky disposition, but digesting
it as the days go by, and somewhat mitigating it after a while.</p>

<head>How this is the end of temper and anger when a man carries it into act as far as he can.</head>
<p>But it looks as if even this was not the end of vengeance to every one, but some can only
completely satisfy their wrath or sulkiness if they carry out the impulse of anger as far as
they are able; and this we know to be the case with those who restrain their feelings, not
from desire of calming them, but simply from want of opportunity of revenge. For they can
do nothing more to those with whom they are angry, except speak to them without ordinary
civility: or it looks as if anger was to be moderated only in action, and not to be altogether
rooted out from its hiding place in our bosom: so that, overwhelmed by its shadows, we are
unable not only to admit the light of wholesome counsel and of knowledge, but also to be
a temple of the Holy Spirit, so long as the spirit of anger dwells in us. For wrath that is nursed
in the heart, although it may not injure men who stand by, yet excludes the splendour of
the radiance of the Holy Ghost, equally with wrath that is openly manifested.</p>

<head>That we should not retain our anger even for an instant.</head>
<p>Or how can we think that the Lord would have it retained even for an instant, since He
does not permit us to offer the spiritual sacrifices of our prayers, if we are aware that another
has any bitterness against us: saying, “If then thou bringest thy gift to the altar and there
rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar and
go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”411 How
then may we retain displeasure against our brother, I will not say for several days, but even
till the going down of the sun, if we are not allowed to offer our prayers to God while he has
anything against us? And yet we are commanded by the Apostle: “Pray without ceasing;”412
and “in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing.”413 It remains then
either that we never pray at all, retaining this poison in our hearts, and become guilty in
regard of this apostolic or evangelic charge, in which we are bidden to pray everywhere and
without ceasing; or else if, deceiving ourselves, we venture to pour forth our prayers, contrary
to His command, we must know that we are offering to God no prayer, but an obstinate
temper with a rebellious spirit.</p>

<head>Of reconciliation with our brother.</head>
<p>And because we often spurn the brethren who are injured and saddened, and despise
them, and say that they were not hurt by any fault of ours, the Healer of souls, who knows
all secrets, wishing utterly to eradicate all opportunities of anger from our hearts, not only
commands us to forgive if we have been wronged, and to be reconciled with our brothers,
and keep no recollection of wrong or injuries against them, but He also gives a similar charge,
that in case we are aware that they have anything against us, whether justly or unjustly, we
should leave our gift, that is, postpone our prayers, and hasten first to offer satisfaction to
them; and so when our brother’s cure is first effected, we may bring the offering of our
prayers without blemish. For the common Lord of all does not care so much for our homage
as to lose in one what He gains in another, through displeasure being allowed to reign in
us. For in any one’s loss He suffers some loss, who desires and looks for the salvation of all
His servants in one and the same way. And therefore our prayer will lose its effect, if our
brother has anything against us, just as much as if we were cherishing feelings of bitterness
against him in a swelling and wrathful spirit.</p>

<p>But why should we spend any more time over evangelic and apostolic precepts, when
even the old law, which is thought to be somewhat slack, guards against the same thing,
when it says, “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart;” and again, “Be not mindful
of the injury of thy citizens;”414 and again, “The ways of those who preserve the recollection
of wrongs are towards death”?415 You see there too that wickedness is restrained not only
in action, but also in the secret thoughts, since it is commanded that hatred be utterly rooted
out from the heart, and not merely retaliation for, but the very recollection of, a wrong done.</p>

<head>How useless is the retirement of those who do not give up their bad manners.</head>
<p>Sometimes when we have been overcome by pride or impatience, and we want to improve
our rough and bearish manners, we complain that we require solitude, as if we should find
the virtue of patience there where nobody provokes us: and we apologize for our carelessness,
and say that the reason of our disturbance does not spring from our own impatience, but
from the fault of our brethren. And while we lay the blame of our fault on others, we shall
never be able to reach the goal of patience and perfection.</p>

<p>The chief part then of our improvement and peace of mind must not be made to depend
on another’s will, which cannot possibly be subject to our authority, but it lies rather in our
own control. And so the fact that we are not angry ought not to result from another’s perfection,
but from our own virtue, which is acquired, not by somebody else’s patience, but
by our own long-suffering.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>Of the zeal with which we should seek the desert, and of the things in which we make progress
there.</head>
<p>Further, it is those who are perfect and purified from all faults who ought to seek the
desert, and when they have thoroughly exterminated all their faults amid the assembly of
the brethren, they should enter it not by way of cowardly flight, but for the purpose of divine
contemplation, and with the desire of deeper insight into heavenly things, which can only
be gained in solitude by those who are perfect. For whatever faults we bring with us uncured
into the desert, we shall find to remain concealed in us and not to be got rid of. For just as
when the character has been improved, solitude can lay open to it the purest contemplation,
and reveal the knowledge of spiritual mysteries to its clear gaze, so it generally not only
preserves but intensifies the faults of those who have undergone no correction. For a man
appears to himself to be patient and humble, just as long as he comes across nobody in intercourse;
but he will presently revert to his former nature, whenever the chance of any sort
of passion occurs: I mean that those faults will at once appear on the surface which were
lying hid, and, like unbridled horses diligently fed up during too long a time of idleness,
dash forth from the barriers the more eagerly and fiercely, to the destruction of their charioteer.
For when the opportunity for practising them among men is removed, our faults will
more and more increase in us, unless we have first been purified from them. And the mere
shadow of patience, which, when we mixed with our brethren, we seemed fancifully to
possess, at least out of respect for them and publicity, we lose altogether through sloth and
carelessness.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>An illustration to help in forming an opinion on those who are only patient when they are not
tried by any one.</head>
<p>But it is like all poisonous kinds of serpents or of wild beasts, which, while they remain
in solitude and their own lairs, are still not harmless;416 for they cannot really be said to be
harmless, because they are not actually hurting anybody. For this results in their case, not
from any feeling of goodness, but from the exigencies of solitude, and when they have secured
an opportunity of hurting some one, at once they produce the poison stored up in them,
and show the ferocity of their nature. And so in the case of men who are aiming at perfection,
it is not enough not to be angry with men. For we recollect that when we were living in
solitude a feeling of irritation would creep over us against our pen because it was too large
or too small; against our penknife when it cut badly and with a blunt edge what we wanted
cut; and against a flint if by chance when we were rather late and hurrying to the reading,
a spark of fire flashed out, so that we could not remove and get rid of our perturbation of
mind except by cursing the senseless matter, or at least the devil. Wherefore for a method
of perfection it will not be of any use for there to be a dearth of men against whom our anger
might be roused: since, if patience has not already been acquired, the feelings of passion
which still dwell in our hearts can equally well spend themselves on dumb things and paltry
objects, and not allow us to gain a continuous state of peacefulness, or to be free from our
remaining faults: unless perhaps we think that some advantage and a sort of cure may be
gained for our passion from the fact that inanimate and speechless things cannot possibly
reply to our curses and rage, nor provoke our ungovernable temper to break out into a worse
madness of passion.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of the way in which auger should be banished according to the gospel.</head>
<p>Wherefore if we wish to gain the substance of that divine reward of which it is said,
“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,”417 we ought not only to banish it
from our actions, but entirely to root it out from our inmost soul. For it will not be of any
good to have checked anger in words, and not to have shown it in deeds, if God, from whom
the secrets of the heart are not hid, sees that it remains in the secret recesses of our bosom.
For the word of the gospel bids us destroy the roots of our faults rather than the fruits; for
these, when the incitements are all removed, will certainly not put forth shoots any more;
and so the mind will be able to continue in all patience and holiness, when this anger has
been removed, not from the surface of acts and deeds, but from the very innermost thoughts.
And, therefore to avoid the commission of murder, anger and hatred are cut off, without
which the crime of murder cannot possibly be committed. For “whosoever is angry with
his brother, is in danger of the judgment;”418 and “whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;”
419 viz., because in his heart he desires to kill him, whose blood we know that he has
certainly not shed among men with his own hand or with a weapon; yet, owing to his burst
of anger, he is declared to be a murderer by God, who renders to each man, not merely for
the result of his actions, but for his purpose and desires and wishes, either a reward or a
punishment; according to that which He Himself says through the prophet: “But I come
that I may gather them together with all nations and tongues;”420 and again:421 “Their
thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in the day when God
shall judge the secrets of men.”422</p>

<head>Whether we ought to admit the addition of “without a cause,” in that which is written in the
Gospel, “whosoever is angry with his brother,” etc.</head>
<p>But you should know that in this, which is found in many copies, “Whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause, is in danger of the judgment,”423 the words “without a
cause” are superfluous, and were added by those who did not think that anger for just causes
was to be banished: since certainly nobody, however unreasonably he is disturbed, would
say that he was angry without a cause. Wherefore it appears to have been added by those
who did not understand the drift of Scripture, which intended altogether to banish the incentive
to anger, and to reserve no occasion whatever for indignation; lest while we were
commanded to be angry with a cause, an opportunity for being angry without a cause might
occur to us. For the end and aim of patience consists, not in being angry with a good reason,
but in not being angry at all. Although I know that by some this very expression, “without
a cause,” is taken to mean that he is angry without a cause who when he is angered is not
allowed to seek for vengeance. But it is better so to take it as we find it written in many
modern copies and all the ancient ones.</p>

<p>Wherefore the athlete of Christ who strives lawfully ought thoroughly to root out the
feeling of wrath. And it will be a sure remedy for this disease, if in the first place we make
up our mind that we ought never to be angry at all, whether for good or bad reasons: as we
know that we shall at once lose the light of discernment, and the security of good counsel,
and our very uprightness, and the temperate character of righteousness, if the main light of
our heart has been darkened by its shadows: next, that the purity of our soul will presently
be clouded, and that it cannot possibly be made a temple for the Holy Ghost while the
spirit of anger resides in us; lastly, that we should consider that we ought never to pray, nor
pour out our prayer to God, while we are angry. And above all, having before our eyes the
uncertain condition of mankind, we should realize daily that we are soon to depart from
the body, and that our continence and chastity, our renunciation of all our possessions, our
contempt of wealth, our efforts in fastings and vigils will not help us at all, if solely on account
of anger and hatred eternal punishments are awarded to us by the judge of the world.</p>

<head>How our fifth combat is against the spirit of dejection, and of the harm which it inflicts upon
the soul.</head>
<p>In our fifth combat we have to resist the pangs of gnawing dejection: for if this, through
separate attacks made at random, and by haphazard and casual changes, has secured an
opportunity of gaining possession of our mind it keeps us back at all times from all insight
in divine contemplation, and utterly ruins and depresses the mind that has fallen away from
its complete state of purity. It does not allow it to say its prayers with its usual gladness of
heart, nor permit it to rely on the comfort of reading the sacred writings, nor suffer it to be
quiet and gentle with the brethren; it makes it impatient and rough in all the duties of work
and devotion: and, as all wholesome counsel is lost, and steadfastness of heart destroyed, it
makes the feelings almost mad and drunk, and crushes and overwhelms them with penal
despair.</p>

<head>Of the care with which the malady of dejection must be healed.</head>
<p>Wherefore if we are anxious to exert ourselves lawfully in the struggle of our spiritual
combat we ought with no less care to set about healing this malady also. For “as the moth
injures the garment, and the worm the wood, so dejection the heart of man.”424 With sufficient
clearness and appropriateness has the Divine Spirit expressed the force of this dangerous
and most injurious fault.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>To what the soul may be compared which is a prey to the attacks of dejection.</head>
<p>For the garment that is moth-eaten has no longer any commercial value or good use to
which it can be put; and in the same way425 the wood that is worm-eaten is no longer worth
anything for ornamenting even an ordinary building, but is destined to be burnt in the fire.
So therefore the soul also which is a prey to the attacks of gnawing dejection will be useless
for that priestly garment which, according to the prophecy of the holy David, the ointment
of the Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, first on Aaron’s beard, then on his skirts, is
wont to assume: as it is said, “It is like the ointment upon the head which ran down upon
Aaron’s beard, which ran down to the skirts of his clothing.”426 Nor can it have anything
to do with the building or ornamentation of that spiritual temple of which Paul as a wise
master builder laid the foundations, saying, “Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you:”427 and what the beams of this are like the bride tells us in the Song
of Songs: “Our rafters are of cypress: the beams of our houses are of cedar.”428 And therefore
those sorts of wood are chosen for the temple of God which are fragrant and not liable to
rot, and which are not subject to decay from age nor to be worm-eaten.</p>

in his hope of securing those things which he had planned. But sometimes without any apparent
reason for our being driven to fall into this misfortune, we are by the instigation of
our crafty enemy suddenly depressed with so great a gloom that we cannot receive with ordinary
civility the visits of those who are near and dear to us; and whatever subject of conversation
is started by them, we regard it as ill-timed and out of place; and we can give them

deceived suddenly when he has looked on a woman and fallen into the abyss of shameful
lust: but rather that, owing to the opportunity of looking on her, the symptoms of disease
which were hidden and concealed in his inmost soul have been brought to the surface.</p>

<p>And so God, the creator of all things, having regard above everything to the amendment

in ourselves, commands that we should not give up intercourse with our brethren, nor avoid
those who we think have been hurt by us, or by whom we have been offended, but bids us
pacify them, knowing that perfection of heart is not secured by separating from men so
much as by the virtue of patience. Which when it is securely held, as it can keep us at peace
even with those who hate peace, so, if it has not been acquired, it makes us perpetually differ
from those who are perfect and better than we are: for opportunities for disturbance, on
account of which we are eager to get away from those with whom we are connected, will
not be wanting so long as we are living among men; and therefore we shall not escape altogether,

offences coming from without, nor will any occasion of falling trouble us from outside, if
the roots of such are not admitted and implanted within in our own selves: for “they have
great peace who love thy law, O God; and they have no occasion of falling.”431</p>

either in penitence for sin, or through being inflamed with the desire of perfection, or the
contemplation of future blessedness. And of this the blessed Apostle says: “The sorrow
which is according to God worketh repentance steadfast unto salvation: but the sorrow of
the world worketh death.”432</p>

<head>How we can decide what is useful and the sorrow according to God, and what is devilish and

<p>But that dejection and sorrow which “worketh repentance steadfast unto salvation” is
obedient, civil, humble, kindly, gentle, and patient, as it springs from the love of God, and
unweariedly extends itself from desire of perfection to every bodily grief and sorrow of
spirit; and somehow or other rejoicing and feeding on hope of its own profit preserves all
the gentleness of courtesy and forbearance, as it has in itself all the fruits of the Holy Spirit
of which the same Apostle gives the list: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance,
goodness, benignity, faith, mildness, modesty.”433 But the other kind is rough,
impatient, hard, full of rancour and useless grief and penal despair, and breaks down the
man on whom it has fastened, and hinders him from energy and wholesome sorrow, as it

<p>We should then be able to expel this most injurious passion from our hearts, so that by
spiritual meditation we may keep our mind constantly occupied with hope of the future
and contemplation of the promised blessedness. For in this way we shall be able to get the
better of all those sorts of dejection, whether those which flow from previous anger or those
which come to us from disappointment of gain, or from some loss, or those which spring
from a wrong done to us, or those which arise from an unreasonable disturbance of mind,
or those which bring on us a deadly despair, if, ever joyful with an insight into things
eternal and future, and continuing immovable, we are not depressed by present accidents,
or over-elated by prosperity, but look on each condition as uncertain and likely soon to pass

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How our sixth combat is against the spirit of accidie, and what its character is.</head>
<p>Our sixth combat is with what the Greeks call ἀκηδία, which we may term weariness
or distress of heart. This is akin to dejection, and is especially trying to solitaries, and a
dangerous and frequent foe to dwellers in the desert; and especially disturbing to a monk
about the sixth hour, like some fever which seizes him at stated times, bringing the burning
heat of its attacks on the sick man at usual and regular hours. Lastly, there are some of the
elders who declare that this is the “midday demon” spoken of in the ninetieth Psalm.435</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>A description of accidie, and the way in which it creeps over the heart of a monk, and the injury
it inflicts on the soul.</head>
<p>And when this has taken possession of some unhappy soul, it produces dislike of the
place, disgust with the cell, and disdain and contempt of the brethren who dwell with him
or at a little distance, as if they were careless or unspiritual. It also makes the man lazy and
sluggish about all manner of work which has to be done within the enclosure of his dormitory.
It does not suffer him to stay in his cell, or to take any pains about reading, and he often
groans because he can do no good while he stays there, and complains and sighs because
he can bear no spiritual fruit so long as he is joined to that society; and he complains that
he is cut off from spiritual gain, and is of no use in the place, as if he were one who, though
he could govern others and be useful to a great number of people, yet was edifying none,
nor profiting any one by his teaching and doctrine. He cries up distant monasteries and
those which are a long way off, and describes such places as more profitable and better suited
for salvation; and besides this he paints the intercourse with the brethren there as sweet and
full of spiritual life. On the other hand, he says that everything about him is rough, and not
only that there is nothing edifying among the brethren who are stopping there, but also that
even food for the body cannot be procured without great difficulty. Lastly he fancies that
he will never be well while he stays in that place, unless he leaves his cell (in which he is sure
to die if he stops in it any longer) and takes himself off from thence as quickly as possible.
Then the fifth or sixth hour brings him such bodily weariness and longing for food that he
seems to himself worn out and wearied as if with a long journey, or some very heavy work,
or as if he had put off taking food during a fast of two or three days. Then besides this he
looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see
him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too
slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him
like some foul darkness,436 and makes him idle and useless for every spiritual work, so that
he imagines that no cure for so terrible an attack can be found in anything except visiting
some one of the brethren, or in the solace of sleep alone. Then the disease suggests that he
ought to show courteous and friendly hospitalities to the brethren, and pay visits to the sick,
whether near at hand or far off. He talks too about some dutiful and religious offices; that
those kinsfolk ought to be inquired after, and that he ought to go and see them oftener; that
it would be a real work of piety to go more frequently to visit that religious woman, devoted
to the service of God, who is deprived of all support of kindred; and that it would be a most
excellent thing to get what is needful for her who is neglected and despised by her own
<note type="footnote">436 Velut tætra suppletur caligine (Petschenig); the text of Gazæus reads terra for tætra.</note>

kinsfolk; and that he ought piously to devote his time to these things instead of staying
uselessly and with no profit in his cell.</p>

<head>Of the different ways in which accidie overcomes a monk.</head>
<p>And so the wretched soul, embarrassed by such contrivances of the enemy, is disturbed,
until, worn out by the spirit of accidie, as by some strong battering ram, it either learns to
sink into slumber, or, driven out from the confinement of its cell, accustoms itself to seek
for consolation under these attacks in visiting some brother, only to be afterwards weakened
the more by this remedy which it seeks for the present. For more frequently and more
severely will the enemy attack one who, when the battle is joined, will as he well knows immediately
turn his back, and whom he sees to look for safety neither in victory nor in
fighting but in flight: until little by little he is drawn away from his cell, and begins to forget
the object of his profession, which is nothing but meditation and contemplation of that divine
purity which excels all things, and which can only be gained by silence and continually remaining
in the cell, and by meditation, and so the soldier of Christ becomes a runaway from
His service, and a deserter, and “entangles himself in secular business,” without at all
pleasing Him to whom he engaged himself.437</p>

<head>How accidie hinders the mind from all contemplation of the virtues.</head>
<p>All the inconveniences of this disease are admirably expressed by David in a single verse,
where he says, “My soul slept from weariness,”438 that is, from accidie. Quite rightly does
he say, not that his body, but that his soul slept. For in truth the soul which is wounded by
the shaft of this passion does sleep, as regards all contemplation of the virtues and insight
of the spiritual senses.</p>

<head>How the attack of accidie is twofold.</head>
<p>And so the true Christian athlete who desires to strive lawfully in the lists of perfection,
should hasten to expel this disease also from the recesses of his soul; and should strive against
this most evil spirit of accidie in both directions, so that he may neither fall stricken through
by the shaft of slumber, nor be driven out from the monastic cloister, even though under
some pious excuse or pretext, and depart as a runaway.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>How injurious are the effects of accidie.</head>
<p>And whenever it begins in any degree to overcome any one, it either makes him stay in
his cell idle and lazy, without making any spiritual progress, or it drives him out from thence
and makes him restless and a wanderer, and indolent in the matter of all kinds of work, and
it makes him continually go round, the cells of the brethren and the monasteries, with an
eye to nothing but this; viz., where or with what excuse he can presently procure some refreshment.
For the mind of an idler cannot think of anything but food and the belly, until
the society of some man or woman, equally cold and indifferent, is secured, and it loses itself
in their affairs and business, and is thus little by little ensnared by dangerous occupations,
so that, just as if it were bound up in the coils of a serpent, it can never disentangle itself
again and return to the perfection of its former profession.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Testimonies from the Apostle concerning the spirit of accidie.</head>
<p>The blessed Apostle, like a true and spiritual physician, either seeing this disease, which
springs from the spirit of accidie, already creeping in, or foreseeing, through the revelation
of the Holy Spirit, that it would arise among monks, is quick to anticipate it by the healing
medicines of his directions. For in writing to the Thessalonians, and at first, like a skilful
and excellent physician, applying to the infirmity of his patients the soothing and gentle
remedy of his words, and beginning with charity, and praising them in that point, that439
this deadly wound, having been treated with a milder remedy, might lose its angry festering
and more easily bear severer treatment, he says: “But concerning brotherly charity ye have
no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. For
this ye do toward all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia.”440 He first began with the
soothing application of praise, and made their ears submissive and ready for the remedy of
the healing words. Then he proceeds: “But we ask you, brethren, to abound more.” Thus
far he soothes them with kind and gentle words; for fear lest he should find them not yet
prepared to receive their perfect cure. Why is it that you ask, O Apostle, that they may
abound more in charity, of which you had said above, “But concerning brotherly charity
we have no need to write to you”? And why is it necessary that you should say to them: “But
we ask you to abound more,” when they did not need to be written to at all on this matter?
especially as you add the reason why they do not need it, saying, “For you yourselves have
been taught of God to love one another.” And you add a third thing still more important:
that not only have they been taught of God, but also that they fulfil in deed that which they
are taught. “For ye do this,” he says, not to one or two, but “to all the brethren;” and not to
your own citizens and friends only, but “in the whole of Macedonia.” Tell us then, I pray,
why it is that you so particularly begin with this. Again he proceeds, “But we ask you,
brethren, to abound the more.” And with difficulty at last he breaks out into that at which
he was driving before: “and that ye take pains to be quiet.” He gave the first aim. Then he
adds a second, “and to do your own business;” and a third as well: “and work with your own
hands, as we commanded you;” a fourth: “and to walk honestly towards those that are
without;” a fifth: “and to covet no man’s goods.” Lo, we can see through that hesitation,
which made him with these preludes put off uttering what his mind was full of: “And that
ye take pains to be quiet;” i.e., that you stop in your cells, and be not disturbed by rumours,
which generally spring from the wishes and gossip of idle persons, and so yourselves disturb
<note type="footnote">439 Quousque is used as equivalent to donec, again in Conf. XXIII. xii.</note>
<note type="footnote">440 1 Thess. iv. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="631"/>
others. And, “to do your own business,” you should not want to require curiously of the
world’s actions, or, examining the lives of others, want to spend your strength, not on bettering
yourselves and aiming at virtue, but on depreciating your brethren. “And work with
your own hands, as we charged you;” to secure that which he had warned them above not
to do; i.e., that they should not be restless and anxious about other people’s affairs, nor walk
dishonestly towards those without, nor covet another man’s goods, he now adds and says,
“and work with your own hands, as we charged you.” For he has clearly shown that leisure
the reason why those things were done which he blamed above. For no one can be restless
or anxious about other people’s affairs, but one who is not satisfied to apply himself to the
work of his own hands. He adds also a fourth evil, which springs also from this leisure, i.e.,
that they should not walk dishonestly: when he says: “And that ye walk honestly towards
those without.” He cannot possibly walk honestly, even among those who are men of this
world, who is not content to cling to the seclusion of his cell and the work of his own hands;
but he is sure to be dishonest, while he seeks his needful food; and to take pains to flatter,
to follow up news and gossip, to seek for opportunities for chattering and stories by means
of which he may gain a footing and obtain an entrance into the houses of others. “And that
you should not covet another man’s goods.” He is sure to look with envious eyes on another’s
gifts and boons, who does not care to secure sufficient for his daily food by the dutiful and
peaceful labour of his hands. You see what conditions, and how serious and shameful ones,
spring solely from the malady of leisure. Lastly, those very people, whom in his first Epistle
he had treated with the gentle application of his words, in his second Epistle he endeavours
to heal with severer and sterner remedies, as those who had not profited by more gentle
treatment; and he no longer applies the treatment of gentle words, no mild and kindly expressions,
as these, “But we ask you, brethren,” but “We adjure you, brethren, in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly.”441
There he asks; here he adjures. There is the kindness of one who is persuading; here the
sternness of one protesting and threatening. “We adjure you, brethren:” because, when we
first asked you, you scorned to listen; now at least obey our threats. And this adjuration he
renders terrible, not by his bare word, but by the imprecation of the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ: for fear lest they might again scorn it, as merely man’s word, and think that it was
not of much importance. And forthwith, like a well-skilled physician with festering limbs,
to which he could not apply the remedy of a mild treatment, he tries to cure by an incision
with a spiritual knife, saying, “that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not according to the tradition which ye received of us.” And so he bids them
withdraw from those who will not make time for work, and to cut them off like limbs tainted
with the festering sores of leisure: lest the malady of idleness, like some deadly contagion,
<note type="footnote">441 2 Thess. iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="632"/>
might infect even the healthy portion of their limbs, by the gradual advance of infection.
And when he is going to speak of those who will not work with their own hands and eat
their bread in quietness, from whom he urges them to withdraw, hear with what reproaches
he brands them at starting. First he calls them “disorderly,” and “not walking according to
the tradition.” In other words, he stigmatizes them as obstinate, since they will not walk
according to his appointment; and “dishonest,” i.e., not keeping to the right and proper
times for going out, and visiting, and talking. For a disorderly person is sure to be subject
to all those faults. “And not according to the tradition which they received from us.” And
in this he stamps them as in some sort rebellious, and despisers, who scorned to keep the
tradition which they had received from him, and would not follow that which they not only
remembered that the master had taught in word, but which they knew that he had performed
in deed. “For you yourselves know how ye ought to be followers of us.” He heaps up an
immense pile of censure when he asserts that they did not observe that which was still in
their memory, and which not only had they learned by verbal instruction, but also had received
by the incitement of his example in working.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>That he is sure to be restless who will not be content with the work of his own hands.</head>
<p>“Because we were not restless among you.” When he wants to prove by the practice of
work that he was not restless among them, he fully shows that those who will not work are
always restless, owing to the fault of idleness. “Nor did we eat any man’s bread for nought.”
By each expression the teacher of the Gentiles advances a step in the rebuke.442 The
preacher of the gospel says that he has not eaten any man’s bread for nought, as he knows
that the Lord commanded that “they who preach the gospel should live of the gospel:”443
again, “The labourer is worthy of his meat.”444 And so if he who preached the gospel, performing
a work so lofty and spiritual, did not venture in reliance on the Lord’s command
to eat his bread for nought, what shall we do to whom not merely is there no preaching of
the word intrusted, but no cure of souls except our own committed? with what confidence
shall we dare with idle hands to eat our bread for nought, when the “chosen vessel,” constrained
by his anxiety for the gospel and his work of preaching, did not venture to eat
without labouring with his own hands? “But in labour,” he says “and weariness, working
night and day lest we should be burdensome to any of you.”445 Up to this point he amplifies
and adds to his rebuke. For he did not simply say, “We did not eat bread for nought from
any of you,” and then stop short. For it might have been thought that he was supported by
his own private means, and by money which he had saved, or by other people’s, though not
by their collections and gifts. “But in labour,” he says, “and weariness, working night and
day;” that is, being specially supported by our own labour. And this, he says, we did not of
our own wish, and for our own pleasure, as rest and bodily exercise suggested, but as our
necessities and the want of food compelled us to do, and that not without great bodily
weariness. For not only throughout the whole day, but also by night, which seems to be
granted for bodily rest, I was continually plying the work of my hands, through anxiety for
food.</p>

<head>That not the Apostle only, but those two who were with him laboured with their own hands.</head>
<p>And he testifies that it was not he alone who so lived among them, lest haply this
method might not seem important or general if he depended only on his example. But he
declares that all those who were appointed with him for the ministry of the gospel, i.e., Silvanus
and Timothy, who wrote this with him, worked in the same fashion. For by saying,
“lest we should be burdensome to any of you, he covers them with great shame. For if he
who preached the gospel and commended it by signs and mighty works, did not dare to eat
bread for nought, lest he should be burdensome to any, how can those men help thinking
that they are burdensome who take it every day in idleness and at their leisure?</p>

<head>That for this reason the Apostle laboured with his own hands, that he might set us an example

<p>“Not as if we had not power; but that we might give ourselves a pattern to you to imitate
us.” He lays bare the reason why he imposed such labour on himself: “that we might,” says
he, “give a pattern to you to imitate us, that if by chance you become forgetful of the teaching
of our words which so often passes through your ears, you may at least keep in your recollection
the example of my manner of life given to you by ocular demonstration. There is
here too no slight reproof of them, where he says that he has gone through this labour and
weariness by night and day, for no other reason but to set an example, and that nevertheless
they would not be instructed, for whose sakes he, although not obliged to do it, yet imposed
on himself such toil. “And indeed,” he says, “though we had the power, and opportunities
were open to us of using all your goods and substance, and I knew that I had the permission446
of our Lord to use them: yet I did not use this power, lest what was rightly and lawfully
done on my part might set an example of dangerous idleness to others. And therefore when
preaching the gospel, I preferred to be supported by my own hands and work, that I might
open up the way of perfection to you who wish to walk in the path of virtue, and might set
an example of good life by my work.”</p>

<p>But lest haply it might be thought that, while he worked in silence and tried to teach
them by example, he had not instructed them by precepts and warnings, he proceeds to say:
“For when we were with you, this we declared to you, that if a man will not work neither
should he eat.” Still greater does he make their idleness appear, for, though they knew that
he, like a good master, worked with his hands for the sake of his teaching and in order to
instruct them, yet they were ashamed to imitate him; and he emphasizes our diligence and
care by saying that he did not only give them this for an example when present, but that he
also proclaimed it continually in words; saying that if any one would not work, neither
should he eat.</p>

<head>Of his saying: “If any will not work, neither shall he eat.”</head>
<p>And now he no longer addresses to them the advice of a teacher or physician, but proceeds
with the severity of a judicial sentence, and, resuming his apostolic authority, pronounces
sentence on his despisers as if from the judgment seat: with that power, I mean,
which, when writing with threats to the Corinthians, he declared was given him of the Lord,
when he charged those taken in sin, that they should make haste and amend their lives before
his coming: thus charging them, “I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present,
against some, with that power which is given to me over you.” And again: “For if I also
should boast somewhat of the power which the Lord has given me unto edification, and not
for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed.”447 With that power, I say, he declares, “If a
man will not work, neither let him eat.” Not punishing them with a carnal sword, but with
the power of the Holy Ghost forbidding them the goods of this life, that if by chance,
thinking but little of the punishment of future death, they still should remain obstinate
through love of ease, they may at last, forced by the requirements of nature and the fear of
immediate death, be compelled to obey his salutary charge.</p>

<head>Of his saying: “We have heard that some among you walk disorderly.”</head>
<p>Then after all this rigour of gospel severity, he now lays bare the reason why he put
forward all these matters. “For we have heard that some among you walk disorderly, working
not at all, but curiously meddling.” He is nowhere satisfied to speak of those who will not
give themselves up to work, as if they were victims of but a single malady. For in his first
Epistle448 he speaks of them as “disorderly,” and not walking according to the traditions
which they had received from him: and he also asserts that they were restless, and ate their
bread for nought. Again he says here, “We have heard that there are some among you who
walk disorderly.” And at once he subjoins a second weakness, which is the root of this restlessness,
and says, “working not at all;” a third malady as well he adds, which springs from
this last like some shoot: “but curiously meddling.”</p>

<head>How manual labour449 prevents many faults.</head>
<p>And so he loses no time in at once applying a suitable remedy to the incentive to so
many faults, and laying aside that apostolic power of his which he had made use of a little
before, he adopts once more the tender character of a good father, or of a kind physician,
and, as if they were his children or his patients, applies by his healing counsel remedies to
cure them, saying: “Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus,
that working with silence they would eat their own bread.” The cause of all these ulcers,
which spring from the root of idleness, he heals like some well-skilled physician by a single
salutary charge to work; as he knows that all the other bad symptoms, which spring as it
were from the same clump, will at once disappear when the cause of the chief malady has
been removed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, like a far-sighted and careful physician, he is not only anxious to heal the
wounds of the sick, but gives suitable directions as well to the whole, that their health may
be preserved continually, and says: “But be not ye weary in well doing:” ye who following
us, i.e., our ways, copy the example given to you by imitating us in work, and do not follow
their sloth and laziness: “Do not be weary in well doing;” i.e., do you likewise show kindness
towards them if by chance they have failed to observe what we said. As then he was severe
with those who were weak, for fear lest being enervated by laziness they might yield to
restlessness and inquisitiveness, so he admonishes those who are in good health neither to
restrain that kindness which the Lord’s command bids us show to the good and evil,450 even
if some bad men will not turn to sound doctrine; nor to desist from doing good and encouraging
them both by words of consolation and by rebuke as well as by ordinary kindness and
civility.</p>

<head>How we ought to admonish those who go wrong, not out of hatred, but out of love.</head>
<p>But again in case some might be encouraged by this gentleness, and scorn to obey his
commands, he proceeds with the severity of an apostle: “But if any man obey not our word
by this Epistle, note that man and do not keep company with him that he may be ashamed.”
And in warning them of what they ought to observe out of regard for him and for the good
of all, and of the care with which they should keep the apostolic commands, at once he joins
to the warning the kindness of a most indulgent father; and teaches them as well, as if they
were his children, what a brotherly disposition they should cultivate towards those mentioned
above, out of love. “Yet do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.”
With the severity of a judge he combines the affection of a father, and tempers with kindness
and gentleness the sentence delivered with apostolic sternness. For he commands them to
note that man who scorns to obey his commands, and not to keep company with him; and
yet he does not bid them do this from a wrong feeling of dislike, but from brotherly affection
and out of consideration for their amendment. “Do not keep company,” he says, “with him
that he may be ashamed;” so that, even if he is not made better by my mild charges, he may
at last be brought to shame by being publicly separated from all of you, and so may some
day begin to be restored to the way of salvation.</p>

“He that stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands
the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.”451
And in the Acts of the Apostles too we find that he not only taught this, but actually practised
it himself. For when he had come to Corinth, he did not permit himself to lodge anywhere
except with Aquila and Priscilla, because they were of the same trade which he himself was
accustomed to practise. For we thus read: “After this, Paul departing from Athens came to
Corinth; and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, and Priscilla his wife, he
came to them because they were of the same trade; and abode with them, and worked: for
they were tent-makers by trade.”452</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>That the Apostle wrought what he thought would be sufficient for him and for others who
were with him.</head>
<p>Then going to Miletus, and from thence sending to Ephesus, and summoning to him
the elders of the church of Ephesus, he charged them how they ought to rule the church of
God in his absence, and said: “I have not coveted any man’s silver and gold; you yourselves
know how for such things as were needful for me and them that are with me these hands
have ministered. I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support
the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is more blessed to
give than to receive.”453 He left us a weighty example in his manner of life, as he testifies
that he not only wrought what would supply his own bodily wants alone, but also what
would be sufficient for the needs of those who were with him: those, I mean, who, being
taken up with necessary duties, had no chance of procuring food for themselves with their
own hands. And as he tells the Thessalonians that he had worked to give them an example
that they might imitate him, so here too he implies something of the same sort when he
says: “I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak,”
viz., whether in mind or body; i.e., that we should be diligent in supplying their needs, not
from the store of our abundance, or money laid by, or from another’s generosity and substance,
but rather by securing the necessary sum by our own labour and toil.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>How we should understand these words: “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</head>
<p>And he says that this is a command of the Lord: “For He Himself,” namely the Lord
Jesus, said he, “said it is more blessed to give than to receive.” That is, the bounty of the
giver is more blessed than the need of the receiver, where the gift is not supplied from money
that has been kept back through unbelief or faithlessness, nor from the stored-up treasures
of avarice, but is produced from the fruits of our own labour and honest toil. And so “it is
more blessed to give than to receive,” because while the giver shares the poverty of the receiver,
yet still he is diligent in providing with pious care by his own toil, not merely enough
for his own needs, but also what he can give to one in want; and so he is adorned with a
double grace, since by giving away all his goods he secures the perfect abnegation of Christ,
and yet by his labour and thought displays the generosity of the rich; thus honouring God
by his honest labours, and plucking for him the fruits of his righteousness, while another,
enervated by sloth and indolent laziness, proves himself by the saying of the Apostle unworthy
of food, as in defiance of his command he takes it in idleness, not without the guilt of sin
and of obstinacy.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of a lazy brother who tried to persuade others to leave the monastery.</head>
<p>We know a brother, whose name we would give if it would do any good, who, although
he was remaining in the monastery and compelled to deliver to the steward his fixed task
daily, yet for fear lest he might be led on to some larger portion of work, or put to shame
by the example of one labouring more zealously, when he had seen some brother admitted
into the monastery, who in the ardour of his faith wanted to make up the sale of a larger
piece of work, if he found that he could not by secret persuasion check him from carrying
out his purpose, he would by bad advice and whisperings persuade him to depart thence.
And in order to get rid of him more easily he would pretend that he also had already been
for many reasons offended, and wanted to leave, if only he could find a companion and
support for the journey. And when by secretly running down the monastery he had wheedled
him into consenting, and arranged with him the time at which to leave the monastery, and
the place to which he should go before, and where he should wait for him, he himself, pretending
that he would follow, stopped where he was. And when the other out of shame for
his flight did not dare to return again to the monastery from which he had run away, the
miserable author of his flight stopped behind in the monastery. It will be enough to have
given this single instance of this sort of men in order to put beginners on their guard, and
to show clearly what evils idleness, as Scripture says,454 can produce in the mind of a monk,
and how “evil communications corrupt good manners.”455</p>

<head>Different passages from the writings of Solomon against accidie.</head>
<p>And Solomon, the wisest of men, clearly points to this fault of idleness in many passages,
as he says: “He that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty,”456 either visible or invisible,
in which an idle person and one entangled with different faults is sure to be involved,
and he will always be a stranger to the contemplation of God, and to spiritual riches, of
which the blessed Apostle says: “For in all things ye were enriched in him, in all utterance
and in all knowledge.”457 But concerning this poverty of the idler elsewhere he also writes
thus: “Every sluggard shall be clothed in torn garments and rags.”458 For certainly he will
not merit to be adorned with that garment of incorruption (of which the Apostle says, “Put
ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,”459 and again: “Being clothed in the breastplate of righteousness
and charity,”460 concerning which the Lord Himself also speaks to Jerusalem by the
prophet: “Arise, arise, O Jerusalem, put on the garments of thy glory),”461 whoever, overpowered
by lazy slumber or by accidie, prefers to be clothed, not by his labour and industry,
but in the rags of idleness, which he tears off from the solid piece and body of the Scriptures,
and fits on to his sloth no garment of glory and honour, but an ignominious cloak and excuse.
For those, who are affected by this laziness, and do not like to support themselves by the
labour of their own hands, as the Apostle continually did and charged us to do, are wont to
make use of certain Scripture proofs by which they try to cloak their idleness, saying that it
is written, “Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that which remains to life eternal;”
462 and “My meat is to do the will of my Father.”463 But these proofs are (as it were)
rags, from the solid piece of the gospel, which are adopted for this purpose, viz., to cover
the disgrace of our idleness and shame rather than to keep us warm, and adorn us with that
costly and splendid garment of virtue which that wise woman in the Proverbs, who was
clothed with strength and beauty, is said to have made either for herself or for her husband;
of which presently it is said: “Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she rejoices in the
latter days.”464 Of this evil of idleness Solomon thus makes mention again: “The ways of

the idlers are strewn with thorns;”465 i.e., with these and similar faults, which the Apostle
above declared to spring from idleness. And again: “Every sluggard is always in want.”466
And of these the Apostle makes mention when he says, “And that you want nothing of any
man’s.”467 And finally: “For idleness has been the teacher of many evils:”468 which the
Apostle has clearly enumerated in the passage which he expounded above: “Working not
at all, but curiously meddling.” To this fault also he joins another: “And that ye study to be
quiet;” and then, “that ye should do your own business and walk honestly towards them
that are without, and that you want nothing of any man’s.” Those also whom he notes as
disorderly and rebellious, from these he charges those who are earnest to separate themselves:
“That ye withdraw yourselves,” says he, “from every brother that walketh disorderly and
not according to the tradition which they received from us.”469</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>How the brethren in Egypt work with their hands, not only to supply their own needs, but also
to minister to those who are in prison.</head>
<p>And so taught by these examples the Fathers in Egypt never allow monks, and especially
the younger ones, to be idle,470 estimating the purpose of their hearts and their growth in
patience and humility by their diligence in work; and they not only do not allow them to
receive anything from another to supply their own wants, but further, they not merely refresh
pilgrims and brethren who come to visit them by means of their labours, but actually collect
an enormous store of provisions and food, and distribute it in the parts of Libya which suffer
from famine and barrenness, and also in the cities, to those who are pining away in the
squalor of prison; as they believe that by such an offering of the fruit of their hands they
offer a reasonable and true sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
<note type="footnote">470 The monks of Egypt were famous for their labours, and Cassian’s language might be illustrated from
many passages in the Fathers; e.g., Epiphanius, in his third book against heresies, compares the monks, and especially
those in Egypt, to bees, because of their diligence. So S. Jerome, writing to Rusticus (Ep. cxxv.), says that
no one is received in a monastery in Egypt unless he will work, and that this rule is made for the good of the
soul rather than for the sake of providing food. Compare also Sozomen H. E. VI. xxviii., where it is said of Serapion
and his followers in the neighbourhood of Arsinöe that “they lived on the produce of their labour and
provided for the poor. During harvest-time they busied themselves in reaping: they set aside sufficient corn for
their own use, and furnished grain gratuitously for the other monks.” S. Basil also, in his Monastic Constitutions
cc. iv. and v., speaks strongly of the value of labour and the Rule of S. Benedict (c. xlviii.) enjoins that “as idleness
is the enemy of the soul, the brethren are to be employed alternately in manual labour and pious reading.”</note>

<head>That idleness is the reason why there are not monasteries for monks in the West.</head>
<p>Hence it is that in these countries we see no monasteries found with such numbers of
brethren: for they are not supported by the resources of their own labour in such a way that
they can remain in them continually; and if in some way or other, through the liberality of
another, there should be a sufficient provision to supply them, yet love of ease and restlessness
of heart does not suffer them to continue long in the place. Whence this saying has been
handed down from the old fathers in Egypt: that a monk who works is attacked by but one
devil; but an idler is tormented by countless spirits.</p>

<p>Abbot Paul471 who every year burnt with fire all the works of his hands.
Lastly, Abbot Paul, one of the greatest of the Fathers, while he was living in a vast desert
which is called the Porphyrian desert,472 and being relieved from anxiety by the date palms
and a small garden, had plenty to support himself, and an ample supply of food, and could
not find any other work to do, which would support him, because his dwelling was separated
from towns and inhabited districts by seven days’ journey,473 or even more, through the
desert, and more would be asked for the carriage of the goods than the price of the work
would be worth; he collected the leaves of the palms, and regularly exacted of himself his
daily task, as if he was to be supported by it. And when his cave had been filled with a whole
year’s work, each year he would burn with fire that at which he had so diligently laboured:
thus proving that without manual labour a monk cannot stop in a place nor rise to the
heights of perfection: so that, though the need for food did not require this to be done, yet
he performed it simply for the sake of purifying his heart, and strengthening his thoughts,
and persisting in his cell, and gaining a victory over accidie and driving it away.</p>
<note type="footnote">471 This Paul is perhaps the same as the one mentioned in connection with Abbot Moses in Conference VII.
xxvi. As he was a contemporary of Cassian he must be carefully distinguished from his more illustrious namesakes,

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>The words of Abbot Moses which he said to me about the cure of accidie.</head>
<p>When I was beginning my stay in the desert, and had said to Abbot Moses, the chief of
all the saints, that I had been terribly troubled yesterday by an attack of accidie, and that I
could only be freed from it by running at once to Abbot Paul, he said, “You have not freed
yourself from it, but rather have given yourself up to it as its slave and subject. For the enemy
will henceforth attack you more strongly as a deserter and runaway, since it has seen that
you fled at once when overcome in the conflict: unless on a second occasion when you join
battle with it you make up your mind not to dispel its attacks and heats for the moment by
deserting your cell, or by the inactivity of sleep, but rather learn to triumph over it by endurance
and conflict.” Whence it is proved by experience that a fit of accidie should not be
evaded by running away from it, but overcome by resisting it.474</p>
<note type="footnote">474 This Abbot Moses is probably the one to whom the first two Conferences are attributed (cf. also Conference
VII. xxvi.); and possibly the second of this name (Moses the Libyan) mentioned by Sozomen, H. E. VI. xxix. Cf.

<head>OF THE SPIRIT OF VAINGLORY.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="653"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How our seventh combat is against the spirit of vainglory, and what its nature.</head>
<p>Our seventh combat is against the spirit of κενοδοξία, which we may term vain or idle
glory: a spirit that takes many shapes, and is changeable and subtle, so that it can with difficulty,
I will not say be guarded against, but be seen through and discovered even by the
keenest eyes.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>How vainglory attacks a monk not only on his carnal, but also on his spiritual side.</head>
<p>For not only does this, like the rest of his faults, attack a monk on his carnal side, but
on his spiritual side as well, insinuating itself by craft and guile into his mind: so that those
who cannot be deceived by carnal vices are more grievously wounded through their spiritual
proficiency; and it is so much the worse to fight against, as it is harder to guard against. For
the attack of all other vices is more open and straightforward, and in the case of each of
them, when he who stirs them up is met by a determined refusal, he will go away the weaker
for it, and the adversary who has been beaten will on the next occasion attack his victim
with less vigour. But this malady when it has attacked the mind by means of carnal pride,
and has been repulsed by the shield of reply, again, like some wickedness that takes many
shapes, changes its former guise and character, and under the appearance of the virtues tries
to strike down and destroy its conqueror.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How many forms and shapes vainglory takes.</head>
<p>For our other faults and passions may be said to be simpler and of but one form: but
this takes many forms and shapes, and changes about and assails the man who stands up
against it from every quarter, and assaults its conqueror on all sides. For it tries to injure
the soldier of Christ in his dress, in his manner, his walk, his voice, his work, his vigils, his
fasts, his prayers, when he withdraws, when he reads, in his knowledge, his silence, his
obedience, his humility, his patience; and like some most dangerous rock hidden by surging
waves, it causes an unforeseen and miserable shipwreck to those who are sailing with a fair
breeze, while they are not on the lookout for it or guarding against it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How vainglory attacks a monk on the right had and on the left.</head>
<p>And so one who wishes to go along the King’s highway by means of the “arms of righteousness
which are on the right hand and on the left,” ought by the teaching of the Apostle
to pass through “honour and dishonour, evil report and good report,”475 and with such
care to direct his virtuous course amid the swelling waves of temptation, with discretion at
the helm, and the Spirit of the Lord breathing on us, since we know that if we deviate ever
so little to the right hand or to the left, we shall presently be dashed against most dangerous
crags. And so we are warned by Solomon, the wisest of men: “Turn not aside to the right
hand or to the left;”476 i.e., do not flatter yourself on your virtues and be puffed up by your
spiritual achievements on the right hand; nor, swerving to the path of vices on the left hand,
seek from them for yourself (to use the words of the Apostle) “glory in your shame.”477 For
where the devil cannot create vainglory in a man by means of his well-fitting and neat dress,
he tries to introduce it by means of a dirty, cheap, and uncared-for style. If he cannot drag
a man down by honour, he overthrows him by humility. If he cannot make him puffed up
by the grace of knowledge and eloquence, he pulls him down by the weight of silence. If a
man fasts openly, he is attacked by the pride of vanity. If he conceals it for the sake of despising
the glory of it, he is assailed by the same sin of pride. In order that he may not be
defiled by the stains of vainglory he avoids making long prayers in the sight of the brethren;
and yet because he offers them secretly and has no one who is conscious of it, he does not
escape the pride of vanity.</p>

<head>A comparison which shows the nature of vainglory.</head>

those bulbs which when stripped of one covering you find to be sheathed in another; and
as often as you strip them, you find them still protected.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="658"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>That vainglory is not altogether got rid of by the advantages of solitude.</head>
<p>In solitude also it does not cease from pursuing him who has for the sake of glory fled
from intercourse with all men. And the more thoroughly a man has shunned the whole
world, so much the more keenly does it pursue him. It tries to lift up with pride one man
because of his great endurance of work and labour, another because of his extreme readiness
to obey, another because he outstrips other men in humility. One man is tempted through
the extent of his knowledge, another through the extent of his reading, another through the
length of his vigils. Nor does this malady endeavour to wound a man except through his
virtues; introducing hindrances which lead to death by means of those very things through
which the supplies of life are sought. For when men are anxious to walk in the path of holiness
and perfection, the enemies do not lay their snares to deceive them anywhere except in the
way along which they walk, in accordance with that saying of the blessed David: “In the way
wherein I walked have they laid a snare for me;”478 that in this very way of virtue along
which we are walking, when pressing on to “the prize of our high calling,”479 we may be
elated by our successes, and so sink down, and fall with the feet of our soul entangled and
caught in the snares of vainglory. And so it results that those of us who could not be vanquished
in the conflict with the foe are overcome by the very greatness of our triumph, or
else (which is another kind of deception) that, overstraining the limits of that self-restraint
which is possible to us, we fail of perseverance in our course on account of bodily weakness.</p>

<head>How vainglory, when it has been overcome, rises again keener than ever for the fight.</head>
<p>All vices when overcome grow feeble, and when beaten are day by day rendered weaker,
and both in regard to place and time grow less and subside, or at any rate, as they are unlike
the opposite virtues, are more easily shunned and avoided: but this one when it is beaten
rises again keener than ever for the struggle; and when we think that it is destroyed, it revives
again, the stronger for its death. The other kinds of vices usually only attack those whom
they have overcome in the conflict; but this one pursues its victors only the more keenly;
and the more thoroughly it has been resisted, so much the more vigorously does it attack
the man who is elated by his victory over it. And herein lies the crafty cunning of our adversary,
namely, in the fact that, where he cannot overcome the soldier of Christ by the
weapons of the foe, he lays him low by his own spear.</p>

<head>How vainglory is not allayed either in the desert or through advancing years.</head>
<p>Other vices, as we said, are sometimes allayed by the advantages of position, and when
the matter of the sin and the occasion and opportunity for it are removed, grow slack, and
are diminished: but this one penetrates the deserts with the man who is flying from it, nor
can it be shut out from any place, nor when outward material for it is removed does it fail.
For it is simply encouraged by the achievements of the virtues of the man whom it attacks.
For all other vices, as we said above, are sometimes diminished by the lapse of time, and
disappear: to this one length of life, unless it is supported by skilful diligence and prudent
discretion, is no hindrance, but actually supplies it with new fuel for vanity.</p>

who are off their guard and not on the lookout.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>An instance showing how King Hezekiah was overthrown by the dart of vainglory.</head>
<p>For so we read that Hezekiah, King of Judah, a man of most perfect righteousness in all
things, and one approved by the witness of Holy Scripture, after unnumbered commendations
for his virtues, was overthrown by a single dart of vainglory. And he who by a single prayer
of his was able to procure the death of a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of
the Assyrians, whom the angel destroyed in one night, is overcome by boasting and vanity.
Of whom—to pass over the long list of his virtues, which it would take a long time to unfold—
I will say but this one thing. He was a man who, after the close of his life had been
decreed and the day of his death determined by the Lord’s sentence, prevailed by a single
prayer to extend the limits set to his life by fifteen years, the sun returning by ten steps, on
which it had already shone in its course towards its setting, and by its return dispersing
those lines which the shadow that followed its course had already marked, and by this giving
two days in one to the whole world, by a stupendous miracle contrary to the fixed laws of
nature.480 Yet after signs so great and so incredible, after such immense proofs of his
goodness, hear the Scripture tell how he was destroyed by his very successes. “In those days,”
we are told, “Hezekiah was sick unto death: and he prayed to the Lord, and He heard him
and gave him a sign,” that, namely of which we read in the fourth book of the kingdoms,
which was given by Isaiah the prophet through the going back of the sun. “But,” it says, “he
did not render again according to the benefits which he had received, for his heart was lifted
up; and wrath was kindled against him and against Judah and Jerusalem: and he humbled
himself afterwards because his heart had been lifted up, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.”481
How dangerous, how terrible is the malady of vanity! So much goodness, so many virtues,
faith and devotion, great enough to prevail to change nature itself and the laws of the whole
world, perish by a single act of pride! So that all his good deeds would have been forgotten
as if they had never been, and he would at once have been subject to the wrath of the Lord
unless he had appeased Him by recovering his humility: so that he who, at the suggestion
of pride, had fallen from so great a height of excellence, could only mount again to the height
he had lost by the same steps of humility. Do you want to see another instance of a similar
downfall?</p>

countless triumphs which he achieved by the merit of his devotion and faith, learn how he
was cast down by the pride of vainglory. “And,” we are told, “the name of Uzziah went forth,
for the Lord helped him and had strengthened him. But when he was made strong, his heart
was lifted up to his destruction, and he neglected the Lord his God.”482 You behold another
instance of a most terrible downfall, and see how two men so upright and excellent were
undone by their very triumphs and victories. Whence you see how dangerous the successes
of prosperity generally are, so that those who could not be injured by adversity are ruined,
unless they are careful, by prosperity; and those who in the conflict of battle have escaped
the danger of death fall before their own trophies and triumphs.</p>

the glory which comes from God alone?”484 Of these too the blessed David speaks with a
threat: “For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men.”485</p>

<head>Of the ways in which vainglory attacks a monk.</head>
<p>In the case also of beginners and of those who have as yet made but little progress either
in powers of mind or in knowledge it usually puffs up their minds, either because of the
quality of their voice because they can sing well, or because their bodies are emaciated,486
or because they are of a good figure, or because they have rich and noble kinsfolk, or because
they have despised a military life and honours. Sometimes too it persuades a man that if he
had remained in the world he would easily have obtained honours and riches, which perhaps
could not possibly have been secured, and inflates him with a vain hope of uncertain things;
and in the case of those things which he never possessed, puffs him up with pride and vanity,
as if he were one who had despised them.</p>

<head>How it suggests that a man may seek to take holy orders.</head>
<p>But sometimes it creates a wish to take holy orders, and a desire for the priesthood or
diaconate. And it represents that if a man has even against his will received this office, he
will fulfil it with such sanctity and strictness that he will be able to set an example of saintliness
even to other priests; and that he will win over many people, not only by his manner
of life, but also by his teaching and preaching. It makes a man, even when alone and sitting
in his cell, to go round in mind and imagination to the dwellings and monasteries of others,
and to make many conversions under the inducements of imaginary exultation.</p>

<p>And so the miserable soul is affected by such vanity—as if it were deluded by a profound

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>Of him whom the superior came upon and found in his cell, deluded by idle vainglory.</head>
<p>I remember an elder, when I was staying in the desert of Scete, who went to the cell of
a certain brother to pay him a visit, and when he had reached the door heard him muttering
inside, and stood still for a little while, wanting to know what it was that he was reading
from the Bible or repeating by heart (as is customary) while he was at work. And when this
most excellent eavesdropper diligently applied his ear and listened with some curiosity, he
found that the man was induced by an attack of this spirit to fancy that he was delivering a
stirring sermon to the people. And when the elder, as he stood still, heard him finish his
discourse and return again to his office, and give out the dismissal of the catechumens, as
the deacon does,487 then at last he knocked at the door, and the man came out, and met the
elder with the customary reverence, and brought him in and (for his knowledge of what
had been his thoughts made him uneasy) asked him when he had arrived, for fear lest he
might have taken some harm from standing too long at the door: and the old man joking
pleasantly replied, “I only got here while you were giving out the dismissal of the catechumens.”</p>
<note type="footnote">487 Celebrare velut diaconum catechumenis missam. Missa is here used for the dismissal of the catechumens,
which it was the deacon’s office to proclaim. The whole service was divided into two parts, (1) the mass of the
catechumens, containing the Scripture lessons, sermon, and prayers for the catechumens; and (2) the mass of
the faithful, or the Eucharist proper. At the end of the first part the deacon warned the catechumens to depart,
in words varying slightly in different churches, but substantially the same in all, both east and west: e.g. in the
Liturgy of S. Chrysostom the form is “Let all the catechumens depart: let not any of the catechumens—Let all
the faithful—”; in that of S. Mark it is still briefer: “Look lest any of the catechumens.” The Roman missal does
not now contain this feature, but it was certainly originally found in it for it is alluded to by Gregory the Great
(Dial. Book II. c. xxiii.), who gives the form as follows: “Si quis non communicat det locum.” It was also customary
in Spain and Gaul, as well as in Africa, being alluded to by Augustine in Sermon xlix.: “Ecce post sermonen fit
missa catechumenis: manebunt fideles, venietur ad locum orationis.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>How faults cannot be cured unless their roots and causes have been discovered.</head>
<p>I thought it well to insert these things in this little work of mine, that we might learn,
not only by reason, but also by examples, about the force of temptations and the order of
the sins which hurt an unfortunate soul, and so might be more careful in avoiding the snares
and manifold deceits of the enemy. For these things are indiscriminately brought forward
by the Egyptian fathers, that by telling them, as those who are still enduring them, they may
disclose and lay bare the combats with all the vices, which they actually do suffer, and those
which the younger ones are sure to suffer; so that, when they explain the illusions arising
from all the passions, those who are but beginners and fervent in spirit may know the secret
of their struggles, and seeing them as in a glass, may learn both the causes of the sins by
which they are troubled, and the remedies for them, and instructed beforehand concerning
the approach of future struggles, may be taught how they ought to guard against them, or
to meet them and to fight with them. As clever physicians are accustomed not only to heal
already existing diseases, but also by a wise skill to seek to obviate future ones, and to prevent
them by their prescriptions and healing draughts, so these true physicians of the soul, by
means of spiritual conferences, like some celestial antidote, destroy beforehand those maladies
of the soul which would arise, and do not allow them to gain a footing in the minds
of the juniors, as they unfold to them the causes of the passions which threaten them, and
the remedies which will heal them.</p>

<p>Wherefore this is an old maxim of the Fathers that is still current,—though I cannot
produce it without shame on my own part, since I could not avoid my own sister, nor escape
the hands of the bishop,—viz., that a monk ought by all means to fly from women and
bishops. For neither of them will allow him who has once been joined in close intercourse
any longer to care for the quiet of his cell, or to continue with pure eyes in divine contemplation
through his insight into holy things.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>Remedies by which we can overcome vainglory.</head>
<p>And so the athlete of Christ who desires to strive lawfully in this true and spiritual
combat, should strive by all means to overcome this changeable monster of many shapes,
which, as it attacks us on every side like some manifold wickedness, we can escape by such
a remedy as this; viz., thinking on that saying of David: “The Lord hath scattered the bones
of those who please men.”488 To begin with we should not allow ourselves to do anything
at the suggestion of vanity, and for the sake of obtaining vainglory. Next, when we have
begun a thing well, we should endeavour to maintain it with just the same care, for fear lest
afterwards the malady of vainglory should creep in and make void all the fruits of our labours.
And anything which is of very little use or value in the common life of the brethren, we
should avoid as leading to boasting; and whatever would render us remarkable amongst the
others, and for which credit would be gained among men, as if we were the only people who
could do it, this should be shunned by us. For by these signs the deadly taint of vainglory
will be shown to cling to us: which we shall most easily escape if we consider that we shall
not merely lose the fruits of those labours of ours which we have performed at the suggestion
of vainglory, but that we shall also be guilty of a great sin, and as impious persons undergo
eternal punishments, inasmuch as we have wronged God by doing for the favour of men
what we ought to have done for His sake, and are convicted by Him who knows all secrets
of having preferred men to God, and the praise of the world to the praise of the Lord.</p>

<head>OF THE SPIRIT OF PRIDE.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="673"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How our eighth combat is against the spirit of pride, and of its character.</head>
<p>Our eighth and last combat is against the spirit of pride, which evil, although it is the
latest in our conflict with our faults and stands last on the list, yet in beginning and in the
order of time is the first: an evil beast that is most savage and more dreadful than all the
former ones, chiefly trying those who are perfect, and devouring with its dreadful bite those
who have almost attained the consummation of virtue.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="674"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>How there are two kinds of pride.</head>
<p>And of this pride there are two kinds: the one, that by which we said that the best of
men and spiritually minded ones were troubled; the other, that which assaults even beginners
and carnal persons. And though each kind of pride is excited with regard to both God and
man by a dangerous elation, yet that first kind more particularly has to do with God; the
second refers especially to men. Of the origin of this last and the remedies for it we will by
God’s help treat as far as possible in the latter part of this book. We now propose to say a
few things about that former kind, by which, as I mentioned before, those who are perfect
are especially tried.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="675"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How pride is equally destructive of all virtues.</head>
<p>There is then no other fault which is so destructive of all virtues, and robs and despoils
a man of all righteousness and holiness, as this evil of pride, which like some pestilential
disease attacks the whole man, and, not content to damage one part or one limb only, injures
the entire body by its deadly influence, and endeavours to cast down by a most fatal fall,
and destroy those who were already at the top of the tree of the virtues. For every other fault
is satisfied within its own bounds and limits, and though it clouds other virtues as well, yet
it is in the main directed against one only, and specially attacks and assaults that. And so
(to make my meaning clearer) gluttony, i.e., the appetites of the belly and the pleasures of
the palate, is destructive of strict temperance: lust stains purity, anger destroys patience: so
that sometimes a man who is in bondage to some one sin is not altogether wanting in other
virtues: but being simply deprived of that one virtue which in the struggle yields to the vice
which is its rival and opposed to it, can to some extent preserve his other virtues: but this
one when once it has taken possession of some unfortunate soul, like some most brutal
tyrant, when the lofty citadel of the virtues has been taken, utterly destroys and lays waste
the whole city; and levelling with the ground of vices the once high walls of saintliness, and
confusing them together, it allows no shadow of freedom henceforth to survive in the soul
subject to it. And in proportion as it was originally the richer, so now will the yoke of servitude
be the severer, through which by its cruel ravages it will strip the soul it has subdued
of all its powers of virtue.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="676"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How by reason of pride Lucifer was turned from an archangel into a devil.</head>
<p>And that we may understand the power of its awful tyranny we see that that angel who,
for the greatness of his splendour and beauty was termed Lucifer, was cast out of heaven
for no other sin but this, and, pierced with the dart of pride, was hurled down from his grand
and exalted position as an angel into hell. If then pride of heart alone was enough to cast
down from heaven to earth a power that was so great and adorned with the attributes of
such might, the very greatness of his fall shows us with what care we who are surrounded
by the weakness of the flesh ought to be on our guard. But we can learn how to avoid the
most deadly poison of this evil if we trace out the origin and causes of his fall. For weakness
can never be cured, nor the remedies for bad states of health be disclosed unless first their
origin and causes are investigated by a wise scrutiny. For as he (viz., Lucifer) was endowed
with divine splendour, and shone forth among the other higher powers by the bounty of
his Maker, he believed that he had acquired the splendour of that wisdom and the beauty
of those powers, with which he was graced by the gift of the Creator, by the might of his
own nature, and not by the beneficence of His generosity. And on this account he was puffed
up as if he stood in no need of divine assistance in order to continue in this state of purity,
and esteemed himself to be like God, as if, like God, he had no need of any one, and trusting
in the power of his own will, fancied that through it he could richly supply himself with
everything which was necessary for the consummation of virtue or for the perpetuation of
perfect bliss. This thought alone was the cause of his first fall. On account of which being
forsaken by God, whom he fancied he no longer needed, he suddenly became unstable and
tottering, and discovered the weakness of his own nature, and lost the blessedness which
he had enjoyed by God’s gift. And because he “loved the words of ruin,” with which he had
said, “I will ascend into heaven,” and the “deceitful tongue,” with which he had said of
himself, “I will be like the Most High,”489 and of Adam and Eve, “Ye shall be as gods,”
therefore “shall God destroy him forever and pluck him out and remove him from his
dwelling place and his root out of the land of the living.” Then “the just,” when they see his
ruin, “shall fear, and shall laugh at him and say” (what may also be most justly aimed at
those who trust that they can obtain the highest good without the protection and assistance
of God): “Behold the man that made not God his helper, but trusted in the abundance of
his riches, and prevailed in his vanity.”490</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>That incentives to all sins spring from pride.</head>
<p>This is the reason of the first fall, and the starting point of the original malady, which
again insinuating itself into the first man,491 through him who had already been destroyed
by it, produced the weaknesses and materials of all faults. For while he believed that by the
freedom of his will and by his own efforts he could obtain the glory of Deity, he actually lost
that glory which he already possessed through the free gift of the Creator.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>That the sin of pride is last in the actual order of the combat, but first in time and origin.</head>
<p>And so it is most clearly established by instances and testimonies from Scripture that
the mischief of pride, although it comes later in the order of the combat, is yet earlier in
origin, and is the beginning of all sins and faults: nor is it (like the other vices) simply fatal
to the virtue opposite to it (in this case, humility), but it is also at the same time destructive
of all virtues: nor does it only tempt ordinary folk and small people, but chiefly those who
already stand on the heights of valour.492 For thus the prophet speaks of this spirit, “His
meat is choice.”493 And so the blessed David, although he guarded the recesses of his heart
with the utmost care, so that he dared to say to Him from whom the secrets of his conscience
were not hid, “Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes lofty: neither have I walked in
great matters, nor in wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded;”494 and again,
“He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house;”495 yet, as he knew how
hard is that watchfulness even for those that are perfect, he did not so presume on his own
efforts, but prayed to God and implored His help, that he might escape unwounded by the
darts of this foe, saying, “Let not the foot of pride come to me,”496 for he feared and dreaded
falling into that which is said of the proud, viz., “God resisteth the proud;”497 and again:
“Every one that exalteth his heart is unclean before the Lord.”498</p>

<head>That the evil of pride is so great that it rightly has even God Himself as its adversary.</head>
<p>How great is the evil of pride, that it rightly has no angel, nor other virtues opposed to
it, but God Himself as its adversary! Since it should be noted that it is never said of those
who are entangled in other sins that they have God resisting them; I mean it is not said that
God is opposed “to the gluttonous, fornicators, passionate, or covetous,” but only “to the
proud.” For those sins react only on those who commit them, or seem to be committed
against those who share in them, i.e., against other men; but this one has more properly to
do with God, and therefore it is especially right that it should have Him opposed to it.</p>

<head>How God has destroyed the pride of the devil by the virtue of humility, and various passages
in proof of this.</head>
<p>And so God, the Creator and Healer of all, knowing that pride is the cause and fountain
head of evils, has been careful to heal opposites with opposites, that those things which were
ruined by pride might be restored by humility. For the one says, “I will ascend into heaven;”
499 the other, “My soul was brought low even to the ground.”500 The one says, “And I
will be like the most High;” the other, “Though He was in the form of God, yet He emptied
Himself and took the form of a servant, and humbled Himself and became obedient unto
death.”501 The one says, “I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;” the other, “Learn
of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.”502 The one says, “I know not the Lord and will
not let Israel go;”503 the other, “If I say that I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you:
but I know Him, and keep His commandments.”504 The one says, “My rivers are mine and
I made them:”505 the other: “I can do nothing of myself, but my Father who abideth in me,
He doeth the works.”506 The one says, “All the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
are mine, and to whomsoever I will, I give them;”507 the other, “Though He were rich yet
He became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich.”508 The one says, “As
eggs are gathered together which are left, so have I gathered all the earth: and there was
none that moved the wing or opened the mouth, or made the least noise;”509 the other, “I
am become like a solitary pelican; I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the
roof.”510 The one says, “I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers shut up in
banks;”511 the other, “Cannot I ask my Father, and He shall presently give me more than
twelve legions of angels?”512 If we look at the reason of our original fall, and the foundations

grace of God with me,” and “by the grace of God I am what I am;”513 and “it is God that
worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”514 As the author of our salvation
Himself also says: “If a man abide in me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for
without me ye can do nothing.”515 And “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in
vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” And
“Vain is it for you to rise up before light.”516 For “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.”517</p>

<head>The case of the thief and of David, and of our call in order to illustrate the grace of God.</head>
<p>For if we recall that thief who was by reason of a single confession admitted into paradise,
521 we shall feel that he did not acquire such bliss by the merits of his life, but obtained
it by the gift of a merciful God. Or if we bear in mind those two grievous and heinous sins
of King David, blotted out by one word of penitence,522 we shall see that neither here were
the merits of his works sufficient to obtain pardon for so great a sin, but that the grace of
God superabounded, as, when the opportunity for true penitence was taken, He removed
the whole weight of sins through the full confession of but one word. If we consider also
the beginning of the call and salvation of mankind, in which, as the Apostle says, we are
saved not of ourselves, nor of our works, but by the gift and grace of God, we can clearly
see how the whole of perfection is “not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of
God that hath mercy,” who makes us victorious over our faults, without any merits of works
and life on our part to outweigh them, or any effort of our will availing to scale the difficult
heights of perfection, or to subdue the flesh which we have to use: since no tortures of this
body, and no contrition of heart, can be sufficient for the acquisition of that true chastity
of the inner man so as to be able to gain that great virtue of purity (which is innate in the
angels alone and indigenous as it were to heaven) merely by human efforts, i.e., without the
aid of God: for the performance of everything good flows from His grace, who by multiplying
His bounty has granted such lasting bliss, and vast glory to our feeble will and short and
petty course of life.</p>

<head>The teaching of the elders on the method of acquiring purity.</head>
<p>Wherefore it is now time to produce, in the very words in which they hand it down, the
opinion of the Fathers; viz., of those who have not painted the way of perfection and its
character in high-sounding words, but rather, possessing it in deed and truth, and in the
virtue of their spirit, have passed it on by their own experience and sure example. And so
they say that no one can be altogether cleansed from carnal sins, unless he has realized that
all his labours and efforts are insufficient for so great and perfect an end; and unless, taught,
not by the system handed down to him, but by his feelings and virtues and his own experience,
he recognizes that it can only be gained by the mercy and assistance of God. For in
order to acquire such splendid and lofty prizes of purity and perfection, however great may
be the efforts of fastings and vigils and readings and solitude and retirement applied to it,
they will not be sufficient to secure it by the merits of the actual efforts and toil. For a man’s
own efforts and human exertions will never make up for the lack of the divine gift, unless
it is granted by divine compassion in answer to his prayer.</p>

be gained without these, but that by these only without the grace of God nobody can ever
attain it. For when we say that human efforts cannot of themselves secure it without the aid
of God, we thus insist that God’s mercy and grace are bestowed only upon those who labour
and exert themselves, and are granted (to use the Apostle’s expression) to them that “will”
and “run,” according to that which is sung in the person of God in the eighty-eighth Psalm:
“I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.”524
For we say, in accordance with our Saviour’s words, that it is given to them that ask, and
opened to them that knock and found by them that seek;525 but that the asking, the seeking,
and the knocking on our part are insufficient unless the mercy of God gives what we ask,
and opens that at which we knock, and enables us to find that which we seek. For He is at
hand to bestow all these things, if only the opportunity is given to Him by our good will.
For He desires and looks for our perfection and salvation far more than we do ourselves.
And the blessed David knew so well that by his own efforts he could not secure the increase
of his work and labour, that he entreated with renewed prayers that he might obtain the
“direction” of his work from the Lord, saying, “Direct thou the work of our hands over us;
yea, the work of our hands do thou direct;”526 and again: “Confirm, O God, what thou hast
wrought in us.”527</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>From whom we can learn the way of perfection.</head>
<p>And so, if we wish in very deed and truth to attain to the crown of virtues, we ought to
listen to those teachers and guides who, not dreaming with pompous declamations, but
learning by act and experience, are able to teach us as well, and direct us likewise, and show
us the road by which we may arrive at it by a most sure pathway; and who also testify that
they have themselves reached it by faith rather than by any merits of their efforts. And further,
the purity of heart that they have acquired has taught them this above all; viz., to recognize
more and more that they are burdened with sin (for their compunction for their faults increases
day by day in proportion as their purity of soul advances), and to sigh continually
from the bottom of their heart because they see that they cannot possibly avoid the spots
and blemishes of those faults which are ingrained in them through the countless triflings
of the thoughts. And therefore they declared that they looked for the reward of the future
life, not from the merits of their works, but from the mercy of the Lord, taking no credit to
themselves for their great circumspection of heart in comparison with others, since they
ascribed this not to their own exertions, but to divine grace; and without flattering themselves
on account of the carelessness of those who are cold, and worse than they themselves are,
they rather aimed at a lasting humility by fixing their gaze on those whom they knew to be
really free from sin and already in the enjoyment of eternal bliss in the kingdom of heaven,
and so by this consideration they avoided the downfall of pride, and at the same time always
saw both what they were aiming at and what they had to grieve over: as they knew that they
could not attain that purity of heart for which they yearned while weighed down by the
burden of the flesh.</p>

<head>That we cannot even make the effort to obtain perfection without the mercy and inspiration
of God.</head>
<p>We ought therefore, in accordance with their teaching and instruction, so to press towards
it, and to be diligent in fastings, vigils, prayers, and contrition of heart and body, for
fear lest all these things should be rendered useless by an attack of this malady. For we ought
to believe not merely that we cannot secure this actual perfection by our own efforts and
exertions, but also that we cannot perform those things which we practise for its sake, viz.,
our efforts and exertions and desires, without the assistance of the divine protection, and
the grace of His inspiration, chastisement, and exhortation, which He ordinarily sheds
abroad in our hearts either through the instrumentality of another, or in His own person
coming to visit us.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Various passages which clearly show that we cannot do anything which belongs to our salvation
without the aid of God.</head>
<p>Lastly, the Author of our salvation teaches us what we ought not merely to think, but
also to acknowledge in everything that we do. “I can,” He says, “of mine own self do nothing,
but the Father which abideth in me, He doeth the works.”528 He says, speaking in the human
nature which He had taken,529 that He could do nothing of Himself; and shall we, who are
dust and ashes, think that we have no need of God’s help in what pertains to our salvation?
And so let us learn in everything, as we feel our own weakness, and at the same time His
help, to declare with the saints, “I was overturned that I might fall, but the Lord supported
me. The Lord is my strength and my praise: and He is become my salvation.”530 And “Unless
the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell. If I said, My foot is moved: Thy
mercy, O Lord, assisted me. According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy
comforts have given joy to my soul.”531 Seeing also that our heart is strengthened in the
fear of the Lord, and in patience, let us say: “And the Lord became my protector; and He
brought me forth into a large place.”532 And knowing that knowledge is increased by progress
in work, let us say: “For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my darkness,
for by Thee I shall be delivered from temptation, and through my God I shall go over a
wall.” Then, feeling that we have ourselves sought for courage and endurance, and are being
directed with greater ease and without labour in the path of the virtues, let us say, “It is God
who girded me with strength, and made my way perfect; who made my feet like hart’s feet,
and setteth me up on high: who teacheth my hands to war.” And having also secured discretion,
strengthened with which we can dash down our enemies, let us cry aloud to God: “Thy
discipline hath set me up533 unto the end, and Thy discipline the same shall teach me. Thou
hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet are not weakened.” And because I am thus
strengthened with Thy knowledge and power, I will boldly take up the words which follow,
and will say, “I will pursue after my enemies and overtake them: and I will not turn again
till they are consumed. I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall
under my feet.”534 Again, mindful of our own infirmity, and of the fact that while still

burdened with the weak flesh we cannot without His assistance overcome such bitter foes
as our sins are, let us say, “Through Thee we will scatter our enemies:535 and through Thy
name we will despise them that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow: neither
shall my sword save me. For Thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put them
to shame that hate us.”536 But further: “Thou hast guided me with strength unto the battle,
and hast subdued under me them that rose up against me. And Thou hast made mine enemies
turn their backs upon me, and hast destroyed them that hated me.”537 And reflecting that
with our own arms alone we cannot conquer, let us say, “Take hold of arms and shield: and
rise up to help me. Bring out the sword and stop the way against them that persecute me:
say to my soul, I am thy salvation.”538 And Thou hast made my arms like a brazen bow.
And Thou hast given me the protection of Thy salvation: and Thy right hand hath held me
up.”539 “For our fathers got not the possession of the land through their own sword; neither
did their own arm save them: but Thy right hand and Thine arm and the light of Thy
countenance because Thou wast pleased with them.”540 Lastly, as with anxious mind we
regard all His benefits with thankfulness, let us cry to Him with the inmost feelings of our
heart, for all these things, because we have fought, and have obtained from Him the light
of knowledge, and self-control and discretion, and because He has furnished us with His
own arms, and strengthened us with a girdle of virtue, and because He has made our enemies
turn their backs upon us, and has given us the power of scattering them like the dust before
the wind: “I will love Thee, O Lord my Strength; the Lord is my stronghold, my refuge and
my deliverer. My God is my helper, and in Him will I put my trust. My protector and the
horn of my salvation, and my support. Praising I will call upon the name of the Lord; and
I shall be saved from mine enemies.”541</p>

<p>How we are protected by the grace of God not only in our natural condition, but also by His

<p>Not alone giving thanks to Him for that He has created us as reasonable beings, and
endowed us with the power of free will, and blessed us with the grace of baptism, and
granted to us the knowledge and aid of the law, but for these things as well, which are bestowed
upon us by His daily providence; viz., that He delivers us from the craft of our enemies;
that He works with us so that we can overcome the sins of the flesh, that, even without
our knowing it, He shields us from dangers; that He protects us from falling into sin; that
He helps us and enlightens us, so that we can understand and recognize the actual help
which He gives us, (which some will have it is what is meant by the law);542 that, when we
are through His influence secretly struck with compunction for our sins and negligences,
He visits us with His regard and chastens us to our soul’s health; that even against our will
we are sometimes drawn by Him to salvation; lastly that this very free will of ours, which is
more readily inclined to sin, is turned by Him to a better purpose, and by His prompting
and suggestion, bent towards the way of virtue.</p>

<head>How this faith concerning the grace of God was delivered to us by the ancient Fathers.</head>
<p>This then is that humility towards God, this is that genuine faith of the ancient fathers
which still remains intact among their successors. And to this faith, the apostolic virtues,
which they so often showed, bear an undoubted witness, not only among us but also among
infidels and unbelievers: for keeping in simplicity of heart the simple faith of the fishermen
they did not receive it in a worldly spirit through dialectical syllogisms or the eloquence of
a Cicero, but learnt by the experience of a pure life, and stainless actions, and by correcting
their faults, and (to speak more truly) by visible proofs, that the character of perfection is
to be found in that faith without which neither piety towards God, nor purification from
sin, nor amendment of life, nor perfection of virtue can be secured.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of one who for his blasphemy was given over to a most unclean spirit.</head>
<p>I knew one of the number of the brethren, whom I heartily wish I had never known;
since afterwards he allowed himself to be saddled with the responsibilities of my order:543
who confessed to a most admirable elder that he was attacked by a terrible sin of the flesh:
for he was inflamed with an intolerable lust, with the unnatural desire of suffering rather
than of committing a shameful act: then the other like a true spiritual physician, at once
saw through the inward cause and origin of this evil. And, sighing deeply, said: “Never would
the Lord have suffered you to be given over to so foul a spirit unless you had blasphemed
against Him.” And he, when this was discovered, at once fell at his feet on the ground, and,
struck with the utmost astonishment, as if he saw the secrets of his heart laid bare by God,
confessed that he had blasphemed with evil thoughts against the Son of God. Whence it is
clear that one who is possessed by the spirit of pride, or who has been guilty of blasphemy
against God,—as one who offers a wrong to Him from whom the gift of purity must be
looked for—is deprived of his uprightness and perfection, and does not deserve the sanctifying
grace of chastity.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>The instance of Joash, King of Judah, showing what was the consequence of his pride.</head>
<p>Some such thing we read of in the book of Chronicles. For Joash the king of Judah at
the age of seven was summoned by Jehoiada the priest to the kingdom and by the witness
of Scripture is commended for all his actions as long as the aforesaid priest lived. But hear
what Scripture relates of him after Jehoiada’s death, and how he was puffed up with pride
and given over to a most disgraceful state. “But after the death of Jehoiada the princes went
in and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened unto them.
And they forsook the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served groves and
idols, and great wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin.” And after a little:
“When a year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to
Judah and Jerusalem, and killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to
the king to Damascus. And whereas there came a very small number of the Syrians, the Lord
delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the
God of their fathers: and on Joash they executed shameful judgments. And departing they
left him in great diseases.”544 You see how the consequence of pride was that he was given
over to shocking and filthy passions. For he who is puffed up with pride and has permitted
himself to be worshipped as God, is (as the Apostle says) “given over to shameful passions
and a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.”545 And because, as
Scripture says, “every one who exalts his heart is unclean before God,”546 he who is puffed
up with swelling pride of heart is given over to most shameful confusion to be deluded by
it, that when thus humbled he may know that he is unclean through impurity of the flesh
and knowledge of impure desires,—a thing which he had refused to recognize in the pride
of his heart; and also that the shameful infection of the flesh may disclose the hidden impurity
of the heart, which he contracted through the sin of pride, and that through the patent pollution
of his body he may be proved to be impure, who did not formerly see that he had
become unclean through the pride of his spirit.</p>

is given over to the Syrians of the soul,547 i.e., to spiritual wickedness, and that it is
entangled in the lusts of the flesh, that the soul being at last humbled by earthly faults, and
carnally polluted, may recognize its uncleanness, though while it stood erect in the coldness
of its heart, it could not understand that through pride of heart it was rendered unclean in
the sight of God; and by this means being humbled, a man may get rid of his former coldness,
and being cast down and confused with the shame of his fleshly lusts, may thenceforward
hasten to betake himself the more eagerly towards fervour and warmth of spirit.</p>

<p>And so it is clearly shown that none can attain the end of perfection and purity, except
through true humility, which he displays in the first instance to the brethren, and shows

<head>Who are attacked by spiritual and who by carnal pride.</head>
<p>Thus much let it suffice to have spoken, as far as, by God’s help, our slender ability was
able, concerning spiritual pride of which we have said that it attacks advanced Christians.
And this kind of pride is not familiar to or experienced by most men, because the majority
do not aim at attaining perfect purity of heart, so as to arrive at the stage of these conflicts;
nor have they secured any purification from the preceding faults of which we have here explained
both the character and the remedies in separate books. But it generally attacks those
only who have conquered the former faults and have already almost arrived at the top of
the tree in respect of the virtues. And because our most crafty enemy has not been able to
destroy them through a carnal fall, he endeavours to cast them down and overthrow them
by a spiritual catastrophe, trying by this to rob them of the prizes of their ancient rewards
secured as they were with great labour. But as for us, who are still entangled in earthly passions,
he never deigns to tempt us in this fashion, but overthrows us by a coarser and what
I called a carnal pride. And therefore I think it well, as I promised, to say a few things about
this kind of pride by which we and men of our stamp are usually affected, and the minds
especially of younger men and beginners are endangered.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>A description of carnal pride, and of the evils which it produces in the soul of a monk.</head>
<p>This carnal pride therefore, of which we spoke, when it has gained an entrance into the
heart of a monk, which is but lukewarm, and has made a bad start in renouncing the world,
does not suffer him to stoop from his former state of worldly haughtiness to the true humility
of Christ, but first of all makes him disobedient and rough; then it does not let him be gentle
and kindly; nor allows him to be on a level with and like his brethren: nor does it permit
him to be stripped and deprived of his worldly goods, as God and our Saviour commands:
and, though renunciation of the world is nothing but the mark of mortification and the
cross, and cannot begin or rise from any other foundations, but these; viz., that a man should
recognize that he is not merely spiritually dead to the deeds of this world, but also should
realize daily that he must die in the body—it makes him on the contrary hope for a long
life, and sets before him many lengthy infirmities, and covers him with shame and confusion.
If when stripped of everything he has begun to be supported by the property of others and
not his own, it persuades him that it is much better for food and clothing to be provided for
him by his own rather than by another’s means according to that text (which, as was before
said,548 those who are rendered dense through such dulness and coldness of heart, cannot
possibly understand), “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”549</p>

own want of faith fall away from that spark of faith, by which they seemed in the early days
of their conversion to be enkindled, begin more anxiously to watch over the money which
before they had begun to give away, and treasure it up with greater avarice, as men who
cannot recover again what they have once wasted: or—what is still worse—take back what
they had formerly cast away: or else (which is a third and most disgusting kind of sin), collect
what they never before possessed, and thus are convicted of having gone no further in forsaking
the world than merely to take the name and style of monk. With this beginning
therefore, and on this bad and rotten foundation, it is a matter of course that the whole superstructure
of faults must rise, nor can anything be built on such villainous foundations,
except what will bring the wretched soul to the ground with a hopeless collapse.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>A description of the faults which spring from the evil of pride.</head>
<p>The mind then that is hardened by such feelings, and which begins with this miserable
coldness is sure to go daily from bad to worse and to conclude its life with a more hideous
end: and while it takes delight in its former desires, and is overcome, as the apostle says, by
impious avarice (as he says of it “and covetousness, which is idolatry, or the worship of
idols,” and again “the love of money,” says he, “is the root of all evils”550) can never admit
into the heart the true and unfeigned humility of Christ, while the man boasts himself of
his high birth, or is puffed up by his position in the world (which he has forsaken in body
but not in mind) or is proud of his wealth which he retains to his own destruction; and because
of this he is no longer content to endure the yoke of the monastery, or to be instructed
by the teaching of any of the elders, and not only objects to observe any rule of subjection
or obedience, but will not even listen to teaching about perfection; and such dislike of spiritual
talk grows up in his heart that if such a conversation should happen to arise, he cannot
keep his eyes fixed on one spot, but his gaze wanders blankly about here and there, and his
eyes shift hither and thither, as the custom is. Instead of wholesome coughs, he spits from
a dry throat: he coughs on purpose without any need, he drums with his fingers, and twiddles
them and scribbles like a man writing: and all his limbs fidget so that while the spiritual
conversation is proceeding, you would think that he was sitting on thorns, and those very
sharp ones, or in the midst of a mass of worms: and if the conversation turns in all simplicity
on something which is for the good of the hearers, he thinks that it is brought forward for
his especial benefit. And all the time that the examination of the spiritual life is proceeding,
he is taken up with his own suspicious thoughts, and is not on the watch for something to
take home for his good, but is anxiously seeking the reason why anything is said, or is quietly
turning over in his mind, how he can raise objections to it, so that he cannot at all take in
any of those things which are so admirably brought forward, or be done any good to by
them. And so the result is that the spiritual conference is not merely of no use to him, but
is positively injurious, and becomes to him an occasion of greater sin. For while he is conscience
stricken and fancies that everything is being aimed at him he hardens himself more
stubbornly in the obstinacy of his heart, and is more keenly affected by the stings of his
wrath: then afterwards his voice is loud, his talk harsh, his answers bitter and noisy, his gait
lordly and capricious; his tongue too ready, he is forward in conversation and no friend to
silence except when he is nursing in his heart some bitterness against a brother, and his silence
denotes not compunction or humility, but pride and wrath: so that one can hardly say which
is the more objectionable in him, that unrestrained and boisterous merriment, or this

dreadful and deadly solemnity.551 For in the former we see inopportune chattering, light
and frivolous laughter, unrestrained and undisciplined mirth. In the latter a silence that is
full of wrath and deadly; and which simply arises from the desire to prolong as long as
possible the rancorous feelings which are nourished in silence against some brother, and
not from the wish to obtain from it the virtues of humility and patience. And as the man
who is a victim to passion readily makes everybody else miserable and is ashamed to apologize
to the brother whom he has wronged, so when the brother offers to do so to him, he rejects
it with scorn. And not only is he not touched or softened by the advances of his brother;
but is the rather made more angry because his brother anticipates him in humility. And that
wholesome humiliation and apology, which generally puts an end to the devil’s temptation,
becomes to him an occasion of a worse outbreak.</p>

shown signs of throwing off the humility, of which he had made trial for a short time at his
renunciation of the world, and of being puffed up with diabolical pride—most impertinently
answered, “Did I humiliate myself for a time on purpose to be always in subjection?” And
at this wanton and wicked reply of his the elder was utterly aghast, and could say nothing,
as if he had received this answer from old Lucifer himself and not from a man; so that he
could not possibly utter a word against such impudence, but only let fall sighs and groans
from his heart; turning over in silence in his mind that which is said of our Saviour: “Who
being in the form of God humbled Himself and became obedient”—not, as the man said
who was seized with a diabolical spirit of pride, “for a time,” but “even to death.”552</p>

<head>The signs by which you can recognize the presence of carnal pride in a soul.</head>
<p>And to draw together briefly what has been said of this kind of pride, by collecting, as
well as we can, some of its signs that we may somehow convey to those who are thirsting
for instruction in perfection, an idea of its characteristics from the movements of the outward
man: I think it well to unfold them in a few words that we may conveniently recognize the
signs by which we can discern and detect it, that when the roots of this passion are laid bare
and brought to the surface, and seen and traced out with ocular demonstration, they may
be the more easily plucked up and avoided. For only then will this most pestilent evil be altogether
escaped, and if we do not begin too late in the day, when it has already got the
mastery over us, to be on our guard against its dangerous heat and noxious influence, but
if, recognizing its symptoms (so to speak) beforehand, we take precautions against it with
wise and careful forethought. For, as we said before, you can tell a man’s inward condition
from his outward gait. By these signs, then, that carnal pride, of which we spoke earlier, is
shown. To begin with, in conversation the man’s voice is loud: in his silence there is bitterness:
in his mirth his laughter is noisy and excessive: when he is serious he is unreasonably gloomy:
in his answers there is rancour: he is too free with his tongue, his words tumbling out at
random without being weighed. He is utterly lacking in patience, and without charity: impudent
in offering insults to others, faint-hearted in bearing them himself: troublesome in
the matter of obedience except where his own wishes and likings correspond with his duty:
unforgiving in receiving admonition: weak in giving up his own wishes: very stubborn about
yielding to those of others: always trying to compass his own ends, and never ready to give
them up for others: and thus the result is that though he is incapable of giving sound advice,
yet in everything he prefers his own opinion to that of the elders.</p>

patience and humility—he longs to take up is abode in a solitary cell; else is eager to build
a monastery and gather together some others to teach and instruct, as if he would do good
to many more people, and make himself from being a bad disciple a still worse master. For
when through this pride of heart a man has fallen into this most dangerous and injurious
coldness, he can neither be a real monk nor a man of the world, and what is worse, promises
to himself to gain perfection by means of this wretched state and manner of life of his.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
<head>How we can overcome pride and attain perfection.</head>
<p>Wherefore if we wish the summit of our building to be perfect and to rise well-pleasing
to God, we should endeavour to lay its foundations not in accordance with the desires of
our own lust, but according to the rules of evangelical strictness: which can only be the fear
of God and humility, proceeding from kindness and simplicity of heart. But humility cannot
possibly be acquired without giving up everything: and as long as a man is a stranger to this,
he cannot possibly attain the virtue of obedience, or the strength of patience, or the serenity
of kindness, or the perfection of love; without which things our hearts cannot possibly be
a habitation for the Holy Spirit: as the Lord says through the prophet: “Upon whom shall
My spirit rest, but on him that is humble and quiet and hears My words,” or according to
those copies which express the Hebrew accurately: “To whom shall I have respect, but to
him that is poor and little and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at My words?”553</p>
<note type="footnote">553 Is. lxvi. 2. It is noteworthy that Cassian after giving a rendering which differs but slightly from that of the
old Latin, as given in Sabbatier’s great work, adds the version of “those copies which express the Hebrew accurately,”
and thus shows his acquaintance with Jerome’s new translation which he quotes. He does the same thing
again in the Conferences, XXIII. viii.; and On the Incarnation Against Nestorius IV. iii.; V. ii., xv. Compare also
Institutes VIII. xxi., and Conf. VIII. x.; where he also betrays a knowledge of the Vulgate. As a general rule,
however, his translations are taken from the old Latin, or possibly in some cases are made by him from the LXX.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">
<pb n="707"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
<head>How pride which is so destructive of all virtues can itself be destroyed by true humility.</head>
<p>Wherefore the Christian athlete who strives lawfully in the spiritual combat and desires
to be crowned by the Lord, should endeavour by every means to destroy this most fierce
beast, which is destructive of all virtues, knowing that as long as this remains in his breast
he not only will never be free from all kinds of evils, but even if he seems to have any good
qualities, will lose them by its malign influence. For no structure (so to speak) of virtue can
possibly be raised in our soul unless first the foundations of true humility are laid in our
heart, which being securely laid may be able to bear the weight of perfection and love upon
them in such a way that, as we have said, we may first show to our brethren true humility
from the very bottom of our heart, in nothing acquiescing in making them sad or in injuring
them: and this we cannot possibly manage unless true self-denial, which consists in stripping
and depriving ourselves of all our possessions, is implanted in us by the love of Christ. Next
the yoke of obedience and subjection must be taken up in simplicity of heart without any
pretence, so that, except for the commands of the Abbot, no will of our own is alive in us.
But this can only be ensured in the case of one who considers himself not only dead to this
world, but also unwise and a fool; and performs without any discussion whatever is enjoined
him by his seniors, believing it to be divine and enjoined from heaven.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
<pb n="708"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<head>Remedies against the evil of pride.</head>
<p>And when men remain in this condition, there is no doubt that this quiet and secure
state of humility will follow, so that considering ourselves inferior to every one else we shall
bear everything offered to us, even if it is hurtful, and saddening, and damaging—with the
utmost patience, as if it came from those who are our superiors. And these things we shall
not only bear with the greatest ease, but we shall consider them trifling and mere nothings,
if we constantly bear in mind the passion of our Lord and of all His Saints: considering that
the injuries by which we are tried are so much less than theirs, as we are so far behind their
merits and their lives: remembering also that we shall shortly depart out of this world, and
soon by a speedy end to our life here become sharers of their lot. For considerations such
as these are a sure end not only to pride but to all kinds of sins. Then, next after this we must
keep a firm grasp of this same humility towards God: which we must so secure as not only
to acknowledge that we cannot possibly perform anything connected with the attainment
of perfect virtue without His assistance and grace, but also truly to believe that this very fact
that we can understand this, is His own gift.</p>

<p>CONTAINING CONFERENCES I–X.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>The obligation, which was promised to the blessed Pope Castor in the preface to those
volumes which with God’s help I composed in twelve books on the Institutes of the Coenobia,
and the remedies for the eight principal faults, has now been, as far as my feeble ability
permitted, satisfied. I should certainly like to see what was the opinion fairly arrived at on
this work both by his judgment and yours, whether, on a matter so profound and so lofty,
and one which has never yet been made the subject of a treatise, we have produced anything
worthy of your notice, and of the eager desire of all the holy brethren. But now as the
aforesaid Bishop has left us and departed to Christ, meanwhile these ten Conferences of the
grandest of the fathers, viz., the Anchorites who dwelt in the desert of Scete, which he, fired
with an incomparable desire for saintliness, had bidden me write for him in the same style
(not considering in the greatness of his affection, what a burden he placed on shoulders too
weak to bear it)—these Conferences I have thought good to dedicate to you in particular,
O blessed Pope,1 Leontius,2 and holy brother Helladius.3 For one of you was united to him
whom I have mentioned, by the ties of brotherhood, and the rank of the priesthood, and
(what is more to the point) by fervour in sacred study, and so has an hereditary right to
demand the debt due to his brother: while the other has ventured to follow the sublime
customs of the Anchorites, not like some others, presumptuously on his own account, but
seizing, at the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, on the right path of doctrine almost before he
had been taught and choosing to learn not so much from his own ideas as from their traditions.
Wherein just as I had anchored in the harbour of Silence, a wide sea opens out before
me, so that I must venture to hand down for posterity some of the Institutes and teaching
of these great men. For the bark of my slender abilities will be exposed to the dangers of a
longer voyage on the deep, in proportion as the Anchorite’s life is grander than that of the
Coenobium, and the contemplation of God, to which those inestimable men ever devoted
themselves, more sublime than ordinary practical life. It is yours therefore to assist our efforts
by your pious prayers for fear lest so sacred a subject that is to be treated in an untried but
faithful manner, should be imperilled by us, or lest our simplicity should lose itself in the
depths of the subject matter. Let us therefore pass from what is visible to the eye and the
external mode of life of the monks, of which we treated in the former books, to the life of
the inner man, which is hidden from view; and from the system of the canonical prayers,
let our discourse mount to that continuance in unceasing prayer, which the Apostle enjoins,
that whoever has through reading our former work already spiritually gained the name of
<note type="footnote">1 Papa. See note on the Preface to the Institutes.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 The see of which Leontius was Bishop is uncertain, possibly Fréjus.</note>

Jacob by ousting his carnal faults, may now by the reception of the Institutes which are not
mine but the fathers’, mount by a pure insight to the merits and (so to speak) the dignity of
Israel, and in the same way be taught what it is that he should observe on these lofty heights
of perfection.4 And so may your prayers gain from Him, Who has deemed us worthy both
to see them and to learn from them and to dwell with them, that He will vouchsafe to grant
us a perfect recollection of their teaching, and a ready tongue to tell it, that we may explain
them as beautifully and as exactly as we received them from them and may succeed in setting
before you the men themselves incorporated, as it were, in their own Institutes, and what
is more to the point, speaking in the Latin tongue. Of this however we wish above all to advertise
the reader of these conferences as well as of our earlier works, that if there chances
to be anything herein which by reason of his condition and the character of his profession,
or owing to custom and the common mode of life seems to him either impossible or very
difficult, he should measure it not by the limits of his own powers but by the worth and
perfection of the speakers, whose zeal and purpose he should first consider, as they were
truly dead to this worldly life, and so hampered by no feelings for their kinsmen according
to the flesh, and by no ties of worldly occupations. Next let him bear in mind the character
of the country in which they dwelt, how they lived in a vast desert, and were cut off from
intercourse with all their fellow-men, and thus were able to have their minds enlightened,
and to contemplate, and utter those things which perhaps will seem impossibilities to the
uninitiated and uninstructed, because of their way of life and the commonplace character
of their habits. But if any one wants to give a true opinion on this matter, and is anxious to
try whether such perfection can be attained, let him first endeavour to make their purpose
his own, with the same zeal and the same mode of life, and then in the end he will find that
those things which used to seem beyond the powers of men, are not only possible, but really
delightful. But now let us proceed at once to their Conferences and Institutes.</p>
<note type="footnote">4 The allusion is rather forced and strained. But Cassian means to say that those who have got the better of
their carnal sins by perusing his former work, are already fit to be named Jacob (the supplanter), who got the
better of his brother: and he hopes that this new work of his will give them such a view of God and insight into
His dealings that they may be worthy to have their name changed, as Jacob’s was, to Israel, which he takes to
mean the man seeing God. Cf. the note on Against Nestorius, VII. ix. (intelligibilis here = spiritualis, cf. intellectualis.

<head>I. FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT MOSES.</head>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="713"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of our stay in Scete, and that which we proposed to Abbot Moses.</head>
<p>When I was in the desert of Scete, where are the most excellent monastic fathers and
where all perfection flourishes, in company with the holy father Germanus (who had since
the earliest days and commencement of our spiritual service been my closest companion
both in the Coenobium and in the desert, so that to show the harmony of our friendship
and aims, everybody would say that a single heart and soul existed in our two bodies), I
sought out Abbot Moses,5 who was eminent amid those splendid flowers, not only in practical
but also in contemplative excellence, in my anxiety to be grounded by his instruction:
and together we implored him to give us a discourse for our edification; not without tears,
for we knew full well his determination never to consent to open the gate of perfection, except
to those who desired it with all faithfulness, and sought it with all sorrow of heart; for fear
lest if he showed it at random to those who cared nothing for it, or only desired it in a halfhearted
way, by opening what is necessary, and what ought only to be discovered to those
seeking perfection, to unworthy persons, and such as accepted it with scorn, he might appear
to lay himself open either to the charge of bragging, or to the sin of betraying his trust; and
at last being overcome by our prayers he thus began.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
<pb n="714"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the question of Abbot Moses, who asked what was the goal and what the end of the monk.</head>
<p>All the arts and sciences, said he, have some goal or mark; and end or aim of their own,
on which the diligent pursuer of each art has his eye, and so endures all sorts of toils and
dangers and losses, cheerfully and with equanimity, e.g., the farmer, shunning neither at
one time the scorching heat of the sun, nor at another the frost and cold, cleaves the earth
unweariedly, and again and again subjects the clods of his field to his ploughshare, while he
keeps before him his goal; viz., by diligent labour to break it up small like fine sand, and to
clear it of all briers, and free it from all weeds, as he believes that in no other way can he
gain his ultimate end, which is to secure a good harvest, and a large crop; on which he can
either live himself free from care, or can increase his possessions. Again, when his barn is
well stocked he is quite ready to empty it, and with incessant labour to commit the seed to
the crumbling furrow, thinking nothing of the present lessening of his stores in view of the
future harvest. Those men too who are engaged in mercantile pursuits, have no dread of
the uncertainties and chances of the ocean, and fear no risks, while an eager hope urges
them forward to their aim of gain. Moreover those who are inflamed with the ambition of
military life, while they look forward to their aim of honours and power take no notice of
danger and destruction in their wanderings, and are not crushed by present losses and wars,
while they are eager to obtain the end of some honour held out to them. And our profession
too has its own goal and end, for which we undergo all sorts of toils not merely without
weariness but actually with delight; on account of which the want of food in fasting is no
trial to us, the weariness of our vigils becomes a delight; reading and constant meditation
on the Scriptures does not pall upon us; and further incessant toil, and self-denial, and the
privation of all things, and the horrors also of this vast desert have no terrors for us. And
doubtless for this it was that you yourselves despised the love of kinsfolk, and scorned your
fatherland, and the delights of this world, and passed through so many countries, in order
that you might come to us, plain and simple folk as we are, living in this wretched state in
the desert. Wherefore, said he, answer and tell me what is the goal and end, which incite
you to endure all these things so cheerfully.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="715"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of our reply.</head>
<p>And when he insisted on eliciting an opinion from us on this question, we replied that
we endured all this for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
<pb n="716"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of Abbot Moses’ question on the aforesaid statement.</head>
<p>To which he replied: Good, you have spoken cleverly of the (ultimate) end. But what
should be our (immediate) goal or mark, by constantly sticking close to which we can gain
our end, you ought first to know. And when we frankly confessed our ignorance, he proceeded:
The first thing, as I said, in all the arts and sciences is to have some goal, i.e., a mark
for the mind, and constant mental purpose, for unless a man keeps this before him with all
diligence and persistence, he will never succeed in arriving at the ultimate aim and the gain
which he desires. For, as I said, the farmer who has for his aim to live free from care and
with plenty, while his crops are springing has this as his immediate object and goal; viz., to
keep his field clear from all brambles, and weeds, and does not fancy that he can otherwise
ensure wealth and a peaceful end, unless he first secures by some plan of work and hope
that which he is anxious to obtain. The business man too does not lay aside the desire of
procuring wares, by means of which he may more profitably amass riches, because he would
desire gain to no purpose, unless he chose the road which leads to it: and those men who
are anxious to be decorated with the honours of this world, first make up their minds to
what duties and conditions they must devote themselves, that in the regular course of hope
they may succeed in gaining the honours they desire. And so the end of our way of life is
indeed the kingdom of God. But what is the (immediate) goal you must earnestly ask, for
if it is not in the same way discovered by us, we shall strive and wear ourselves out to no
purpose, because a man who is travelling in a wrong direction, has all the trouble and gets
none of the good of his journey. And when we stood gaping at this remark, the old man
proceeded: The end of our profession indeed, as I said, is the kingdom of God or the kingdom
of heaven: but the immediate aim or goal, is purity of heart, without which no one can gain
that end: fixing our gaze then steadily on this goal, as if on a definite mark, let us direct our
course as straight towards it as possible, and if our thoughts wander somewhat from this,
let us revert to our gaze upon it, and check them accurately as by a sure standard, which
will always bring back all our efforts to this one mark, and will show at once if our mind
has wandered ever so little from the direction marked out for it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
<pb n="717"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>A comparison with a man who is trying to hit a mark.</head>
<p>As those, whose business it is to use weapons of war, whenever they want to show their
skill in their art before a king of this world, try to shoot their arrows or darts into certain
small targets which have the prizes painted on them; for they know that they cannot in any
other way than by the line of their aim secure the end and the prize they hope for, which
they will only then enjoy when they have been able to hit the mark set before them; but if
it happens to be withdrawn from their sight, however much in their want of skill their aim
may vainly deviate from the straight path, yet they cannot perceive that they have strayed
from the direction of the intended straight line because they have no distinct mark to prove
the skilfulness of their aim, or to show up its badness: and therefore while they shoot their
missiles idly into space, they cannot see how they have gone wrong or how utterly at fault
they are, since no mark is their accuser, showing how far they have gone astray from the
right direction; nor can an unsteady look help them to correct and restore the straight line
enjoined on them. So then the end indeed which we have set before us is, as the Apostle
says, eternal life, as he declares, “having indeed your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal
life;”6 but the immediate goal is purity of heart, which he not unfairly terms “sanctification,”
without which the afore-mentioned end cannot be gained; as if he had said in other words,
having your immediate goal in purity of heart, but the end life eternal. Of which goal the
same blessed Apostle teaches us, and significantly uses the very term, i.e., σκοπός, saying as
follows, “Forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those that are
before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of the Lord:”7 which is more
clearly put in Greek κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω, i.e., “I press toward the mark,” as if he said, “With
this aim, with which I forget those things that are behind, i.e., the faults of earlier life, I strive
to reach as the end the heavenly prize.” Whatever then can help to guide us to this object;
viz., purity of heart, we must follow with all our might, but whatever hinders us from it, we
must shun as a dangerous and hurtful thing. For, for this we do and endure all things, for
this we make light of our kinsfolk, our country, honours, riches, the delights of this world,
and all kinds of pleasures, namely in order that we may retain a lasting purity of heart. And
so when this object is set before us, we shall always direct our actions and thoughts straight
towards the attainment of it; for if it be not constantly fixed before our eyes, it will not only
make all our toils vain and useless, and force them to be endured to no purpose and without
any reward, but it will also excite all kinds of thoughts opposed to one another. For the
mind, which has no fixed point to which it may return, and on which it may chiefly fasten,
<note type="footnote">6 Rom. vi. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">7 Phil. iii. 13, 14.</note>

<pb n="718"/>
is sure to rove about from hour to hour and minute to minute in all sorts of wandering
thoughts, and from those things which come to it from outside, to be constantly changed
into that state which first offers itself to it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="719"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of those who in renouncing the world, aim at perfection without love.</head>
<p>For hence it arises that in the case of some who have despised the greatest possessions
of this world, and not only large sums of gold and silver, but also large properties, we have
seen them afterwards disturbed and excited over a knife, or pencil, or pin, or pen. Whereas
if they kept their gaze steadily fixed out of a pure heart they would certainly never allow
such a thing to happen for trifles, while in order that they might not suffer it in the case of
great and precious riches they chose rather to renounce them altogether. For often too some
guard their books so jealously that they will not allow them to be even slightly moved or
touched by any one else, and from this fact they meet with occasions of impatience and
death, which give them warning of the need of acquiring the requisite patience and love;
and when they have given up all their wealth for the love of Christ, yet as they preserve their
former disposition in the matter of trifles, and are sometimes quickly upset about them,
they become in all points barren and unfruitful, as those who are without the charity of
which the Apostle speaks: and this the blessed Apostle foresaw in spirit, and “though,” says
he, “I give all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing.”8 And from this it clearly follows that perfection is not arrived
at simply by self-denial, and the giving up of all our goods, and the casting away of
honours, unless there is that charity, the details of which the Apostle describes, which consists
in purity of heart alone. For “not to be envious,” “not to be puffed up, not to be angry, not
to do any wrong, not to seek one’s own, not to rejoice in iniquity, not to think evil” etc.,
what is all this except ever to offer to God a perfect and clean heart, and to keep it free from
all disturbances?</p>
<note type="footnote">8 1 Cor. xiii. 3.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7"> 
<pb n="720"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How peace of mind should be sought.</head>
<p>Everything should be done and sought after by us for the sake of this. For this we must
seek for solitude, for this we know that we ought to submit to fastings, vigils, toils, bodily
nakedness, reading, and all other virtues that through them we may be enabled to prepare
our heart and to keep it unharmed by all evil passions, and resting on these steps to mount
to the perfection of charity, and with regard to these observances, if by accident we have
been employed in some good and useful occupation and have been unable to carry out our
customary discipline, we should not be overcome by vexation or anger, or passion, with the
object of overcoming which, we were going to do that which we have omitted. For the gain
from fasting will not balance the loss from anger, nor is the profit from reading so great as
the harm which results from despising a brother. Those things which are of secondary importance,
such as fastings, vigils, withdrawal from the world, meditation on Scripture, we
ought to practise with a view to our main object, i.e., purity of heart, which is charity, and
we ought not on their account to drive away this main virtue, for as long as it is still found
in us intact and unharmed, we shall not be hurt if any of the things which are of secondary
importance are necessarily omitted; since it will not be of the slightest use to have done
everything, if this main reason of which we have spoken be removed, for the sake of which
everything is to be done. For on this account one is anxious to secure and provide for one’s
self the implements for any branch of work, not simply to possess them to no purpose, nor
as if one made the profit and advantage, which is looked for from them, to consist in the
bare fact of possession but that by using them, one may effectually secure practical knowledge
and the end of that particular art of which they are auxiliaries. Therefore fastings, vigils,
meditation on the Scriptures, self-denial, and the abnegation of all possessions are not perfection,
but aids to perfection: because the end of that science does not lie in these, but by
means of these we arrive at the end. He then will practise these exercises to no purpose, who
is contented with these as if they were the highest good, and has fixed the purpose of his
heart simply on them, and does not extend his efforts towards reaching the end, on account
of which these should be sought: for he possesses indeed the implements of his art, but is
ignorant of the end, in which all that is valuable resides. Whatever then can disturb that
purity and peace of mind—even though it may seem useful and valuable—should be shunned
as really hurtful, for by this rule we shall succeed in escaping harm from mistakes and
vagaries, and make straight for the desired end and reach it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
<pb n="721"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the main effort towards the contemplation of things and an illustration from the case of
Martha and Mary.</head>
<p>This then should be our main effort: and this steadfast purpose of heart we should
constantly aspire after; viz., that the soul may ever cleave to God and to heavenly things.
Whatever is alien to this, however great it may be, should be given the second place, or even
treated as of no consequence, or perhaps as hurtful. We have an excellent illustration of this
state of mind and condition in the gospel in the case of Martha and Mary: for when Martha
was performing a service that was certainly a sacred one, since she was ministering to the
Lord and His disciples, and Mary being intent only on spiritual instruction was clinging
close to the feet of Jesus which she kissed and anointed with the ointment of a good confession,
she is shown by the Lord to have chosen the better part, and one which should not be
taken away from her: for when Martha was toiling with pious care, and was cumbered about
her service, seeing that of herself alone she was insufficient for such service she asks for the
help of her sister from the Lord, saying: “Carest Thou not that my sister has left me to serve
alone: bid her therefore that she help me”—certainly it was to no unworthy work, but to a
praiseworthy service that she summoned her: and yet what does she hear from the Lord?
“Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: but few things are
needful, or only one. Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from
her.”9 You see then that the Lord makes the chief good consist in meditation; i.e., in divine
contemplation: whence we see that all other virtues should be put in the second place, even
though we admit that they are necessary, and useful, and excellent, because they are all
performed for the sake of this one thing. For when the Lord says: “Thou art careful and
troubled about many things, but few things are needful or only one,” He makes the chief
good consist not in practical work however praiseworthy and rich in fruits it may be, but
in contemplation of Him, which indeed is simple and “but one”; declaring that “few things”
are needful for perfect bliss, i.e., that contemplation which is first secured by reflecting on
a few saints: from the contemplation of whom, he who has made some progress rises and
attains by God’s help to that which is termed “one thing,” i.e., the consideration of God
alone, so as to get beyond those actions and services of Saints, and feed on the beauty and
knowledge of God alone. “Mary” therefore “chose the good part, which shall not be taken
away from her.” And this must be more carefully considered. For when He says that Mary
<note type="footnote">9 S. Luke x. 40–42. The reading which Cassian here follows is found in 􀀀BC,2 but has not much Latin authority.
It is however followed by Jerome Ep: ad Eustochium, xxii. 24, though the Vulgate has simply Porro unum est
necessarium. For Mary as the type of the contemplative life, and Martha of the practical, compare S. Gregory
the Great. Moralia VI. c. xxviii.</note>

<pb n="722"/>
chose the good part, although He says nothing of Martha, and certainly does not appear to
blame her, yet in praising the one, He implies that the other is inferior. Again when He says
“which shall not be taken away from her,” He shows that from the other her portion can be
taken away (for a bodily ministry cannot last forever with a man), but teaches that this one’s
desire can never have an end.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>A question how it is that the practice of virtue cannot remain with a man.</head>
<p>To which we, being deeply moved, replied what then? will the effort of fasting, diligence
in reading, works of mercy, justice, piety, and kindness, be taken away from us, and not
continue with the doers of them, especially since the Lord Himself promises the reward of
the kingdom of heaven to these works, when He says: “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. For I was an hungred,
and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink:” etc.10 How then shall these
works be taken away, which admit the doers of them into the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<head>The answer that not the reward, but the doing of them will come to an end.</head>
<p>Moses. I did not say that the reward for a good work would be taken away, as the Lord
Himself says: “Whosoever shall give to one of the least of these, a cup of cold water only in
the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward:”11 but I maintain
that the doing of a thing, which either bodily necessity, or the onslaught of the flesh, or the
inequalities of this world, compel to be done, will be taken away. For diligence in reading,
and self-denial in fasting, are usefully practised for purifying the heart and chastening the
flesh in this life only, as long as “the flesh lusteth against the spirit,”12 and sometimes we
see that even in this life they are taken away from those men who are worn out with excessive
toil, or bodily infirmity or old age, and cannot be practised by them. How much more then
will they come to an end hereafter, when “this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,”13
and the body which is now “a natural body” shall have risen “a spiritual body”14 and the
flesh shall have begun to be such that it no longer lusts against the spirit? And of this the
blessed Apostle also clearly speaks, when he says that “bodily exercise is profitable for a
little: but godliness” (by which he certainly means love) “is profitable for all things, having
the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.”15 This clearly shows that
what is said to be useful for a little, is not to be practised for all time, and cannot possibly
by itself alone confer the highest state of perfection on the man who slaves at it. For the term
“for a little” may mean either of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time,
because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this life and in the world
to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the profit which results from exercising the flesh,
because bodily austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the actual
perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come:
and therefore we deem that the practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without
them we cannot climb the heights of love. For what you call works of religion and mercy
are needful in this life while these inequalities and differences of conditions still prevail; but
even here we should not look for them to be performed, unless such a large proportion of
poor, needy, and sick folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness of men;
viz., of those who have grasped and kept for their own use (without however using them)
those things which were granted to all by the Creator of all alike. As long then as this inequal-

ity lasts in this world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that practises
it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal inheritance: but it
will come to an end in the life to come, where equality will reign, when there will be no
longer inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from
these manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of heavenly things in
continual purity of heart: to which those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to
knowledge and purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their might
and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which they
are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when they come to that promise
of the Lord the Saviour, which says “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.”16</p>

<head>On the abiding character of love.</head>
<p>And why do you wonder that those duties enumerated above will cease, when the holy
Apostle tells us that even the higher gifts of the Holy Spirit will pass away: and points out
that charity alone will abide without end, saying “whether there be prophecies, they shall
fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease: whether there be knowledge, it will come to
an end,” but of this he says “Charity never faileth.” For all gifts are given for a time as use
and need require, but when the dispensation is ended they will without doubt presently pass
away: but love will never be destroyed. For not only does it work usefully in us in this world;
but also in that to come, when the burden of bodily needs is cast off, it will continue in far
greater vigour and excellence, and will never be weakened by any defect, but by means of
its perpetual incorruption will cling to God more intently and earnestly.17</p>

<p>A question on perseverance in spiritual contemplation.</p>
<p>Germanus. Who then, while he is burdened with our frail flesh, can be always so intent
on this contemplation, as never to think about the arrival of a brother, or visiting the sick,
or manual labour, or at least about showing kindness to strangers and visitors? And lastly,
who is not interrupted by providing for the body, and looking after it? Or how and in what
way can the mind cling to the invisible and incomprehensible God, this we should like to
learn.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The answer concerning the direction of the heart towards and concerning the kingdom of God
and the kingdom of the devil.</head>
<p>Moses. To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation
on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be
aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should
ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve
and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen
away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering
that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our
gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and
recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the
inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled from this, and sins no longer
reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God is founded in us, as the Evangelist says “The
kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for
verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.”18 But nothing else can be
“within you,” but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue,
through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this
kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says “For the kingdom of God is not
meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”19 And so if the
kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace
and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on
the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh
death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens
the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting
up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live
on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual
and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true blessedness
as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say,
is really so, not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes
the character and condition of that world: “Behold,” says He, “I create new heavens
and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind. But
ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.”20 And again “joy and gladness

<note type="footnote">19 Rom. xiv. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">20 Is. lxv. 17, 18.</note>

<pb n="729"/>
shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall be month after
month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.”21 And again: “they shall obtain joy and gladness; and
sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”22 And if you want to know more definitely about that
life and the city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem
herself: “I will make,” says He, “thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness.
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders.
And salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no
more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the
Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down,
neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the
days of thy mourning shall be ended:”23 and therefore the holy Apostle does not say generally
or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically
that joy alone which is “in the Holy Ghost.”24 For he was perfectly aware of another detestable
joy, of which we hear “the world shall rejoice,”25 and “woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall
mourn.”26 In fact the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that the
heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, “Be
thou over five cities, and thou over ten;”27 and this which is said to the disciples: “Ye shall
sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:”28 or that the heavens themselves
shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when “all things are subdued unto Him,” and God
begins to be “all in all:”29 or else that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Of the continuance of the soul.</head>
<p>Wherefore every one while still existing in this body should already be aware that he
must be committed to that state and office, of which he made himself a sharer and an adherent
while in this life, nor should he doubt that in that eternal world he will be partner of
him, whose servant and minister he chose to make himself here: according to that saying
of our Lord which says “If any man serve Me, let him follow Me, and where I am, there shall
My servant also be.”30 For as the kingdom of the devil is gained by consenting to sin, so the
kingdom of God is attained by the practice of virtue in purity of heart and spiritual knowledge.
But where the kingdom of God is, there most certainly eternal life is enjoyed, and
where the kingdom of the devil is, there without doubt is death and the grave. And the man
who is in this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the prophet
which tells us: “The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither all they that go down into the
grave (doubtless of sin). But we,” says he, “who live (not forsooth to sin nor to this world
but to God) will bless the Lord, from this time forth for evermore: for in death no man remembereth
God: but in the grave (of sin) who will confess to the Lord?”31 i.e., no one will.
For no man even though he were to call himself a Christian a thousand times over, or a
monk, confesses God when he is sinning: no man who allows those things which the Lord
hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself with any truth the servant of Him, whose commands
he scorns with obstinate rashness: in which death the blessed Apostle declares that
the widow is involved, who gives herself to pleasure, saying “a widow who giveth herself to
pleasure is dead while she liveth.”32 There are then many who while still living in this body
are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God; and on the contrary there are many who
though they are dead in the body yet bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to
this: “O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:”33 and “every spirit shall
praise the Lord.”34 And in the Apocalypse the souls of them that are slain are not only said
to praise God but to address Him also.35 In the gospel too the Lord says with still greater
clearness to the Sadducees: “Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when He said
to you: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. He is not the
God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.”36 Of whom also the Apostle

says: “wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them
a city.”37 For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable
of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives
clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham’s bosom, the
other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.38 But if you care too to understand
the words spoken to the thief “To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,”39 what do they
clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but
also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their
actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had
known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived
of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which
was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shun with the utmost horror,
that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be
found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate “Verily,
I say unto you to-day,” and making a stop apply “thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,” in
such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed
from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,40 as they do not understand
what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was
hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: “No man hath ascended
into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in
heaven:”41 by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived
of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and
fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved
for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into
nothing after their departure from this life:42 but that they live a more real life, and are still
more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture

and was dissolved (dissolvi) with the body and that it would at the end of the world be revived and rise again.
These were the heretics of whom Eusebius speaks in his Eccl. History Book VI. c. xxxvii., where he tells us that
they were successfully refuted by Origen. It is probably to this last error that Cassian is here making allusion.</note>

proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul
itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity,
even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed
Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,43 will, when the burden of the body
with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains
in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by
participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that
when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it
will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer
condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is
true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might
be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: “I desire to be dissolved and to be
with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:”
and therefore “we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and
present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing
to Him;”44 and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is
distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation
and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more
clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: “But
ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to
an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in
heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.”45 Of which spirits he speaks in another
passage, “Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall
we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?”46</p>

<head>How we must meditate on God.</head>
<p>But the contemplation of God is gained in a variety of ways. For we not only discover
God by admiring His incomprehensible essence, a thing which still lies hid in the hope of
the promise, but we see Him through the greatness of His creation, and the consideration
of His justice, and the aid of His daily providence: when with pure minds we contemplate
what He has done with His saints in every generation, when with trembling heart we admire
His power with which He governs, directs, and rules all things, or the vastness of His
knowledge, and that eye of His from which no secrets of the heart can lie hid, when we
consider the sand of the sea, and the number of the waves measured by Him and known to
Him, when in our wonder we think that the drops of rain, the days and hours of the ages,
and all things past and future are present to His knowledge; when we gaze in unbounded
admiration on that ineffable mercy of His, which with unwearied patience endures countless
sins which are every moment being committed under His very eyes, or the call with which
from no antecedent merits of ours, but by the free grace of His pity He receives us; or again
the numberless opportunities of salvation which He grants to those whom He is going to
adopt—that He made us be born in such a way as that from our very cradles His grace and
the knowledge of His law might be given to us, that He Himself, overcoming our enemy in
us simply for the pleasure of His good will, rewards us with eternal bliss and everlasting rewards,
when lastly He undertook the dispensation of His Incarnation for our salvation, and
extended the marvels of His sacraments47 to all nations. But there are numberless other
considerations of this sort, which arise in our minds according to the character of our life
and the purity of our heart, by which God is either seen by pure eyes or embraced: which
considerations certainly no one will preserve lastingly, if anything of carnal affections still
survives in him, because “thou canst not,” saith the Lord, “see My face: for no man shall see
Me and live;”48 viz., to this world and to earthly affections.</p>

<head>A question on the changing character of the thoughts.</head>
<p>Germanus. How is it then, that even against our will, aye and without our knowledge

drive them away, but even to grasp and seize them? Can then a mind sometimes be found
free from them, and never attacked by illusions of this kind?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>The answer what the mind can and what it cannot do with regard to the state of its thoughts.</head>
<p>Moses. It is impossible for the mind not to be approached by thoughts, but it is in the
power of every earnest man either to admit them or to reject them. As then their rising up
does not entirely depend on ourselves, so the rejection or admission of them lies in our own
power. But because we said that it is impossible for the mind not to be approached by
thoughts, you must not lay everything to the charge of the assault, or to those spirits who
strive to instil them into us, else there would not remain any free will in man, nor would
efforts for our improvement be in our power: but it is, I say, to a great extent in our power
to improve the character of our thoughts and to let either holy and spiritual thoughts or
earthly ones grow up in our hearts. For for this purpose frequent reading and continual
meditation on the Scriptures is employed that from thence an opportunity for spiritual recollection
may be given to us, therefore the frequent singing of Psalms is used, that thence
constant feelings of compunction may be provided, and earnest vigils and fasts and prayers,
that the mind may be brought low and not mind earthly things, but contemplate things celestial,
for if these things are dropped and carelessness creeps on us, the mind being hardened
with the foulness of sin is sure to incline in a carnal direction and fall away.</p>

<head>Comparison of a soul and a millstone.</head>
<p>And this movement of the heart is not unsuitably illustrated by the comparison of a
mill wheel, which the headlong rush of water whirls round, with revolving impetus, and
which can never stop its work so long as it is driven round by the action of the water: but it
is in the power of the man who directs it, to decide whether he will have wheat or barley or
darnel ground by it. That certainly must be crushed by it which is put into it by the man
who has charge of that business. So then the mind also through the trials of the present life
is driven about by the torrents of temptations pouring in upon it from all sides, and cannot
be free from the flow of thoughts: but the character of the thoughts which it should either
throw off or admit for itself, it will provide by the efforts of its own earnestness and diligence:
for if, as we said, we constantly recur to meditation on the Holy Scriptures and raise our
memory towards the recollection of spiritual things and the desire of perfection and the
hope of future bliss, spiritual thoughts are sure to rise from this, and cause the mind to dwell
on those things on which we have been meditating. But if we are overcome by sloth or
carelessness and spend our time in idle gossip, or are entangled in the cares of this world
and unnecessary anxieties, the result will be that a sort of species of tares will spring up, and
afford an injurious occupation for our hearts, and as our Lord and Saviour says, wherever
the treasure of our works or purpose may be, there also our heart is sure to continue.49</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>Of the three origins of our thoughts.</head>
<p>Above all we ought at least to know that there are three origins of our thoughts, i.e.,
from God, from the devil, and from ourselves. They come from God when He vouchsafes
to visit us with the illumination of the Holy Ghost, lifting us up to a higher state of progress,
and where we have made but little progress, or through acting slothfully have been overcome,
He chastens us with most salutary compunction, or when He discloses to us heavenly mysteries,
or turns our purpose and will to better actions, as in the case where the king Ahasuerus,
being chastened by the Lord, was prompted to ask for the books of the annals, by which he
was reminded of the good deeds of Mordecai, and promoted him to a position of the highest
honour and at once recalled his most cruel sentence concerning the slaughter of the Jews.50
Or when the prophet says: “I will hearken what the Lord God will say in me.”51 Another
too tells us “And an angel spoke, and said in me,”52 or when the Son of God promised that
He would come with His Father, and make His abode in us,53 and “It is not ye that speak,
but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”54 And the chosen vessel: “Ye seek a
proof of Christ that speaketh in me.”55 But a whole range of thoughts springs from the
devil, when he endeavours to destroy us either by the pleasures of sin or by secret attacks,
in his crafty wiles deceitfully showing us evil as good, and transforming himself into an angel
of light to us:56 as when the evangelist tells us: “And when supper was ended, when the
devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray”57 the Lord:
and again also “after the sop,” he says, “Satan entered into him.”58 Peter also says to
Ananias: “Why hath Satan tempted thine heart, to lie to the Holy Ghost?”59 And that which
we read in the gospel much earlier as predicted by Ecclesiastes: “If the spirit of the ruler rise
up against thee, leave not thy place.”60 That too which is said to God against Ahab in the
third book of Kings, in the character of an unclean spirit: “I will go forth and will be a lying

of nature we recollect what we are doing or have done or have heard. Of which the blessed
David speaks: “I thought upon the ancient days, and had in mind the years from of old, and
I meditated, by night I exercised myself with my heart, and searched out my spirit.”62 And
again: “the Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vain:”63 and “the thoughts of
the righteous are judgments.”64 In the gospel too the Lord says to the Pharisees: “why do

in the first instance, that we may be able to consider how we ought to yield ourselves to
them in accordance with the desert of those who suggest them so that we may, as the Lord’s
command bids us, become good money-changers,66 whose highest skill and whose training
is to test what is perfectly pure gold and what is commonly termed tested,67 or what is not
sufficiently purified in the fire; and also with unerring skill not to be taken in by a common
brass denarius, if by being coloured with bright gold it is made like some coin of great value;
and not only shrewdly to recognize coins stamped with the heads of usurpers, but with a
still shrewder skill to detect those which have the image of the right king, but are not properly
made, and lastly to be careful by the test of the balance to see that they are not under proper
weight. All of which things the gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought
also to observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and
whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to see
whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether
it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy
and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostle’s
advice, “Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God.”68 But by
this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks are enticed
by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of philosophers, which at the first blush, owing
to some pious meanings not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold
their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor and miserable
for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper: either bringing them back to
the bustle of this world, or enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits:
a thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of Nun,69

when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was
smitten with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we should be
careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives
us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon
our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation he
perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it
specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, “For He shall give
His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they
shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,”70 by a skilful assumption
on his part giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them
into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as to offer to us the image
and face of an usurper under cover of the gold colour which may deceive us. Or whether
he tries to cheat us with counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should
be taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads under the form
of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long
vigils, or inordinate prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he
persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious visits, by
which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy
of its friendly peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and
cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably entangled in
snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious occupations and cares. Or else
when he incites a man to desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying
many people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility
and strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed to our salvation
and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily
deceive those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king,
because they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have the right to
coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office
for receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off
upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious harm. And even although they seem
to be useful and needful at first, yet if afterwards they begin to interfere with the soundness
of our profession, and as it were to weaken in some sense the whole body of our purpose,
it is well that they should be cut off and cast away from us like a member which may be necessary,
but yet offends us and which seems to perform the office of the right hand or foot.
For it is better, without one member of a command, i.e., its working or result, to continue
safe and sound in other parts, and to enter as weak into the kingdom of heaven rather than

with the whole mass of commands to fall into some error which by an evil custom separates
us from our strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads to such loss,
that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but will cause all our past fruits and
the whole body of our work to be burnt in hell fire.71 Of which kind of illusions it is well
said in the Proverbs: “There are ways which seem to be right to a man, but their latter end
will come into the depths of hell,”72 and again “An evil man is harmful when he attaches
himself to a good man,”73 i.e., the devil deceives when he is covered with an appearance of
sanctity: “but he hates the sound of the watchman,”74 i.e., the power of discretion which
comes from the words and warnings of the fathers.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of the illusion of Abbot John.</head>
<p>In this manner we have heard that Abbot John who lived at Lycon,75 was recently deceived.
For when his body was exhausted and failing as he had put off taking food during a
fast of two days, on the third day while he was on his way to take some refreshment the
devil came in the shape of a filthy Ethiopian, and falling at his feet, cried “Pardon me because
I appointed this labour for you.” And so that great man, who was so perfect in the matter
of discretion, understood that under pretence of an abstinence practised unsuitably, he was
deceived by the craft of the devil, and engaged in a fast of such a character as to affect his
worn out body with a weariness that was unnecessary, indeed that was harmful to the spirit;
as he was deceived by a counterfeit coin, and, while he paid respect to the image of the true
king upon it, was not sufficiently alive to the question whether it was rightly cut and stamped.
But the last duty of this “good money-changer,” which, as we mentioned before, concerns
the examination of the weight, will be fulfilled, if whenever our thoughts suggest that anything
is to be done, we scrupulously think it over, and, laying it in the scales of our breast, weigh
it with the most exact balance, whether it be full of good for all, or heavy with the fear of
God: or entire and sound in meaning; or whether it be light with human display or some
conceit of novelty, or whether the pride of foolish vain glory has not diminished or lessened
the weight of its merit. And so straightway weighing them in the public balance, i.e., testing
them by the acts and proofs of the Apostles and Prophets let us hold them as it were entire
and perfect and of full weight, or else with all care and diligence reject them as imperfect
and counterfeit, and of insufficient weight.</p>

<head>Of the fourfold method of discrimination.</head>
<p>This power of discriminating will then be necessary for us in the fourfold manner of
which we have spoken; viz., first that the material does not escape our notice whether it be
of true or of painted gold: secondly, that those thoughts which falsely promise works of religion
should be rejected by us as forged and counterfeit coins, as they are those which are
not rightly stamped, and which bear an untrue image of the king; and that we may be able
in the same way to detect those which in the case of the precious gold of Scripture, by means
of a false and heretical meaning, show the image not of the true king but of an usurper; and
that we refuse those whose weight and value the rust of vanity has depreciated and not allowed
to pass in the scales of the fathers, as coins that are too light, and are false and weigh
too little; so that we may not incur that which we are warned by the Lord’s command to
avoid with all our power, and lose the value and reward of all our labour. “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on the earth, where rust and moth corrupt and where thieves break
through and steal.”76 For whenever we do anything with a view to human glory we know
that we are, as the Lord says, laying up for ourselves treasure on earth, and that consequently
being as it were hidden in the ground and buried in the earth it must be destroyed by sundry
demons or consumed by the biting rust of vain glory, or devoured by the moths of pride so
as to contribute nothing to the use and profits of the man who has hidden it. We should
then constantly search all the inner chambers of our hearts, and trace out the footsteps of
whatever enters into them with the closest investigation lest haply some beast, if I may say
so, relating to the understanding, either lion or dragon, passing through has furtively left
the dangerous marks of his track, which will show to others the way of access into the secret
recesses of the heart, owing to a carelessness about our thoughts. And so daily and hourly
turning up the ground of our heart with the gospel plough, i.e., the constant recollection of
the Lord’s cross, we shall manage to stamp out or extirpate from our hearts the lairs of
noxious beasts and the lurking places of poisonous serpents.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>Of the discourse of the teacher in regard to the merits of his hearers.</head>
<p>At this the old man seeing that we were astonished, and inflamed at the words of his
discourse with an insatiable desire, stopped his speech for a little in consequence of our
admiration and earnestness, and presently added: Since your zeal, my sons, has led to so
long a discussion, and a sort of fire supplies keener zest to our conference in proportion to
your earnestness, as from this very thing I can clearly see that you are truly thirsting after
teaching about perfection, I want still to say something to you on the excellence of discrimination
and grace which rules and holds the field among all virtues, and not merely to prove
its value and usefulness by daily instances of it, but also from former deliberations and
opinions of the fathers. For I remember that frequently when men were asking me with
sighs and tears for a discourse of this kind, and I myself was anxious to give them some
teaching I could not possibly manage it, and not merely my thoughts but even my very
power of speech failed me so that I could not find how to send them away with even some
slight consolation. And by these signs we clearly see that the grace of the Lord inspires the
speakers with words according to the deserts and zeal of the hearers. And because the very
short night which is before us does not allow me to finish the discourse, let us the rather
give it up to bodily rest, in which the whole of it will have to be spent, if a reasonable portion
is refused, and let us reserve the complete scheme of the discourse for unbroken consideration
on a future day or night. For it is right for the best counsellors on discretion to show the
diligence of their minds in the first place in this, and to prove whether they are or can be
possessors of it by this evidence and patience, so that in treating of that virtue which is the
mother of moderation they may by no means fall into the vice which is opposite to it; viz.,
that of undue length, by their actions and deeds destroying the force of the system and
nature which they recommend in word. In regard then to this most excellent discretion, on
which we still propose to inquire, so far as the Lord gives us power, it may in the first instance
be a good thing, when we are disputing about its excellence and the moderation which we
know exists in it as the first of virtues, not to allow ourselves to exceed the due limit of the
discussion and of our time.</p>
<p>And so with this the blessed Moses put a stop to our talk, and urged us, eager though
we were and hanging on his lips, to go off to bed for a little, advising us to lie down on the
same mats on which we were sitting, and to put our bundles77 under our heads instead of
pillows, as these being tied evenly to thicker leaves of papyrus collected in long and slender

bundles, six feet apart, at one time provide the brethren when sitting at service with a very
low seat instead of a footstool, at another time being put under their necks when they go to
bed furnish a support for their heads, that is not too hard, but comfortable and just right.
For which uses of the monks these things are considered especially fit and suitable not only
because they are somewhat soft, and prepared at little cost of money and labour, as the papyrus
grows everywhere along the banks of the Nile, but also because they are of a convenient
stuff and light enough to be removed or fetched as need may require. And so at last at the
bidding of the old man we settled ourselves down to sleep in deep stillness, both excited
with delight at the conference we had held, and also buoyed up with hope of the promised
discussion.</p>

<head>II. SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT MOSES.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="747"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Abbot Moses’ introduction on the grace of discretion.</head>
<p>And so when we had enjoyed our morning sleep, when to our delight the dawn of light
again shone upon us, and we had begun to ask once more for his promised talk, the blessed
Moses thus began: As I see you inflamed with such an eager desire, that I do not believe that
that very short interval of quiet which I wanted to subtract from our spiritual conference
and devote to bodily rest, has been of any use for the repose of your bodies, on me too a
greater anxiety presses when I take note of your zeal. For I must give the greater care and
devotion in paying my debt, in proportion as I see that you ask for it the more earnestly,
according to that saying: “When thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is
put before thee, and put forth thine hand, knowing that thou oughtest to prepare such
things.”78 Wherefore as we are going to speak of the excellent quality of discretion and the
virtue of it, on which subject our discourse of last night had entered at the termination of
our discussion, we think it desirable first to establish its excellence by the opinions of the
fathers, that when it has been shown what our predecessors thought and said about it, then
we may bring forward some ancient and modern shipwrecks and mischances of various
people, who were destroyed and hopelessly ruined because they paid but little attention to
it, and then as well as we can we must treat of its advantages and uses: after a discussion of
which we shall know better how we ought to seek after it and practise it, by the consideration
of the importance of its value and grace. For it is no ordinary virtue nor one which can be
freely gained by merely human efforts, unless they are aided by the Divine blessing, for we
read that this is also reckoned among the noblest gifts of the Spirit by the Apostle: “To one
is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit,”
and shortly after, “to another the discerning of spirits.” Then after the complete catalogue
of spiritual gifts he subjoins: “But all these worketh one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as He will.”79 You see then that the gift of discretion is no earthly thing
and no slight matter, but the greatest prize of divine grace. And unless a monk has pursued
it with all zeal, and secured a power of discerning with unerring judgment the spirits that
rise up in him, he is sure to go wrong, as if in the darkness of night and dense blackness,
and not merely to fall down dangerous pits and precipices, but also to make frequent mistakes
in matters that are plain and straightforward.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>What discretion alone can give a monk; and a discourse of the blessed Antony on this subject.</head>
<p>And so I remember that while I was still a boy, in the region of Thebaid, where the
blessed Antony lived,80 the elders came to him to inquire about perfection: and though the
conference lasted from evening till morning, the greatest part of the night was taken up with
this question. For it was discussed at great length what virtue or observance could preserve
a monk always unharmed by the snares and deceits of the devil, and carry him forward on
a sure and right path, and with firm step to the heights of perfection. And when each one
gave his opinion according to the bent of his own mind, and some made it consist in zeal
in fasting and vigils, because a soul that has been brought low by these, and so obtained
purity of heart and body will be the more easily united to God, others in despising all things,
as, if the mind were utterly deprived of them, it would come the more freely to God, as if
henceforth there were no snares to entangle it: others thought that withdrawal from the
world was the thing needful, i.e., solitude and the secrecy of the hermit’s life; living in which
a man may more readily commune with God, and cling more especially to Him; others laid
down that the duties of charity, i.e., of kindness should be practised, because the Lord in
the gospel promised more especially to give the kingdom to these; when He said “Come ye
blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world. For I was an hungred and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink,
etc.:”81 and when in this fashion they declared that by means of different virtues a more
certain approach to God could be secured, and the greater part of the night had been spent
in this discussion, then at last the blessed Antony spoke and said: All these things which
you have mentioned are indeed needful, and helpful to those who are thirsting for God, and
desirous to approach Him. But countless accidents and the experience of many people will
not allow us to make the most important of gifts consist in them. For often when men are
most strict in fasting or in vigils, and nobly withdraw into solitude, and aim at depriving
themselves of all their goods so absolutely that they do not suffer even a day’s allowance of
food or a single penny to remain to them, and when they fulfil all the duties of kindness
with the utmost devotion, yet still we have seen them suddenly deceived, so that they could
not bring the work they had entered upon to a suitable close, but brought their exalted fervour
and praiseworthy manner of life to a terrible end. Wherefore we shall be able clearly to recognize
what it is which mainly leads to God, if we trace out with greater care the reason of
their downfall and deception. For when the works of the above mentioned virtues were
abounding in them, discretion alone was wanting, and allowed them not to continue even
<note type="footnote">80 Cf. the note on the Institutes, V. iv.</note>
<note type="footnote">81 S. Matt. xxv. 35, 36.</note>

<pb n="749"/>
to the end. Nor can any other reason for their falling off be discovered except that as they
were not sufficiently instructed by their elders they could not obtain judgment and discretion,
which passing by excess on either side, teaches a monk always to walk along the royal road,
and does not suffer him to be puffed up on the right hand of virtue, i.e., from excess of zeal
to transgress the bounds of due moderation in foolish presumption, nor allows him to be
enamoured of slackness and turn aside to the vices on the left hand, i.e., under pretext of
controlling the body, to grow slack with the opposite spirit of luke-warmness. For this is
discretion, which is termed in the gospel the “eye,” “and light of the body,” according to the
Saviour’s saying: “The light of thy body is thine eye: but if thine eye be single, thy whole
body will be full of light, but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be full of darkness:”82
because as it discerns all the thoughts and actions of men, it sees and overlooks all things
which should be done. But if in any man this is “evil,” i.e., not fortified by sound judgment
and knowledge, or deceived by some error and presumption, it will make our whole body
“full of darkness,” i.e., it will darken all our mental vision and our actions, as they will be
involved in the darkness of vices and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, “if the light
which is in thee be darkness, how great will that darkness be!”83 For no one can doubt that
when the judgment of our heart goes wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance,
our thoughts and deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved
in the darkness of still greater sins.</p>

<head>Of the error of Saul and of Ahab, by which they were deceived through lack of discretion.</head>
<p>Lastly, the man who in the judgment of God was the first to be worthy of the kingdom
of His people Israel, because he was lacking in this “eye” of discretion, was, as if his whole
body were full of darkness, actually cast down from the kingdom while, being deceived by
the darkness of this “light,” and in error, he imagined that his own offerings were more acceptable
to God than obedience to the command of Samuel, and met with an occasion of
falling in that very matter in which he had hoped to propitiate the Divine Majesty.84 And
ignorance, I say, of this discretion led Ahab the king of Israel after a triumph and splendid
victory which had been granted to him by the favour of God to fancy that mercy on his part
was better than the stern execution of the divine command, and, as it seemed to him, a cruel
rule: and moved by this consideration, while he desired to temper a bloody victory with
mercy, he was on account of his indiscriminating clemency rendered full of darkness in his
whole body, and condemned irreversibly to death.85</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>What is said of the value of discretion in Holy Scripture.</head>
<p>Such is discretion, which is not only the “light of the body,” but also called the sun by
the Apostle, as it said “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.”86 It is also called the
guidance of our life: as it said “Those who have no guidance, fall like leaves.”87 It is most
truly named counsel, without which the authority of Scripture allows us to do nothing, so
that we are not even permitted to take that spiritual “wine which maketh glad the heart of
man”88 without its regulating control: as it is said “Do everything with counsel, drink thy
wine with counsel,”89 and again “like a city that has its walls destroyed and is not fenced in,
so is a man who does anything without counsel.”90 And how injurious the absence of this
is to a monk, the illustration and figure in the passage quoted shows, by comparing it to a
city that is destroyed and without walls. Herein lies wisdom, herein lies intelligence and
understanding without which our inward house cannot be built, nor can spiritual riches be
gathered together, as it is said: “A house is built with wisdom, and again it is set up with
intelligence. With understanding the storehouses are filled with all precious riches and good
things.”91 This I say is “solid food,” which can only be taken by those who are full grown
and strong, as it is said: “But solid food is for full grown men, who by reason of use have
their senses exercised to discern good and evil.”92 And it is shown to be useful and necessary
for us, only in so far as it is in accordance with the word of God and its powers, as is said
“For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and
reaching even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:”93 and by this it is clearly shown that no
virtue can possibly be perfectly acquired or continue without the grace of discretion. And
so by the judgment of the blessed Antony as well as of all others it has been laid down that
it is discretion which leads a fearless monk by fixed stages to God, and preserves the virtues
mentioned above continually intact, by means of which one may ascend with less weariness
to the extreme summit of perfection, and without which even those who toil most willingly

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of the death of the old man Heron.</head>
<p>And to support this judgment delivered of old by the blessed Antony and the other
fathers by a modern instance, as we promised to do, remember what you lately saw happen
before your very eyes, I mean, how the old man Heron,94 only a very few days ago was cast
down by an illusion of the devil from the heights to the depths, a man whom we remember
to have lived for fifty years in this desert and to have preserved a strict continence with especial
severity, and who aimed at the secrecy of solitude with marvellous fervour beyond
all those who dwell here. By what device then or by what method was he deluded by the
deceiver after so many labours, and falling by a most grievous downfall struck with profound
grief all those who live in this desert? Was it not because, having too little of the virtue of
discretion he preferred to be guided by his own judgment rather than to obey the counsels
and conference of the brethren and the regulations of the elders? Since he ever practised
incessant abstinence and fasting with such severity, and persisted in the secrecy of solitude
and a monastic cell so constantly that not even the observance of the Easter festival could
ever persuade him to join in the feast with the brethren: when in accordance with the annual
observance, all the brethren remained in the church and he alone would not join them for
fear lest he might seem to relax in some degree from his purpose by taking only a little pulse.
And deceived by this presumption he received with the utmost reverence an angel of Satan
as an angel of light and with blind slavishness obeyed his commands and cast himself down
a well, so deep that the eye could not pierce its depths, nothing doubting of the promise of
the angel who had assured him that the merits of his virtues and labours were such that he
could not possibly run any risk. And that he might prove the truth of this most certainly by
experimenting on his own safety, in the dead of night he was deluded enough to cast himself
into the above mentioned well, to prove indeed the great merit of his virtue if he should
come out thence unhurt. And when by great efforts on the part of the brethren he had been
got out already almost dead, on the third day afterward he expired, and what was still worse,
persisted in his obstinate delusion so that not even the experience of his death could persuade
him that he had been deceived by the craft of devils. Wherefore in spite of the merits of his
great labours and the number of years which he had spent in the desert those who with
compassion and the greatest kindness pitied his end, could hardly obtain from Abbot

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the destruction of two brethren for lack of discretion.</head>
<p>What shall I say of those two brethren who lived beyond that desert of the Thebaid
where once the blessed Antony dwelt, and, not being sufficiently influenced by careful discrimination,
when they were going through the vast and extended waste determined not to
take any food with them, except such as the Lord Himself might provide for them. And
when as they wandered through the deserts and were already fainting from hunger they
were spied at a distance by the Mazices97 (a race which is even more savage and ferocious
than almost all wild tribes, for they are not driven to shed blood, as other tribes are, from
desire of spoil but from simple ferocity of mind), and when these acting contrary to their
natural ferocity, met them with bread, one of the two as discretion came to his aid, received
it with delight and thankfulness as if it were offered to him by the Lord, thinking that the
food had been divinely provided for him, and that it was God’s doing that those who always
delighted in bloodshed had offered the staff of life to men who were already fainting and
dying; but the other refused the food because it was offered to him by men and died of
starvation. And though this sprang in the first instance from a persuasion that was blameworthy
yet one of them by the help of discretion got the better of the idea which he had
rashly and carelessly conceived, but the other persisting in his obstinate folly, and being
utterly lacking in discretion, brought upon himself that death which the Lord would have
averted, as he would not believe that it was owing to a Divine impulse that the fierce barbarians
forgot their natural ferocity and offered them bread instead of a sword.</p>

<head>Of an illusion into which another fell for lack of discretion.</head>
<p>Why also should I speak of one (whose name we had rather not mention as he is still
alive), who for a long while received a devil in the brightness of an angelic form, and was
often deceived by countless revelations from him and believed that he was a messenger of
righteousness: for when these were granted, every night he provided a light in his cell without
the need of any lamp. At last he was ordered by the devil to offer up to God his own son
who was living with him in the monastery, in order that his merits might by this sacrifice
be made equal to those of the patriarch Abraham. And he was so far seduced by his persuasion
that he would really have committed the murder unless his son had seen him getting
ready the knife and sharpening it with unusual care, and looking for the chains with which
he meant to tie him up for the sacrifice when he was going to offer him up; and had fled
away in terror with a presentiment of the coming crime.</p>

<head>Of the fall and deception of a monk of Mesopotamia.</head>
<p>It is a long business too to tell the story of the deception of that monk of Mesopotamia,
who observed an abstinence that could be imitated by but few in that country, which he had
practised for many years concealed in his cell, and at last was so deceived by revelations and
dreams that came from the devil that after so many labours and good deeds, in which he
had surpassed all those who dwelt in the same parts, he actually relapsed miserably into
Judaism and circumcision of the flesh. For when the devil by accustoming him to visions
through the wish to entice him to believe a falsehood in the end, had like a messenger of
truth revealed to him for a long while what was perfectly true, at length he showed him
Christian folk together with the leaders of our religion and creed; viz. Apostles and Martyrs,
in darkness and filth, and foul and disfigured with all squalor, and on the other hand the
Jewish people with Moses, the patriarchs and prophets, dancing with all joy and shining
with dazzling light; and so persuaded him that if he wanted to share their reward and bliss,
he must at once submit to circumcision. And so none of these would have been so miserably
deceived, if they had endeavoured to obtain a power of discretion. Thus the mischances and
trials of many show how dangerous it is to be without the grace of discretion.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>A question about the acquirement of true discretion.</head>
<p>To this Germanus: It has been fully and completely shown both by recent instances and
by the decisions of the ancients how discretion is in some sense the fountain head and the
root of all virtues. We want then to learn how it ought to be gained, or how we can tell
whether it is genuine and from God, or whether it is spurious and from the devil: so that
(to use the figure of that gospel parable which you discussed on a former occasion, in which
we are bidden to become good money changers98) we may be able to see the figure of the
true king stamped on the coin and to detect what is not stamped on coin that is current,
and that, as you said in yesterday’s talk using an ordinary expression, we may reject it as
counterfeit, under the teaching of that skill which you treated of with sufficient fulness and
detail, and showed ought to belong to the man who is spiritually a good money changer of
the gospel. For of what good will it be to have recognized the value of that virtue and grace
if we do not know how to seek for it and to gain it?</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10"> 
<pb n="759"/>
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>The answer how true discretion may be gained.</head>
<p>Then Moses: True discretion, said he, is only secured by true humility. And of this humility
the first proof is given by reserving everything (not only what you do but also what
you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, so as not to trust at all in your own judgment but
to acquiesce in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered
good or bad by their traditions.99 And this habit will not only teach a young man to walk
in the right path through the true way of discretion, but will also keep him unhurt by all the
crafts and deceits of the enemy. For a man cannot possibly be deceived, who lives not by
his own judgment but according to the example of the elders, nor will our crafty foe be able
to abuse the ignorance of one who is not accustomed from false modesty to conceal all the
thoughts which rise in his heart, but either checks them or suffers them to remain, in accordance
with the ripened judgment of the elders. For a wrong thought is enfeebled at the moment
that it is discovered: and even before the sentence of discretion has been given, the foul
serpent is by the power of confession dragged out, so to speak, from his dark under-ground
cavern, and in some sense shown up and sent away in disgrace. For evil thoughts will hold
sway in us just so long as they are hidden in the heart: and that you may gather still more
effectually the power of this judgment I will tell you what Abbot Serapion did,100 and what
he used often to tell to the younger brethren for their edification.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>The words of Abbot Serapion on the decline of thoughts that are exposed to others, and also
on the danger of self-confidence.</head>
<p>While, said he, I was still a lad, and stopping with Abbot Theonas,101 this habit was
forced upon me by the assaults of the enemy, that after I had supped with the old man at
the ninth hour, I used every day secretly to hide a biscuit in my dress, which I would eat on
the sly later on without his knowing it. And though I was constantly guilty of the theft with
the consent of my will, and the want of restraint that springs from desire that has grown
inveterate, yet when my unlawful desire was gratified I would come to myself and torment
myself over the theft committed in a way that overbalanced the pleasure I had enjoyed in
the eating. And when I was forced not without grief of heart to fulfil day after day this most
heavy task required of me, so to speak, by Pharaoh’s taskmasters, instead of bricks, and
could not escape from this cruel tyranny, and yet was ashamed to disclose the secret theft
to the old man, it chanced by the will of God that I was delivered from the yoke of this voluntary
captivity, when certain brethren had sought the old man’s cell with the object of being
instructed by him. And when after supper the spiritual conference had begun to be held,
and the old man in answer to the questions which they had propounded was speaking about
the sin of gluttony and the dominion of secret thoughts, and showing their nature and the
awful power which they have so long as they are kept secret, I was overcome by the power
of the discourse and was conscience stricken and terrified, as I thought that these things
were mentioned by him because the Lord had revealed to the old man my bosom secrets;
and first I was moved to secret sighs, and then my heart’s compunction increased and I
openly burst into sobs and tears, and produced from the folds of my dress which shared my
theft and received it, the biscuit which I had carried off in my bad habit to eat on the sly;
and I laid it in the midst and lying on the ground an begging for forgiveness confessed how
I used to eat one every day in secret, and with copious tears implored them to intreat the
Lord to free me from this dreadful slavery. Then the old man: “Have faith, my child,” said
he, “Without any words of mine, your confession frees you from this slavery. For you have
today triumphed over your victorious adversary, by laying him low by your confession in
a manner which more than makes up for the way in which you were overthrown by him
through your former silence, as when, never confuting him with your own answer or that
of another, you had allowed him to lord it over you, according to that saying of Solomon’s:
‘Because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the heart of the children of
men is full within them to do evil:’102 and therefore after this exposure of him that evil
<note type="footnote">101 See the note on Conf. xxi. i.</note>
<note type="footnote">102 Eccl. vii. 11 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="761"/>
spirit will no longer be able to vex you, nor will that foul serpent henceforth make his lurking
place in you, as he has been dragged out into light from the darkness by your life-giving
confession.” The old man had not finished speaking when lo! a burning lamp proceeding
from the folds of my dress filled the cell with a sulphureous smell so that the pungency of
the odour scarcely allowed us to stay there: and the old man resuming his admonition said
Lo! the Lord has visibly confirmed to you the truth of my words, so that you can see with
your eyes how he who was the author of His Passion has been driven out from your heart
by your life-giving confession, and know that the enemy who has been exposed will certainly
no longer find a home in you, as his expulsion is made manifest. And so, as the old man
declared, said he, the sway of that diabolical tyranny over me has been destroyed by the
power of this confession and stilled for ever so that the enemy has never even tried to force
upon me any more the recollection of this desire, nor have I ever felt myself seized with the
passion of that furtive longing. And this meaning we see is neatly expressed in a figure in
Ecclesiastes. “If” says he “a serpent bite without hissing there is no sufficiency for the
charmer,”103 showing that the bite of a serpent in silence is dangerous, i.e., if a suggestion
or thought springing from the devil is not by means of confession shown to some charmer,
I mean some spiritually minded person who knows how to heal the wound at once by charms
from the Scripture, and to extract the deadly poison of the serpent from the heart, it will be
impossible to help the sufferer who is already in danger and must soon die. In this way
therefore we shall easily arrive at the knowledge of true discretion, so as by following the
steps of the Elders never to do anything novel nor to decide anything by or on our own responsibility,
but to walk in all things as we are taught by their tradition and upright life.
And the man who is strengthened by this system will not only arrive at the perfect method
of discretion, but also will remain perfectly safe from all the wiles of the enemy: for by no
other fault does the devil drag down a monk so precipitately and lead him away to death,
as when he persuades him to despise the counsel of the Elders and to rely on his own opinion
and judgment: for if all the arts and contrivances discovered by man’s ingenuity and those
which are only useful for the conveniences of this temporary life, though they can be felt
with the hand and seen with the eye, can yet not be understood by anyone, without lessons
from a teacher, how foolish it is to fancy that there is no need of an instructor in this one
alone which is invisible and secret and can only be seen by the purest heart, a mistake in
which brings about no mere temporary loss or one that can easily be repaired, but the destruction
of the soul and everlasting death: for it is concerned with a daily and nightly conflict
against no visible foes, but invisible and cruel ones, and a spiritual combat not against one
or two only, but against countless hosts, failure in which is the more dangerous to all, in
proportion as the foe is the fiercer and the attack the more secret. And therefore we should

always follow the footsteps of the Elders with the utmost care, and bring to them everything
which rises in our hearts, by removing the veil of shame.</p>

<head>A confession of the modesty which made us ashamed to reveal our thoughts to the elders.</head>
<p>Germanus: The ground of that hurtful modesty, through which we endeavour to hide
bad thoughts, is especially owing to this reason; viz., that we have heard of a superior of the
Elders in the region of Syria, as it was believed, who, when one of the brethren had laid bare
his thoughts to him in a genuine confession, was afterwards extremely indignant and severely
chid him for them. Whence it results that while we press them upon our selves and are
ashamed to make them known to the Elders, we cannot obtain the remedies that would heal
them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The answer concerning the trampling down of shame, and the danger of one without contrition.</head>
<p>Moses: Just as all young men are not alike in fervour of spirit nor equally instructed in
learning and good morals, so too we cannot find that all old men are equally perfect and
excellent. For the true riches of old men are not to be measured by grey hairs but by their
diligence in youth and the rewards of their past labours. “For,” says one, “the things that
thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?” “For venerable
old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding
of a man is grey hairs, and a spotless life is old age.”104 And therefore we are not to follow
in the steps or embrace the traditions and advice of every old man whose head is covered
with grey hairs, and whose age is his sole claim to respect, but only of those whom we find
to have distinguished themselves in youth in an approved and praiseworthy manner, and
to have been trained up not on self-assurance but on the traditions of the Elders. For there
are some, and unhappily they form the majority, who pass their old age in a lukewarmness
which they contracted in youth, and in sloth, and so obtain authority not from the ripeness
of their character but simply from the number of their years. Against whom that reproof of
the Lord is specially aimed by the prophet: “Strangers have devoured his strength and he
knew it not: yea, grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is ignorant of it.”105
These men, I say, are not pointed out as examples to youth from the uprightness of their
lives, nor from the strictness of their profession, which would be worthy of praise and imitation,
but simply from the number of their years; and so the subtle enemy uses their grey
hairs to deceive the younger men, by a wrongful appeal to their authority, and endeavours
in his cunning craftiness to upset and deceive by their example those who might have been
urged into the way of perfection by their advice or that of others; and drags them down by
means of their teaching and practice either into a baneful indifference, or into deadly despair.
And as I want to give you an instance of this, I will tell you a fact which may supply us with
some wholesome teaching, without giving the name of the actor, lest we might be guilty of
something of the same kind as the man who published abroad the sins of the brother which
had been disclosed to him. When this one, who was not the laziest of young men, had gone
to an old man, whom we know very well, for the sake of the profit and health of his soul,
and had candidly confessed that he was troubled by carnal appetites and the spirit of fornication,
fancying that he would receive from the old man’s words consolation for his efforts,
and a cure for the wounds inflicted on him, the old man attacked him with the bitterest reproaches,
and called him a miserable and disgraceful creature, and unworthy of the name
<note type="footnote">104 Ecclus. xxv. 5; Wisdom iv. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">105 Hos. vii. 9.</note>

<pb n="765"/>
of monk, while he could be affected by a sin and lust of this character, and instead of helping
him so injured him by his reproaches that he dismissed him from his cell in a state of
hopeless despair and deadly despondency. And when he, oppressed with such a sorrow, was
plunged in deep thought, no longer how to cure his passion, but how to gratify his lust, the
Abbot Apollos,106 the most skilful of the Elders, met him, and seeing by his looks and
gloominess his trouble and the violence of the assault which he was secretly revolving in his
heart, asked him the reason of this upset; and when he could not possibly answer the old
man’s gentle inquiry, the latter perceived more and more clearly that it was not without
reason that he wanted to hide in silence the cause of a gloom so deep that he could not
conceal it by his looks, and so began to ask him still more earnestly the reasons for his hidden
grief. And by this he was forced to confess that he was on his way to a village to take a wife,
and leave the monastery and return to the world, since, as the old man had told him, he
could not be a monk, if he was unable to control the desires of the flesh and to cure his
passion. And then the old man smoothed him down with kindly consolation, and told him
that he himself was daily tried by the same pricks of desire and lust, and that therefore he
ought not to give way to despair, nor be surprised at the violence of the attack of which he
would get the better not so much by zealous efforts, as by the mercy and grace of the Lord;
and he begged him to put off his intention just for one day, and having implored him to
return to his cell, went as fast as he could to the monastery of the above mentioned old
man—and when he had drawn near to him he stretched forth his hands and prayed with
tears, and said “O Lord, who alone art the righteous judge and unseen Physician of secret
strength and human weakness, turn the assault from the young man upon the old one, that
he may learn to condescend to the weakness of sufferers, and to sympathize even in old age
with the frailties of youth.” And when he had ended his prayer with tears, he sees a filthy
Ethiopian standing over against his cell and aiming fiery darts at him, with which he was
straightway wounded, and came out of his cell and ran about hither and thither like a lunatic
or a drunken man, and going in and out could no longer restrain himself in it, but began
to hurry off in the same direction in which the young man had gone. And when Abbot
Apollos saw him like a madman driven wild by the furies, he knew that the fiery dart of the
devil which he had seen, had been fixed in his heart, and had by its intolerable heat wrought
in him this mental aberration and confusion of the understanding; and so he came up to
him and asked “Whither are you hurrying, or what has made you forget the gravity of years
and disturbed you in this childish way, and made you hurry about so rapidly”?</p>
<note type="footnote">106 Apollos or Apollonius was a most celebrated hermit of the fourth century, who finally became the head
of a monastery of five hundred brethren in the Thebaid. Some account of him is given by Palladius (Hist. Laus.
c. lii.) and Rufinus (Hist. Monach. c. vii.). Cf. also Sozomen III. xiv.; and VI. xx., whence we learn that his life
was written by Timothy, Bishop of Alexandria. Cassian relates another story of him in XXIV. ix.</note>

<pb n="766"/>
<p>And when he owing to his guilty conscience and confused by this disgraceful excitement
fancied that the lust of his heart was discovered, and, as the secrets of his heart were known
to the old man, did not venture to return any answer to his inquiries, “Return,” said he, “to
your cell, and at last recognize the fact that till now you have been ignored or despised by
the devil, and not counted in the number of those with whom he is daily roused to fight and
struggle against their efforts and earnestness,—you who could not—I will not say ward off,
but not even postpone for one day, a single dart of his aimed at you after so many years
spent in this profession of yours. And with this the Lord has suffered you to be wounded
that you may at least learn in your old age to sympathize with infirmities to which you are
a stranger, and may know from your own case and experience how to condescend to the
frailties of the young, though when you received a young man troubled by an attack from
the devil, you did not encourage him with any consolation, but gave him up in dejection
and destructive despair into the hands of the enemy, to be, as far as you were concerned,
miserably destroyed by him. But the enemy would certainly never have attacked him with
so fierce an onslaught, with which he has up till now scorned to attack you, unless in his
jealousy at the progress he was to make, he had endeavoured to get the better of that virtue
which he saw lay in his disposition, and to destroy it with his fiery darts, as he knew without
the shadow of a doubt that he was the stronger, since he deemed it worth his while to attack
him with such vehemence. And so learn from your own experience to sympathize with those
in trouble, and never to terrify with destructive despair those who are in danger, nor harden
them with severe speeches, but rather restore them with gentle and kindly consolations, and
as the wise Solomon says, “Spare not to deliver those who are led forth to death, and to redeem
those who are to be slain,”107 and after the example of our Saviour, break not the
bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax,108 and ask of the Lord that grace, by means of
which you yourself may faithfully learn both in deed and power to sing: “the Lord hath
given me a learned tongue that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary:”109
for no one could bear the devices of the enemy, or extinguish or repress those carnal fires
which burn with a sort of natural flame, unless God’s grace assisted our weakness, or protected
and supported it. And therefore, as the reason for this salutary incident is over, by
which the Lord meant to set that young man free from dangerous desires and to teach you
something of the violence of their attack, and of the feeling of compassion, let us together
implore Him in prayer, that He may be pleased to remove that scourge, which the Lord
thought good to lay upon you for your good (for “He maketh sorry and cureth: he striketh
and his hands heal. He humbleth and exalteth, he killeth and maketh alive: he bringeth

down to the grave and bringeth up”)110, and may extinguish with the abundant dew of His
Spirit the fiery darts of the devil, which at my desire He allowed to wound you. And although
the Lord removed this temptation at a single prayer of the old man with the same speed
with which He had suffered it to come upon him, yet He showed by a clear proof that a
man’s faults when laid bare were not merely not to be scolded, but that the grief of one in
trouble ought not to be lightly despised. And therefore never let the clumsiness or shallowness
of one old man or of a few deter you and keep you back from that life-giving way, of which
we spoke earlier, or from the tradition of the Elders, if our crafty enemy makes a wrongful
use of their grey hairs in order to deceive younger men: but without any cloak of shame
everything should be disclosed to the Elders, and remedies for wounds be faithfully received
from them together with examples of life and conversation: from which we shall find like
help and the same sort of result, if we try to do nothing at all on our own responsibility and
judgment.</p>

<p>Lastly so far has this opinion been shown to be pleasing to God that we see that this
system not without reason finds a place in holy Scripture, so that the Lord would not of
Himself instruct by the method of a Divine colloquy the lad Samuel, when chosen for
judgment, but suffered him to run once or twice to the old man, and willed that one whom
He was calling to converse with Him should be taught even by one who had offended God,
as he was an old man, and preferred that he whom He had deemed worthy to be called by
Him should be trained by the Elder in order to test the humility of him who was called to

<head>Of the call of the Apostle Paul.</head>
<p>And when Christ in His own Person called and addressed Paul, although He might have
opened out to him at once the way of perfection, yet He chose rather to direct him to
Ananias and commanded him to learn the way of truth from him, saying: “Arise and go
into the city and there it shall be told thee what thou oughtest to do.”111 So He sends him
to an older man, and thinks good to have him instructed by his teaching rather than His
own, lest what might have been rightly done in the case of Paul might set a bad example of
self-sufficiency, if each one were to persuade himself that he also ought in like manner to
be trained by the government and teaching of God alone rather than by the instruction of
the Elders. And this self-sufficiency the apostle himself teaches, not only by his letters but
by his acts and deeds, ought to be shunned with all possible care, as he says that he went up
to Jerusalem solely for this reason; viz., to communicate in a private and informal conference
with his co-apostles and those who were before him that Gospel which he preached to the
Gentiles, the grace of the Holy Spirit accompanying him with powerful signs and wonders:
as he says “And I communicated with them the Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles
lest perhaps I had run or should run in vain.”112 Who then is so self-sufficient and blind as
to dare to trust in his own judgment and discretion when the chosen vessel confesses that
he had need of conference with his fellow apostles. Whence we clearly see that the Lord
does not Himself show the way of perfection to anyone who having the opportunity of
learning depises the teaching and training of the Elders, paying no heed to that saying which
ought most carefully to be observed: “Ask thy father and he will show it to thee: thine Elders
and they will tell thee.”113</p>

<head>How to seek for discretion.</head>
<p>We ought then with all our might to strive for the virtue of discretion by the power of
humility, as it will keep us uninjured by either extreme, for there is an old saying ἀκρότητες
ἰσότητες, i.e., extremes meet. For excess of fasting and gluttony come to the same thing,
and an unlimited continuance of vigils is equally injurious to a monk as the torpor of a deep
sleep: for when a man is weakened by excessive abstinence he is sure to return to that condition
in which a man is kept through carelessness and negligence, so that we have often
seen those who could not be deceived by gluttony, destroyed by excessive fasting and by
reason of weakness liable to that passion which they had before overcome. Unreasonable
vigils and nightly watchings have also been the ruin of some whom sleep could not get the
better of: wherefore as the apostle says “with the arms of righteousness on the right hand
and on the left,”114 we pass on with due moderation, and walk between the two extremes,
under the guidance of discretion, that we may not consent to be led away from the path of
continence marked out for us, nor fall by undue carelessness into the pleasures of the palate
and belly.</p>

<head>On excessive fasts and vigils.</head>
<p>For I remember that I had so often resisted the desire for food, that having abstained
from taking any for two or three days, my mind was not troubled even by the recollection
of any eatables and also that sleep was by the assaults of the devil so far removed from my
eyes, that for several days and nights I used to pray the Lord to grant a little sleep to my eyes;
and then I felt that I was in greater peril from the want of food and sleep than from struggling
against sloth and gluttony. And so as we ought to be careful not to fall into dangerous effeminacy
through desire for bodily gratification, nor indulge ourselves with eating before the
right time nor take too much, so also we ought to refresh ourselves with food and sleep at
the proper time even if we dislike it. For the struggle in each case is caused by the devices
of the enemy; and excessive abstinence is still more injurious to us than careless satiety: for
from this latter the intervention of a healthy compunction will raise us to the right measure
of strictness, and not from the former.</p>

<head>A question on the right measure of abstinence and refreshment.</head>
<p>Germanus: What then is the measure of abstinence by keeping which with even balance
we shall succeed in passing unharmed between the two extremes?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19"> 
<pb n="773"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>Of the best plan for our daily food.</head>
<p>Moses: On this matter we are aware that there have been frequent discussions among
our Elders. For in discussing the abstinence of some who supported their lives continually
on nothing but beans or only on vegetables and fruits, they proposed to all of them to partake
of bread alone, the right measure of which they fixed at two biscuits, so small that they assuredly
scarcely weighed a pound.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>An objection on the ease of that abstinence in which a man is sustained by two biscuits.</head>
<p>And this we gladly embraced, and answered that we should scarcely consider this limit
as abstinence, as we could not possibly reach it entirely.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21"> 
<pb n="775"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>The answer concerning the value and measure of well-proved abstinence.</head>
<p>Moses: If you want to test the force of this rule, keep to this limit continually, never
departing from it by taking any cooked food even on Sunday or Saturday, or on the occasions
of the arrival of any of the brethren; for the flesh, refreshed by these exceptions, is able not
only to support itself through the rest of the week on a smaller quantity, but can also postpone
all refreshment without difficulty, as it is sustained by the addition of that food which it has
taken beyond the limit; while the man who has always been satisfied with the full amount
of the above-mentioned measure will never be able to do this, nor to put off breaking his
fast till the morrow. For I remember that our Elders (and I recollect that we ourselves also
often had the same experience) found it so hard and difficult to practise this abstinence,
and observed the rule laid down with such pain and hunger that it was almost against their
will and with tears and lamentation that they set this limit to their meals.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22"> 
<pb n="776"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>What is the usual limit both of abstinence and of partaking food.</head>
<p>But this is the usual limit of abstinence; viz., for everyone to allow himself food according
to the requirements of his strength or bodily frame or age, in such quantity as is required
for the support of the flesh, and not for the satisfactory feeling of repletion. For on both
sides a man will suffer the greatest injury, if having no fixed rule at one time he pinches his
stomach with meagre food and fasts, and at another stuffs it by over-eating himself; for as
the mind which is enfeebled for lack of food loses vigour in praying, while it is worn out
with excessive weakness of the flesh and forced to doze, so again when weighed down with
over-eating it cannot pour forth to God pure and free prayers: nor will it succeed in preserving
uninterruptedly the purity of its chastity, while even on those days on which it seems to
chastise the flesh with severer abstinence, it feeds the fire of carnal desire with the fuel of
the food that it has already taken.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>Quemadmodum abundantia umorum genitalium castigetur.115</head>
<p>Nam quod semel per escarum abundantian concretus fuerit in medullis, necesse est
egeri atque ab ipsa naturæ lege propelli, quæ exuberantiam cujuslibet umoris superflui velut
noxiam sibi atque contrariam in semet ipsa residere non patitur ideoque rationabili semper
et æquali est corpus nostrum parsimonia castigandum, ut si naturali hac necessitate commorantes
in carne omnimodis carere non possumus, saltim rarius nos et non amplius
quamtrina vice ista conluvione respersos totius anni cursus inveniat, quod tamen sine ullo
pruritu quietus egerat sopor, non fallax imago index occultæ voluptatis eliciat.</p>
<p>Wherefore this is the moderate and even allowance and measure of abstinence, of which
we spoke, which has the approval also of the judgment of the fathers; viz., that daily hunger
should go hand in hand with our daily meals, preserving both body and soul in one and the
same condition, and not allowing the mind either to faint through weariness from fasting,
nor to be oppressed by over-eating, for it ends in such a sparing diet that sometimes a man
neither notices nor remembers in the evening that he has broken his fast.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>Of the difficulty of uniformity in eating; and of the gluttony of brother Benjamin.</head>
<p>And so far is this not done without difficulty, that those who know nothing of perfect
discretion would rather prolong their fasts for two days, and reserve for tomorrow what
they should have eaten today, so that when they come to partake of food they may enjoy as
much as they can desire. And you know that lastly your fellow citizen Benjamin most obstinately
stuck to this: as he would not every day partake of his two biscuits, nor, continually
take his meagre fare with uniform self-discipline, but preferred always to continue his fasts
for two days that when he came to eat he might fill his greedy stomach with a double portion,
and by eating four biscuits enjoy a comfortable sense of repletion, and manage to fill his
belly by means of a two days’ fast. And you doubtless remember what sort of an end there
was to the life of this man who obstinately and pertinaciously relied on his own judgment
rather than on the traditions of the Elders, for he forsook the desert and returned back to
the vain philosophy of this world and earthly vanities, and so confirmed the above mentioned
opinion of the Elders by the example of his downfall, and by his destruction teaches a lesson
that no one who trusts in his own opinion and judgment can possibly climb the heights of
perfection, nor fail to be deceived by the dangerous wiles of the devil.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>A question how is it possible always to observe one and the same measure.</head>
<p>Germanus: How then can we observe this measure without ever breaking it? for sometimes
at the ninth hour when the Station fast116 is over, brethren come to see us and then
we must either for their sakes add something to our fixed and customary portion, or certainly
fail in that courtesy which we are told to show to everybody.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26"> 
<pb n="780"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>The answer how we should not exceed the proper measure of food.</head>
<p>Moses: Both duties must be observed in the same way and with equal care: for we ought
most scrupulously to preserve the proper allowance of food for the sake of our abstinence,
and in like manner out of charity to show courtesy and encouragement to any of the brethren
who may arrive; because it is absolutely ridiculous when you offer food to a brother, nay,
to Christ Himself, not to partake of it with him, but to make yourself a stranger to his repast.
And so we shall keep clear of guilt on either hand if we observe this plan; viz., at the ninth
hour to partake of one of the two biscuits which form our proper canonical allowance, and
to keep back the other to the evening, in expectation of something like this, that if any of
the brethren comes to see us we may partake of it with him, and so add nothing to our own
customary allowance: and by this arrangement the arrival of our brother which ought to be
a pleasure to us will cause us no inconvenience: since we shall show him the civilities which
courtesy requires in such a way as to relax nothing of the strictness of our abstinence. But
if no one should come, we may freely take this last biscuit as belonging to us according to
our canonical rule, and by this frugality of ours as a single biscuit was taken at the ninth
hour, our stomach will not be overloaded at eventide, a thing which is often the case with
those who under the idea that they are observing a stricter abstinence put off all their repast
till evening; for the fact that we have but recently taken food hinders our intellect from being
bright and keen both in our evening and in our nocturnal prayers, and so at the ninth hour
a convenient and suitable time has been allowed for food, in which a monk can refresh
himself and so find that he is not only fresh and bright during his nocturnal vigils, but also
perfectly ready for his evening prayers, as his food is already digested.</p>
<p>With such a banquet of two courses, as it were, the holy Moses feasted us, showing us
not only the grace and power of discretion by his present learned speech, but also the
method of renunciation and the end and aim of the monastic life by the discussion previously
held; so as to make clearer than daylight what we had hitherto pursued simply with fervour
of spirit and zeal for God but with closed eyes, and to make us feel how far we had up till
then wandered from purity of heart and the straight line of our course, since the practice
of all visible arts belonging to this life cannot possibly stand without an understanding of
their aim, nor can it be taken in hand without a clear view of a definite end.</p>

<head>III. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PAPHNUTIUS.
ON THE THREE SORTS OF RENUNCIATIONS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="782"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the life and conduct of Abbot Paphnutius.</head>
<p>In that choir of saints who shine like brilliant stars in the night of this world, we have
seen the holy Paphnutius,117 like some great luminary, shining with the brightness of
knowledge. For he was a presbyter of our company, I mean of those whose abode was in
the desert of Scete, where he lived to extreme old age, without ever moving from his cell, of
which he had taken possession when still young, and which was five miles from the church,
even to nearer districts; nor was he when worn out with years hindered by the distance from
going to Church on Saturday or Sunday. But not wanting to return from thence empty
handed he would lay on his shoulders a bucket of water to last him all the week, and carry
it back to his cell, and even when he was past ninety would not suffer it to be fetched by the
labour of younger men. He then from his earliest youth threw himself into the monastic
discipline with such fervour that when he had spent only a short time in it, he was endowed
with the virtue of submission, as well as the knowledge of all good qualities. For by the
practice of humility and obedience he mortified all his desires, and by this stamped out all
his faults and acquired every virtue which the monastic system and the teaching of the ancient
fathers produces, and, inflamed with desire for still further advances, he was eager to penetrate
into the recesses of the desert, so that, with no human companions to disturb him, he might
be more readily united to the Lord, to whom he longed to be inseparably joined, even while
he still lived in the society of the brethren. And there once more in his excessive fervour he
outstripped the virtues of the Anchorites, and in his eager desire for continual divine meditation
avoided the sight of them: and he plunged into solitary places yet wilder and more
inaccessible, and hid himself for a long while in them, so that, as the Anchorites themselves
only with great difficulty caught a glimpse of him every now and then, the belief was that
he enjoyed and delighted in the daily society of angels, and because of this remarkable
characteristic of his118 he was surnamed by them the Buffalo.</p>
<note type="footnote">117 Paphnutius. The name is not uncommon in the annals of the fourth century: (1) A Deacon who bore it
suffered in the persecution of Diocletian; and (2) a Bishop of the same name, who had been a confessor, was
mainly instrumental in preventing the rule of celibacy being forced on the clergy by the Council of Nicæa; (3)
another was a prominent member of the Meletian schism; while (4) a fourth was present, as Bishop of Sais in
Lower Egypt at the Council of Alexandria in 362; and (5) the life of a fifth is given by Palladius (Hist. Laus.
lxii.–lxv.) and Rufinus (Hist. Monach. c. xvi.). The one whom Cassian here mentions, surnamed the Buffalo, is
apparently a different person from the last mentioned. Further details of his history are given in the Institutes
IV. c. xxx. xxxi., and in Conference X. ii., iii. Cassian tells the interesting story of his share in the Anthropomorphite
controversy, and the beneficial influence which he then exercised.</note>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the discourse of the same old man, and our reply to it.</head>
<p>As then we were anxious to learn from his teaching, we came in some agitation to his
cell towards evening. And after a short silence he began to commend our undertaking, because
we had left our homes, and had visited so many countries out of love for the Lord,
and were endeavouring with all our might to endure want and the trials of the desert, and
to imitate their severe life, which even those who had been born and bred in the same state
of want and penury, could scarcely put up with; and we replied that we had come for his
teaching and instruction in order that we might be to some extent initiated in the customs
of so great a man, and in that perfection which we had known from many evidences to exist
in him, not that we might be honoured by any commendations to which we had no right,
or be puffed up with any elation of mind, (with which we were sometimes exercised in our
own cells at the suggestion of our enemy) in consequence of any words of his. Wherefore
we begged him rather to lay before us what would make us humble and contrite, and not
what would flatter us and puff us up.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>The statement of Abbot Paphnutius on the three kinds of vocations, and the three sorts of renunciations.</head>
<p>Then The Blessed Paphnutius: There are, said he, three kinds of vocations. And we
know that there are three sorts of renunciations as well, which are necessary to a monk,
whatever his vocation may be. And we ought diligently to examine first the reason for which
we said that there were three kinds of vocations, that when we are sure that we are summoned
to God’s service in the first stage of our vocation, we may take care that our life is in harmony
with the exalted height to which we are called, for it will be of no use to have made a good
beginning if we do not show forth an end corresponding to it. But if we feel that only in the
last resort have we been dragged away from a worldly life, then, as it appears that we rest
on a less satisfactory beginning as regards religion, so must we proportionately make the
more earnest endeavours to rouse ourselves with spiritual fervour to make a better end. It
is well too on every ground for us to know secondly the manner of the threefold renunciations
because we shall never be able to attain perfection, if we are ignorant of it or if we know it,
but do not attempt to carry it out in act.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
<pb n="785"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>An explanation of the three callings.</head>
<p>To make clear therefore the main differences between these three kinds of calling, the
first is from God, the second comes through man, the third is from compulsion. And a
calling is from God whenever some inspiration has taken possession of our heart, and even
while we are asleep stirs in us at desire for eternal life and salvation, and bids us follow God
and cleave to His commandments with life-giving contrition: as we read in Holy Scripture
that Abraham was called by the voice of the Lord from his native country, and all his dear
relations, and his father’s house; when the Lord said “Get thee out from thy country and
from thy kinsfolk and from thy father’s house.”119 And in this way we have heard that the
blessed Antony also was called,120 the occasion of whose conversion was received from God
alone. For on entering a church he there heard in the Gospel the Lord saying: “Whoever
hateth not father and mother and children and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also,
cannot be my disciple;” and “if thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me:”121 And with heartfelt
contrition he took this charge of the Lord as if specially aimed at him, and at once gave up
everything and followed Christ, without any incitement thereto from the advice and teaching
of men. The second kind of calling is that which we said took place through man; viz., when
we are stirred up by the example of some of the saints, and their advice, and thus inflamed
with the desire of salvation: and by this we never forget that by the grace of the Lord we
ourselves were summoned, as we were aroused by the advice and good example of the abovementioned
saint, to give ourselves up to this aim and calling; and in this way also we find
in Holy Scripture that it was through Moses that the children of Israel were delivered from
the Egyptian bondage. But the third kind of calling is that which comes from compulsion,
when we have been involved in the riches and pleasures of this life, and temptations suddenly
come upon us and either threaten us with peril of death, or smite us with the loss and confiscation
of our goods, or strike us down with the death of those dear to us, and thus at
<note type="footnote">119 Gen. xii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">120 The story, to which allusion is here made, is given in the Vita Antonii of Athanasius. We are there told
that six months after the death of his parents Antony, then a young man of eighteen, chanced to enter a church
just as the gospel for the day was being read: and hearing the words, “If thou wilt be perfect,” etc., he took them
as addressed specially to himself, and at once proceeded to act upon them, selling all that he had except a small
portion which he reserved for his sister’s maintenance. Shortly after, he was struck by the words, “Take no
thought for the morrow,” which he heard in church, and acting upon this, made away with the little property
which was left, committed his sister to the care of certain faithful virgins, and betook himself to the ascetic life.</note>
<note type="footnote">121 S. Luke xiv. 12; S. Matt. xix. 21.</note>

<pb n="786"/>
length even against our will we are driven to turn to God whom we scorned to follow in the
days of our wealth. And of this compulsory call we often find instances in Scripture, when
we read that on account of their sins the children of Israel were given up by the Lord to their
enemies; and that on account of their tyranny and savage cruelty they turned again, and
cried to the Lord. And it says: “The Lord sent them a Saviour, called Ehud, the son of Gera,
the son of Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right:” and again we are told, “they
cried unto the Lord, who raised them up a Saviour and delivered them, to wit, Othniel, the
son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.”122 And it is of such that the Psalm speaks: “When
He slew them, then they sought Him: and they returned and came to Him early in the
morning: and they remembered that God was their helper, and the most High God their
redeemer.” And again: “And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He
delivered them out of their distress.”123</p>

<pb n="787"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How the first of these calls is of no use to a sluggard, and the last is no hindrance to one who
is in earnest.</head>
<p>Of these three calls then, although the two former may seem to rest on better principles,
yet sometimes we find that even by the third grade, which seems the lowest and the coldest,
men have been made perfect and most earnest in spirit, and have become like those who
made an admirable beginning in approaching the Lord’s service, and passed the rest of their
lives also in most laudable fervour of spirit: and again we find that from the higher grade
very many have grown cold, and often have come to a miserable end. And just as it was no
hindrance to the former class that they seemed to be converted not of their own free will,
but by force and compulsion, in as much as the loving kindness of the Lord secured for
them the opportunity for repentance, so too to the latter it was of no avail that the early days
of their conversion were so bright, because they were not careful to bring the remainder of
their life to a suitable end. For in the case of Abbot Moses,124 who lived in a spot in the
wilderness called Calamus,125 nothing was wanting to his merits and perfect bliss, in consequence
of the fact that he was driven to flee to the monastery through fear of death, which
was hanging over him because of a murder; for he made such use of his compulsory conversion
that with ready zeal he turned it into a voluntary one and climbed the topmost heights
of perfection. As also on the other hand; to very many, whose names I ought not to mention,
it has been of no avail that they entered on the Lord’s service with better beginning than
this, as afterwards sloth and hardness of heart crept over them, and they fell into a dangerous
state of torpor, and the bottomless pit of death, an instance of which we see clearly indicated
in the call of the Apostles. For of what good was it to Judas that he had of his own free will
embraced the highest grade of the Apostolate in the same way in which Peter and the rest
of the Apostles had been summoned, as he allowed the splendid beginning of his call to
terminate in a ruinous end of cupidity and covetousness, and as a cruel murderer even
rushed into the betrayal of the Lord? Or what hindrance was it to Paul that he was suddenly
blinded, and seemed to be drawn against his will into the way of salvation, as afterwards he
followed the Lord with complete fervour of soul, and having begun by compulsion completed
it by a free and voluntary devotion, and terminated with a magnificent end a life that was
rendered glorious by such great deeds? Everything therefore depends upon the end; in which
<note type="footnote">124 Moses. This Abbot is possibly a different person from the author of the first two Conferences, who had
in his youth been a pupil of Antony; whereas the one here mentioned only took the monastic life out of fear of
death on a charge of murder. He is mentioned again in Conferences VII. xxvi., XIX. xi., and some account of
him is given in Sozomen H.E. VI. xxix.</note>

one who was consecrated by a noble conversion at the outset may through carelessness turn
out a failure, and one who was compelled by necessity to adopt the monastic life may through
fear of God and earnestness be made perfect.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
<pb n="789"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>An account of the three sorts of renunciations.</head>
<p>We must now speak of the renunciations, of which tradition and the authority of Holy
Scripture show us three, and which every one of us ought with the utmost zeal to make
complete. The first is that by which as far as the body is concerned we make light of all the
wealth and goods of this world; the second, that by which we reject the fashions and vices
and former affections of soul and flesh; the third, that by which we detach our soul from all
present and visible things, and contemplate only things to come, and set our heart on what
is invisible. And we read that the Lord charged Abraham to do all these three at once, when
He said to him “Get thee out from thy country, and thy kinsfolk, and thy father’s house.”126
First He said “from thy country,” i.e., from the goods of this world, and earthly riches:
secondly, “from thy kinsfolk,” i.e., from this former life and habits and sins, which cling to
us from our very birth and are joined to us as it were by ties of affinity and kinship: thirdly,
“from thy father’s house,” i.e., from all the recollection of this world, which the sight of the
eyes can afford. For of the two fathers, i.e., of the one who is to be forsaken, and of the one
who is to be sought, David thus speaks in the person of God: “Hearken, O daughter, and
consider, and incline thine ear: forget also thine own people and thy father’s house:”127 for
the person who says “Hearken, O daughter,” is certainly a Father; and yet he bears witness
that the one, whose house and people he urges should be forgotten, is none the less father
of his daughter. And this happens when being dead with Christ to the rudiments of this
world, we no longer, as the Apostle says, regard “the things which are seen, but those which
are not seen, for the things which are not seen are eternal,”128 and going forth in heart from
this temporal and visible home, turn our eyes and heart towards that in which we are to remain
for ever. And this we shall succeed in doing when, while we walk in the flesh, we are
no longer at war with the Lord according to the flesh, proclaiming in deed and actions the
truth of that saying of the blessed Apostle “Our conversation is in heaven.”129 To these three
sorts of renunciations the three books of Solomon suitably correspond. For Proverbs answers
to the first renunciation, as in it the desires for carnal things and earthly sins are repressed;
to the second Ecclesiastes corresponds, as there everything which is done under the sun is
declared to be vanity; to the third the Song of Songs, in which the soul soaring above all
things visible, is actually joined to the word of God by the contemplation of heavenly things.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="790"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How we can attain perfection in each of these sorts of renunciations.</head>
<p>Wherefore it will not be of much advantage to us that we have made our first renunciation
with the utmost devotion and faith, if we do not complete the second with the same
zeal and ardour. And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the
third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know
well, was our father from our very birth, after the old man, when we were “by nature children
of wrath, as others also,”130) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this
father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, “Thy father was
an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;”131 and in the gospel we read “Ye are of your father
the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.”132 And when we have left him, as we
pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: “But we
know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God,
a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,”133 and this also, which we quoted a
little while ago: “But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour,
the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His
glory,”134 and this of the blessed David: “For I am a sojourner upon the earth,” and “a
stranger as all my fathers were;”135 so that we may in accordance with the Lord’s word be
made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: “They are
not of the world, as I am not of the world,”136 and again to the Apostles themselves: “If ye
were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world,
therefore the world hateth you.”137 Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in
reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but,
all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and
desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far
passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual
it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up
into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with

gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects
straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except
one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one,
the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer
considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with,
and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, “walking with God,”
and “translated” from human life and fashions, not “be found” amid the vanities of this life.
And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus
tells us. “And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.” And
the Apostle also says: “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,” the death
namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: “He that liveth and believeth in me shall not
die eternally.”138 Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look
to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and
pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and
never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who
were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned
in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs,
and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says:
“And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before
us,”139 for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the
wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and
of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: “It was
well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and
cucumbers, and melons:”140 A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that
people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after
renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts
in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says “It was well with me in Egypt,”
and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders
of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and
three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two
entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness
from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have
spoken in the gospel “Many are called but few” are said to be “chosen.”141 A renunciation

then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we
do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable.
For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows:
“Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have
not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”142 And the blessed Apostle would never have said this
had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed
the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity,
because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify
themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could
never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second
stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher.
But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say “If I bestow
my goods.” For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the
command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted
persons do. But he says “Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,” i.e., even if my
renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something
still greater: “And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:”
As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance
with that command in the gospel, where we are told “If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that
thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,”143 renouncing
them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my
goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for
Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done
by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in
bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man
will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because,
while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly
substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast
out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord
which is patient, which is “kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry,
dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,” which “beareth all things,
endureth all things,”144 and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the
deceitfulness of sin.</p>

<head>Of our very own possessions in which the beauty of the soul is seen or its foulness.</head>
<p>We ought then to take the utmost care that our inner man as well may cast off and make
away with all those possessions of its sins, which it acquired in its former life: which as they
continually cling to body and soul are our very own, and, unless we reject them and cut
them off while we are still in the flesh, will not cease to accompany us after death. For as
good qualities, or charity itself which is their source, may be gained in this world, and after
the close of this life make the man who loves it lovely and glorious, so our faults transmit
to that eternal remembrance a mind darkened and stained with foul colours. For the beauty
or ugliness of the soul is the product of its virtues or its vices, the colour it takes from which
either makes it so glorious, that it may well hear from the prophet “And the king shall have
pleasure in thy beauty,”145 or so black, and foul, and ugly, that it must surely acknowledge
the stench of its shame, and say “My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness,”
146 and the Lord Himself says to it “Why is not the wound of the daughter of my
people closed?”147 And therefore these are our very own possessions, which continually
remain with the soul, which no king and no enemy can either give or take away from us.
These are our very own possessions which not even death itself can part from the soul, but
by renouncing which we can attain to perfection, and by clinging to which we shall suffer
the punishment of eternal death.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of three sorts of possessions.</head>
<p>Riches and possessions are taken in Holy Scripture in three different ways, i.e., as good,
bad, and indifferent. Those are bad, of which it is said: “The rich have wanted and have
suffered hunger,”148 and “Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation:”
149 and to have cast off these riches is the height of perfection; and a distinction which
belongs to those poor who are commended in the gospel by the Lord’s saying: “Blessed are
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;”150 and in the Psalm: “This poor man
cried, and the Lord heard him,”151 and again: “The poor and needy shall praise thy name.”152
Those riches are good, to acquire which is the work of great virtue and merit, and the
righteous possessor of which is praised by David who says “The generation of the righteous
shall be blessed: glory and riches are in his house, and his righteousness remaineth for
ever:”153 and again “the ransom of a man’s life are his riches.”154 And of these riches it is
said in the Apocalypse to him who has them not and to his shame is poor and naked: “I will
begin,” says he, “to vomit thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest I am rich and wealthy
and have need of nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor
and blind and naked, I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire-tried, that thou mayest be made
rich, and mayest be clothed in white garments, and that the shame of thy nakedness may
not appear.”155 There are some also which are indifferent, i.e., which may be made either
good or bad: for they are made either one or the other in accordance with the will and
character of those who use them: of which the blessed, Apostle says “Charge the rich of this
world not to be high-minded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in God (who
giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy), to do good, to give easily, to communicate to
others, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation that they may lay hold on the
true life.”156 These are what the rich man in the gospel kept, and never distributed to the
poor,—while the beggar Lazarus was lying at his gate and desiring to be fed with his crumbs;
and so he was condemned to the unbearable flames and everlasting heat of hell-fire.157</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>That none can become perfect merely through the first grade of renunciation.</head>
<p>In leaving then these visible goods of the world we forsake not our own wealth, but that
which is not ours, although we boast of it as either gained by our own exertions or inherited
by us from our forefathers. For as I said nothing is our own, save this only which we possess
with our heart, and which cleaves to our soul, and therefore cannot be taken away from us
by any one. But Christ speaks in terms of censure of those visible riches, to those who clutch
them as if they were their own, and refuse to share them with those in want. “If ye have not
been faithful in what is another’s, who will give to you what is your own?”158 Plainly then
it is not only daily experience which teaches us that these riches are not our own, but this
saying of our Lord also, by the very title which it gives them. But concerning visible159 and
worthless riches Peter says to the Lord: “Lo, we have left all and followed thee. What shall
we have therefore?”160 when it is clear that they had left nothing but their miserable broken
nets. And unless this expression “all” is understood to refer to that renunciation of sins
which is really great and important, we shall not find that the Apostles had left anything of
any value, or that the Lord had any reason for bestowing on them the blessing of so great
glory, that they were allowed to hear from Him that “in the regeneration, when the Son of
Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.”161 If then those, who have completely renounced their earthly and
visible goods, cannot for sufficient reason attain to Apostolic charity, nor climb with readiness
and vigour to that third stage of renunciation which is still higher and belongs to but few,
what should those think of themselves, who do not even make that first step (which is very
easy) a thorough one, but keep together with their old want of faith, their former sordid
riches, and fancy that they can boast of the mere name of monks? The first renunciation
then of which we spoke is of what is not our own, and therefore is not enough of itself to
confer perfection on the renunciant, unless he advances to the second, which is really and
truly a renunciation of what belongs to us. And when we have made sure of this by the expulsion
of all our faults, we shall mount to the heights of the third renunciation also, whereby
we rise above not merely all those things which are done in this world or specially belong
to men, but even that whole universe around us which is esteemed so glorious, and shall
with heart and soul look down upon it as subject to vanity and destined soon to pass away;
as we look, as the Apostle says, “not on those things which are seen, but on those which are

not seen: for the things that are seen, are temporal, and the things which are not seen are
eternal;”162 that so we may be found worthy to hear that highest utterance, which was spoken
to Abraham: “and come into a land which I will show thee,”163 which clearly shows that
unless a man has made those three former renunciations with all earnestness of mind, he
cannot attain to this fourth, which is granted as a reward and privilege to one whose renunciation
is perfect, that he may be found worthy to enter the land of promise which no longer
bears for him the thorns and thistles of sins; which after all the passions have been driven
out is acquired by purity of heart even in the body, and which no good deeds or exertions
of man’s efforts (can gain), but which the Lord Himself promises to show, saying “And
come into the land which I will show to thee:” which clearly proves that the beginning of
our salvation results from the call of the Lord, Who says “Get thee out from thy country,”
and that the completion of perfection and purity is His gift in the same way, as He says “And
come into the land which I will show thee,” i.e., not one you yourself can know or discover
by your own efforts, but one which I will show not only to one who is ignorant of it, but
even to one who is not looking for it. And from this we clearly gather that as we hasten to
the way of salvation through being stirred up by the inspiration of the Lord, so too it is under
the guidance of His direction and illumination that we attain to the perfection of the highest
bliss.</p>

<head>A question on the free will of man and the grace of God.</head>
<p>Germanus: Where then is there room for free will, and how is it ascribed to our efforts
that we are worthy of praise, if God both begins and ends everything in us which concerns
our salvation?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12"> 
<pb n="798"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The answer on the economy of Divine Grace, with free will still remaining in us.</head>
<p>Paphnutius: This would fairly influence us, if in every work and practice, the beginning
and the end were everything, and there were no middle in between. And so as we know that
God creates opportunities of salvation in various ways, it is in our power to make use of the
opportunities granted to us by heaven more or less earnestly. For just as the offer came from
God Who called him “get thee out of thy country,” so the obedience was on the part of Abraham
who went forth; and as the fact that the saying “Come into the land” was carried into
action, was the work of him who obeyed, so the addition of the words “which I will show
thee” came from the grace of God Who commanded or promised it. But it is well for us to
be sure that although we practise every virtue with unceasing efforts, yet with all our exertions
and zeal we can never arrive at perfection, nor is mere human diligence and toil of itself
sufficient to deserve to reach the splendid reward of bliss, unless we have secured it by means
of the co-operation of the Lord, and His directing our heart to what is right. And so we
ought every moment to pray and say with David “Order my steps in thy paths that my
footsteps slip not:”164 and “He hath set my feet upon a rock and ordered my goings:”165
that He Who is the unseen ruler of the human heart may vouchsafe to turn to the desire of
virtue that will of ours, which is more readily inclined to vice either through want of
knowledge of what is good, or through the delights of passion. And we read this in a verse
in which the prophet sings very plainly: “Being pushed I was overturned that I might fall,”
where the weakness of our free will is shown. And “the Lord sustained me:”166 again this
shows that the Lord’s help is always joined to it, and by this, that we may not be altogether
destroyed by our free will, when He sees that we have stumbled, He sustains and supports
us, as it were by stretching out His hand. And again: “If I said my foot was moved;” viz.,
from the slippery character of the will, “Thy mercy, O Lord, helped me.”167 Once more he
joins on the help of God to his own weakness, as he confesses that it was not owing to his
own efforts but to the mercy of God, that the foot of his faith was not moved. And again:
“According to the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart,” which sprang most
certainly from my free will, “Thy comforts have refreshed my soul,”168 i.e., by coming
through Thy inspiration into my heart, and laying open the view of future blessings which
Thou hast prepared for them who labour in Thy name, they not only removed all anxiety

from my heart, but actually conferred upon it the greatest delight. And again: “Had it not
been that the Lord helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.”169 He certainly shows that
through the depravity of this free will he would have dwelt in hell, had he not been saved
by the assistance and protection of the Lord. For “By the Lord,” and not by free-will, “are a
man’s steps directed,” and “although the righteous fall” at least by free will, “he shall not be
cast away.” And why? because “the Lord upholdeth him with His hand:”170 and this is to
say with the utmost clearness: None of the righteous are sufficient of themselves to acquire
righteousness, unless every moment when they stumble and fall the Divine mercy supports
them with His hands, that they may not utterly collapse and perish, when they have been
cast down through the weakness of free will.</p>

<p>And truly the saints have never said that it was by their own efforts that they secured
the direction of the way in which they walked in their course towards advance and perfection
of virtue, but rather they prayed for it from the Lord, saying “Direct me in Thy truth,” and
“direct my way in thy sight.”171 But someone else declares that he discovered this very fact
not only by faith, but also by experience, and as it were from the very nature of things: “I
know, O Lord, that the way of man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk and to direct his
steps.”172 And the Lord Himself says to Israel: “I will direct him like a green fir-tree: from
Me is thy fruit found.”173</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>That the understanding, by means of which we can recognize God’s commands, and the performance
of a good will are both gifts from the Lord.</head>
<p>Further the blessed David asks of the Lord that he may gain that very understanding,
by which he can recognize God’s commands which, he well knew, were written in the book
of the law, and he says “I am Thy servant: O give me understanding that I may learn Thy
commandments.”175 Certainly he was in possession of understanding, which had been
granted to him by nature, and also had at his fingers’ ends a knowledge of God’s commands
which were preserved in writing in the law: and still he prayed the Lord that he might learn
this more thoroughly as he knew that what came to him by nature would never be sufficient
for him, unless his understanding was enlightened by the Lord by a daily illumination from
Him, to understand the law spiritually and to recognize His commands more clearly, as the
“chosen vessel” also declares very plainly this which we are insisting on. “For it is God which
worketh in you both to will and to do according to good will.”176 What could well be
clearer than the assertion that both our good will and the completion of our work are fully
wrought in us by the Lord? And again “For it is granted to you for Christ’s sake, not only
to believe in Him but also to suffer for Him.”177 Here also he declares that the beginning
of our conversion and faith, and the endurance of suffering is a gift to us from the Lord.
And David too, as he knows this, similarly prays that the same thing may be granted to him
by God’s mercy. “Strengthen, O God, that which Thou hast wrought in us:”178 showing that
it is not enough for the beginning of our salvation to be granted by the gift and grace of
God, unless it has been continued and ended by the same pity and continual help from Him.
For not free will but the Lord “looseth them that are bound.” No strength of ours, but the
Lord “raiseth them that are fallen:” no diligence in reading, but “the Lord enlightens the
blind:” where the Greeks have κύριος σοφοῖ τυφλούς, i.e., “the Lord maketh wise the blind:”
no care on our part, but “the Lord careth for the stranger:” no courage of ours, but “the Lord
assists (or supports) all those who are down.”179 But this we say, not to slight our zeal and
efforts and diligence, as if they were applied unnecessarily and foolishly, but that we may
know that we cannot strive without the help of God, nor can our efforts be of any use in
securing the great reward of purity, unless it has been granted to us by the assistance and
mercy of the Lord: for “a horse is prepared for the day of battle: but help cometh from the

Lord,”180 “for no man can prevail by strength.”181 We ought then always to sing with the
blessed David: “My strength and my praise is” not my free will, but “the Lord, and He is
become my salvation.”182 And the teacher of the Gentiles was not ignorant of this when he
declared that he was made capable of the ministry of the New Testament not by his own
merits or efforts but by the mercy of God. “Not” says he, “that we are capable of thinking
anything of ourselves as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, which can be put in less
good Latin but more forcibly, “our capability is of God,” and then there follows: “Who also
made us capable ministers of the New Testament.”183</p>

<head>That faith itself must be given us by the Lord.</head>
<p>But so thoroughly did the Apostles realize that everything which concerns salvation
was given them by the Lord, that they even asked that faith itself should be granted from
the Lord, saying: “Add to us faith”184 as they did not imagine that it could be gained by free
will, but believed that it would be bestowed by the free gift of God. Lastly the Author of
man’s salvation teaches us how feeble and weak and insufficient our faith would be unless
it were strengthened by the aid of the Lord, when He says to Peter “Simon, Simon, behold
Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed to my
Father that thy faith fail not.”185 And another finding that this was happening in his own
case, and seeing that his faith was being driven by the waves of unbelief on the rocks which
would cause a fearful shipwreck, asks of the same Lord an aid to his faith, saying “Lord, help
mine unbelief.”186 So thoroughly then did those Apostles and men in the gospel realize that
everything which is good is brought to perfection by the aid of the Lord, and not imagine
that they could preserve their faith unharmed by their own strength or free will that they
prayed that it might be helped or granted to them by the Lord. And if in Peter’s case there
was need of the Lord’s help that it might not fail, who will be so presumptuous and blind
as to fancy that he has no need of daily assistance from the Lord in order to preserve it? Es-
pecially as the Lord Himself has made this clear in the gospel, saying: “As the branch cannot
bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, so no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”187
And again: “for without me ye can do nothing.”188 How foolish and wicked then it is to attribute
any good action to our own diligence and not to God’s grace and assistance, is clearly
shown by the Lord’s saying, which lays down that no one can show forth the fruits of the
Spirit without His inspiration and co-operation. For “every good gift and every perfect boon
is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.”189 And Zechariah too says, “For
whatever is good is His, and what is excellent is from Him.”190 And so the blessed Apostle
consistently says: “What hast thou which thou didst not receive? But if thou didst receive
it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?”191</p>

<p>That temperateness and the endurance of temptations must be given to us by the Lord.</p>
<p>And that all the endurance, with which we can bear the temptations brought upon us,
depends not so much on our own strength as on the mercy and guidance of God, the blessed
Apostle thus declares: “No temptation hath come upon you but such as is common to man.
But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will
with the temptation make also a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”192 And that
God fits and strengthens our souls for every good work, and worketh in us all those things
which are pleasing to Him, the same Apostle teaches: “May the God of peace who brought
out of darkness the great Shepherd of the sheep, Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting
Testament, fit you in all goodness, working in you what is well-pleasing in His sight.”193
And that the same thing may happen to the Thessalonians he prays as follows, saying: “Now
our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father who hath loved us and hath given us
everlasting consolation and good hope in grace, exhort your hearts, and confirm you in
every good word and work.”194</p>

<head>That the continual fear of God must be bestowed on us by the Lord.</head>
<p>And lastly the prophet Jeremiah, speaking in the person of God, clearly testifies that
even the fear of God, by which we can hold fast to Him, is shed upon us by the Lord: saying
as follows: “And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me all days:
and that it may be well with them and with their children after them. And I will make an
everlasting covenant with them and will not cease to do them good: and I will give My fear
in their hearts that they may not revolt from Me.”195 Ezekiel also says: “And I will give them
one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out
of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh: that they may walk in My commandments,
and keep My judgments and do them: and that they may be My people, and I may be their
God.”196</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>That the beginning of our good will and its completion comes from God.</head>
<p>And this plainly teaches us that the beginning of our good will is given to us by the inspiration
of the Lord, when He draws us towards the way of salvation either by His own act,
or by the exhortations of some man, or by compulsion; and that the consummation of our
good deeds is granted by Him in the same way: but that it is in our own power to follow up
the encouragement and assistance of God with more or less zeal, and that accordingly we
are rightly visited either with reward or with punishment, because we have been either
careless or careful to correspond to His design and providential arrangement made for us
with such kindly regard. And this is clearly and plainly described in Deuteronomy. “When,”
says he, “the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which thou art going to
possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Gergeshite,
and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations
much more numerous than thou art and stronger than thou, and the Lord thy God shall
have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league
with them. Neither shalt thou make marriage with them.”197 So then Scripture declares that
it is the free gift of God that they are brought into the land of promise, that many nations
are destroyed before them, that nations more numerous and mightier than the people of
Israel are given up into their hands. But whether Israel utterly destroys them, or whether it
preserves them alive and spares them, and whether or no it makes a league with them, and
makes marriages with them or not, it declares lies in their own power. And by this testimony
we can clearly see what we ought to ascribe to free will, and what to the design and daily
assistance of the Lord, and that it belongs to divine grace to give us opportunities of salvation
and prosperous undertakings and victory: but that it is ours to follow up the blessings which
God gives us with earnestness or indifference. And this same fact we see is plainly taught
in the healing of the blind men. For the fact that Jesus passed by them, was a free gift of
Divine providence and condescension. But the fact that they cried out and said “Have mercy
on us, Lord, thou son of David,”198 was an act of their own faith and belief. That they received
the sight of their eyes was a gift of Divine pity. But that after the reception of any blessing,
the grace of God, and the use of free will both remain, the case of the ten lepers, who were
all healed alike, shows us. For when one of them through goodness of will returned thanks,
the Lord looking for the nine, and praising the one, showed that He was ever anxious to
help even those who were unmindful of His kindness. For even this is a gift of His visitation;
<note type="footnote">197 Deut. vii. 1–3.</note>
<note type="footnote">198 S. Matt. xx. 31.</note>

viz., that he receives and commends the grateful one, and looks for and censures those who
are thankless.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>That nothing can be done in this world without God.</head>
<p>But it is right for us to hold with unswerving faith that nothing whatever is done in this
world without God. For we must acknowledge that everything is done either by His will or
by His permission, i.e., we must believe that whatever is good is carried out by the will of
God and by His aid, and whatever is the reverse is done by His permission, when the Divine
Protection is withdrawn from us for our sins and the hardness of our hearts, and suffers the
devil and the shameful passions of the body to lord it over us. And the words of the Apostle
most assuredly teach us this, when he says: “For this cause God delivered them up to
shameful passions:” and again: “Because they did not like to have God in their knowledge,
God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.”199
And the Lord Himself says by the prophet: “But My people did not hear My voice and Israel
did not obey me: Wherefore I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lusts. They shall walk
after their own inventions.”200</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>An objection on the power of free will.</head>
<p>Germanus: This passage very clearly shows the freedom of the will, where it is said “If
My people would have hearkened unto Me,” and elsewhere “But My people would not hear
My voice.”201 For when He says “If they would have heard” He shows that the decision to
yield or not to yield lay in their own power. How then is it true that our salvation does not
depend upon ourselves, if God Himself has given us the power either to hearken or not to
hearken?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22"> 
<pb n="811"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>The answer; viz., that our free will always has need of the help of the Lord.</head>
<p>Paphnutius: You have shrewdly enough noticed how it is said “If they would have
hearkened to Me:” but have not sufficiently considered either who it is who speaks to one
who does or does not hearken; or what follows: “I should soon have put down their enemies,
and laid My hand on those that trouble them.”202 Let no one then try by a false interpretation
to twist that which we brought forward to prove that nothing can be done without the Lord,
nor take it in support of free will, in such a way as to try to take away from man the grace
of God and His daily oversight, through this test: “But My people did not hear My voice,”
and again: “If My people would have hearkened unto Me, and if Israel would have walked
in My ways, etc.:” but let him consider that just as the power of free will is evidenced by the
disobedience of the people, so the daily oversight of God who declares and admonishes him
is also shown. For where He says “If My people would have hearkened unto Me” He clearly
implies that He had spoken to them before. And this the Lord was wont to do not only by
means of the written law, but also by daily exhortations, as this which is given by Isaiah:
“All day long have I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gain-saying people.”203
Both points then can be supported from this passage, where it says: “If My people would
have hearkened, and if Israel had walked in My ways, I should soon have put down their
enemies, and laid My hand on those that trouble them.” For just as free will is shown by the
disobedience of the people, so the government of God and His assistance is made clear by
the beginning and end of the verse, where He implies that He had spoken to them before,
and that afterwards He would put down their enemies, if they would have hearkened unto
Him. For we have no wish to do away with man’s free will by what we have said, but only
to establish the fact that the assistance and grace of God are necessary to it every day and
hour. When he had instructed us with this discourse Abbot Paphnutius dismissed us from
his cell before midnight in a state of contrition rather than of liveliness; insisting on this as
the chief lesson in his discourse; viz., that when we fancied that by making perfect the first
renunciation (which we were endeavouring to do with all our powers), we could climb the
heights of perfection, we should make the discovery that we had not yet even begun to dream
of the heights to which a monk can rise, since after we had learnt some few things about the
second renunciation, we should find out that we had not before this even heard a word of
the third stage, in which all perfection is comprised, and which in many ways far exceeds
these lower ones.</p>

<head>IV. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT DANIEL.
ON THE LUST OF THE FLESH AND OF THE SPIRIT.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="813"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the life of Abbot Daniel.</head>
<p>Among the other heroes of Christian philosophy we also knew Abbot Daniel, who was
not only the equal of those who dwelt in the desert of Scete in every sort of virtue, but was
specially marked by the grace of humility. This man on account of his purity and gentleness,
though in age the junior of most, was preferred to the office of the diaconate by the blessed
Paphnutius, presbyter in the same desert: for the blessed Paphnutius was so delighted with
his excellent qualities, that, as he knew that he was his equal in virtue and grace of life, he
was anxious also to make him his equal in the order of the priesthood. And since he could
not bear that he should remain any longer in an inferior office, and was also anxious to
provide a worthy successor to himself in his lifetime, he promoted him to the dignity of the
priesthood.204 He however relinquished nothing of his former customary humility, and
when the other was present, never took upon himself anything from his advance to a higher
order, but when Abbot Paphnutius was offering spiritual sacrifices, ever continued to act
as a deacon in the office of his former ministry. However, the blessed Paphnutius though
so great a saint as to possess the grace of foreknowledge in many matters, yet in this case
was disappointed of his hope of the succession and the choice he had made, for he himself
passed to God no long time after him whom he had prepared as his successor.</p>
<note type="footnote">204 Nothing further appears to be known of Daniel than what is here told us by Cassian. There has been some
discussion as to the action of Paphnutius in having him raised to the priesthood, as Cassian here narrates. Was
Paphnutius really a bishop, or is it a case of presbyterian orders, or do Cassian’s expressions merely mean that
Paphnutius procured his ordination first to the Diaconate and then to the Priesthood? Probably the latter, for
(1) all the evidence goes to show that presbyters had not the power of ordination; and (2) there are many instances,
in which it is said even of the laity that they “ordained” men to the ministry when all that can possibly be meant
is that they “procured their ordination;” further (3) it will be noticed that it is not even said that Paphnutius
ordained Daniel but merely that he “promoted” him to the priesthood; an expression which might equally well
be used of nomination as of actual ordination. See the subject discussed in Bingham’s Antiquities, Book II. c.
iii. § 7, and C. Gore’s “Church and the Ministry,” p. 374.</note>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>An investigation of the origin of a sudden change of feeling from inexpressible joy to extreme
dejection of mind.</head>
<p>So then we asked this blessed Daniel why it was that as we sat in the cells we were
sometimes filled with the utmost gladness of heart, together with inexpressible delight and
abundance of the holiest feelings, so that I will not say speech, but feeling could not follow
it, and pure prayers were readily breathed, and the mind being filled with spiritual fruits,
praying to God even in sleep could feel that its petitions rose lightly and powerfully to God:
and again, why it was that for no reason we were suddenly filled with the utmost grief, and
weighed down with unreasonable depression, so that we not only felt as if we ourselves were
overcome with such feelings, but also our cell grew dreadful, reading palled upon us, aye
and our very prayers were offered up unsteadily and vaguely, and almost as if we were intoxicated:
so that while we were groaning and endeavouring to restore ourselves to our former
disposition, our mind was unable to do this, and the more earnestly it sought to fix again
its gaze upon God, so was it the more vehemently carried away to wandering thoughts by
shifting aberrations and so utterly deprived of all spiritual fruits, as not to be capable of being
roused from this deadly slumber even by the desire of the kingdom of heaven, or by the fear
of hell held out to it. To this he replied.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>His answer to the question raised.</head>
<p>A threefold account of this mental dryness of which you speak has been given by the
Elders. For it comes either from carelessness on our part, or from the assaults of the devil,
or from the permission and allowance of the Lord. From carelessness on our part, when
through our own faults, coldness has come upon us, and we have behaved carelessly and
hastily, and owing to slothful idleness have fed on bad thoughts, and so make the ground
of our heart bring forth thorns and thistles; which spring up in it, and consequently make
us sterile, and powerless as regards all spiritual fruit and meditation. From the assaults of
the devil when, sometimes, while we are actually intent on good desires, our enemy with
crafty subtilty makes his way into our heart, and without our knowledge and against our
will we are drawn away from the best intentions.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
<pb n="816"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How there is a twofold reason for the permission and allowance of God.</head>
<p>But for God’s permission and allowance there is a twofold reason. First, that being for
a short time forsaken by the Lord, and observing with all humility the weakness of our own
heart, we may not be puffed up on account of the previous purity of heart. granted to us by
His visitation; and that by proving that when we are forsaken by Him we cannot possibly
recover our former state of purity and delight by any groanings and efforts of our own, we
may also learn that our previous gladness of heart resulted not from our own earnestness
but from His gift, and that for the present time it must be sought once more from His grace
and enlightenment. But a second reason for this allowance, is to prove our perseverance,
and steadfastness of mind, and real desires, and to show in us, with what purpose of heart,
or earnestness in prayer we seek for the return of the Holy Spirit, when He leaves us, and
also in order that when we discover with what efforts we must seek for that spiritual gladness—
when once it is lost—and the joy of purity, we may learn to preserve it more carefully,
when once it is secured, and to hold it with firmer grasp. For men are generally more careless
about keeping whatever they think can be easily replaced.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
<pb n="817"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How our efforts and exertions are of no use without God’s help.</head>
<p>And by this it is clearly shown that God’s grace and mercy always work in us what is
good, and that when it forsakes us, the efforts of the worker are useless, and that however
earnestly a man may strive, he cannot regain his former condition without His help, and
that this saying is constantly fulfilled in our case: that it is “not of him that willeth or runneth
but of God which hath mercy.”205 And this grace on the other hand sometimes does not
refuse to visit with that holy inspiration of which you spoke, and with an abundance of
spiritual thoughts, even the careless and indifferent; but inspires the unworthy, arouses the
slumberers, and enlightens those who are blinded by ignorance, and mercifully reproves us
and chastens us, shedding itself abroad in our hearts, that thus we may be stirred by the
compunction which He excites, and impelled to rise from the sleep of sloth. Lastly we are
often filled by His sudden visitation with sweet odours, beyond the power of human composition—
so that the soul is ravished with these delights, and caught up, as it were, into an
ecstasy of spirit, and becomes oblivious of the fact that it is still in the flesh.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>How it is sometimes to our advantage to be left by God.</head>
<p>But the blessed David recognizes that sometimes this departure of which we have spoken,
and (as it were) desertion by God may be to some extent to our advantage, so that he was
unwilling to pray, not that he might not be absolutely forsaken by God in anything (for he
was aware that this would have been disadvantageous both to himself and to human nature
in its course towards perfection) but he rather entreated that it might be in measure and
degree, saying “Forsake me not utterly”206 as if to say in other words: I know that thou dost
forsake thy saints to their advantage, in order to prove them, for in no other way could they
be tempted by the devil, unless they were for a little forsaken by Thee. And therefore I ask
not that Thou shouldest never forsake me, for it would not be well for me not to feel my
weakness and say “It is good for me that Thou hast brought me low”207 nor to have no opportunity
of fighting. And this I certainly should not have, if the Divine protection shielded
me incessantly and unbrokenly. For the devil will not dare to attack me while supported by
Thy defence, as he brings both against me and Thee this objection and complaint, which
he ever slanderously brings against Thy champions, “Does Job serve God for nought? Hast
not Thou made a fence for him and his house and all his substance round about?”208 But I
rather entreat that Thou forsake me not utterly—what the Greeks call ἕως σφόδρα, i.e., too
much. For, first, as it is advantageous to me for Thee to forsake me a little, that the steadfastness
of my love may be tried, so it is dangerous if Thou suffer me to be forsaken excessively
in proportion to my faults and what I deserve, since no power of man, if in temptation it is
forsaken for too long a time by Thine aid, can endure by its own steadfastness, and not
forthwith give in to the power of the enemy’s side, unless Thou Thyself, as Thou knowest
the strength of man, and moderatest his struggles, “Suffer us not to be tempted above that
we are able, but makest with the temptation a way of escape that we may be able to bear
it.”209 And something of this sort we read in the book of Judges was mystically designed in
the matter of the extermination of the spiritual nations which were opposed to Israel: “These
are the nations, which the Lord left that by them He might instruct Israel, that they might
learn to fight with their enemies,” and again shortly after: “And the Lord left them that He
might try Israel by them, whether they would hear the commandments of the Lord, which
He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses, or not.”210 And this conflict God

reserved for Israel, not from envy of their peace, or from a wish to hurt them, but because
He knew that it would be good for them that while they were always oppressed by the attacks
of those nations they might not cease to feel themselves in need of the aid of the Lord, and
for this reason might ever continue to meditate on Him and invoke His aid, and not grow
careless through lazy ease, and lose the habit of resisting, and the practice of virtue. For
again and again, men whom adversity could not overcome, have been cast down by freedom
from care and by prosperity.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of the value of the conflict which the Apostle makes to consist in the strife between the flesh
and the spirit.</head>
<p>This conflict too we read in the Apostle has for our good been placed in our members:
“For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh. But these two are
opposed to each other so that ye should not do what ye would.”211 You have here too a
contest as it were implanted in our bodies, by the action and arrangement of the Lord. For
when a thing exists in everybody universally and without the slightest exception, what else
can you think about it except that it belongs to the substance of human nature, since the
fall of the first man, as it were naturally: and when a thing is found to be congenital with
everybody, and to grow with their growth, how can we help believing that it was implanted
by the will of the Lord, not to injure them but to help them? But the reason of this conflict;
viz., of flesh and spirit, he tells us is this: that ye should not do what ye would.” And so, if
we fulfil what God arranged that we should not fulfil, i.e., that we should not do what we
liked, how can we help believing that it is bad for us? And this conflict implanted in us by
the arrangement of the Creator is in a way useful to us, and calls and urges us on to a higher
state: and if it ceased, most surely there would ensue on the other hand a peace that is fraught
with danger.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>A question, how it is that in the Apostle’s chapter, after he has spoken of the lusts of the flesh
and spirit opposing one another, he adds a third thing; viz., man’s will.</head>
<p>Germanus: Although some glimmer of the sense now seems clear to us, yet as we cannot
thoroughly grasp the Apostle’s meaning, we want you to explain this more clearly to us. For
the existence of three things seems to be indicated here: first, the struggle of the flesh against
the spirit, secondly the desire of the spirit against the flesh, and thirdly our own free will,
which seems to be placed between the two, and of which it is said: “Ye should not do what
ye will.” And on this subject though as I said we can gather some hints, from what you have
explained of the meaning, yet—since this conference gives the opportunity—we are anxious
to have it more fully explained to us.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"> 
<pb n="822"/>
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>The answer on the understanding of one who asks rightly.</head>
<p>Daniel: It belongs to the understanding to discern the distinctions and the drift of
questions; and it is a main part of knowledge to understand how ignorant you are. Wherefore
it is said that “if a fool asks questions, it will be accounted wisdom,”212 because, although
one who asks questions is ignorant of the answer to the question raised, yet as he wisely
asks, and learns what he does not know, this very fact will be counted as wisdom in him,
because he wisely discovers what he was ignorant of. According then to this division of
yours, it seems that in this passage the Apostle mentions three things, the lust of the flesh
against the spirit, and of the spirit against the flesh, the mutual struggle of which against
each other appears to have this as its cause and reason; viz., “that,” says he, “we should not
do what we would.” There remains then a fourth case, which you have overlooked; viz., that
we should do what we would not. Now then, we must first discover the meaning of those
two desires, i.e., of the flesh and spirit, and so next learn to discuss our free will, which is
placed between the two, and then lastly in the same way we can see what cannot belong to
our free will.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10"> 
<pb n="823"/>
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>That the word flesh is not used with one single meaning only.</head>
<p>We find that the word flesh is used in holy Scripture with many different meanings: for
sometimes it stands for the whole man, i.e., for that which consists of body and soul, as here
“And the Word was made flesh,”213 and “All flesh shall see the salvation of our God.”214
Sometimes it stands for sinful and carnal men, as here “My spirit shall not remain in those
men, because they are flesh.”215 Sometimes it is used for sins themselves, as here: “But ye
are not in the flesh but in the spirit,”216 and again “Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
kingdom of God:” lastly there follows, “Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.”217
Sometimes it stands for consanguinity and relationship, as here: “Behold we are thy bone
and thy flesh,”218 and the Apostle says: “If by any means I may provoke to emulation them
who are my flesh, and save some of them.”219 We must therefore inquire in which of these
four meanings we ought to take the word flesh in this place, for it is clear that it cannot
possibly stand as in the passage where it is said “The Word was made flesh,” and “All flesh
shall see the salvation of God.” Neither can it have the same meaning as where it is said “My
Spirit shall not remain in those men because they are flesh,” because the word flesh is not
used here as it is there where it stands simply for a sinful man—when he says” The flesh
lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh.”220 Nor is he speaking of things
material, but of realities which in one and the same man struggle either at the same time or
separately, with the shifting and changing of time.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>What the Apostle means by flesh in this passage, and what the lust of the flesh is.</head>
<p>Wherefore in this passage we ought to take “flesh” as meaning not man, i.e., his material
substance, but the carnal will and evil desires, just as “spirit” does not mean anything
material, but the good and spiritual desires of the soul: a meaning which the blessed Apostle
has clearly given just before, where he begins: “But I say, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not
fulfil the desires of the flesh; for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the
flesh: but these are contrary the one to the other, that ye may not do what ye would.” And
since these two; viz., the desires of the flesh and of the spirit co-exist in one and the same
man, there arises an internal warfare daily carried on within us, while the lust of the flesh
which rushes blindly towards sin, revels in those delights which are connected with present
ease. And on the other hand the desire of the spirit is opposed to these, and wishes to be
entirely absorbed in spiritual efforts, so that it actually wants to be rid of even the necessary
uses of the flesh, longing to be so constantly taken up with these things as to desire to have
no share of anxiety about the weakness of the flesh. The flesh delights in wantonness and
lust: the spirit does not even tolerate natural desires. The one wants to have plenty of sleep,
and to be satiated with food: the other is nourished with vigils and fasting, so as to be unwilling
even to admit of sleep and food for the needful purposes of life. The one longs to be
enriched with plenty of everything, the other is satisfied even without the possession of a
daily supply of scanty food. The one seeks to look sleek by means of baths, and to be surrounded
every day by crowds of flatterers, the other delights in dirt and filth, and the solitude
of the inaccessible desert, and dreads the approach of all mortal men. The one lives on the
esteem and applause of men, the other glories in injuries offered to it, and in persecutions.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12"> 
<pb n="825"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>What is our free will, which stands in between the lust of the flesh and the spirit.</head>
<p>Between these two desires then the free will of the soul stands in an intermediate position
somewhat worthy of blame, and neither delights in the excesses of sin, nor acquiesces in the
sorrows of virtue. Seeking to restrain itself from carnal passions in such a way as not nevertheless
to be willing to undergo the requisite suffering, and wanting to secure bodily chastity
without chastising the flesh, and to acquire purity of heart without the exertion of vigils,
and to abound in spiritual virtues together with carnal ease, and to attain the grace of patience
without the irritation of contradiction, and to practise the humility of Christ without the
loss of worldly honour, to aim at the simplicity of religion in conjunction with worldly
ambition, to serve Christ not without the praise and favour of men, to profess the strictness
which truth demands without giving the slightest offence to anybody: in a word, it is anxious
to pursue future blessings in such a way as not to lose present ones. And this free will would
never lead us to attain true perfection, but would plunge us into a most miserable condition
of lukewarmness, and make us like those who are rebuked by the Lord’s remonstrance in
the Apocalypse: “I know thy works, that thou art neither hot nor cold. I would that thou
wert hot or cold. But now thou art lukewarm, and I will forthwith spue thee out of my
mouth;”221 were it not that these contentions which rise up on both sides disturb and destroy
this condition of lukewarmness. For when we give in to this free will of ours and want to
let ourselves go in the direction of this slackness, at once the desires of the flesh start up,
and injure us with their sinful passions, and do not suffer us to continue in that state of
purity in which we delight, and allure us to that cold and thorny path of pleasure which we
have to dread. Again, if inflamed with fervour of spirit, we want to root out the works of
the flesh, and without any regard to human weakness try to raise ourselves altogether to
excessive efforts after virtue, the frailty of the flesh comes in, and recalls us and restrains us
from that over excess of spirit which is bad for us: and so the result is that as these two desires
are contradicting each other in a struggle of this kind, the soul’s free will, which does not
like either to give itself up entirely to carnal desires, nor to throw itself into the exertions
which virtue calls for, is tempered as it were by a fair balance, while this struggle between
the two hinders that more dangerous free will of the soul, and makes a sort of equitable
balance in the scales of our body, which marks out the limits of flesh and spirit most accurately,
and does not allow the mind inflamed with fervour of spirit to sway to the right hand,
nor the flesh to incline through the pricks of sin, to the left. And while this struggle goes on
day after day in us to our profit, we are driven most beneficially to come to that fourth stage
which we do not like, so as to gain purity of heart not by ease and carelessness, but by constant
<note type="footnote">221 Rev. iii. 15, 16.</note>

<pb n="826"/>
efforts and contrition of spirit; to retain our chastity of the flesh by prolonged fastings,
hunger, thirst, and watchfulness; to acquire purpose of heart by reading, vigils, constant
prayer and the wretchedness of solitude; to preserve patience by the endurance of tribulation;
to serve our Maker in the midst of blasphemies and abounding insults; to follow after truth
if need be amid the hatred of the world and its enmity; and while, with such a struggle going
on in our body, we are secured from slothful carelessness, and incited to that effort which
is against the grain, and to the desire for virtue, our proper balance is admirably secured,
and on one side the languid choice of our free will is tempered by fervour of spirit, and on
the other the frigid coldness of the flesh is moderated by a gentle warmth, and while the
desire of the spirit does not allow the mind to be dragged into unbridled licence, neither
does the weakness of the flesh allow the spirit to be drawn on to unreasonable aspirations
after holiness, lest in the one case incentives to all kinds of sins might arise, or in the other
the earliest of all sins might lift its head and wound us with a yet more fatal dart of pride:
but a due equilibrium will result from this struggle, and open to us a safe and secure path
of virtue between the two, and teach the soldier of Christ ever to walk on the King’s highway.
And thus the result will be that when, in consequence of the lukewarmness arising from
this sluggish will of which we have spoken, the mind has been more easily entangled in
carnal desires, it is checked by the desire of the spirit, which by no means acquiesces in
earthly sins; and again, if through over much feeling our spirit has been carried in unbounded
fervour and towards ill-considered and impossible heights, it is recalled by the weakness of
the flesh to sounder considerations and rising above the lukewarm condition of our free
will with due proportion and even course proceeds along the way of perfection. Something
of this sort we hear that the Lord ordained in the case of the building of that tower in the
book of Genesis, where a confusion of tongues suddenly sprang up, and put a stop to the
blasphemous and wicked attempts of men. For there would have remained there in opposition
to God, aye and against the interest of those who had begun to assail His Divine Majesty,
an agreement boding no good, unless by God’s providence the difference of languages,
raising disturbances among them, had forced them because of the variations of their words
to go on to a better condition, and a happy and valuable discord had recalled to salvation
those whom a ruinous union had driven to destruction, as when divisions arose they began
to experience human weakness of which when puffed up by their wicked plots they had
hitherto known nothing.</p>

<head>Of the advantage of the delay which results from the struggle between flesh and spirit.</head>
<p>But from the differences which this conflict causes, there arises a delay that is so far
advantageous to us, and from this struggle an adjournment that is for our good, so that
while through the resistance of the material body we are hindered from carrying out those
things which we have wickedly conceived with our minds, we are sometimes recalled to a
better mind either by penitence springing up, or by some better thoughts which usually
come to us when delay in carrying out things, and time for reflection intervene. Lastly, those
who, as we know, are not prevented from carrying out the desires of their free will by any
hindrances of the flesh, I mean devils and spiritual wickednesses, these, since they have
fallen from a higher and angelical state, we see are in a worse plight than men, much in as
much as (owing to the fact that opportunity is always present to gratify their desires) they
are not delayed from irrevocably performing whatever evil they have imagined because as
their mind is quick to conceive it, so their substance is ready and free to carry it out; and
while a short and easy method is given them of doing what they wish, no salutary second
thoughts come in to amend their wicked intention.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Of the incurable depravity of spiritual wickednesses.</head>
<p>For a spiritual substance and one that is not tied to any material flesh has no excuse for
an evil thought which arises within, and also shuts out forgiveness for its sin, because it is
not harassed as we are by incentives of the flesh without, to sin, but is simply inflamed by
the fault of a perverse will. And therefore its sin is without forgiveness and its weakness
without remedy. For as it falls through the allurements of no earthly matter, so it can find
no pardon or place for repentance. And from this we can clearly gather that this struggle
which arises in us of the flesh and spirit against each other is not merely harmless, but actually
extremely useful to us.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15"> 
<pb n="829"/>
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Of the value of the lust of the flesh against the spirit in our case.</head>
<p>To begin with, because it is an immediate reproof of our sloth and carelessness, and like
some energetic schoolmaster who never allows us to deviate from the line of strict discipline,
and if our carelessness has ever so little exceeded the limits of due gravity which become it,
it immediately excites us by the stimulus of desire, and chides us and recalls us to due
moderation. Secondly, because, in the matter of chastity and perfect purity, when by God’s
grace we see that we have been for some time kept from carnal pollution, in order that we
may not imagine that we can no longer be disturbed by the motions of the flesh and thereby
be elated and puffed up in our secret hearts as if we no longer bore about the corruption of
the flesh, it humbles and checks us, and reminds us by its pricks that we are but men.222
For as we ordinarily fall without much thought into other kinds of sins and those worse and
more harmful, and are not so easily ashamed of committing them, so in this particular one
the conscience is especially humbled, and by means of this illusion it is stung by the recollection
of passions that have been neglected, as it sees clearly that it is rendered unclean by
natural emotions, of which it knew nothing while it was still more unclean through spiritual
sins; and so coming back at once to the cure of its former sluggishness, it is warned both
that it ought not to trust in the attainments of purity in the past, which it sees to be lost by
ever so small a falling away from the Lord, and also that it cannot attain the gift of this
purity except by God’s grace alone, since actual experience somehow or other teaches us
that if we are anxious to reach abiding perfection of heart we must constantly endeavour to
obtain the virtue of humility.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>Of the excitements of the flesh, without the humiliation of which we should fall more grievously.</head>
<p>To the fact then that the pride which results from this purity would be more dangerous
than all sins and wickednesses, and that we should on that account gain no reward for any
height of perfect chastity, we may call as witnesses those powers of which we spoke before,
which since it is believed that they experience no such fleshly lusts, were cast down from
their high and heavenly estate in everlasting destruction simply from pride of heart. And
so we should be altogether hopelessly lukewarm, since we should have no warning of carelessness
on our part implanted either in our body or in our mind, nor should we ever strive
to reach the glow of perfection, or even keep to strict frugality and abstinence, were it not
that this excitement of the flesh springs up and humbles us and baffles us and makes us keen
and anxious about purifying ourselves from spiritual sins.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p>Of the lukewarmness of eunuchs.</p>
<p>Lastly, on this account in those who are Eunuchs, we often detect the existence of this
lukewarmness of mind, because, as they are so to speak free from the needs of the flesh, they
fancy that they have no need either of the trouble of bodily abstinence, or of contrition of
heart; and being rendered slack by this freedom from anxiety, they make no efforts either
truly to seek or to acquire perfection of heart or even purity from spiritual faults. And this
condition which is the result of their state in the flesh, becomes natural, which is altogether
a worse state. For he who passes from the state of coldness to that of lukewarmness is branded
by the Lord’s words as still more hateful.</p>

<p>The question what is the difference between the carnal and natural man.
Germanus: You have, it seems to us, very clearly shown the value of the struggle which
is raised between the flesh and spirit, so that we can believe that it can in a sort of way be
grasped by us; and therefore we want to have this also explained to us in the same way; viz.,
what is the difference between the carnal and the natural man, or how the natural man can
be worse than the carnal.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19"> 
<pb n="833"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<p>The answer concerning the threefold condition of souls.</p>
<p>Daniel: There are, according to the statements of Scripture, three kinds of souls; the
first is the carnal, the second the natural, and the third the spiritual: which we find are thus
described by the Apostle. For of the carnal he says: “I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for
you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.” And
again: “For whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal?”223
Concerning the natural he also speaks as follows: “But the natural man perceiveth not the
things that are of the spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him.” But concerning the spiritual:
“But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged by no man.”224 And again
“You who are spiritual instruct such ones in the spirit of meekness.”225 And so, though at
our renunciation we ceased to be carnal, i.e., we began to separate ourselves from intercourse
with those in the world, and to have nothing to do with open pollution of the flesh, we must
still be careful to strive with all our might to attain forthwith a spiritual condition, lest haply
we flatter ourselves because we seem as far as the outer man is concerned to have renounced
this world and got rid of the defilement of carnal fornication, as if by this we had reached
the heights of perfection; and thence become careless and indifferent about purifying
ourselves from other affections, and so being kept back between these two, become unable
to reach the stage of spiritual advancement; either because we think that it is amply sufficient
for our perfection if we seem to separate ourselves, as regards the outward man, from intercourse
with this world and from its pleasure, or because we are free from corruption and
carnal intercourse, and thus we find ourselves in that lukewarm condition which is considered
the worst of all, and discover that we are spued out of the mouth of the Lord, in accordance
with these words of His: “I would that thou wert hot or cold. But now thou art lukewarm
and I will begin to spue thee out of My mouth.”226 And not without good reason does the
Lord declare that those whom he has previously received in the bowels of His love, and who
have become shamefully lukewarm, shall be spued out and rejected from His bosom: in as
much as, though they might have yielded Him some health-giving subsistence, they preferred
to be torn away from His heart: thus becoming far worse than those who had never found
their way into the Lord’s mouth as food, just as we turn away with loathing from that which
nausea compels us to bring up. For whatever is cold is warmed when received into the mouth
and is received with satisfaction and good results. But whatever has been once rejected owing

to its miserable luke-warmness, we cannot—I will not say touch with the lips—but even
look on from a distance without the greatest disgust. Rightly then is he said to be worse,
because the carnal man, i.e., the worldly man and the heathen, is more readily brought to
saving conversion and to the heights of perfection than one who has been professed as a
monk, but has not, as his rule directs, laid hold on the way of perfection, and so has once
for all drawn back from that fire of spiritual fervour. For the former is at last broken down
by the sins of the flesh, and acknowledges his uncleanness, and in his compunction hastens
from carnal pollution to the fountain of true cleansing, and the heights of perfection, and
in his horror at that cold state of infidelity in which he finds himself, he is kindled with the
fire of the spirit and flies the more readily to perfection. For one who has, as we said, once
started with a lukewarm beginning, and has begun to abuse the name of monk, and who
has not laid hold on the way of this profession with the humility and fervour that he ought,
when once he is infected by this miserable plague, and is as it were unstrung by it, can no
longer of himself discern what is perfect nor learn from the admonitions of another. For he
says in his heart that which the Lord tells us: “Because I am rich and wealthy and want
nothing;” and so this which follows is at once applied to him: “But thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:”227 and he is so far in a worse condition than a
worldly man, because he has no idea that he is wretched or blind or naked or requires
cleansing, or needs to be directed and taught by any one; and on this account he receives
no sound advice as he does not realise that he is weighted with the name of monk, and is
lowered in the judgment of all, whereas, though everybody believes him to be a saint and
regards him as a servant of God, he must hereafter be subjected to a stricter judgment and
punishment. Lastly, why should we any longer linger over those things which we have sufficiently
discovered and proved by experience? We have often seen those who were cold
and carnal, i.e., worldly men and heathen, attain spiritual warmth: but lukewarm and “natural”
men never. And these too we read in the prophet are hated of the Lord, so that a charge
is given to spiritual and learned men to desist from warning and teaching them, and not to
sow the seed of the life-giving word in ground that is barren and unfruitful and choked by
noxious thorns; but that they should scorn this, and rather cultivate fallow ground, i.e., that
they should transfer all their care and teaching, and their zeal in the life-giving word to pagans
and worldly men: as we thus read: “Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and inhabitants
of Jerusalem: break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.”228</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of those who renounce the world but ill.</head>
<p>In the last place I am ashamed to say how we find that a large number have made their
renunciation in such a way that we find that they have altered nothing of their former sins
and habits, but only their state of life and worldly garb. For they are eager in amassing wealth
which they never had before, or else do not give up that which they had, or which is still
sadder, they actually strive to augment it under this excuse; viz., that they assert that it is
right that they should always support with it their relations or the brethren, or they hoard
it under pretence of starting congregations which they imagine that they can preside over
as Abbots. But if only they would sincerely seek after the way of perfection, they would
rather endeavour with all their might and main to attain to this: viz., that they might strip
themselves not only of their wealth but of all their former likings and occupations, and place
themselves unreservedly and entirely under the guidance of the Elders so as to have no
anxiety not merely about others, but even about themselves. But on the contrary we find
that while they are eager to be set over their brethren, they are never subject to their Elders
themselves, and, with pride for their starting point, while they are quite ready to teach others
they take no trouble to learn themselves or to practise what they are to teach: and so it is
sure to end in their becoming, as the Saviour said, “blind leaders of the blind” so that “both
fall into the ditch.”229 And this pride though there is only one kind of it, yet takes a twofold
form. One form continually puts on the appearance of seriousness and gravity, the other
breaks out with unbridled freedom into silly giggling and laughing. The former delights in
not talking: the latter thinks it hard to be kept to the restraint of silence, and has no scruples
about talking freely on matters that are unsuitable and foolish, while it is ashamed to be
thought inferior to or less well informed than others. The one on account of pride seeks
clerical office, the other looks down upon it, since it fancies that it is unsuitable or beneath
its former dignity and life and the deserts of its birth. And which of these two should be
accounted the worse each man must consider and decide for himself. At any rate the kind
of disobedience is one and the same, if a man breaks the Elder’s commands whether it be
owing to zeal in work, or to love of ease: and it is as hurtful to upset the rules of the monastery
for the sake of sleep, as it is for the sake of vigilance, and it is just the same to transgress the
Abbot’s orders in order to read, as it is to slight them in order to sleep: nor is there any difference
in the incentive to pride if you neglect a brother, whether it is because of your fast
or because of your breakfast: except that those faults which seem to show themselves under
the guise of virtues and in the form of spirituality are worse and less likely to be cured than
those which arise openly and from carnal pleasures. For these latter, like sicknesses which
<note type="footnote">229 Cf. S. Matt. xv. 14.</note>

<pb n="836"/>
are perfectly plain and visible, are grappled with and cured, while the former, since they are
covered under the cloak of virtue, remain uncured, and cause their victims to fall into a
more dangerous and deadly state of ill health.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21"> 
<pb n="837"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of those who having made light of great things busy themselves about trifles.</head>
<p>For how can we show how absurd it is that we see that some men after their first enthusiasm
of renunciation in which they forsook their estates and vast wealth and the service of
the world, and betook themselves to the monasteries, are still earnestly devoted to those
things which cannot altogether be cut off, and which we cannot do without in this state of
life, even though they are small and trifling things; so that in their case the anxiety about
these trifles is greater than their love of all their property. And it certainly will not profit
them much that they have disregarded greater riches and property, if they have only transferred
their affections (on account of which they were to make light of them) to small and
trifling things. For the sin of covetousness and avarice of which they cannot be guilty in the
matter of really valuable things, they retain with regard to commoner matters, and so show
that they have not got rid of their former greed but only changed its object. For if they are
too careful about their mats, baskets, blankets, books, and other trifles such as these, the
same passion holds them captive as before. And they actually guard and defend their rights
over them so jealously as to get angry with their brethren about them, and, what is worse,
they are not ashamed to quarrel over them. And being still troubled by the bad effects of
their former covetousness, they are not content to possess those things which the needs and
requirements of the body compel a monk to have, according to the common number and
measure, but here too they show the greediness of their heart, as they try to have those things
which they are obliged to use, better got up than the others; or, exceeding all due bounds,
keep as their special and peculiar property and guard from the touch of others that which
ought to belong to all the brethren alike. As if the difference of metals, and not the passion
of covetousness was what mattered; and as if it was wrong to be angry about big things,
while one might innocently be about trifling matters: and as if we had not given up all our
precious things just in order that we might learn more readily to think nothing about trifles!
For what difference does it make whether one gives way to covetousness in the matter of
large and splendid things, or in the matter of the merest trifles, except that we ought to think
a man so far worse if he has made light of great things and then is a slave to little things?
And so that sort of renunciation of the world does not attain perfection of heart, because
though it ranks as poverty it still keeps the mind of wealth.</p>

<head>V. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT SERAPION.
ON THE EIGHT PRINCIPAL FAULTS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="839"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Our arrival at Abbot Serapion’s cell, and inquiry on the different kinds of faults and the way
to overcome them.</head>
<p>In that assembly of Ancients and Elders was a man named Serapion,230 especially endowed
with the grace of discretion, whose Conference I think it is worth while to set down
in writing. For when we entreated him to discourse of the way to overcome our faults, so
that their origin and cause might be made clearer to us, he thus began.</p>
<note type="footnote">230 Serapion when young was a pupil of Theonas, and an anecdote of his youthful indulgence in good things
in secret has been already told in II. c. xi. Another story of him is given in XVIII. xi. One of this name is mentioned
by Palladius in the Lausiac History, c. lxxvi., and by Rufinus in the History of the Monks, c. xviii., where we are
told that he lived at Arsinöe, and that he had ten thousand monks subject to his rule; a number which Sozomen
also gives (H.E. VI. xxviii.). It is however, doubtful whether this Serapion of Arsinöe is the person whose Conference
Cassian here gives. Gazet identifies, Tillemont distinguishes the two. Jerome, it should be noticed, speaks
in Ep. cviii. (Epitaphium Paulæ) as if there was not only one of this name famous among the monks of Egypt
at that time.</note>

<head>Abbot Serapion’s enumeration of eight principal faults.</head>
<p>There are eight principal faults which attack mankind; viz., first gastrimargia, which
means gluttony, secondly fornication, thirdly philargyria, i.e., avarice or the love of money,
fourthly anger, fifthly dejection, sixthly acedia, i.e., listlessness or low spirits, seventhly
cenodoxia, i.e., boasting or vain glory; and eighthly pride.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of the two classes of faults and their fourfold manner of acting on us.</head>
<p>Of these faults then there are two classes. For they are either natural to us as gluttony,
or arise outside of nature as covetousness. But their manner of acting on us is fourfold. For
some cannot be consummated without an act on the part of the flesh, as gluttony and fornication,
while some can be completed without any bodily act, as pride and vainglory. Some
find the reasons for their being excited outside us, as covetousness and anger; others are
aroused by internal feelings, as accidie231 and dejection.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="842"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>A review of the passions of gluttony and fornication and their remedies.</head>
<p>And to make this clearer not only by a short discussion to the best of my ability, but by
Scripture proof as well, gluttony and fornication, though they exist in us naturally (for
sometimes they spring up without any incitement from the mind, and simply at the motion
and allurement of the flesh) yet if they are to be consummated, must find an external object,
and thus take effect only through bodily acts. For “every man is tempted of his own lust.
Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets
death.”232 For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had
material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted
without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: “If Thou art the Son of
God, command that these stones be made bread.”233 And it is clear to everybody that fornication
also is only completed by a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job:
“And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.”234 And so these two
faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require
bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind
is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess
or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification
of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by
means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene,
because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be
overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generally
that all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other
works of the flesh,235 yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly
we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual.
And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the
flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when
at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle
says: “In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will
of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.”236
But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind and not merely

<pb n="843"/>
contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it,
and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore
these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as
we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity,
to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions,
through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that
is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from
the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the
lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully
place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude,
lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse
with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly
desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke,
and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident,
and so they are cured with speedy remedies.</p>

<head>How our Lord alone was tempted without sin.</head>
<p>And so our Lord Jesus Christ, though declared by the Apostle’s word to have been
tempted in all points like as we are, is yet said to have been “without sin,”237 i.e., without
the infection of this appetite, as He knew nothing of incitements of carnal lust, with which
we are sure to be troubled even against our will and without our knowledge;238 for the
archangel thus describes the manner of His conception: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: therefore that which shall be
born of thee shall be called holy, the Son of God.”239</p>

direct propension to sin that we have, or that which is called by divines concupiscence. Such direct appetite for
what is sinful is the characteristic of our fallen and corrupt nature, and our Lord did not assume a corrupt, but
a sound humanity. Indeed, concupiscence, even prior to and independent of its gratification has of itself the
nature of sin; and therefore could not belong to a perfect Being. Our Lord had all the passions and affections
that legitimately belong to man; which passions and affections, tending as they do in their own natures to become
inordinate, constituted of themselves a state of trial; but the Church has regarded our Lord’s trial as consisting
in preserving ordinate affections from becoming inordinate, rather than in restraining desire proximate to sin
from gratification” (p. 97).</note>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the manner of the temptation in which our Lord was attacked by the devil.</head>
<p>For it was right that He who was in possession of the perfect image and likeness of God
should be Himself tempted through those passions, through which Adam also was tempted
while he still retained the image of God unbroken, that is, through gluttony, vainglory, pride;
and not through those in which he was by his own fault entangled and involved after the
transgression of the commandment, when the image and likeness of God was marred. For
it was gluttony through which he took the fruit of the forbidden tree, vainglory through
which it was said “Your eyes shall be opened,” and pride through which it was said “Ye shall
be as gods, knowing good and evil.”240 With these three sins then we read that the Lord our
Saviour was also tempted; with gluttony when the devil said to Him: “Command these stones
that they be made bread:” with vainglory: “If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down:”
with pride, when he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and
said: “All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me:”241 in order that
He might by His example teach us how we ought to vanquish the tempter when we are attacked
on the same lines of temptation as He was. And so both the former and the latter are
spoken of as Adam; the one being the first for destruction and death, and the other the first
for resurrection and life. Through the one the whole race of mankind is brought into condemnation,
through the other the whole race of mankind is set free. The one was fashioned
out of raw and unformed earth, the other was born of the Virgin Mary. In His case then
though it was fitting that He should undergo temptation, yet it was not necessary that He
should fail under it. Nor could He who had vanquished gluttony be tempted by fornication,
which springs from superfluity and gluttony as its root, with which even the first Adam
would not have been destroyed unless before its birth he had been deceived by the wiles of
the devil and fallen a victim to passion. And therefore the Son of God is not said absolutely
to have come “in the flesh of sin,” but “in the likeness of the flesh of sin,” because though
His was true flesh and He ate and drank and slept, and truly received the prints of the nails,
there was in Him no true sin inherited from the fall, but only what was something like it.
For He had no experience of the fiery darts of carnal lust, which in our case arise even against
our will, from the constitution of our natures, but He took upon Him something like this,
by sharing in our nature. For as He truly fulfilled every function which belongs to us, and
bore all human infirmities, He has consequently been considered to have been subject to
this feeling also, that He might appear through these infirmities to bear in His own flesh
the state even of this fault and sin. Lastly the devil only tempted Him to those sins, by which
<note type="footnote">240 Gen. iii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">241 Imaginarium.</note>

<pb n="846"/>
he had deceived the first Adam, inferring that He as man would similarly be deceived in
other matters if he found that He was overcome by those temptations by which he had
overthrown His predecessor. But as he was overthrown in the first encounter he was not
able to bring upon Him the second infirmity which had shot up as from the root of the first
fault. For he saw that He had not even admitted anything from which this infirmity might
take its rise, and it was idle to hope for the fruit of sin from Him, as he saw that He in no
sort of way received into Himself seeds or roots of it. Yet according to Luke, who places last
that temptation in which he uses the words “If Thou art the Son of God, cast Thyself
down,”242 we can understand this of the feeling of pride, so that that earlier one, which
Matthew places third, in which, as Luke the evangelist says, the devil showed Him all the
kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and promised them to Him, may be taken of
the feeling of covetousness, because after His victory over gluttony, he did not venture to
tempt Him to fornication, but passed on to covetousness, which he knew to be the root of
all evils,243 and when again vanquished in this, he did not dare attack Him with any of those
sins which follow, which, as he knew full well, spring from this as a root and source; and so
he passed on to the last passion; viz., pride, by which he knew that those who are perfect
and have overcome all other sins, can be affected, and owing to which he remembered that
he himself in his character of Lucifer, and many others too, had fallen from their heavenly
estate, without temptation from any of the preceding passions. In this order then which we
have mentioned, which is the one given by the evangelist Luke, there is an exact agreement
between the allurements and forms of the temptations by which that most crafty foe attacked
both the first and the second Adam. For to the one he said “Your eyes shall be opened;” to
the other “he showed all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.” In the one case
he said “Ye shall be as gods;” in the other, “If Thou art the Son of God.”244</p>

<head>How vainglory and pride can be consummated without any assistance from the body.</head>
<p>And to go on in the order which we proposed, with our account of the way in which
the other passions act (our analysis of which was obliged to be interrupted by this account
of gluttony and of the Lord’s temptation) vainglory and pride can be consummated even
without the slightest assistance from the body. For in what way do those passions need any
action of the flesh, which bring ample destruction on the soul they take captive simply by
its assent and wish to gain praise and glory from men? Or what act on the part of the body
was there in that pride of old in the case of the above mentioned Lucifer; as he only conceived
it in his heart and mind, as the prophet tells us: “Who saidst in thine heart: I will ascend
into heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of God. I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds, I will be like the most High.”245 And just as he had no one to stir him up to this
pride, so his thoughts alone were the authors of the sin when complete and of his eternal
fall; especially as no exercise of the dominion at which he aimed followed.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of covetousness, which is something outside our nature, and of the difference between it and
those faults which are natural to us.</head>
<p>Covetousness and anger, although they are not of the same character (for the former is
something outside our nature, while the latter seems to have as it were its seed plot within
us) yet they spring up in the same way, as in most instances they find the reasons for their
being stirred in something outside of us. For often men who are still rather weak complain
that they have fallen into these sins through irritation and the instigation of others, and are
plunged headlong into the passions of anger and covetousness by the provocation of other
people. But that covetousness is something outside our nature, we can clearly see from this;
viz., that it is proved not to have its first starting point inside us, nor does it originate in
what contributes to keeping body and soul together, and to the existence of life. For it is
plain that nothing belongs to the actual needs and necessities of our common life except
our daily meat and drink: but everything else, with whatever zeal and care we preserve it, is
shown to be something distinct from the wants of man by the needs of life itself. And so
this temptation, as being something outside our nature, only attacks those monks who are
but lukewarm and built on a bad foundation, whereas those which are natural to us do not
cease from troubling even the best of monks and those who dwell in solitude. And so far is
this shown to be true, that we find that there are some nations who are altogether free from
this passion of covetousness, because they have never by use and custom received into
themselves this fault and infirmity. And we believe that the old world before the flood was
for long ages ignorant of the madness of this desire. And in the case of each one of us who
makes his renunciation of the world a thorough one, we know that it is extirpated without
any difficulty, if, that is, a man gives up all his property, and seeks the monastic discipline
in such a way as not to allow himself to keep a single farthing. And we can find thousands
of men to bear witness to this, who in a single moment have given up all their property, and
have so thoroughly eradicated this passion as not to be in the slightest degree troubled by
it afterwards, though all their life long they have to fight against gluttony, and cannot be
safe from it without striving with the utmost watchfulness of heart and bodily abstinence.</p>

<head>How dejection and accidie generally arise without any external provocation, as in the case of
other faults.246</head>
<p>Dejection and accidie generally arise without any external provocation, like those others
of which we have been speaking: for we are well aware that they often harass solitaries, and
those who have settled themselves in the desert without any intercourse with other men,
and this in the most distressing way. And the truth of this any one who has lived in the
desert and made trial of the conflicts of the inner man, can easily prove by experience.</p>
<note type="footnote">246 Such is the heading which Gazet gives. Petschenig edits “De ira atque tristitia, quod inter accedentia vitia

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>How six of these faults are related, and the two which differ from them are akin to one another.</head>
<p>Of these eight faults then, although they are different in their origin and in their way of
affecting us, yet the six former; viz., gluttony, fornication, covetousness, anger, dejection,
accidie, have a sort of connexion with each other, and are, so to speak, linked together in a
chain, so that any excess of the one forms a starting point for the next. For from superfluity
of gluttony fornication is sure to spring, and from fornication covetousness, from covetousness
anger, from anger, dejection, and from dejection, accidie. And so we must fight against
them in the same way, and with the same methods: and having overcome one, we ought
always to enter the lists against the next. For a tall and spreading tree of a noxious kind will
the more easily be made to wither if the roots on which it depends have first been laid bare
or cut; and a pond of water which is dangerous will be dried up at once if the spring and
flowing channel which produce it are carefully stopped up. Wherefore in order to overcome
accidie, you must first get the better of dejection: in order to get rid of dejection, anger must
first be expelled: in order to quell anger, covetousness must be trampled under foot: in order
to root out covetousness, fornication must be checked: and in order to destroy fornication,
you must chastise the sin of gluttony. But the two remaining faults; viz., vainglory and pride,
are connected together in a somewhat similar way as the others of which we have spoken,
so that the growth of the one makes a starting point for the other (for superfluity of vainglory
produces an incentive to pride); but they are altogether different from the six former faults,
and are not joined in the same category with them, since not only is there no opportunity
given for them to spring up from these, but they are actually aroused in an entirely different
way and manner. For when these others have been eradicated these latter flourish the more
vigorously, and from the death of the others they shoot forth and grow up all the stronger:
and therefore we are attacked by these two faults in quite a different way. For we fall into
each one of those six faults at the moment when we have been overcome by the ones that
went before them; but into these two we are in danger of falling when we have proved victorious,
and above all after some splendid triumph. In the cases then of all faults just as they
spring up from the growth of those that go before them, so are they eradicated by getting
rid of the earlier ones. And in this way in order that pride may be driven out vainglory must
be stifled, and so if we always overcome the earlier ones, the later ones will be checked; and
through the extermination of those that lead the way, the rest of our passions will die down
without difficulty. And though these eight faults of which we have spoken are connected
and joined together in the way which we have shown, yet they may be more exactly divided
into four groups and sub-divisions. For to gluttony fornication is linked by a special tie: to
covetousness anger, to dejection accidie, and to vainglory pride is closely allied.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="851"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the origin and character of each of these faults.</head>
<p>And now, to speak about each kind of fault separately: of gluttony there are three sorts:
(1) that which drives a monk to eat before the proper and stated times; (2) that which cares
about filling the belly and gorging it with all kinds of food, and (3) that which is on the
lookout for dainties and delicacies. And these three sorts give a monk no little trouble, unless
he tries to free himself from all of them with the same care and scrupulousness. For just as
one should never venture to break one’s fast before the right time so we must utterly avoid
all greediness in eating, and the choice and dainty preparation of our food: for from these
three causes different but extremely dangerous conditions of the soul arise. For from the
first there springs up dislike of the monastery, and thence there grows up disgust and intolerance
of the life there, and this is sure to be soon followed by withdrawal and speedy departure
from it. By the second there are kindled the fiery darts of luxury and lasciviousness.
The third also weaves the entangling meshes of covetousness for the nets of its prisoners,
and ever hinders monks from following the perfect self-abnegation of Christ. And when
there are traces of this passion in us we can recognize them by this; viz., if we are kept to
dine by one of the brethren we are not content to eat our food with the relish which he has
prepared and offers to us, but take the unpardonable liberty of asking to have something
else poured over it or added to it, a thing which we should never do for three reasons: (1)
because the monastic mind ought always to be accustomed to practise endurance and abstinence,
and like the Apostle, to learn to be content in whatever state he is.247 For one who
is upset by taking an unsavoury morsel once and in a way, and who cannot even for a short
time overcome the delicacy of his appetite will never succeed in curbing the secret and more
important desires of the body; (2) because it sometimes happens that at the time our host
is out of that particular thing which we ask for, and we make him feel ashamed of the wants
and bareness of his table, by exposing his poverty which he would rather was only known
to God; (3) because sometimes other people do not care about the relish which we ask for,
and so it turns out that we are annoying most of them while intent on satisfying the desires
of our own palate. And on this account we must by all means avoid such a liberty. Of fornication
there are three sorts: (1) that which is accomplished by sexual intercourse; (2) that
which takes place without touching a woman, for which we read that Onan the son of the
patriarch Judah was smitten by the Lord; and which is termed by Scripture uncleanness: of
which the Apostle says: “But I say to the unmarried and to widows, that it is good for them
if they abide even as I. But if they do not contain let them marry: for it is better to marry
than to burn;”248 (3) that which is conceived in heart and mind, of which the Lord says in
<note type="footnote">247 Cf. Phil. iv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">248 1 Cor. vii. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="852"/>
the gospel: “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed
adultery with her in his heart.”249 And these three kinds the blessed Apostle tells us must
be stamped out in one and the same way. “Mortify,” says he, “your members which are upon
the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, etc.”250 And again of two of them he says to the
Ephesians: “Let fornication and uncleanness be not so much as named among you:” and
once more: “But know this that no fornicator or unclean person, or covetous person who
is an idolater hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.”251 And just as these
three must be avoided by us with equal care, so they one and all shut us out and exclude us
equally from the kingdom of Christ. Of covetousness there are three kinds: (1) That which
hinders renunciants from allowing themselves of be stripped of their goods and property;
(2) that which draws us to resume with excessive eagerness the possession of those things
which we have given away and distributed to the poor; (3) that which leads a man to covet
and procure what he never previously possessed. Of anger there are three kinds: one which
rages within, which is called in Greek θυμός; another which breaks out in word and deed
and action, which they term ὀργή: of which the Apostle speaks, saying “But now do ye lay
aside all anger and indignation;”252 the third, which is not like those in boiling over and
being done with in an hour, but which lasts for days and long periods, which is called μῆνις.
And all these three must be condemned by us with equal horror. Of dejection there are two
kinds: one, that which springs up when anger has died down, or is the result of some loss
we have incurred or of some purpose which has been hindered and interfered with; the
other, that which comes from unreasonable anxiety of mind or from despair. Of accidie
there are two kinds: one of which sends those affected by it to sleep; while the other makes
them forsake their cell and flee away. Of vainglory, although it takes various forms and
shapes, and is divided into different classes, yet there are two main kinds: (1) when we are
puffed up about carnal things and things visible, and (2) when we are inflamed with the
desire of vain praise for things spiritual and unseen.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>How vainglory may be useful to us.</head>
<p>But in one matter vainglory is found to be a useful thing for beginners. I mean by those
who are still troubled by carnal sins, as for instance, if, when they are troubled by the spirit
of fornication, they formed an idea of the dignity of the priesthood, or of reputation among
all men, by which they may be thought saints and immaculate: and so with these considerations
they repell the unclean suggestions of lust, as deeming them base and at least unworthy
of their rank and reputation; and so by means of a smaller evil they overcome a greater one.
For it is better for a man to be troubled by the sin of vainglory than for him to fall into the
desire for fornication, from which he either cannot recover at all or only with great difficulty
after he has fallen. And this thought is admirably expressed by one of the prophets speaking
in the person of God, and saying: “For My name’s sake I will remove My wrath afar off: and
with My praise I will bridle thee lest thou shouldest perish,”253 i.e., while you are enchained
by the praises of vainglory, you cannot possibly rush on into the depths of hell, or plunge
irrevocably into the commission of deadly sins. Nor need we wonder that this passion has
the power of checking anyone from rushing into the sin of fornication, since it has been
again and again proved by many examples that when once a man has been affected by its
poison and plague, it makes him utterly indefatigable, so that he scarcely feels a fast of even
two or three days. And we have often known some who are living in this desert, confessing
that when their home was in the monasteries of Syria they could without difficulty go for
five days without food, while now they are so overcome with hunger even by the third hour,
that they can scarcely keep on their daily fast to the ninth hour. And on this subject there
is a very neat answer of Abbot Macarius254 to one who asked him why he was troubled with
hunger as early as the third hour in the desert, when in the monastery he had often scorned
food for a whole week, without feeling hungry. “Because,” said he, “here there is nobody to
see your fast, and feed and support you with his praise of you: but there you grew fat on the
notice of others and the food of vainglory.” And of the way in which, as we said, the sin of
fornication is prevented by an attack of vainglory, there is an excellent and significant figure
in the book of Kings, where, when the children of Israel had been taken captive by Necho,
King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Assyria, came up and brought them back from the
borders of Egypt to their own country, not indeed meaning to restore them to their former
liberty and their native land, but meaning to carry them off to his own land and to transport
them to a still more distant country than the land of Egypt in which they had been prisoners.
And this illustration exactly applies to the case before us. For though there is less harm in
<note type="footnote">253 Is. xlviii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">254 Cf. note on the Institutes V. xli.</note>

<pb n="854"/>
yielding to the sin of vainglory than to fornication, yet it is more difficult to escape from
the dominion of vainglory. For somehow or other the prisoner who is carried off to a
greater distance, will have more difficulty in returning to his native land and the freedom
of his fathers, and the prophet’s rebuke will be deservedly aimed at him: “Wherefore art
thou grown old in a strange country?255 since a man is rightly said to have grown old in a
strange country, if he has not broken up the ground of his faults. Of pride there are two
kinds: (1) carnal, and (2) spiritual, which is the worse. For it especially attacks those who
are seen to have made progress in some good qualities.</p>

<head>Of the different ways in which all these faults assault us.</head>
<p>Although then these eight faults trouble all sorts of men, yet they do not attack them
all in the same way. For in one man the spirit of fornication holds the chief place: wrath
rides rough shod over another: over another vainglory claims dominion: in an other pride
holds the field: and though it is clear that we are all attacked by all of them, yet the difficulties
come to each of us in very different ways and manners.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Of the struggle into which we must enter against our faults, when they attack us.</head>
<p>Wherefore we must enter the lists against these faults in such a way that every one should
discover his besetting sin, and direct his main attack against it, directing all his care and
watchfulness of mind to guard against its assault, directing against it daily the weapons of
fasting, and at all times hurling against it the constant darts of sighs and groanings from the
heart, and employing against it the labours of vigils and the meditation of the heart, and
further pouring forth to God constant tears and prayers and continually and expressly
praying to be delivered from its attack. For it is impossible for a man to win a triumph over
any kind of passion, unless he has first clearly understood that he cannot possibly gain the
victory in the struggle with it by his own strength and efforts, although in order that he may
be rendered pure he must night and day persist in the utmost care and watchfulness. And
even when he feels that he has got rid of this fault, he should still search the inmost recesses
of his heart with the same purpose, and single out the worst fault which he can see among
those still there, and bring all the forces of the Spirit to bear against it in particular, and so
by always overcoming the stronger passions, he will gain a quick and easy victory over the
rest, because by a course of triumphs the soul is made more vigorous, and the fact that the
next conflict is with weaker passion insures him a readier success in the struggle: as is generally
the case with those who are wont to face all kinds of wild beasts in the presence of the
kings of this world, out of consideration for the rewards—a kind of spectacle which is generally
called “pancarpus.”256 Such men, I say, direct their first assault against whatever beasts
they see to be the strongest and fiercest, and when they have despatched these, then they
can more easily lay low the remaining ones, which are not so terrible and powerful. So too,
by always overcoming the stronger passions, as weaker ones take their place, a perfect victory
will be secured for us without any risk. Nor need we imagine that if any one grapples with
one fault in particular, and seems too careless about guarding against the attacks of others,
he will be easily wounded by a sudden assault, for this cannot possibly happen. For where
a man is anxious to cleanse his heart, and has steeled his heart’s purpose against the attack
of any one fault, it is impossible for him not to have a general dread of all other faults as
well, and take similar care of them. For if a man renders himself unworthy of the prize of
purity by contaminating himself with other faults, how can he possibly succeed in gaining
the victory over that one passion from which he is longing to be freed? But when the main
<note type="footnote">256 Pancarpus (πάγκαρπος). The word originally applied to an offering of all kinds of fruit. Cf. Tertullian ad

purpose of our heart has singled out one passion as the special object of its attack, we shall
pray about it more earnestly, and with special anxiety and fervour shall entreat that we may
be more especially on our guard against it and so succeed in gaining a speedy victory. For
the giver of the law himself teaches us that we ought to follow this plan in our conflicts and
not to trust in our own power; as he says: “Thou shalt not fear them because the Lord thy
God is in the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible: He will consume these nations in
thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether:
lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee. But the Lord thy God shall
deliver them in thy sight; and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.”257</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>How we can do nothing against our faults without the help of God, and how we should not
be puffed up by victories over them.</head>
<p>And that we ought not to be puffed up by victories over them he likewise charges us;
saying, “Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses and dwelt in them,
and shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver, and of all
things, thy heart be lifted up and thou remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee
out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; and was thy leader in the great and
terrible wilderness.”258 Solomon also says in Proverbs: “When thine enemy shall fall be not
glad, and in his ruin be not lifted up, lest the Lord see and it displease Him, and He turn
away His wrath from him,”259 i.e., lest He see thy pride of heart, and cease from attacking
him, and thou begin to be forsaken by Him and so once more to be troubled by that passion
which by God’s grace thou hadst previously overcome. For the prophet would not have
prayed in these words, “Deliver not up to beasts, O Lord, the soul that confesseth to Thee,”260
unless he had known that because of their pride of heart some were given over again to
those faults which they had overcome, in order that they might be humbled. Wherefore it
is well for us both to be certified by actual experience, and also to be instructed by countless
passages of Scripture, that we cannot possibly overcome such mighty foes in our own
strength, and unless supported by the aid of God alone; and that we ought always to refer
the whole of our victory each day to God Himself, as the Lord Himself also gives us instruction
by Moses on this very point: “Say not in thine heart when the Lord thy God shall have
destroyed them in thy sight: For my righteousness hath the Lord brought me in to possess
this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness. For it is not for thy
righteousness, and the uprightness of thine heart, that thou shalt go in to possess their lands:
but because they have done wickedly they are destroyed at thy coming in.”261 I ask what
could be said clearer in opposition to that impious notion and impertinence of ours, in
which we want to ascribe everything that we do to our own free will and our own exertions?
“Say not,” he tells us, “in thine heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in
thy sight: For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land.” To those
who have their eyes opened and their ears ready to hearken does not this plainly say: When
your struggle with carnal faults has gone well for you, and you see that you are free from

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>Of the meaning of the seven nations of whose lands Israel took possession, and the reason why
they are sometimes spoken of as “seven,” and sometimes as “many.”</p>
<p>These are the seven nations whose lands the Lord promised to give to the children of
Israel when they came out of Egypt. And everything which, as the Apostle says, happened
to them “in a figure”262 we ought to take as written for our correction. For so we read:
“When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to
possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashites,
and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven
nations much more numerous than thou art and much stronger than thou: and the Lord
thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them.”263 And the
reason that they are said to be much more numerous, is that faults are many more in number
than virtues and so in the list of them the nations are reckoned as seven in number, but
when the attack upon them is spoken of they are set down without their number being given,
for thus we read “And shall have destroyed many nations before thee.” For the race of carnal
passions which springs from this sevenfold incentive and root of sin, is more numerous
than that of Israel. For thence spring up murders, strifes, heresies, thefts, false witness,
blasphemy, surfeiting, drunkenness, back-biting, buffoonery, filthy conversation, lies, perjury,
foolish talking, scurrility, restlessness, greediness, bitterness, clamour, wrath, contempt,
murmuring, temptation, despair, and many other faults, which it would take too long to
describe. And if we are inclined to think these small matters, let us hear what the Apostle
thought about them, and what was his opinion of them: “Neither murmur ye,” says he, “as
some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer:” and of temptation: “Neither
let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents.”264 Of backbiting:
“Love not backbiting lest thou be rooted out.”265 And of despair: “Who despairing have
given themselves up to lasciviousness unto the working of all error, in uncleanness.”266 And
that clamour is condemned as well as anger and indignation and blasphemy, the words of
the same Apostle teach us as clearly as possible when he thus charges us: “Let all bitterness,
and anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy be put away from you with all
malice,”267 and many more things like these. And though these are far more numerous than

the virtues are, yet if those eight principal sins, from which we know that these naturally
proceed, are first overcome, all these at once sink down, and are destroyed together with
them with a lasting destruction. For from gluttony proceed surfeiting and drunkenness.
From fornication filthy conversation, scurrility, buffoonery and foolish talking. From covetousness,
lying, deceit, theft, perjury, the desire of filthy lucre, false witness, violence, inhumanity,
and greed. From anger, murders, clamour and indignation. From dejection, rancor,
cowardice, bitterness, despair. From accidie, laziness, sleepiness, rudeness, restlessness,
wandering about, instability both of mind and body, chattering, inquisitiveness. From
vainglory, contention, heresies, boasting and confidence in novelties. From pride, contempt,
envy, disobedience, blasphemy, murmuring, backbiting. And that all these plagues are
stronger than we, we can tell very plainly from the way in which they attack us. For the delight
in carnal passions wars more powerfully in our members than does the desire for virtue,
which is only gained with the greatest contrition of heart and body. But if you will only gaze
with the eyes of the spirit on those countless hosts of our foes, which the Apostle enumerates
where he says: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places,”268 and this which we find of the righteous man in the nineteenth Psalm: “A thousand
shall fall beside thee and ten thousand at thy right hand,”269 then you will clearly see that
they are far more numerous and more powerful than are we, carnal and earthly creatures
as we are, while to them is given a substance which is spiritual and incorporeal.</p>

<head>A question with regard to the comparison of seven nations with eight faults.</head>
<p>Germanus: How then is it that there are eight faults which assault us, when Moses
reckons the nations opposed to the people of Israel as seven, and how is it well for us to take
possession of the territory of our faults?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<pb n="863"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>Serapion: Everybody is perfectly agreed that there are eight principal faults which affect
a monk. And all of them are not included in the figure of the nations for this reason, because
in Deuteronomy Moses, or rather the Lord through him, was speaking to those who had
already gone forth from Egypt and been set free from one most powerful nation, I mean
that of the Egyptians. And we find that this figure holds good also in our case, as when we
have got clear of the snares of this world we are found to be free from gluttony, i.e., the sin
of the belly and palate; and like them we have a conflict against these seven remaining nations,
without taking account at all of the one which has been already overcome. And the land of
this nation was not given to Israel for a possession, but the command of the Lord ordained
that they should at once forsake it and go forth from it. And for this cause our fasts ought
to be made moderate, that there may be no need for us through excessive abstinence, which
results from weakness of the flesh and infirmity, to return again to the land of Egypt, i.e.,
to our former greed and carnal lust which we forsook when we made our renunciation of
this world. And this has happened in a figure, in those who after having gone forth into the
desert of virtue again hanker after the flesh pots over which they sat in Egypt.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
<pb n="864"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>The reason why one nation is to be forsaken, while seven are commanded to be destroyed.</head>
<p>But the reason why that nation in which the children of Israel were born, was bidden
not to be utterly destroyed but only to have its land forsaken, while it was commanded that
these seven nations were to be completely destroyed, is this: because however great may be
the ardour of spirit, inspired by which we have entered on the desert of virtues, yet we cannot
possibly free ourselves entirely from the neighbourhood of gluttony or from its service and,
so to speak, from daily intercourse with it. For the liking for delicacies and dainties will live
on as something natural and innate in us, even though we take pains to cut off all superfluous
appetites and desires, which, as they cannot be altogether destroyed, ought to be shunned
and avoided. For of these we read “Take no care for the flesh with its desires.”270 While then
we still retain the feeling for this care, which we are bidden not altogether to cut off, but to
keep without its desires, it is clear that we do not destroy the Egyptian nation but separate
ourselves in a sort of way from it, not thinking anything about luxuries and delicate feasts,
but, as the Apostle says, being “content with our daily food and clothing.”271 And this is
commanded in a figure in the law, in this way: “Thou shalt not abhor the Egyptian, because
thou wast a stranger in his land.”272 For necessary food is not refused to the body without
danger to it and sinfulness in the soul. But of those seven troublesome faults we must in
every possible way root out the affections from the inmost recesses of our souls. For of them
we read: “Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and blasphemy be put
away from you with all malice:” and again: “But fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness
let it not so much as be named among you, or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility.”
273 We can then cut out the roots of these faults which are grafted into our nature
from without while we cannot possibly cut off occasions of gluttony. For however far we
have advanced, we cannot help being what we were born. And that this is so we can show
not only from the lives of little people like ourselves but from the lives and customs of all
who have attained perfection, who even when they have got rid of incentives to all other
passions, and are retiring to the desert with perfect fervour of spirit and bodily abnegation,
yet still cannot do without thought for their daily meal and the preparation of their food
from year to year.</p>

<head>Of the nature of gluttony, which may be illustrated by the simile of the eagle.</head>
<p>An admirable illustration of this passion, with which a monk, however spiritual and
excellent, is sure to be hampered, is found in the simile of the eagle. For this bird when in
its flight on high it has soared above the highest clouds, and has withdrawn itself from the
eyes of all mortals and from the face of the whole earth, is yet compelled by the needs of the
belly to drop down and descend to the earth and feed upon carrion and dead bodies. And
this clearly shows that the spirit of gluttony cannot be altogether extirpated like all other
faults, nor be entirely destroyed like them, but that we can only hold down and check by
the power of the mind all incentives to it and all superfluous appetites.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of the lasting character of gluttony as described to some philosophers.</head>
<p>For the nature of this fault was admirably expressed under cover of the following puzzle
by one of the Elders in a discussion with some philosophers, who thought that they might
chaff him like a country bumpkin because of his Christian simplicity. “My father,” said he,
“left me in the clutches of a great many creditors. All the others I have paid in full, and have
freed myself from all their pressing claims; but one I cannot satisfy even by a daily payment.”
And when they could not see the meaning of the puzzle, and urgently begged him to explain
it: “I was,” said he, “in my natural condition, encompassed by a great many faults. But when
God inspired me with the longing to be free, I renounced this world, and at the same time
gave up all my property which I had inherited from my father, and so I satisfied them all
like pressing creditors, and freed myself entirely from them. But I was never able altogether
to get rid of the incentives to gluttony. For though I reduce the quantity of food which I
take to the smallest possible amount, yet I cannot avoid the force of its daily solicitations,
but must be perpetually ‘dunned’ by it, and be making as it were interminable payments by
continually satisfying it, and pay never ending toll at its demand.” Then they declared that
this man, whom they had till now despised as a booby and a country bumpkin, had thoroughly
grasped the first principles of philosophy, i.e., training in ethics, and they marvelled
that he could by the light of nature have learnt that which no schooling in this world could
have taught him, while they themselves with all their efforts and long course of training had
not learnt this. This is enough on gluttony in particular. Now let us return to the discourse
in which we had begun to consider the general relation of our faults to each other.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>How it was that God foretold to Abraham that Israel would have to drive out ten nations.</head>
<p>When the Lord was speaking with Abraham about the future (a point which you did
not ask about) we find that He did not enumerate seven nations, but ten, whose land He
promised to give to his seed.274 And this number is plainly made up by adding idolatry, and
blasphemy, to whose dominion, before the knowledge of God and the grace of Baptism,
both the irreligious hosts of the Gentiles and blasphemous ones of the Jews were subject,
while they dwelt in a spiritual Egypt. But when a man has made his renunciation and come
forth from thence, and having by God’s grace conquered gluttony, has come into the spiritual
wilderness, then he is free from the attacks of these three, and will only have to wage
war against those seven which Moses enumerates.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>How it is useful for us to take possession of their lands.</head>
<p>But the fact that we are bidden for our good to take possession of the countries of those
most wicked nations, may be understood in this way. Each fault has its own especial corner
in the heart, which it claims for itself in the recesses of the soul, and drives out Israel, i.e.,
the contemplation of holy and heavenly things, and never ceases to oppose them. For virtues
cannot possibly live side by side with faults. “For what participation hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?”275 But as soon as these
faults have been overcome by the people of Israel, i.e., by those virtues which war against
them, then at once the place in our heart which the spirit of concupiscence and fornication
had occupied, will be filled by chastity. That which wrath had held, will be claimed by patience.
That which had been occupied by a sorrow that worketh death, will be taken by a
godly sorrow and one full of joy. That which had been wasted by accidie, will at once be
tilled by courage. That which pride had trodden down will be ennobled by humility: and so
when each of these faults has been expelled, their places (that is the tendency towards them)
will be filled by the opposite virtues which are aptly termed the children of Israel, that is, of
the soul that seeth God:276 and when these have expelled all passions from the heart we may
believe that they have recovered their own possessions rather than invaded those of others.</p>

<head>How the lands from which the Canaanites were expelled, had been assigned to the seed of
Shem.</head>
<p>For, as an ancient tradition tells us,277 these same lands of the Canaanites into which
the children of Israel were brought, had been formerly allotted to the children of Shem at
the division of the world, and afterward the descendants of Ham wickedly invading them
with force and violence took possession of them. And in this the righteous judgment of God
is shown, as He expelled from the land of others these who had wrongfully taken possession
of them, and restored to those others the ancient property of their fathers which had been
assigned to their ancestors at the division of the world. And we can perfectly well see that
this figure holds good in our own case. For by nature God’s will assigned the possession of
our heart not to vices but to virtues, which, after the fall of Adam were driven out from their
own country by the sins which grew up, i.e., by the Canaanites; and so when by God’s grace
they are by our efforts and labour restored again to it, we may hold that they have not occupied
the territory of another, but rather have recovered their own country.</p>
<note type="footnote">277 The “ancient tradition” to which Cassian here alludes is given in the Clementine Recognitions I. xxix.,
xxx.; and in Epiphanius “Heresies,” c. lxvi. § 83, sq., where it is given as an answer to the Manichæan objection
against the cruelty and injustice of the extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Different passages of Scripture on the meaning of the eight faults.</head>
<p>And in reference to these eight faults we also have the following in the gospel: “But when
the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest and
findeth none. Then he saith, I will return to my house from whence I came out: and coming
he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished: then he goeth and taketh seven other spirits worse
than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is made worse
than the first.”278 Lo, just as in the former passages we read of seven nations besides that of
the Egyptians from which the children of Israel had gone forth, so here too seven unclean
spirits are said to return beside that one which we first hear of as going forth from the man.
And of this sevenfold incentive of sins Solomon gives the following account in Proverbs:
“If thine enemy speak loud to thee, do not agree to him because there are seven mischiefs
in his heart;”279 i.e., if the spirit of gluttony is overcome and begins to flatter you with having
humiliated it, asking in a sort of way that you would relax something of the fervour with
which you began, and yield to it something beyond what the due limits of abstinence, and
measure of strict severity would allow, do not you be overcome by its submission, nor return
in fancied security from its assaults, as you seem to have become for a time freed from carnal
desires, to your previous state of carelessness or former liking for good things. For through
this the spirit whom you have vanquished is saying “I will return to my house from whence
I came out,” and forthwith the seven spirits of sins which proceed from it will prove to you
more injurious than that passion which in the first instance you overcame, and will presently
drag you down to worse kinds of sins.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>How when we have got the better of the passion of gluttony we must take pains to gain all the
other virtues.</head>
<p>Wherefore while we are practising fasting and abstinence, we must be careful when we
have got the better of the passion of gluttony never to allow our mind to remain empty of
the virtues of which we stand in need; but we should the more earnestly fill the inmost recesses
of our heart with them for fear lest the spirit of concupiscence should return and find
us empty and void of them, and should not be content to secure an entrance there for himself
alone, but should bring in with him into our heart this sevenfold incentive of sins and make
our last state worse than the first. For the soul which boasts that it has renounced this world
with the eight faults that hold sway over it, will afterwards be fouler and more unclean and
visited with severer punishments, than it was when formerly it was at home in the world,
when it had taken upon itself neither the rules nor the name of monk. For these seven spirits
are said to be worse than the first which went forth, for this reason; because the love of good
things, i.e., gluttony would not be in itself harmful, were it not that it opened the door to
other passions; viz, to fornication, covetousness, anger, dejection, and pride, which are
clearly hurtful in themselves to the soul, and domineering over it. And therefore a man will
never be able to gain perfect purity, if he hopes to secure it by means of abstinence alone,
i.e., bodily fasting, unless he knows that he ought to practise it for this reason that when the
flesh is brought low by means of fasting, he may with greater ease enter the lists against
other faults, as the flesh has not been habituated to gluttony and surfeiting.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>That our battles are not fought with our faults in the same order as that in which they stand
in the list.</head>
<p>But you must know that our battles are not all fought in the same order, because, as we
mentioned that the attacks are not always made on us in the same way, each one of us ought
also to begin the battle with due regard to the character of the attack which is especially
made on him so that one man will have to fight his first battle against the fault which stands
third on the list, another against that which is fourth or fifth. And in proportion as faults
hold sway over us, and the character of their attack may demand, so we too ought to regulate
the order of our conflict, in such a way that the happy result of a victory and triumph succeeding
may insure our attainment of purity of heart and complete perfection.</p>
<p>Thus far did Abbot Serapion discourse to us of the nature of the eight principal faults,
and so clearly did he expound the different sorts of passions which are latent within us—the
origin and connexion of which, though we were daily tormented by them, we could never
before thoroughly understand and perceive—that we seemed almost to see them spread out
before our eyes as in a mirror.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="874"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Description of the wilderness, and the question about the death of the saints.</head>
<p>In the district of Palestine near the village of Tekoa which had the honour of producing
the prophet Amos,281 there is a vast desert which stretches far and wide as far as Arabia and
the dead sea, into which the streams of Jordan enter and are lost, and where are the ashes
of Sodom. In this district there lived for a long while monks of the most perfect life and
holiness, who were suddenly destroyed by an incursion of Saracen robbers:282 whose bodies
we knew were seized upon with the greatest veneration283 both by the Bishops of the
neighbourhood and by the whole populace of Arabia, and deposited among the relics of the
martyrs, so that swarms of people from two towns met, and made terrible war upon each
other, and in their struggle actually came to blows for the possession of the holy spoil, while
they strove among themselves with pious zeal as to which of them had the better claim to
bury them and keep their relics—the one party boasting of their vicinity to the place of their
abode, the other of the fact that they were near the place of their birth. But we were upset
by this and being disturbed either on our own account or on account of some of the brethren
who were in no small degree scandalized at it, inquired why men of such illustrious merits
and of so great virtues should be thus slain by robbers, and why the Lord permitted such a
crime to be committed against his servants, so as to give up into the hands of wicked men
those who were the admiration of everybody: and so in our grief we came to the holy
Theodore, a man who excelled in practical common sense. For he was living in Cellæ,284 a

“Saracenos vagos…qui universas gentes…incursant.” By the seventh century the name had become a

Nitria, and cut off by eighty intervening miles of desert from the wilderness of Scete where
we were living. And when we had made our complaint to him about the death of the men

suffered men of such worth to be killed in this way, so that those who ought to be able by

from the hands of wicked men (and asked) why it was that God allowed so great a crime to
be committed against his servants, then the blessed Theodore replied.</p>

<head>Abbot Theodore’s answer to the question proposed to him.</head>
<p>This question often exercises the minds of those who have not much faith or knowledge,
and imagine that the prizes and rewards of the saints (which are not given in this world, but
laid up for the future) are bestowed in the short space of this mortal life. But we whose hope
in Christ is not only in this life, for fear lest, as the Apostle says, we should be “of all men
most miserable”285 (because as we receive none of the promises in this world we should for
our unbelief lose them also in that to come) ought not wrongly to follow their ideas, lest
through ignorance of the true real explanation, we should hesitate and tremble and fail in
temptation, if we find ourselves given up to such men; and should ascribe to God injustice
or carelessness about the affairs of mankind—a thing which it is almost a sin to mention—because
He does not protect in their temptations men who are living an upright and holy life,
nor requite good men with good things and evil men with evil things in this world; and so
we should deserve to fall under the condemnation of those whom the prophet Zephaniah
rebukes, saying “who say in their hearts the Lord will not do good, nor will He do evil:”286
or at least be found among those of whom we are told that they blaspheme God with such
complaints as this: “Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such
please Him: for surely where is the God of judgment?”287 Adding further that blasphemy
which is described in the same way in what follows: “He laboureth in vain that serveth God,
and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinances, and walked sorrowful before the
Lord? Wherefore now we call the proud happy, for they that work wickedness are enriched,
and they have tempted God, and are preserved.”288 Wherefore that we may avoid this ignorance
which is the root and cause of this most deadly error, we ought in the first place to
know what is really good, and what is bad, and so finally if we grasp the true scriptural
meaning of these words, and not the false popular one, we shall escape being deceived by
the errors of unbelievers.</p>

<head>Of the three kinds of things there are in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent.</head>
<p>Altogether there are three kinds of things in the world; viz., good, bad, and indifferent.
And so we ought to know what is properly good, and what is bad, and what is indifferent,
that our faith may be supported by true knowledge and stand firm in all temptations. We
must then believe that in things which are merely human there is no real good except virtue
of soul alone, which leads us with unfeigned faith to things divine, and makes us constantly
adhere to that unchanging good. And on the other hand we ought not to call anything bad,
except sin alone, which separates us from the good God, and unites us to the evil devil. But
those things are indifferent which can be appropriated to either side according to the fancy
or wish of their owner, as for instance riches, power, honour, bodily strength, good health,
beauty, life itself, and death, poverty, bodily infirmities, injuries, and other things of the
same sort, which can contribute either to good or to evil as the character and fancy of their
owner directs. For riches are often serviceable for our good, as the Apostle says, who charges
“the rich of this world to be ready to give, to distribute to the needy, to lay up in store for
themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that” by this means “they may lay
hold on the true life.”289 And according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who
“make to themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon.”290 And again, they can be drawn
in the direction of what is bad when they are amassed only for the sake of hoarding them
or for a life of luxury, and are not employed to meet the wants of the poor. And that power
also and honour and bodily strength and good health are indifferent and available for either
(good or bad) can easily be shown from the fact that many of the Old Testament saints enjoyed
all these things and were in positions of great wealth and the highest honour, and
blessed with bodily strength, and yet are known to have been most acceptable to God. And
on the contrary those who have wrongfully abused these things and perverted them for their
own purposes are not without good reason punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings
shows us has often happened. And that even life and death are in themselves indifferent the
birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in the case of the one his life was so profitable to
himself that we are told that his birth brought joy to others also, as we read “And many shall
rejoice at his birth;”291 but of the life of the other it is said: “It were good for that man if he
had never been born.”292 Further it is said of the death of John and of all saints “Right dear
in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints:”293 but of that of Judas and men like him

“The death of the wicked is very evil.”294 And how useful bodily sickness sometimes may
be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar who was full of sores, shows us. For Scripture makes
mention of no other good qualities or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone; viz., that
he endured want and bodily sickness with the utmost patience, that he was deemed worthy
of the blessed lot of a place in Abraham’s bosom.295 And with regard to want and persecution
and injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful and necessary they are is clearly
proved by this fact; viz., that the saints not only never tried to avoid them, but actually either
sought them with all their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the friends of
God, and obtained the reward of eternal life, as the blessed Apostle chants: “For which cause
I delight myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses
for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in infirmity.”296
And therefore those who are exalted with the greatest riches and honours and powers of
this world, should not be deemed to have secured their chief good out of them (for this is
shown to consist only in virtue) but only something indifferent, because just as to good men
who use them well and properly they will be found to be useful and convenient (for they
afford them opportunities for good works and fruits which shall endure to eternal life), so
to those who wrongfully abuse their wealth, they are useless and out of place, and furnish
occasions of sin and death.</p>

<head>How evil cannot be forced on any one by another against his will.</head>
<p>Preserving then these distinctions clear and fixed, and knowing that there is nothing
good except virtue alone, and nothing bad except sin alone and separation from God, let us
now carefully consider whether God ever allows evil to be forced on his saints either by
Himself or by some one else. And you will certainly find that this never happens. For another
can never possibly force the evil of sin upon anyone, who does not consent and who resists,
but only on one who admits it into himself through sloth and the corrupt desire of his heart.
Finally, when the devil having exhausted all his wicked devices had tried to force upon the
blessed Job this evil of sin, and had not only stripped him of all his worldly goods, but also
after that terrible and utterly unlooked for calamity of bereavement through the death of
his seven children, had heaped upon him dreadful wounds and intolerable tortures from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he tried in vain to fasten on him the stain of
sin, because he remained steadfast through it all, never brought himself to consent to blasphemy.</p>

<head>An objection, how God Himself can be said to create evil.</head>
<p>Germanus: We often read in holy Scripture that God has created evil or brought it upon
men, as is this passage: “There is none beside Me. I am the Lord, and there is none else: I
form the light and create darkness, I make peace, and create evil.”297 And again: “Shall there
be evil in a city which the Lord hath not done?”298</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>The answer to the question proposed.</head>
<p>Theodore: Sometimes holy Scripture is wont by an improper use of terms to use “evils”
for “affliction;” not that these are properly and in their nature evils, but because they are
imagined to be evils by those on whom they are brought for their good. For when divine
judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men. For
when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who
are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an evil by those who have to
bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement
seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as the Apostle says:
“Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy but sorrow;
but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,”
and “whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth:
for what son is there whom the father doth not correct?”299 And so evils are sometimes
wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read: “And God repented of the evil which He had
said that He would do to them and He did it not.”300 And again: “For Thou, Lord, are gracious
and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to repent of the evil,”301 i.e., of the
sufferings and losses which Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And
another prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and certainly not through
any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their good, prays thus: “Add evils to them, O
Lord, add evils to the haughty ones of the earth;”302 and the Lord Himself says “Lo, I will
bring evils upon them,”303 i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they shall for the present be
chastened for their soul’s health, and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back
to Me whom in their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we cannot
possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer the occasions of eternal
bliss, and therefore (to return to the question raised) all those things, which are thought to
be brought upon us as evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted
as evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what he thinks, who brought
them upon us in his rage and fury, but what he makes them who endures them. And so
when death has been brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened
to him but a thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while to the good it is rest

and freedom from evils. “For death is rest to a man whose way is hidden.”304 And so a good
man does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime
of an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of eternal life) that which would
have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays the debt of man’s death, which must
be paid by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense
of a great reward.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>The answer to the foregoing question.</head>
<p>Theodore: We are talking about the actual qualities of things good and bad, and what
we call indifferent; and not about the characters of the men who do these things. Nor ought
any bad or wicked man to go unpunished because his evil deed was not able to do harm to
a good man. For the endurance and goodness of a righteous man are of no profit to the man
who is the cause of his death or suffering, but only to him who patiently endures what is
inflicted on him. And so the one is justly punished for savage cruelty, because he meant to
injure him, while the other nevertheless suffers no evil, because in the goodness of his heart
he patiently endures his temptation and sufferings, and so causes all those things, which
were inflicted upon him with evil intent, to turn out to his advantage, and to conduce to the
bliss of eternal life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>The case of Job who was tempted by the devil and of the Lord who was betrayed by Judas: and
how prosperity as well as adversity is advantageous to a good man.</head>
<p>For the patience of Job did not bring any gain to the devil, through making him a better
man by his temptations, but only to Job himself who endured them bravely; nor was Judas
granted freedom from eternal punishment, because his act of betrayal contributed to the
salvation of mankind. For we must not regard the result of the deed, but the purpose of the
doer. Wherefore we should always cling to this assertion; viz., that evil cannot be brought
upon a man by another, unless a man has admitted it by his sloth or feebleness of heart: as
the blessed Apostle confirms this opinion of ours in a verse of Scripture: “But we know that
all things work together for good to them that love God.”305 But by saying “All things work
together for good,” he includes everything alike, not only things fortunate, but also those
which seem to be misfortunes: through which the Apostle tells us in another place that he
himself has passed, when he says: “By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and
on the left,” i.e., “Through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as
deceivers and yet true, as sorrowful but always rejoicing, as needy and yet enriching many:”306
All those things then which are considered fortunate, and are called those “on the right
hand,” which the holy Apostle designates by the terms honour and good report; and those
too which are counted misfortunes, which he clearly means by dishonour and evil report,
and which he describes as “on the left hand,” become to the perfect man “the armour of
righteousness,” if when they are brought upon him, he bears them bravely: because, as he
fights with these, and uses those very weapons with which he seems to be attacked, and is
protected by them as by bow and sword and stout shield against those who bring these
things upon him, he secures the advantage of his patience and goodness, and obtains a grand
triumph of steadfastness by means of those very weapons of his enemies which are hurled
against him to kill him; and if only he is not elated by success or cast down by failure, but
ever marches straightforward on the king’s highway, and does not swerve from that state
of tranquillity as it were to the right hand, when joy overcomes him, nor let himself be
driven so to speak to the left hand, when misfortunes overwhelm him, and sorrow holds
sway. For “Much peace have they that love Thy law, and to them there is no stumbling
block.”307 But of those who shift about according to the character and changes of the several
chances which happen to them, we read: “But a fool will change like the moon.”308 For just

as it is said of men who are perfect and wise: “To them that love God all things work together
for good,”309 so of those who are weak and foolish it is declared that “everything is against
a foolish man,”310 for he gets no profit out of prosperity, nor does adversity make him any
better. For it requires as much goodness to bear sorrows bravely, as to be moderate in
prosperity: and it is quite certain that one who fails in one of these, will not bear up under
the other. But a man can be more easily overcome by prosperity than by misfortunes: for
these sometimes restrain men against their will and make them humble and through most
salutary sorrow cause them to sin less, and make them better: while prosperity puffs up the
mind with soothing but most pernicious flatteries and when men are secure in the prospect
of their happiness dashes them to the ground with a still greater destruction.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Of the excellence of the perfect man who is figuratively spoken of as ambidextrous.</head>
<p>Those are they then who are figuratively spoken of in holy Scripture as ἀμφοτεροδέξιον
, i.e., ambidextrous, as Ehud is described in the book of Judges “who used either hand as
the right311 hand.” And this power we also can spiritually acquire, if by making a right and
proper use of those things which are fortunate, and which seem to be “on the right hand,”
as well as of those which are unfortunate and as we call it “on the left hand,” we make them
both belong to the right side, so that whatever turns up proves in our case, to use the words
of the Apostle, “the armour of righteousness.” For we see that the inner man consists of two
parts, and if I may be allowed the expression, two hands, nor can any of the saints do without
that which we call the left hand: but by means of it the perfection of virtue is shown, where
a man by skilful use can turn both hands into right hands. And in order to make our
meaning clearer, the saint has for his right hand his spiritual achievements, in which he is
found when with fervent spirit he gets the better of his desires and passions, when he is free
from all attacks of the devil, and without any effort or difficulty rejects and cuts off all carnal
sins, when he is exalted above the earth and regards all things present and earthly as light
smoke or vain shadows, and scorns them as what is about to vanish away, when with an
overflowing heart he not only longs most intensely for the future but actually sees it the
more clearly, when he is more effectually fed on spiritual contemplations, when he sees
heavenly mysteries more brightly laid open to him, when he pours forth his prayers to God
with greater purity and readiness, when he is so inflamed with fervent of spirit as to pass
with the utmost readiness of soul to things invisible and eternal, so as scarcely to believe
that he any longer remains in the flesh. He has also a left hand, when he is entangled in the
toils of temptation, when he is inflamed with the heat of desire for carnal lusts, when he is
set on fire by emotion towards rage and anger, when he is overcome by being puffed up
with pride or vainglory, when he is oppressed by a sorrow that worketh death, when he is
shaken to pieces by the contrivances and attacks of accidie, and when he has lost all spiritual
warmth, and grows indifferent with a sort of lukewarmness and unreasonable grief so that
not only is he forsaken by good and kindling thoughts, but actually Psalms, prayer, reading,
and retirement in his cell all pall upon him, and all virtuous exercises seem by an intolerable
and horrible loathing to have lost their savour. And when a monk is troubled in this way,
then he knows that he is attacked “on the left hand.” Anyone therefore who is not at all
puffed up through the aid of vainglory by any of those things on the right hand which we
have mentioned, and who struggles manfully against those on the left hand, and does not
yield to despair and give in, but rather on the other hand seizes the armour of patience to
<note type="footnote">311 Judg. iii. 15, where the LXX. has ἀμφοτεροδέξιον.</note>

<pb n="888"/>
practise himself in virtue—this man can use both hands as right hands, and in each action
he proves triumphant and carries off the prize of victory from that condition on the left
hand as well as that on the right. Such, we read, was the reward which the blessed Job obtained
who was certainly crowned (for a victory) on the right hand, when he was the father of
seven sons and walked as a rich and wealthy man, and yet offered daily sacrifices to the Lord
for their purification, in his anxiety that they might prove acceptable and dear to God rather
than to himself, when his gates stood open to every stranger, when he was “feet to lame and
eyes to blind,”312 when the shoulders of the suffering were kept warm by the wool of his
sheep, when he was a father to orphans and a husband to widows, when he did not even in
his heart rejoice at the fall of his enemy. And again it was the same man who with still
greater virtue triumphed over adversity on the left hand, when deprived in one moment of
his seven sons he was not as a father overcome with bitter grief but as a true servant of God
rejoiced in the will of his Creator. When instead of being a wealthy man he became poor,
naked instead of rich, pining away instead of strong, despised and contemptible instead of
famous and honourable, and yet preserved his fortitude of mind unshaken, when, lastly,
bereft of all his wealth and substance he took up his abode on the dunghill, and like some
stern executioner of his own body scraped with a potsherd the matter that broke out, and
plunging his fingers deep into his wounds dragged out on every side masses of worms from
his limbs. And in all this he never fell into despair and blasphemy, nor murmured at all
against his Creator. Moreover also so little was he overcome by such a weight of bitter
temptations that the cloak which out of all his former property remained to cover his body,
and which alone could be saved from destruction by the devil because he was clothed with
it, he rent and cast off, and covered with it his nakedness which he voluntarily endured,
which the terrible robber had brought upon him. The hair of his head too, which was the
only thing left untouched out of all the remains of his former glory, he shaved and cast to
his tormentor, and cutting off even that which his savage foe had left to him he exulted over
him and mocked him with that celestial cry of his: “If we have received good at the hand of
the Lord, should we not also receive evil? Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked
shall I return thither. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the
Lord, so is it done; blessed be the name of the Lord.”313 I should also with good reason call
Joseph ambidextrous, as in prosperity he was very dear to his father, affectionate to his
brethren, acceptable to God; and in adversity was chaste, and faithful to the Lord, in prison
most kind to the prisoners, forgetful of wrongs, generous to his enemies; and to his brethren
who were envious of him and as far as lay in their powers, his murderers, he proved not
only affectionate but actually munificent. These men then and those who are like them are

<note type="footnote">313 Job ii. 10; i. 21.</note>

<pb n="889"/>
rightly termed ἀμφοτεροδέξιον , i.e., ambidextrous. For they can use either hand as the
right hand, and passing through those things which the Apostle enumerates can fairly say:
“Through the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, through honour
and dishonour, through evil report and good report, etc.” And of this right and left hand
Solomon speaks as follows in the Song of songs, in the person of the bride: “His left hand
is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.”314 And while this passage shows
that both are useful, yet it puts one under the head, because misfortunes ought to be subject
to the control of the heart, since they are only useful for this; viz., to train us for a time and
discipline us for our salvation and make us perfect in the matter of patience. But the right
hand she hopes will ever cling to her to cherish her and hold her fast in the blessed embrace
of the Bridegroom, and unite her to him indissolubly. We shall then be ambidextrous, when
neither abundance nor want affects us, and when the former does not entice us to the luxury
of a dangerous carelessness, while the latter does not draw us to despair, and complaining;
but when, giving thanks to God in either case alike, we gain one and the same advantage
out of good and bad fortune. And such that truly ambidextrous man, the teacher of the
Gentiles, testifies that he himself was, when he says: “For I have learnt in whatsoever state
I am, to be content therewith. I know both how to be brought low and I know how to abound:
everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound
and to suffer need. I can do all things in Him which strengtheneth me.”315</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the two kinds of trials, which come upon us in a three-fold way.</head>
<p>Well then, though we say that trial is twofold, i.e., in prosperity and in adversity, yet
you must know that all men are tried in three different ways. Often for their probation,
sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their sins deserve it. For their
probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many of the saints endured
countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by Moses:
“And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee
for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that
were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep His Commandments
or no:”316 and this which we find in the Psalms: “I proved thee at the waters of strife.”317
To Job also: “Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou mightest
be seen to be righteous?”318 But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones
for some small and venial sins, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them
over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the
prophet’s word, the “dross,” which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may
thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain
in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal
torments according to this saying: “Many are the tribulations of the righteous.”319 And:
“My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked
by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom
He receiveth. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are without
chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.”320 And in the
Apocalypse: “Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten.”321 To whom under the figure of
Jerusalem the following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: “For I will
utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume
thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent.”322
And for this life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: “Prove me, O Lord, and try me;
turn my reins and my heart.”323 Isaiah also, well knowing the value of this trial, says “O

Lord, correct us but with judgment: not in Thine anger.”324 And again: “I will give thanks
to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou hast
comforted me.”325 But as a punishment for sins, the blows of trial are inflicted, as where
the Lord threatens that He will send plagues upon the people of Israel: “I will send the teeth
of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:”326 and “In vain
have I struck your children: they have not received correction.”327 In the Psalms also: “Many
are the scourges of the sinners:”328 and in the gospel: “Behold thou art made whole: now
sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.”329 We find, it is true, a fourth way also
in which we know on the authority of Scripture that some sufferings are brought upon us
simply for the manifestation of the glory of God and His works, according to these words
of the gospel: “Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works of God might
be manifested in him:”330 and again: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of
God that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”331 There are also other sorts of vengeance,
with which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in this life, as
we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or above all, those of whom the
Apostle speaks: “Wherefore God gave them up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:”332
and this must be counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist says:
“They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.”333 For
they are not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by
plagues in this world, as “in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto
the working of all error unto uncleanness,”334 and as by hardening their hearts, and by
growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and
punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the
prophet: “I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were
as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,”335

and Jeremiah: “I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from
their ways.”336 And again: “Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast
bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than
the rock, they have refused to return.”337 And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of
this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of
their life, declares: “The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for
their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected
them.”338 And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary
cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted
all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: “set it empty upon burning coals, that it may
be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst
thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even
by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not
cleansed from thy filthiness.”339 Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving
cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in
a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement
of His, and so denounces them saying: “I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy
has departed from thee.”340 But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance
in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic
remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is sufficient—of them
it is said: “I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.”341 We are well aware that there
are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance which is inflicted on those who
have sinned grievously—not to expiate their crimes, nor wipe out the deserts of their sins,
but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were
inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel,
when the Divine reproof thus declares: “Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut
down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in
Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the
house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger,
and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab
die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat

him,”342 and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: “Thy dead body shall not
be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.”343 It was not that this short and momentary
punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made
the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from
the Lord,—or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by
their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also,
who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be
moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they
might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily
doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might
the more clearly see in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for
lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with
which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous
falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,344 and
in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion
of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the first found
out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an
example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that
anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were
postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of
the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials
and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were
saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us
return to it once more.</p>

<p>And so the mind of the upright man ought not to be like wax or any other soft material
which always yields to the shape of what presses on it, and is stamped with its form and
impress and keeps it until it takes another shape by having another seal stamped upon it;
and so it results that it never retains its own form but is turned and twisted about to correspond
to whatever is pressed upon it. But he should rather be like some stamp of hard steel,
that the mind may always keep its proper form and shape inviolate, and may stamp and
imprint on everything which occurs to it the marks of its own condition, while upon it itself
nothing that happens can leave any mark.</p>

<head>A question whether the mind can constantly continue in one and the same condition.</head>
<p>Germanus: But can our mind constantly preserve its condition unaltered, and always
continue in the same state?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14"> 
<pb n="896"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>The answer to the point raised by the questioner.</head>
<p>Theodore: It is needful that one must either, as the Apostle says, “be renewed in the
spirit of the mind,”345 and daily advance by “pressing forward to those things which are
before,”346 or, if one neglects to do this, the sure result will be to go back, and become worse
and worse. And therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one and the same state. Just
as when a man, by pulling hard, is trying to force a boat against the stream of a strong current
he must either stem the rush of the torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what
is higher up, or letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down stream. Wherefore it
will be a clear proof of our failure if we find that we have gained nothing more, nor should
we doubt but that we have altogether gone back, whenever we find that we have not advanced
upwards, because, as I said, the mind of man cannot possibly continue in the same condition,
nor so long as he is in the flesh will any of the saints ever reach the height of all virtues, so
that they continue unalterable. For something must either be added to them or taken away
from them, and in no creature can there be such perfection, as not to be subject to the feeling
of change; as we read in the book of Job: “What is man that he should be without spot, and
he that is born of a woman that he should appear just? Behold among His saints none is
unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in His sight.”347 For we confess that God only
is unchangeable, who alone is thus addressed by the prayer of the holy prophet “But Thou
art the same,”348 and who says of Himself “I am God, and I change not,”349 because He
alone is by nature always good, always full and perfect, and one to whom nothing can ever
be added, or from whom nothing can be taken away. And so we ought always with incessant
care and anxiety to give ourselves up to the acquirement of virtue, and constantly to occupy
ourselves with the practice of it, lest, if we cease to go forward, the result should immediately
be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue in one and the same condition,
I mean without receiving addition to or diminution of its good qualities. For to fail to gain
new ones, is to lose them, because when the desire of making progress ceases, there the
danger of going back is present.</p>

<head>How one loses by going away from one’s cell.</head>
<p>And so we ought always to remain shut up in our cell. For whenever a man has strayed
from it and returns fresh to it and begins again to live there he will be upset and disturbed.
For if he has let it go he cannot without difficulty and pains recover that fixed purpose of
mind, which he had gained when he remained in his cell; and as through this he has gone
back, he will not think anything of the advance which he has missed, and which he would
have secured if he had not allowed himself to leave his cell, but he will rather congratulate
himself if he finds that he has regained that condition from which he fell away. For just as
time once lost and gone cannot any more be recovered, so neither can those advantages
which have been missed be restored: for whatever earnest purpose of the mind there may
be afterwards, it will be the profit of the day then present, and the gain that belongs to the
time that then is, and will not make up for the gain that has been once for all lost.</p>

<head>How even celestial powers above are capable of change.</head>
<p>But that even the powers above are, as we said, subject to change is shown by those who
fell from their ranks through the fault of a corrupt will. Wherefore we ought not to think
that the nature of those is unchangeable, who remain in the blessed condition in which they
were created, simply because they were not in like manner led astray to choose the worse
part. For it is one thing to have a nature incapable of change, and another thing for a man
through the efforts of his virtue, and by guarding what is good through the grace of the
unchangeable God, to be kept from change. For everything that is secured or preserved by
care, can also be lost by carelessness. And so we read: “Call no man blessed before his
death,”350 because so long as a man is still engaged in the struggle, and if I may use the expression,
still wrestling—even though he generally conquers and carries off many prizes of
victory,—yet he can never be free from fear, and from the suspicion of an uncertain issue.
And therefore God alone is called unchangeable and good, as His goodness is not the result
of effort, but a natural possession, and so He cannot be anything but good. No virtue then
can be acquired by man without the possibility of change, but in order that when it once
exists it may be continually preserved, it must be watched over with the same care and diligence
with which it was acquired.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>That no one is dashed to the ground by a sudden fall.</head>
<p>But we must not imagine that anyone slips and comes to grief by a sudden fall, but that
he falls by a hopeless collapse either from being deceived by beginning his training badly,
or from the good qualities of his soul failing through a long course of carelessness of mind,
and so his faults gaining ground upon him little by little. For “loss goeth before destruction,
and an evil thought before a fall,”351 just as no house ever falls to the ground by a sudden
collapse, but only when there is some flaw of long standing in the foundation, or when by
long continued neglect of its inmates, what was at first only a little drip finds its way through,
and so the protecting walls are by degrees ruined, and in consequence of long standing
neglect the gap becomes larger, and break away, and in time the drenching storm and rain
pours in like a river: for “by slothfulness a building is cast down, and through the weakness
of hands the house shall drop through.”352 And that the same thing happens spiritually to
the soul the same Solomon thus tells us in other words, when he says: “water dripping drives
a man out of the house on a stormy day.”353 Elegantly then does he compare carelessness
of mind to a roof, and to tiles that have not been looked after, through which in the first
instance only very slight drippings (so to speak) of the passions make their way to the soul:
but if these are not heeded, as being but small and trifling, then the beams of virtues will
decay and be carried away by a great tempest of sins, through which “on a stormy day,” i.e.,
in the time of temptation, the devil’s attack will assail us, and the soul will be driven forth
from the abode of virtue, in which, as long as it preserved all watchful diligence, it had remained
as in a house that belonged to it.</p>
<p>And so when we had heard this, we were so immensely delighted with our spiritual repast,
that the mental pleasure with which we were filled by this conference outweighed the sorrow
which we had experienced before from the death of the saints. For not only were we instructed
in things about which we had been puzzled, but we also learnt from the raising of that
question some things, which our understanding had been too small for us to ask about.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>On the chastity of Abbot Serenus.354</head>
<p>As we desire to introduce to earnest minds the Abbot Serenus, a man of the greatest
holiness and continence, and one who answers like a mirror to his name, whom we admired
above all others with peculiar veneration, we think that we only carry out our desire by the
attempt to insert his conferences in our book. To this man beyond all other virtues, which
shone forth not merely in his actions and manners, but by God’s grace in his very look as
well, there was granted by a special blessing the gift of continence, so that he never felt
himself disturbed even by natural incitements even in sleep. And how it was that by the assistance
of God’s grace he attained such wondrous purity of the flesh, as it seems beyond
the conditions of human nature, I think that I ought first of all to explain.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The question of the aforesaid old man on the state of our thoughts.</head>
<p>This man then in his prayers by day and night, and in fasts and vigils unweariedly entreated
for inward chastity of heart and soul, and seeing that he had obtained what he wished
and prayed for, and that all the passions of carnal concupiscence in his heart were dead, was
roused as it were by the sweetest taste of purity, and inflamed by his zeal for chastity towards
a yet more ardent desire, and began to apply himself to stricter fasts and prayers that the
mortification of this passion which by God’s grace had been granted to his inner man, might
be extended also so as to include external purity, to such an extent that he might no longer
be affected by any simple and natural movement, such as is excited even in children and
infants. And by the experience of the gift he had obtained, which he knew he had secured
by no merit of his labours, but by the grace God, he was the more ardently stimulated to
obtain this also in like manner, as he believed that God could much more easily tear up by
the roots this incitement of the flesh, (which even by man’s art and skill is sometimes destroyed
by potions and remedies or by the use of the knife) since He had of His own free gift
conferred that purity of spirit which is a still greater thing, and which cannot be acquired
by human efforts and exertions. And when with unceasing supplications and tears he was
applying himself unweariedly to the petition he had commenced, there came to him an angel
in a vision by night, and seemed to open his belly, and to remove from his bowels a sort of
fiery fleshly humour, and to cast it away, and restore everything to its place as before; and
“lo” he said, “the incitements of your flesh are removed, and you may be sure that you have
this day obtained that lasting purity of body for which you have faithfully asked.” It will be
enough thus briefly to have told this of the grace of God which was granted to this famous
man in a special way. But I deem it unnecessary to say anything of those virtues which he
possessed in common with other good men, for fear lest that particular narrative on this
man’s name might seem to deprive others of that which is specially mentioned of him. Him
therefore, as we were inflamed with the greatest eagerness for conference with and instruction
from him, we arranged to visit in Lent; and when he had very quietly inquired of us of the
character of our thoughts and the state of our inner man, and what help we had got towards
its purity from our long stay in the desert, we approached him with these complaints:</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="903"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Our answer on the fickle character of our thoughts.</head>
<p>The time spent here, and the dwelling in solitude, and meditation, through which you
think that we ought to have attained perfection of the inner man, has only done this for us;
viz., teach us that which we are unable to be, without making us what we are trying to be.
Nor do we feel that by this knowledge we have acquired any fixed steadfastness of the purity
which we long for, or any strength and firmness; but only an increase of confusion and
shame: for though our meditation in all our discipline aims at this in our daily studies, and
endeavours from trembling beginnings to reach a sure and unwavering skill, and to begin
to know something of what originally it knew but vaguely or was altogether ignorant of,
and by advancing by sure steps (so to speak) towards the condition of that discipline, to
habituate itself perfectly to it without any difficulty, I find on the contrary that while I am
struggling in this desire for purity, I have only got far enough to know what I cannot be.
And hence I feel that nothing but trouble results to me from all this contrition of heart, so
that matter for tears is never wanting, and yet I do not cease to be what I ought not to be.
And so what is the good of having learnt what is best, if it cannot be attained even when
known? for when we have been feeling that the aim of our heart was directed towards what
we purposed, insensibly the mind returns to its previous wandering thoughts and slips back
with a more violent rush, and is taken up with daily distractions and incessantly drawn away
by numberless things that take it captive, so that we almost despair of the improvement
which we long for, and all these observances seem useless. Since the mind which every moment
wanders off vaguely, when it is brought back to the fear of God or spiritual contemplation,
before it is established in it, darts off and strays; and when we have been roused and
have discovered that it has wandered from the purpose set before it, and want to recall it to
the meditation from which it has strayed, and to bind it fast with the firmest purpose of
heart, as if with chains, while we are making the attempt it slips away from the inmost recesses
of the heart swifter than a snake. Wherefore we being inflamed by daily exercises of this
kind, and yet not seeing that we gain from them any strength and stability in heart are
overcome and in despair driven to this opinion; viz., to believe that it is from no fault of our
own but from a fault of our nature that these wanderings of mind are found in mankind.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 

<pb n="904"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>The discourse of the old man on the state of the soul and its excellence.</head>
<p>Serenus: It is dangerous to jump to a conclusion and lay down the law hastily on the
nature of anything before you have properly discussed the subject and considered its true
character. Nor should you, looking only at your own weakness, hazard a conjecture instead
of pronouncing a judgment based on the character and value of the practice itself, and others’
experience of it. For if anyone, who was ignorant of swimming but knew that the weight of
his body could not be supported by water, wished from the proof which his inexperience
afforded, to lay down that no one composed of solid flesh could possibly be supported on
the liquid element, we ought not therefore to think his opinion a true one, which he seemed
to bring forward in accordance with his own experience, since this can be shown to be not
merely not impossible but actually extremely easily done by others, by the clearest proofs
and ocular demonstration. And so the νοῦς, i.e., the mind, is defined as ἀεικίνητος καὶ
πολυκίνητος, i.e., ever shifting and very shifting: as it is thus described in the so called wisdom
of Solomon in other words: καὶ γεῶδες σκῆνος βρίθει νοῦν πολυφρόντιδα , i.e., “And the
earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth on many things.”355 This then in
accordance with its nature can never remain idle, but unless provision is made where it may
exercise its motions and have what will continually occupy it, it must by its own fickleness
wander about and stray over all kinds of things until, accustomed by long practice and daily
use—in which you say that you have toiled without result—it tries and learns what food for
the memory it ought to prepare, toward which it may bring back its unwearied flight and
acquire strength for remaining, and thus may succeed in driving away the hostile suggestion
of the enemy by which it is distracted, and in persisting in that state and condition which
it yearns for. We ought not then to ascribe this wandering inclination of our heart either to
human nature or to God its Creator. For it is a true statement of Scripture, that “God made
man upright; but they themselves found out many thoughts.”356 The character of these then
depends on us ourselves, for it says “a good thought comes near to those that know it, but
a prudent man will find it.”357 For where anything is subject to our prudence and industry
so that it can be found out, there if it is not found out, we ought certainly to set it down to
our own laziness or carelessness and not to the fault of our nature. And with this meaning
the Psalmist also is in agreement, when he says: “Blessed is the man whose help is from
Thee: in his heart he hath disposed his ascents.”358 You see then that it lies in our power to

dispose in our hearts either ascents, i.e., thoughts that belong to God, or descents; viz., those
that sink down to carnal and earthly things. And if this was not in our power the Lord would
not have rebuked the Pharisees, saying “Why do ye think evil in your hearts?”359 nor would
He have given this charge by the prophet, saying: “Take away the evil of your thoughts from
mine eyes;” and “How long shall wicked thoughts remain in you?”360 Nor would the character
of them as of our works be taken into consideration in the day of judgment in our case
as the Lord threatens by Isaiah: “Lo, I come to gather together their works and thoughts
together with all nations and tongues;”361 nor would it be right that we should be condemned
or defended by their evidence in that terrible and dreadful examination, as the blessed
Apostle says: “Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel.”362</p>

<head>On the perfection of the soul, as drawn from the comparison of the Centurion in the gospel.</head>
<p>Of this perfect mind then there is an excellent figure drawn in the case of the centurion
in the gospel; whose virtue and consistency, owing to which he was not led away by the rush
of thoughts, but in accordance with his own judgment either admitted such as were good,
or easily drove away those of the opposite character, are described in this tropical form:
“For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go,
and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he
doeth it.”363 If then we too strive manfully against disturbances and sins and can bring them
under our own control and discretion, and fight and destroy the passions in our flesh, and
bring under the sway of reason the swarm of our thoughts, and drive back from our breast
the terrible hosts of the powers opposed to us by the life-giving standard of the Lord’s cross,
we shall in reward for such triumphs be promoted to the rank of that centurion spiritually
understood, who, as we read in Exodus, was mystically pointed to by Moses: “Appoint for
thee rulers of thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties and of tens.”364 And so we too when
raised to the height of this dignity shall have the same right and power to command, so that
we shall not be carried away by thoughts against our will, but shall be able to continue in
and cling to those which spiritually delight us, commanding the evil suggestions to depart,
and they will depart, while to good ones we shall say “Come,” and they will come: and to
our servant also, i.e., the body, we shall in like manner enjoin what belongs to chastity and
continence, and it will serve us without any gainsaying, no longer arousing in us the hostile
incitements of concupiscence, but showing all subservience to the spirit. And what is the
character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed
Apostle declaring: “The arms,” he says “of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.”
He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to
God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: “Unto the pulling down
of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of
Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be
first fulfilled.”365 And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through
these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics,
as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the
Lord’s battles and to serve among the centurions of the gospel. “Take,” he says “the shield

<pb n="907"/>
of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.”366 Faith then
is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future
judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. “And the breastplate,” he says, “of charity.”367
This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is
exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and
does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it “endureth all
things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.”368 “And for an helmet the hope of salvation.”
369 The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always
in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come,
and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has
lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living
is extended to no one without a head. “And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of
God.”370 For it is “sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of
soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart:”371 as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in
us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and
ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive
and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: “Why
art thou grown old in a strange country?”372 But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror
in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and
courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not
carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves
brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. “Let,” says He, “the weak
say that I am strong;” and: “Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior.”373 You see then
that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord’s battles, weak indeed with that
weakness, founded on which that centurion of ours in the gospel said with confidence: “For
when I am weak, then am I strong,” and again, “for strength is made perfect in weakness.”374
Of which weakness one of the prophets says: “And he that is weak among them shall be as

<head>Of perseverance as regards care of the thoughts.</head>
<p>But we shall find out by our own experience that we can and ought to cling to the Lord
if we have our wills mortified and the desires of this world cut off, and we shall be taught
by the authority of those who in converse with the Lord say in all confidence: “My soul hath
stuck close to Thee;” and: “I have stuck unto Thy testimonies, O Lord;” and: “It is good for
me to stick fast to God;” and: “He who cleaveth to the Lord, is one spirit.”377 We ought not
then to be wearied out by these wanderings of mind and relax from our fervour: for “he that
tilleth his ground shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness shall be filled with
poverty.”378 Nor should we be drawn away from being intent on this watchfulness through
a dangerous despair, for “in every one who is anxious there is abundance, for he who is
pleasant and free from grief will be in want;” and again: “a man in grief labours for himself,
and forcibly brings about his own destruction.”379 Moreover also: “the kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence and the violent take it by force,”380 for no virtue is acquired without effort,
nor can anyone attain to that mental stability which he desires without great sorrow of heart,
for “man is born to trouble,”381 and in order that he may be able to attain to “the perfect
man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ”382 he must ever be on the watch
with still greater intentness, and toil with ceaseless carefulness. But to the fulness of this
measure no one will ever attain, but one who has considered it beforehand and been trained
to it now and has had some foretaste of it while still in this world, and being marked a most
precious member of Christ, has possessed in the flesh an earnest of that “joint”383 by which
he can be united to His body: desiring one thing alone, thirsting for but one thing, ever
bringing not only his acts but even his thoughts to bear on one thing alone; viz., that he may
even now keep as an earnest that which is said of the blessed life of the saints hereafter; viz.,
that “God may be” to him “all in all.”384</p>

<head>A question on the roving tendency of the mind and the attacks of spiritual wickedness.</head>
<p>Germanus: Perhaps this tendency of the mind to rove might to some extent be checked
were it not that so great a swam of enemies surrounded it, and ceaselessly urged it toward
what it has no wish for, or rather whither the roving character of its own nature drives it.
And since such numberless foes, and those so powerful and terrible, surround it, we should
not fancy that it was possible for them to be withstood especially by this weak flesh of ours,
were we not encouraged to this view by your words as if by oracles from heaven.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>The answer on the help of God and the power of free will.</head>
<p>Serenus: No one who has experienced the conflicts of the inner man, can doubt that
our foes are continually lying in wait for us. But we mean that they oppose our progress in
such a way that we can think of them as only inciting to evil things and not forcing. But no
one could altogether avoid whatever sin they were inclined to imprint upon our hearts, if a
strong impulse was present to force (evil) upon us, just as it is to suggest it. Wherefore as
there is in them ample power of inciting, so in us there is a supply of power of rejection,
and of liberty of acquiescing. But if we are afraid of their power and assaults, we may also
claim the protection and assistance of God against them, of which we read: “For greater is
He who is in us than he who is in this world:”385 and His aid fights on our side with much
greater power than their hosts fight against us; for God is not only the suggester of what is
good, but the maintainer and insister of it, so that sometimes He draws us towards salvation
even against our will and without our knowing it. It follows then that no one can be deceived
by the devil but one who has chosen to yield to him the consent of his own will: as Ecclesiastes
clearly puts it in these words: “For since there is no gainsaying by those who do evil
speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is filled within them to do evil.”386 It is
therefore clear that each man goes wrong from this; viz., that when evil thoughts assault
him he does not immediately meet them with refusal and contradiction, for it says: “resist
him, and he will flee from you.”387</p>

<head>A question on the union of the soul with devils.</head>
<p>Germanus: What, I pray you, is that indiscriminate and common union of the soul with
those evil spirits, by which it is possible for them to be (I will not say joined with but) united
to it in such a way that they can imperceptibly talk with it, and find their way into it and
suggest to it whatever they want, and incite it to whatever they like, and look into and see
its thoughts and movements; and the result is so close a union between them and the soul
that it is almost impossible without God’s grace to distinguish between what results from
their instigation, and what from our free will.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>The answer how unclean spirits are united with human souls.</head>
<p>Serenus: It is no wonder that spirit can be imperceptibly joined with spirit, and exercise
an unseen power of persuasion toward what is allowed to it. For there is between them (just
as between men) some sort of similarity and kinship of substance, since the description
which is given of the nature of the soul, applies equally well to their substance. But it is impossible
for spirits to be implanted in spirits inwardly or united with them in such a way
that one can hold the other; for this is the true prerogative of Deity alone, which is the only
simple and incorporeal nature.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>An objection whether unclean spirits can be present in or united with the souls of those whom
they have filled.</head>
<p>Germanus: To this idea we think that what we see happen in the case of those possessed
is sufficiently opposed, when they say and do what they know not under the influence of
the spirits. How then are we to refuse to believe that their souls are not united to those
spirits, when we see them made their instruments, and (forsaking their natural condition)
yielding to their movements and moods, in such a way that they give expression no longer
to their own words and actions and wishes, but to those of the demons?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12"> 
<pb n="915"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The answer how it is that unclean spirits can lord it over those possessed.</head>
<p>Serenus: What you speak of as taking place in the case of demoniacs is not opposed to
our assertion; viz., that those possessed by unclean spirits say and do what they do not want
to, and are forced to utter what they know not; for it is perfectly clear that they are not
subject to the entrance of the spirits all in the same way: for some are affected by them in
such a way as to have not the slightest conception of what they do and say, while others
know and afterwards recollect it. But we must not imagine that this is done by the infusion
of the spirit in such a way that it penetrates into the actual substance of the soul and, being
as it were united to it and somehow clothed with it, utters words and sayings through the
mouth of the sufferer. For we ought not to believe that this can possibly be done by them.
For we can clearly see that this results from no loss of the soul but from weakness of the
body, when the unclean spirit seizes on those members in which the vigour of the soul
resides, and laying on them an enormous and intolerable weight overwhelms it with foulest
darkness, and interferes with its intellectual powers: as we see sometimes happen also from
the fault of wine and fever or excessive cold, and other indispositions affecting men from
without; and it was this which the devil was forbidden to attempt to inflict on the blessed
Job, though he had received power over his flesh, when the Lord commanded him saying:
“Lo, I give him into thine hands: only preserve his soul,”388 i.e., do not weaken the seat of
his soul and make him mad, and overpower the understanding and wisdom of what remains,
by smothering the ruling power in his heart with your weight.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>How spirit cannot be penetrated by spirit, and how God alone is incorporeal.</head>
<p>For even if spirit is mingled with this crass and solid matter; viz., flesh (as very easily
happens), should we therefore believe that it can be united to the soul, which is in like
manner spirit, in such a way as to make it also receptive in the same way of its own nature:
a thing which is possible to the Trinity alone, which is so capable of pervading every intellectual
nature, that it cannot only embrace and surround it but even insert itself into it and,
incorporeal though it is, be infused into a body? For though we maintain that some spiritual
natures exist, such as angels, archangels and the other powers, and indeed our own souls
and the thin air, yet we ought certainly not to consider them incorporeal. For they have in
their own fashion a body in which they exist, though it is much finer than our bodies are,
in accordance with the Apostle’s words when he says: “And there are bodies celestial, and
bodies terrestrial:” and again: “It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body;”389
from which it is clearly gathered that there is nothing incorporeal but God alone, and
therefore it is only by Him that all spiritual and intellectual substances can be pervaded,
because He alone is whole and everywhere and in all things, in such a way as to behold and
see the thoughts of men and their inner movements and all the recesses of the soul; since it
was of Him alone that the blessed Apostle spoke when he said: “For the word of God is quick
and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of
soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart; and there is no creature invisible in His sight, but all things are naked and open
to His eyes.”390 And the blessed David says: “Who fashioneth their hearts one by one;” and
again: “For He knoweth the secrets of the heart;”391 and Job too: “Thou who alone knowest
the hearts of men.”392</p>

<head>An objection, as to how we ought to believe that devils see into the thoughts of men.</head>
<p>Germanus: In this way, which you describe, those spirits cannot possibly see into our
thoughts. But we think it utterly absurd to hold such an opinion, when Scripture says: “If
the spirit of him that hath power ascend upon thee;”393 and again: “When the devil had put
it into the heart of Simon Iscariot to betray the Lord.”394 How then can we believe that our
thoughts are not open to them, when we feel that for the most part they spring up and are
nursed by their suggestions and instigation?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>The answer what devils can and what they cannot do in regard to the thoughts of men.</head>
<p>Serenus: Nobody doubts that unclean spirits can influence the character of our thoughts,
but this is by affecting them from without by sensible influences, i.e., either from our inclinations
or from our words, and those likings to which they see that we are especially disposed.
But they cannot possibly come near to those which have not yet come forth from the inmost
recesses of the soul. And the thoughts too, which they suggest, whether they are actually or
in a kind of way embraced, are discovered by them not from the nature of the soul itself,
i.e., that inner inclination which lies concealed so to speak in the very marrow, but from
motions and signs given by the outward man, as for example, when they suggest gluttony,
if they have seen a monk raising his eyes anxiously to the window or to the sun, or inquiring
eagerly what o’clock it is, they know that he has admitted the feeling of greediness. If when
they suggest fornication they find him calmly submitting to the attack of lust, or see him
perturbed in body, or at any rate not groaning as he ought under the wantonness of an impure
suggestion, they know that the dart of lust is already fixed in his very soul. If they stir up
incitements to grief, or anger, or rage, they can tell whether they have taken root in the heart
by the movements of the body, and visible disturbances, when, for instance, they have noticed
him either groaning silently, or panting with indignation or changing colour; and so they
cunningly discover the fault to which he is given over. For they know that every one of us
is enticed in a regular way by that one, to the incitement of which they see, by a sort of assenting
motion of the body, that he has yielded his consent and agreement. And it is no
wonder that this is discovered by those powers of the air, when we see that even clever men
can often discover the state of the inner man from his mien and look and external bearing.
How much more surely then can this be discovered by those who as being of a spiritual
nature are certainly much more subtle and cleverer than men.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16"> 
<pb n="919"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>An illustration showing how we are taught that unclean spirits know the thoughts of men.</head>
<p>For just as some thieves are in the habit of examining the concealed treasures of the
men in those houses which they mean to rob, and in the dark shades of night sprinkle with
careful hands little grains of sand and discover the hidden treasures which they cannot see
by the tinkling sound with which they answer to the fall of the sand, and so arrive at certain
knowledge of each thing and metal, which betrays itself in a way by the voice elicited from
it; so these too, in order to explore the treasures of our heart, scatter over us the sand of
certain evil suggestions, and when they see some bodily affection arise corresponding to
their character, they recognize as if by a sort of tinkling sound proceeding from the inmost
recesses, what it is that is stored up in the secret chamber of the inner man.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>On the fact that not every devil has the power of suggesting every passion to men.</head>
<p>But we ought to know this, that not all devils can implant all the passions in men, but
that certain spirits brood over each sin, and that some gloat over uncleanness and filthy
lusts, others over blasphemy, others are more particularly devoted to anger and wrath,
others thrive on gloominess, others are pacified with vainglory and pride; and each one
implants in the hearts of men that sin, in which he himself revels, and they cannot implant
their special vices all at one time, but in turn, according as the opportunity of time or place,
or a man, who is open to their suggestions, excites them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>A question whether among the devils there is any order observed in the attack, or system in
its changes.</head>
<p>Germanus: Must we then believe that wickedness is arranged and so to speak systematized
among them in such a way that there is some order in the changes observed by them,
and a regular plan of attack carried out, though it is clear that method and system can only
exist among good and upright men, as Scripture says: “Thou shalt seek wisdom among the
ungodly and shalt not find it; and: “our enemies are senseless;” and this: “There is neither
wisdom, nor courage, nor counsel among the ungodly.”395</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19"> 
<pb n="922"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>The answer how far an agreement exists among devils about the attack and its changes.</head>
<p>Serenus: It is a true assertion that there is no lasting concord among bad men, and that
perfect harmony cannot exist even in regard to those particular faults which have attractions
for them all in common. For, as you have said, it can never be that system and discipline
are preserved among undisciplined things. But in some matters, where community of interests,
and necessity enforces it, or participation in some gain recommends it, they must
arrange for some agreement for the time being. And we see very clearly that this is so in the
case of this war of spiritual wickedness; so that not only do they observe times and changes
among themselves, but actually are known specially to occupy some particular spots and to
haunt them persistently: for since they must make their attacks through certain fixed
temptations and well defined sins, and at particular times, we clearly infer from this that no
one can at one and at the same time be deluded by the emptiness of vainglory and inflamed
by the lust of fornication, nor at one and the same time be puffed up by the outrageous
haughtiness of spiritual pride, and subject to the humiliation of carnal gluttony. Nor can
anyone be overcome by silly giggling and laughter and at the same time be excited by the
stings of anger, or at any rate filled with the pains of gnawing grief: but all the spirits must
one by one advance to attack the soul, in such a way that when one has been vanquished
and retreated, he must make way for another spirit to attack it still more vehemently, or if
he has come forth victorious, he will none the less hand it over to be deceived by another.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of the fact that opposite powers are not of the same boldness, and that the occasions of
temptation are not under their control.</head>
<p>We ought also not to be ignorant of this, that they have not all the same fierceness and
energy, nor indeed the same boldness and malice, and that with beginners and feeble folk
only the weaker spirits join battle, and when these spiritual wickednesses are beaten, then
gradually the assaults of stronger ones are made against the athlete of Christ. For in proportion
to a man’s strength and progress, is the difficulty of the struggle made greater: for none
of the saints could possibly be equal to the endurance of the malice of so many and so great
foes, or meet their attacks, or even bear their cruelty and savagery, were it not that the
merciful judge of our contest, and president of the games, Christ Himself, equalized the
strength of the combatants, and repelled and checked their excessive attacks, and made with
the temptation a way of escape as well that we might be able to bear it.396</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21"> 
<pb n="924"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>Of the fact that devils struggle with men not without effort on their part.</head>
<p>But our belief is that they undertake this struggle not without effort on their part. For
in their conflict they themselves have some sort of anxiety and depression, and especially
when they are matched with stronger rivals, i.e., saints and perfect men. Otherwise no contest
or struggle, but only a simple deception of men, and one free from anxiety on their part
would be assigned to them. And how then would the Apostle’s words stand, where he says:
“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places;” and this too:
“So fight I, not as one that beateth the air;” and again: “I have fought a good fight”?397 For
where it is spoken of as a fight, and conflict, and battle, there must be effort and exertion
and anxiety on both sides, and equally there must either be in store for them chagrin and
confusion for their failure, or delight consequent upon their victory. But where one fights
with ease and security against another who struggles with great effort, and in order to
overthrow his rival makes use of his will alone as his strength, there it ought not to be called
a battle, struggle, or strife, but a sort of unfair and unreasonable assault and attack. But they
certainly have to labour, and when they attack men, exert themselves in no lesser degree in
order to secure from each one that victory which they want to obtain, and there is hurled
back upon them the same confusion which was awaiting us had we been worsted by them;
as it is said: “The head of their compassing me about, the labour of their own lips shall
overwhelm them;” and: “His sorrow shall be turned on his own head;” and again: “Let the
snare which he knoweth not come upon him, and let the net which he hath hidden catch
him, and into that very snare let him fall;”398 viz., that which he contrived for the deception
of men. They then themselves also come to grief, and as they damage us so are they also in
like manner damaged by us, nor when they are worsted do they depart without confusion,
and seeing these defeats of theirs and their struggles, one who had good eyes in his inner
man, seeing also that they gloated over the downfall and mischances of individuals, and
fearing lest his own case might furnish them with this kind of delight, prayed to the Lord
saying: “Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death: lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed
against him. They that trouble me will rejoice if I be moved;” and: “O My God, let them not
rejoice over me; let them not say in their hearts, Aha, Aha, our very wish; neither let them
say; we have devoured him;” and: “They gnashed their teeth upon me. Lord, how long wilt
Thou look on this?” for: “he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to
ravish the poor;” and: “He seeketh from God his meat.”399 And again when all their efforts

are exhausted, and they have failed to secure our deception, they must “be confounded and
blush” at the failure of their efforts, “who seek our souls to destroy them: and let them be
covered with shame and confusion who imagine evil against us.”400 Jeremiah also says: “Let
them be confounded, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be
afraid: bring upon them the fury of Thy wrath, and with a double destruction destroy
them.”401 For no one can doubt that when they are vanquished by us they will be destroyed
with a double destruction: first, because while men are seeking after holiness, they, though
they possessed it, lost it, and became the cause of man’s ruin; secondly, because being spiritual
existences, they have been vanquished by carnal and earthly ones. Each one then of
the saints when he looks on the destruction of his foes and his own triumphs, exclaims with
delight: “I will follow after mine enemies and overtake them: and I will not turn until they
are destroyed. I will break them and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my
feet,”402 and in his prayers against them the same prophet says: “Judge thou, O Lord, them
that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me. Take hold of arms and shield: and
rise up to help me. Bring out the sword and shut up the way against them that persecute
me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation.”403 And when by subduing and destroying all our
passions we have vanquished these, we shall then be permitted to hear those words of
blessing: “Thy hand shall be exalted over thine enemies, and all thine enemies shall perish.”404
And so when we read or chant all these and such like passages found in holy writ, unless
we take them as written against those spiritual wickednesses which lie in wait for us night
and day, we shall not only fail to draw from them any edification to make us gentle and
patient, but shall actually meet with some dreadful consequence and one that is quite contrary
to evangelical perfection. For we shall not only not be taught to pray for or to love our enemies,
but actually shall be stirred up to hate them with an implacable hatred, and to curse
them and incessantly to pour forth prayers against them. And it is terribly wrong and blasphemous
to think that these words were uttered in such a spirit by holy men and friends of
God, on whom before the coming of Christ the law was not imposed for the very reason
that they went beyond its commands, and chose rather to obey the precepts of the gospel
and to aim at apostolical perfection, though they lived before the dispensation of the time.</p>

<p>On the fact that the power to hurt does not depend upon the will of the devils.</p>
<p>But that they have not the power of hurting any man is shown in a very clear way by
the instance of the blessed Job, where the enemy did not venture to try him beyond what
was allowed to him by the Divine permission; and it is evidenced by the confession of the
same spirits contained in the records of the gospel, where they say: “If Thou cast us out,
suffer us to go into the herd of swine.”405 And far more must we hold that they cannot of
their own free will enter into any one of men who are created in the image of God, if they
have not power to enter into dumb and unclean animals without the permission of God.
But no one—I will not say of the younger men, whom we see living most steadfastly in this
desert, but even of those who are perfect—could live alone in the desert, surrounded by
such swarms of foes of this kind, if they had unlimited power and freedom to hurt and tempt
us: and still more clearly is this supported by the words of our Lord and Saviour, which in
the lowliness of the manhood He had assumed, He uttered to Pilate, when He said: “Thou
couldest have no power against Me at all, unless it were given thee from above.”406</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>Of the diminished power of the devils.</head>
<p>But we have thoroughly discovered both by our own experience and by the testimony
of the Elders that the devils have not now the same power as they had formerly during the
early days of the anchorites, when yet there were only a few monks living in the desert. For
such was their fierceness that it was with difficulty that a few very steadfast men, and those
advanced in years were able to endure a life of solitude. Since in the actual monasteries
where eight or ten men used to live, their violence attacked them so and their assaults were
experienced so frequently, and so visibly, that they did not dare all to go to bed at once by
night, but took turns and while some snatched a little sleep, others kept watch and devoted
themselves to Psalms and prayer and reading. And when the wants of nature compelled
them to sleep, they awoke the others, and committed to them in like manner the duty of
keeping watch over those who were going to bed. Whence we cannot doubt that one of two
things has brought about this result not only in the case of us who seem to be fairly strong
from the experience which our age gives us, but also in the case of younger men as well. For
either the malice of the devils has been beaten back by the power of the cross penetrating
even to the desert, and by its grace which shines everywhere; or else our carelessness makes
them relax something of their first onslaught, as they scorn to attack us with the same energy
with which they formerly raged against those most admirable soldiers of Christ; and by this
deceit and ceasing from open attacks they do us still more damage. For we see that some
have fallen into so sluggish a condition that they have to be coaxed by too gentle exhortations
for fear lest they should forsake their cells and fall into more dangerous troubles, and wander
and stray about and be entangled in what I would call grosser sins; and it is thought that a
great thing is got from them if they can even with some listlessness remain in the desert,
and the Elders often say to them as a great relief: Stop in your cells, and eat and drink and
sleep as much as you like,407 if only you will stay in them always.</p>
<note type="footnote">407 So centuries later it is told of a Jesuit father that when one wanted to relax the strictness of his fast, he
replied, “Eat an ox, but be a Christian.”</note>

<head>Of the way in which the devils prepare for themselves an entrance into the bodies of those
whom they are going to possess.</head>
<p>It is clear then that unclean spirits cannot make their way into those whose bodies they
are going to seize upon, in any other way than by first taking possession of their minds and
thoughts. And when they have robbed them of fear and the recollection of God and spiritual
meditation, they boldly advance upon them, as if they were dispossessed of all protection
and Divine safeguard, and could easily be bound, and then take up their dwelling in them
as if in a possession given over to them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>On the fact that those men are more wretched who are possessed by sins than those who are
possessed by devils.</head>
<p>Although it is a fact that those men are more grievously and severely troubled, who,
while they seem to be very little affected by them in the body, are yet possessed in spirit in
a far worse way, as they are entangled in their sins and lusts. For as the Apostle says: “Of
whom a man is overcome, of him he is also the servant.” Only that in this respect they are
more dangerously ill, because though they are their slaves, yet they do not know that they
are assaulted by them, and under their dominion. But we know that even saintly men have
been given over in the flesh to Satan and to great afflictions for some very slight faults, since
the Divine mercy will not suffer the very least spot or stain to be found in them on the day
of judgment, and purges away in this world every spot of their filth, as the prophet, or rather
God Himself says, in order that He may commit them to eternity as gold or silver refined
and needing no penal purification. “And,” says He, “I will clean purge away thy dross, and
I will take away all thy sin; and after this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful
city.” And again: “Like as silver and gold are tried in the furnace, so the Lord chooseth the
hearts;” And again: “The fire tries gold and silver; but man is tried in the furnace of humiliation;”
and this also: “For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom He receiveth.”408</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>Of the death of the prophet who was led astray, and of the infirmity of the Abbot Paul, with
which he was visited for the sake of his cleansing.</head>
<p>And we see clear instance of this in the case of that prophet and man of God in the third
book of Kings, who was straightway destroyed by a lion for a single fault of disobedience,
in which he was implicated not of set purpose nor by the fault of his own will but by the
enticement of another, as the Scripture speaks thus of him: “It is the man of God, who was
disobedient to the mouth of the Lord, and the Lord delivered him to the lion, and it tare
him according to the word of the Lord, which He spake.”409 In which case the punishment
of the present offence and carelessness together with the reward of his righteousness, for
which the Lord gave over his prophet in this world to the destroyer, are shown by the
moderation and abstinence of the beast of prey, as that most savage creature did not dare
even to taste the carcass that was given over to him. And of the same thing a very clear and
plain proof has been given in our own days in the case of the Abbots Paul and Moses who
lived in a spot in this desert called Calamus,410 for the former had formerly dwelt in the
wilderness which is hard by the city of Panephysis,411 which we know had only recently
been made a wilderness by an inundation of salt water; which whenever the north wind
blew, was driven from the marshes and spreading over the adjacent fields covered the face
of the whole district, so as to make the ancient villages, which on this very account had been
deserted by all their inhabitants, look like islands. Here, then, the Abbot Paul had made
such progress in purity of heart in the stillness and silence of the desert, that he did not
suffer, I will not say a woman’s face, but even the clothes of one of that sex to appear in his
sight. For when as he was going to the cell of one of the Elders together with Abbot
Archebius412 who lived in the same desert, by accident a woman met him, he was so disgusted
at meeting her that he dropped the business of his friendly visit which he had taken in hand
and dashed back again to his own monastery with greater speed than a man would flee from
the face of a lion or terrible dragon; so that he was not moved even by the shouts and prayers
of the aforesaid Abbot Archebius who called him back to go on with the journey they had
undertaken to ask the old man what they had proposed to do. But though this was done in
his eagerness for chastity and desire for purity, yet because it was done not according to
knowledge, and because the observance of discipline, and the methods of proper strictness
were overstrained, for he imagined that not merely familiarity with a woman (which is the

real harm,) but even the very form of that sex was to be execrated, he was forthwith overtaken
by such a punishment that his whole body was struck with paralysis, and none of his limbs
were able to perform their proper functions, since not merely his hands and feet, but even
the movements of the tongue, which enables us to frame our words, (were affected) and his
very ears lost the sense of hearing, so that there was left in him nothing more of his manhood
than an immovable and insensible figure. But he was reduced to such a condition that the
utmost care of men was unable to minister to his infirmity, but only the tender service of
women could attend to his wants: for when he was taken to a convent of holy virgins, food
and drink, which he could not ask for even by signs, were brought to him by female attendants,
and for the performance of all that nature required he was ministered to by the same
service for nearly four years, i.e., to the end of his life. And though he was affected by such
weakness of all his members that none of his limbs retained their keen power of motion and
feeling, nevertheless such grace of goodness proceeded from him that when sick persons
were anointed with the oil which had touched what should be called his corpse rather than
his body, they were instantly healed of all diseases, so that as regards his own malady it was
made clearly and plainly evident even to unbelievers that the infirmity of all his limbs was
caused by the providence and love of the Lord, and that the grace of these healings was
granted by the power of the Holy Ghost as a witness of his purity and a manifestation of his
merits.</p>

his mouth with filth414 which he supplied, and the Lord showed by the quickness of his
cure, and the author of his healing, that He had brought this scourge upon him to purify
him, that there might not remain in him any stain from his momentary error: for as soon
as Abbot Macarius committed himself to prayer, quicker than a word the evil spirit fled
away from him and departed.</p>

<head>How we ought not to despise those who are delivered up to unclean spirits.</head>
<p>From which it plainly results that we ought not to hate or despise those whom we see
to be delivered up to various temptations or to those spirits of evil, because we ought firmly
to hold these two points: first, that none of them can be tempted at all by them without
God’s permission, and secondly that all things which are brought upon us by God, whether
they seem to us at the present time to be sad or joyful, are inflicted for our advantage as by
a most kind father and most compassionate physician, and that therefore men are, as it
were, given into the charge of schoolmasters, and humbled in order that when they depart
out of this world they may be removed in a state of greater purity to the other life, or have
a lighter punishment inflicted on them, as they have been, as the Apostle says, delivered
over at the present time “to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord Jesus.”415</p>

<p>Germanus: And how is it that we see them not only scorned and shunned by everybody,
but actually always kept away from the Lord’s communion in our provinces, in accordance
with these words of the gospel: “Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your
pearls before swine;”416 while you tell us that somehow we ought to hold that the humiliation
of this temptation is brought upon them with a view to their purification and profit?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">

<head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
<head>The answer to the question raised.</head>
<p>Serenus: If we had this knowledge, or rather faith, of which I treated above; viz., to believe
that all things were brought about by God, and ordered for the good of our souls, we should
not only never despise them, but rather pray without ceasing for them as our own members,
and sympathize with them with all our hearts and the fullest affection (for “when one
member suffers, all the members suffer with it”417), as we know that we cannot possibly be
perfected without them inasmuch as they are members of us, just as we read that our predecessors
could not attain the fulness of promise without us, as the Apostle speaks of them as
follows: “And these all being approved by the testimony of faith, received not the promise,
God providing some better thing for us that they should not be perfected without us.”418
But we never remember that holy communion was forbidden them; nay rather if it were
possible, they thought that it ought to be given to them daily; nor indeed according to the
words of the gospel which you incongruously apply in this sense “Give not that which is
holy to dogs,”419 ought we to believe that holy communion becomes food for the demon,
and not a purification and safeguard of body and soul; for when it is received by a man it,
so to speak, burns out and puts to flight the spirit which has its seat in his members or is
trying to lurk in them. For in this way we have lately seen Abbot Andronicus and many
others cured. For the enemy will more and more abuse the man who is possessed, if he sees
him cut off from the heavenly medicine, and will tempt him more often and more fearfully,
as he sees him removed the further from this spiritual remedy.420</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
<head>On the fact that those men are more to be pitied to whom it is not given to be subjected to
those temporal temptations.</head>
<p>But we ought to consider those men truly wretched and miserable in whose case, although
they defile themselves with all kinds of sins and wickedness, yet not only is there no visible
sign of the devil’s possession shown in them, nor is any temptation proportionate to their
actions, nor any scourge of punishment brought to bear upon them. For they are vouchsafed
no swift and immediate remedy in this world, whose “hardness and impenitent heart,” being
too much for punishment in this life, “heapeth up for itself wrath and indignation in the
day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,” “where their worm dieth
not, and their fire is not quenched.”421 Against whom the prophet as if perplexed at the affliction
of the saints, when he sees them subject to various losses and temptations, and on
the other hand sees sinners not only passing through the course of this world without any
scourge of humiliation, but even rejoicing in great riches, and the utmost prosperity in
everything, inflamed with uncontrollable indignation and fervour of spirit, exclaims: “But
as for me, my feet had almost gone, my treadings had well nigh slipped. For I was grieved
at the wicked, when I saw the peace of sinners. For there is no regard to their death, nor is
there strength in their stripes. They are not in the labour of men, neither shall they be
scourged like other men,”422 since hereafter they shall be punished with the devils, to whom
in this world it was not vouchsafed to be scourged in the lot and discipline of sons, together
with men. Jeremiah also, when conversing with God on this prosperity of sinners, although
he never professes to doubt about the justice of God, as he says “for Thou art just, O Lord,
if I dispute with Thee,” yet in his inquiry as to the reasons of this inequality, proceeds to
say: “But yet I will speak what is just to Thee. Why doth the way of the wicked prosper?
Why is it well with all them that transgress and do wickedly? Thou hast planted them and
they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit. Thou art near in their mouth and
far from their reins.”423 And when the Lord mourns for their destruction by the prophet,
and anxiously directs doctors and physicians to heal them, and in a manner urges them on
to a similar lamentation and says: “Babylon is suddenly fallen: she is destroyed. Howl for
her: take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed;” then, in their despair, the angels, to
whom is entrusted the care of man’s salvation, make reply; or at any rate the prophet in the
person of the Apostles and spiritual men and doctors who see the hardness of their soul,
and their impenitent heart: “We have healed Babylon: but she is not cured. Let us forsake

there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
<head>Of the different desires and wishes which exist in the powers of the air.</head>
<p>But it is clearly proved that there exist in unclean spirits as many desires as there are in
men. For some of them, which are commonly called Plani,426 are shown to be so seductive
and sportive that, when they have taken continual possession of certain places or roads, they
delight themselves not indeed with tormenting the passers by whom they can deceive, but,
contenting themselves merely with laughing at them and mocking them, try to tire them
out rather than to injure them: while some spend the night merely by harmlessly taking
possession of men, though others are such slaves to fury and ferocity that they are not simply
content with hurting the bodies of those of whom they have taken possession, by tearing
them in a dreadful manner, but actually are eager to rush upon those who are passing by at
a distance, and to attack them with most savage slaughter: like those described in the gospel,
for fear of whom no man dared to pass by that way. And there is no doubt that these and
such as these in their insatiable fury delight in wars and bloodshed. Others we find affect
the hearts of those whom they have seized with empty pride, (and these are commonly called
Bacucei427) so that they stretch themselves up beyond their proper height and at one time
puff themselves up with arrogance and pomposity, and at another time condescend in an
ordinary and bland manner, to a state of calmness and affability: and as they fancy that they
are great people and the wonder of everybody, at one time show by bowing their body that
they are worshipping higher powers, while at another time they think that they are worshipped
by others, and so go through all those movements which express true service either
proudly or humbly. Others we find are not only keen for lies, but also inspire men with
blasphemies. And of this we ourselves can testify as we have heard a demon openly confessing
that he had proclaimed a wicked and impious doctrine by the mouths of Arius and Eunomius.
And the same thing we read that one of them openly proclaimed in the fourth book of Kings:
“I will go forth,” he said, “and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.”428 On
which the Apostle, when reproving those who are deceived by them, adds as follows: “giving
heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy.”429 And that
there are other kinds of devils which are deaf and dumb the gospels testify. And that some
spirits incite to lust and wantonness the prophet maintains saying: “The spirit of fornication
deceived them and they went astray from their God.”430 In the same way the authority of

Scripture teaches us that there are demons of the night and of the day and of the noonday:431
But it would take too long to search through the whole of Scripture and run through the
different kinds of them, as they are termed by the prophets onocentaurs, satyrs, sirens,
witches, howlers, ostriches, urchins; and asps and basilisks in the Psalms; and are called
lions, dragons, scorpions in the gospel, and are named by the Apostle the prince of this
world, rulers of this darkness, and spirits of wickedness.432 And all these names we ought
not to take as given at random or hap-hazard, but as alluding to their fierceness and madness
under the sign of those wild beasts which are more or less harmful and dangerous among
us, and by comparing them to the poisonous wickedness or power which among other beasts
or serpents, some pre-eminence in evil confers on them, they are called by their names, in
such a way that to one is assigned the name of lion because of the fury of his rage and the
madness of his anger, to another that of basilisk because of his deadly poison, which kills a
person before it is perceived, and to another that of onocentaur or urchin or ostrich because
of his sluggish malice.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the hospitality of Abbot Serenus.</head>
<p>When we had finished the duties of the day, and the congregation had been dismissed
from Church we returned to the old man’s cell, and enjoyed a most sumptuous repast. For
instead of the sauce which with a few drops of oil spread over it was usually set on the table
for his daily meal, he mixed a little decoction and poured over it a somewhat more liberal
allowance of oil than usual; for each of them when he is going to partake of his daily repast,
pours those drops of oil on, not that he may receive any enjoyment from the taste of it (for
so limited is the supply that it is hardly enough I will not say to line the passage of his throat
and jaws, but even to pass down it) but that using it, he may keep down the pride of his
heart (which is certain to creep in stealthily and surely if his abstinence is any stricter) and
the incitements to vainglory, for as his abstinence is practised with the greater secrecy, and
is carried on without anyone to see it, so much the more subtly does it never cease to tempt
the man who conceals it. Then he set before us table salt, and three olives each: after which
he produced a basket containing parched vetches which they call trogalia,434 from which
we each took five grains, two prunes and a fig apiece. For it is considered wrong for anyone
to exceed that amount in that desert. And when we had finished this repast and had begun
to ask him again for his promised solution of the question, “Let us hear,” said the old man,
“your question, the consideration of which we postponed till the present time.”</p>

powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
places:”435 and again: “Neither angels nor principalities nor powers nor any other creature,
can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”436 Whence then
arises the enmity of all this malice jealous of us? Are we to believe that those powers were
created by the Lord for this; viz., to fight against men in these grades and orders?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
<pb n="945"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>The answer on the many kinds of food provided in holy Scripture.</head>
<p>Serenus: The authority of holy Scripture says on those points on which it would inform
us some things so plainly and clearly even to those who are utterly void of understanding,
that not only are they not veiled in the obscurity of any hidden meaning, but do not even
require the help of any explanation, but carry their meaning and sense on the surface of the
words and letters: but some things are so concealed and involved in mysteries as to offer us
an immense field for skill and care in the discussion and explanation of them. And it is clear
that God has so ordered it for many reasons: first for fear lest the holy mysteries, if they
were covered by no veil of spiritual meaning, should be exposed equally to the knowledge
and understanding of everybody, i.e., the profane as well as the faithful and thus there might
be no difference in the matter of goodness and prudence between the lazy and the earnest:
next that among those who are indeed of the household of faith, while immense differences
of intellectual power open out before them, there might be the opportunity of reproving
the slothfulness of the idle, and of proving the keenness and diligence of the earnest. And
so holy Scripture is fitly compared to a rich and fertile field, which, while bearing and producing
much which is good for man’s food without being cooked by fire, produces some
things which are found to be unsuitable for man’s use or even harmful unless they have lost
all the roughness of their raw condition by being tempered and softened down by the heat
of fire. But some are naturally fit for use in both states, so that even when uncooked they
are not unpleasant from their raw condition, but still are rendered more palatable by being
cooked and heated by fire. Many more things too are produced only fit for the food of irrational
creatures, and cattle, and wild animals and birds, but utterly useless as food for men,
which while still in their rough state without being in any way touched by fire, conduce to
the health and life of cattle. And we can clearly see that the same system holds good in that
most fruitful garden of the Scriptures of the Spirit, in which some things shine forth clear
and bright in their literal sense, in such a way that while they have no need of any higher
interpretation, they furnish abundant food and nourishment in the simple sound of the
words, to the hearers: as in this passage: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord;” and:
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength.”437 But there are some which, unless they are weakened down by an allegorical
interpretation, and softened by the trial of the fire of the spirit cannot become wholesome
food for the inner man without injury and loss to him; and damage rather than profit will
accrue to him from receiving them: as with this passage: “But let your loins be girded up
and your lights burning;” and: “whosoever has no sword, let him sell his coat and buy himself
<note type="footnote">437 Deut. vi. 4, 5.</note>

<pb n="946"/>
a sword;” and: “whosoever taketh not up his cross and followeth after Me is not worthy of
Me;”438 a passage which some most earnest monks, having “indeed a zeal for God, but not
according to knowledge”439 understood literally, and so made themselves wooden crosses,
and carried them about constantly on their shoulders, and so were the cause not of edification
but of ridicule on the part of all who saw them. But some are capable of being taken suitable
and properly in both ways, i.e., the historical and allegorical, so that either explanation furnishes
a healing draught to the soul; as this passage: “If any one shall smite thee on the right
cheek, turn to him the other also;” and: “when they persecute you in one city, flee to another;”
and: “if thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me.”440 It produces indeed “grass for the cattle”
also, (and of this food all the fields of Scripture are full); viz., plain and simple narratives of
history, by which simple folk, and those who are incapable of perfect and sound understanding
(of whom it is said “Thou, Lord, wilt save both man and beast”)441 may be made stronger
and more vigorous for their hard work and the labour of actual life, in accordance with the
state and measure of their capacity.</p>

<head>Of the double sense in which Holy Scripture may be taken.</head>
<p>Wherefore on those passages which are brought forward with a clear explanation we
also can constantly lay down the meaning and boldly state our own opinions. But those
which the Holy Spirit, reserving for our meditation and exercise, has inserted in holy
Scripture with veiled meaning, wishing some of them to be gathered from various proofs
and conjectures, ought to be step by step and carefully brought together, so that their assertions
and proofs may be arranged by the discretion of the man who is arguing or supporting
them. For sometimes when a difference of opinion is expressed on one and the same subject,
either view may be considered reasonable and be held without injury to the faith either
firmly, or doubtfully, i.e., in such a way that neither is full belief nor absolute rejection accorded
to it, and the second view need not interfere with the former, if neither of them is
found to be opposed to the faith: as in this case: where Elias came in the person of John,442
and is again to be the precursor of the Lord’s Advent: and in the matter of the “Abomination
of desolation” which “stood in the holy place,” by means of that idol of Jupiter which, as we
read, was placed in the temple in Jerusalem, and which is again to stand in the Church
through the coming of Antichrist,443 and all those things which follow in the gospel, which
we take as having been fulfilled before the captivity of Jerusalem and still to be fulfilled at
the end of this world. In which matters neither view is opposed to the other, nor does the
first interpretation interfere with the second.</p>

<head>Of the fact that nothing is created evil by God.</head>
<p>God forbid that we should admit that God has created anything which is substantially
evil, as Scripture says “everything that God had made was very good.”444 For if they were
created by God such as they are now, or made for this purpose; viz., to occupy these positions
of malice, and ever to be ready for the deception and ruin of men, we should in opposition
to the view of the above quoted Scripture slander God as the Creator and author of evil, as
having Himself formed utterly evil wills and natures, creating them for this very purpose;
viz., that they might ever persist in their wickedness and never pass over to the feeling of a
good will. The following reason then of this diversity is what we received from the tradition
of the fathers, being drawn from the fount of Holy Scripture.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of the origin of principalities or powers.</head>
<p>None of the faithful question the fact that before the formation of this visible creation
God made spiritual and celestial powers, in order that owing to the very fact that they knew
that they had been formed out of nothing by the goodness of the Creator for such glory and
bliss, they might render to Him continual thanks and ceaselessly continue to praise Him.
For neither should we imagine that God for the first time began to originate His creation
and work with the formation of this world, as if in those countless ages beforehand He had
taken no thought of Providence and the divine ordering of things, and as if we could believe
that having none towards whom to show the blessings of His goodness, He had been solitary,
and a stranger to all bountifulness; a thing which is too poor and unsuitable to fancy of that
boundless and eternal and incomprehensible Majesty; as the Lord Himself says of these
powers: “When the stars were made together, all my angels praised Me with a loud voice.”445
Those then who were present at the creation of the stars, are most clearly proved to have
been created before that “beginning” in which it is said that heaven and earth were made,
inasmuch as they are said with loud voices and admiration to have praised the Creator be-
cause of all those visible creatures which, as they saw, proceeded forth from nothing. Before
then that beginning in time which is spoken of by Moses, and which according to the historic
and Jewish interpretation denotes the age of this world (without prejudice to our interpretation,
according to which we explain that the “beginning,” of all things is Christ, in whom
the Father created all things, as it is said “All things were made by him, and without Him
was not anything made,”)446 before, I say, that beginning of Genesis in time there is no
question that God had already created all those powers and heavenly virtues; which the
Apostle enumerates in order and thus describes: “For in Christ were created all things both
in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be angels or archangels, whether
they be thrones or dominions, whether they be principalities or powers. All things were
made by Him and in Him.”447</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the fall of the devil and the angels.</head>
<p>And so we are clearly shown that out of that number of them some of the leaders fell,
by the lamentations of Ezekiel and Isaiah, in which we know that the prince of Tyre or that
Lucifer who rose in the morning is lamented with a doleful plaint: and of him the Lord
speaks as follows to Ezekiel: “Son of man, take up a lamentation over the prince of Tyre,
and say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom,
perfect in beauty. Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God: every precious stone
was thy covering: the sardius, the topaz and the jasper, the chrysolyte and the onyx and the
beryl, the sapphire and the carbuncle and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty, and thy
pipes were prepared in the day that thou wast created. Thou wast a cherub stretched out
and protecting, and I set thee in the holy mountain of God, thou hast walked in the midst
of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity
was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise thy inner parts were filled with
iniquity and thou hast sinned; and I cast thee out from the mountain of God, and destroyed
thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst of the stones of fire. And thy heart was lifted up
with thy beauty: thou hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I
have set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy
sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities and by the iniquity of thy traffic.”448 Isaiah
also says of another: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the
morning? how art thou fallen to the ground, that didst wound the nations? and thou saidst
in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will
sit in the mountain of the covenant, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds. I will be like the Most High.”449 But Holy Scripture relates that these fell not
alone from that summit of their station in bliss, as it tells us that the dragon dragged down
together with himself the third part of the stars.450 One of the Apostles too says still more
plainly: “But the angels who kept not their first estate, but left their own dwelling, He hath
reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.”451 This too
which is said to us: “But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes,”452 what does
it imply but that many princes have fallen? And by these testimonies we can gather the
reason for this diversity; viz., either that they still retain those differences of rank (which

station of their former rank in which they were severally created, or else that, though
themselves cast down from heavenly places, yet, as a reward for that wickedness of theirs
in which they have graduated in evil, they claim in perversity these grades and titles of rank
among themselves, by way of copying those virtues which have stood firm there.</p>

<head>An objection stating that the fall of the devil took its origin from the deception of God.</head>
<p>Germanus: Up till now we used to believe that the reason and commencement of the
ruin and fall of the devil, in which he was cast out from his heavenly estate, was more particularly
envy, when in his spiteful subtlety he deceived Adam and Eve.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10"> 
<pb n="954"/>
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>The answer about the beginning of the devil’s fall.</head>
<p>Serenus: The passage in Genesis shows that that was not the beginning of his fall and
ruin, as before their deception it takes the view that he had already been branded with the
ignominy of the name of the serpent, where it says: “But the serpent was wiser” or as the
Hebrew copies express it, “more subtle than all the beasts of the earth, which the Lord God
had made.”453 You see then that he had fallen away from his angelic holiness even before
he deceived the first man, so that he not only deserved to be stamped with the ignominy of
this title, but actually excelled all other beasts of the earth in the subterfuges of wickedness.
For Holy Scripture would not have designated a good angel by such a term, nor would it
say of those who were still continuing in that state of bliss: “But the serpent was wiser than
all the beasts of the earth.” For this title could not possibly be applied I say not to Gabriel
or Michæl, but it would not even be suitable to any good man. And so the title of serpent
and the comparison to beasts most clearly suggests not the dignity of an angel but the infamy
of an apostate. Finally the occasion of the envy and seduction, which led him to deceive
man, arose from the ground of his previous fall, in that he saw that man, who had but recently
been formed out of the dust of the ground, was to be called to that glory, from which he
remembered that he himself, while still one of the princes, had fallen. And so that first fall
of his, which was due to pride, and which obtained for him the name of the serpent, was
followed by a second owing to envy: and as this one found him still in the possession of
something upright so that he could enjoy some interchange of conference and counsel with
man, by the Lord’s sentence he was very properly cast down to the lowest depth, that he
might no longer walk as before erect, and looking up on high, but should cleave to the
ground and creep along, and be brought low upon his belly and feed upon the earthly food
and works of sins, and henceforward proclaim his secret hostility, and put between himself
and man an enmity that is to our advantage, and a discord that is to our profit, so that while
men are on their guard against him as a dangerous enemy, he can no longer injure them by
a deceptive show of friendship.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>The punishment of the deceiver and the deceived.</head>
<p>But we ought in this matter, in order that we may shun evil counsels, to learn a special
lesson from the fact that though the author of the deception was visited with a fitting punishment
and condemnation, yet still the one who was led astray did not go scot free from
punishment, although it was somewhat lighter than that of him who was the author of the
deception. And this we see was very plainly expressed. For Adam who was deceived, or
rather (to use the Apostle’s words) “was not deceived” but, acquiescing in the wishes of her
who was deceived, seems to have come to yield a consent that was deadly, is only condemned
to labour and the sweat of his brow, which is assigned to him not by means of a curse upon
himself, but by means of a curse upon the ground, and its barrenness. But the woman, who
persuaded him to this, is visited with an increase of anguish, and pains and sorrow, and also
given over to the yoke of perpetual subjection. But the serpent who was the first to incite
them to this offence, is punished by a lasting curse. Wherefore we should with the utmost
care and circumspection be on our guard against evil counsels, for as they bring punishment
upon their authors, so too they do not suffer those who are deceived by them to go free from
guilt and punishment.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Of the crowd of the devils, and the disturbance which they always raise in our atmosphere.</head>
<p>But the atmosphere which extends between heaven and earth is ever filled with a thick
crowd of spirits, which do not fly about in it quietly or idly, so that most fortunately the divine
providence has withdrawn them from human sight. For through fear of their attacks, or
horror at the forms, into which they transform and turn themselves at will, men would
either be driven out of their wits by an insufferable dread, and faint away, from inability to
look on such things with bodily eyes, or else would daily grow worse and worse, and be
corrupted by their constant example and by imitating them, and thus there would arise a
sort of dangerous familiarity and deadly intercourse between men and the unclean powers
of the air, whereas those crimes which are now committed among men, are concealed either
by walls and enclosures or by distance and space, or by some shame and confusion: but if
they could always look on them with open face, they would be stimulated to a greater pitch
of insanity, as there would not be a single moment in which they would see them desist
from their wickedness, since no bodily weariness, or occupation in business or care for their
daily food (as in our case) forces them sometimes even against their will to desist from the
purposes they have begun to carry out.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13"> 
<pb n="957"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Of the fact that opposing powers turn the attack, which they aim at men, even against each
other.</head>
<p>For it is quite clear that they aim these attacks, with which they assault men, even against
each other, for in like manner they do not cease to promote with unwearied strife the discords
and struggles which they have undertaken for some peoples because of a sort of innate love
of wickedness which they have: and this we read of as being very clearly set forth in the vision
of Daniel the prophet, where the angel Gabriel speaks as follows: “Fear not, Daniel: for from
the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy
God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom
of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael one of the chief princes
came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. But I am come to teach
thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter days.”454 And we can not possibly doubt
that this prince of the kingdom of the Persians was a hostile power, which favoured the nation
of the Persians an enemy of God’s people; for in order to hinder the good which it saw would
result from the solution of the question for which the prophet prayed the Lord, by the
archangel, in its jealousy it opposed itself to prevent the saving comfort of the angel from
reaching Daniel too speedily, and from strengthening the people of God, over which the
archangel Gabriel was: and the latter said that even then, owing to the fierceness of his assaults,
he would not have been able to come to him, had not Michael the archangel come
to help him, and met the prince of the kingdom of the Persians, and joined battle with him,
and intervened, and defended him from his attack, and so enabled him to come to instruct
the prophet after twenty-one days. And a little later on it says: “And the angel said: Dost
thou know wherefore I am come to thee? And now I will return to fight against the prince
of the Persians. For when I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. But
I will tell thee what is written down in the Scriptures of truth: and none is my helper in all
these things but Michael your prince.”455 And again: “At that time shall Michael rise up,
the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people.”456 So then we read that in
the same way another was called the prince of the Greeks, who since he was patron of that
nation which was subject to him seems to have been opposed to the nation of the Persians
as well as to the people of Israel. From which we clearly see that antagonistic powers raise
against each other those quarrels of nations, and conflicts and dissensions, which they show
among themselves at their instigation, and that they either exult at their victories or are cast

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How it is that spiritual wickednesses obtained the names of powers or principalities.</head>
<p>We can then see clear reasons, in addition to those ideas which we expounded above,
why they are called principalities or powers; viz., because they rule and preside over different
nations, and at least hold sway over inferior spirits and demons, of which the gospels give
us evidence by their own confession that there exist legions. For they could not be called
lords unless they had some over whom to exercise the sway of lordship; nor could they be
called powers or principalities, unless there were some over whom they could claim power:
and this we find pointed out very clearly in the gospel by the Pharisees in their blasphemy:
“He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils,”457 for we find that they are
also called “rulers of darkness,”458 and that one of them is styled “the prince of this world.”459
But the blessed Apostle declares that hereafter, when all things shall be subdued to Christ,
these orders shall be destroyed, saying: “When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to
God even the Father, when He shall have destroyed all principalities and powers and
dominions.”460 And this certainly can only take place if they are removed from the sway of
those over whom we know that powers and dominions and principalities take charge in this
world.</p>

<p>For no one doubts that not without cause or reason are the same titles of rank assigned
to the better sort, and that they are names of office and of worth or dignity, for it is plain
that they are termed angels, i.e., messengers from their office of bearing messages, and the
appropriateness of the name teaches that they are “archangels” because they preside over
angels, “dominions” because they hold dominion over certain persons, and “principalities”
because they have some to be princes over, and “thrones” because they are so near to God
and so privy and close to Him that the Divine Majesty specially rests in them as in a Divine
throne, and in a way reclines surely on them.</p>

<head>Of the subjection of the devils, which they show to their own princes, as seen in a brother’s
victim.</head>
<p>But that unclean spirits are ruled over by worse powers and are subject to them we not
only find from those passages of Scripture, recorded in the gospels when the Pharisees maligned
the Lord, and He answered “If I by Beelzebub the prince of the devils cast out devils,”
461 but we are also taught this by clear visions and many experiences of the saints, for
when one of our brethren was making a journey in this desert, as day was now declining he
found a cave and stopped there meaning to say his evening office in it, and there midnight
passed while he was still singing the Psalms. And when after he had finished his office he
sat down a little before refreshing his wearied body, on a sudden he began to see innumerable
troops of demons gathering together on all sides, who came forward in an immense crowd,
and a long line, some preceding and others following their prince; who at length arrived,
being taller and more dreadful to look at than all the others; and, a throne having been
placed, he sat down as on some lofty tribunal, and began to investigate by a searching examination
the actions of each one of them; and those who said that they had not yet been able
to circumvent their rivals, he commanded to be driven out of his sight with shame and ignominy
as idle and slothful, rebuking them with angry wrath for the waste of so much time,
and for their labour thrown away: but those who reported that they had deceived those assigned
to them, he dismissed before all with the highest praise amidst the exultation and
applause of all, as most brave warriors, and most renowned as an example to all the rest:
and when in this number some most evil spirit had presented himself, in delight at having
to relate some magnificent triumph, he mentioned the name of a very well known monk,
and declared that after having incessantly attacked him for fifteen years, he had at last got
the better of him, so as to destroy him that very same night by the sin of fornication, for
that he had not only impelled him to commit adultery with some consecrated maid, but
had actually persuaded him to keep her and marry her. And when there arose shouts of joy
at this narrative, he was extolled with the highest praise by the prince of darkness, and departed
crowned with great honours. And so when at break of day the whole swarm of demons
had vanished from his eyes, the brother being doubtful about the assertion of the unclean
spirit, and rather thinking that he had desired to entice him by an ancient customary deceit,
and to brand an innocent brother with the crime of incest, being mindful of those words of
the gospel; viz., that “he abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar, and its father,”462 he made his way to

<pb n="962"/>
Pelusium, where he knew that the man lived, whom the evil spirit declared to be destroyed:
for the brother was very well known to him, and when he had asked him, he found that on
the same night on which that foul demon had announced his downfall to his company and
prince, he had left his former monastery, and sought the town, and had gone astray by a
wretched fall with the girl mentioned.</p>

one of us. And of the good ones the Saviour says: “Do not despise one of these little ones;
for I say unto you that their angels in heaven do always behold the face of thy Father which
is in heaven:”463 and this also: “the angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that
fear Him, and deliver them.”464 Moreover this also which is said in the Acts of the Apostles,
of Peter, that “it is his angel.”465 But of both sorts the book of the Shepherd teaches us very
fully.466 But if we consider about him who attacked the blessed Job we shall clearly learn
that it was he who always plotted against him but never could entice him to sin, and that
therefore he asked for power from the Lord, as he was worsted not by his (Job’s) virtue but
by the Lord’s protection which ever shielded him. Of Judas also it is said: “And let the devil
stand at his right hand.”467</p>

<head>Of the degrees of wickedness which exist in hostile spirits, as shown in the case of two philosophers.</head>
<p>But of the difference that there is between demons we have learnt a great deal by means
of those two philosophers who formerly by acts of magic had oftentimes great experience
both of their laziness and of their courage and savage wickedness. For these looking down
on the blessed Antony as a boor and rustic, and wanting, if they could not injure him any
further, at least to drive him from his cell by illusions of magic and the devices of demons,
despatched against him most foul spirits, for they were impelled to this attack upon him by
the sting of jealousy because enormous crowds came daily to him as the servant of God.
And when these most savage demons did not even venture to approach him as he was now
signing his breast and forehead with the sign of the cross, and, now devoting himself to
prayer and supplication, they returned without any result to those who had directed them;
and these again sent against him others more desperate in wickedness, and when these too
had spent their strength in vain, and returned without having accomplished anything, and
others still more powerful were nevertheless told off against the victorious soldier of Christ,
and could prevail nothing against him, all these great plots of theirs devised with all the arts
of magic were only useful in proving the great value that there is in the profession of
Christians, so that those fierce and powerful shadows, which they thought would veil the
sun and moon if they were directed towards them, could not only not injure him, but not
even draw him forth from his monastery for a single instant.</p>

<head>Of the fact that devils cannot prevail at all against men unless they have first secured possession

<p>And when in their astonishment at this they came straight to Abbot Antony and disclosed
the extent of their attacks and the reason of them and their plots, they dissembled their
jealousy and asked that they might forthwith be made Christians. But when he had asked
of them the day when the assault was made, he declared that at that time he had been afflicted
with the most bitter pangs of thought. And by this experience the blessed Antony proved
and established the opinion which we expressed yesterday in our Conference, that demons
cannot possibly find an entrance into the mind or body of anyone, nor have they the power
of overwhelming the soul of anyone, unless they have first deprived it of all holy thoughts,
and made it empty and free from spiritual meditation. But you must know that unclean
spirits are obedient to men in two ways. For either they are by divine grace and power subject
to the holiness of the faithful, or they are captivated by the sacrifices of sinners, and certain
charms, and are flattered by them as their worshippers. And the Pharisees too were led
astray by this notion and fancied that by this device even the Lord the Saviour gave commands
to devils, and said “By Beelzebub the prince of the devils He casteth out devils,” in accordance
with that plan by which they knew that their own magicians and enchanters—by invoking
his name and offering sacrifices, with which they know he is pleased and delighted—have
as his servants power even over the devils who are subject to him.</p>

daughters of men.</head>
<p>Germanus: Since a passage of Genesis was a little while ago by the providence of God
brought forward in our midst, and happily reminded us that we can now conveniently ask
about a point which we have always longed to learn, we want to know what view we ought
to take about those fallen angels who are said to have had intercourse with the daughters of
men, and whether such a thing can literally take place with a spiritual nature. And also with
regard to this passage of the gospel which you quoted of the devil a little while back, “for he
is a liar and his father,”468 we should like in the same way to hear who is to be understood
by “his father.”</p>
<note type="footnote">468 S. John viii. 44. We find from Augustin (Tract. xxiv. in Johan.) that the Manichees interpreted this text
as implying that the devil had a father, translating it “For he is a liar, and so is his father.” Augustine himself
explains it as Abbot Serenus does below in c. xxv.; viz., that the devil is not only a liar himself but the parent of
lies.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<head>The answer to the question raised.</head>
<p>Serenus: You have propounded two not unimportant questions, to which I will reply,
to the best of my ability, in the order in which you have raised them. We cannot possibly
believe that spiritual existences can have carnal intercourse with women. But if this could
ever have literally happened how is it that it does not now also sometimes take place, and
that we do not see some in the same way born of women by the agency of demons without
intercourse with men? especially when it is clear that they delight in the pollution of lust,
which they would certainly prefer to bring about through their own agency rather than
through that of men, if they could possibly manage it, as Ecclesiastes declares: “What is it
that hath been? The same that is. And what is it that hath been done? The same that is done.
And there is nothing new that can be said under the sun, so that a man can say: Behold this
is new; for it hath already been in the ages which were before us.”469 But the question raised
may be resolved in this way. After the death of righteous Abel, in order that the whole human
race might not spring from a wicked fratricide, Seth was born in the place of his brother
who was slain, to take the place of his brother not only as regards posterity, but also as regards
justice and goodness. And his offspring, following the example of their father’s goodness,
always remained separate from intercourse with and the society of their kindred descended
from the wicked Cain, as the difference of the genealogy very clearly tells us, where it says:
“Adam begat Seth, Seth begat Enos, Enos begat Cainan, but Cainan begat Mahalaleel, but
Mahalaleel begat Jared, Jared begat Enoch, Enoch begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat
Lamech, Lamech begat Noah.”470 And the genealogy of Cain is given separately as follows:
“Cain begat Enoch, Enoch begat Cainan, Cainan begat Mahalaleel, Mahalaleel begat Methuselah,
Methuselah begat Lamech, Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal.”471 And so the line which
sprang from the seed of righteous Seth always mixed with its own kith and kin, and continued
for a long while in the holiness of its fathers and ancestors, untouched by the blasphemies
and the wickedness of an evil offspring, which had implanted in it a seed of sin as it were
transmitted by its ancestors. As long then as there continued that separation of the lines
between them, the seed of Seth, as it sprang from an excellent root, was by reason of its
sanctity termed “angels of God,” or as some copies have it “sons of God;”472 and on the

the early fathers, including Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius and others. The explanation,

contrary the others by reason of their own and their fathers’ wickedness and their earthly
deeds were termed “children of men.” Though then there was up to this time that holy and
salutary separation between them, yet after this the sons of Seth who were the sons of God
saw the daughters of those who were born of the line of Cain, and inflamed with the desire
for their beauty took to themselves from them wives who taught their husbands the
wickedness of their fathers, and at once led them astray from their innate holiness and the
single-mindedness of their forefathers. To whom this saying applies with sufficient accuracy:
“I have said: Ye are Gods, and ye are all the children of the Most High. But ye shall die like
men, and fall like one of the princes;”473 who fell away from that true study of natural
philosophy, handed down to them by their ancestors, which the first man who forthwith
traced out the study of all nature, could clearly attain to, and transmit to his descendants
on sure grounds, inasmuch as he had seen the infancy of this world, while still as it were
tender and throbbing and unorganized; and as there was in him not only such fulness of
wisdom, but also the grace of prophecy given by the Divine inspiration, so that while he was
still an untaught inhabitant of this world he gave names to all living creatures, and not only
knew about the fury and poison of all kinds of beasts and serpents, but also distinguished
between the virtues of plants and trees and the natures of stones, and the changes of seasons
of which he had as yet no experience, so that he could well say: “The Lord hath given me
the true knowledge of the things that are, to know the disposition of the whole world, and
the virtues of the elements, the beginning and the ending and the midst of times, the alterations
of their courses and the changes of their seasons, the revolutions of the year and the
disposition of the stars, the natures of living creatures and the rage of wild beasts, the force
of winds, and the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots, and
all such things as are hid and open I have learnt.”474 This knowledge then of all nature the
seed of Seth received through successive generations, handed down from the fathers, so
long as it remained separate from the wicked line, and as it had received it in holiness, so it
made use of it to promote the glory of God and the needs of everyday life. But when it had
been mingled with the evil generation, it drew aside at the suggestion of devils to profane
and harmful uses what it had innocently learnt, and audaciously taught by it the curious
arts of wizards and enchantments and magical superstitions, teaching its posterity to forsake
the holy worship of the Divinity and to honour and worship either the elements or fire or
the demons of the air. How it was then that this knowledge of curious arts of which we have
spoken, did not perish in the deluge, but became known to the ages that followed, should,

Augustine, De Civitate Dei, Book XV. xxiii., where the passage is fully discussed.</note>

<pb n="969"/>
I think, be briefly explained, as the occasion of this discussion suggests, although the answer
to the question raised scarcely requires it. And so, as ancient traditions tell us, Ham the son
of Noah, who had been taught these superstitions and wicked and profane arts, as he knew
that he could not possibly bring any handbook on these subjects into the ark, into which he
was to enter with his good father and holy brothers, inscribed these nefarious arts and profane
devices on plates of various metals which could not be destroyed by the flood of waters, and
on hard rocks, and when the flood was over he hunted for them with the same inquisitiveness
with which he had concealed them, and so transmitted to his descendants a seed-bed of
profanity and perpetual sin. In this way then that common notion, according to which men
believe that angels delivered to men enchantments and diverse arts, is in truth fulfilled.
From these sons of Seth then and daughters of Cain, as we have said, there were born still
worse children who became mighty hunters, violent and most fierce men who were termed
giants by reason of the size of their bodies and their cruelty and wickedness. For these first
began to harass their neighbours and to practise pillaging among men, getting their living
rather by rapine than by being contented with the sweat and labour of toil, and their
wickedness increased to such a pitch that the world could only be purified by the flood and
deluge. So then when the sons of Seth at the instigation of their lust had transgressed that
command which had been for a long while kept by a natural instinct from the beginning of
the world, it was needful that it should afterwards be restored by the letter of the law: “Thou
shalt not give thy daughter to his son to wife, nor shalt thou take a wife of his daughters to
thy son; for they shall seduce your hearts to depart from your God, and to follow their gods
and serve them.”475</p>

<head>An objection, as to how an unlawful intermingling with the daughters of Cain could be charged
against the line of Seth before the prohibition of the law.</head>
<p>Germanus: If that command had been given to them, then the sin of breaking it might
fairly have been brought against them for their audacity in so marrying. But since the observance
of that separation had not yet been established by any rule, how could that intermingling
of races be counted wrong in them, as it had not been forbidden by any command?
For a law does not ordinarily forbid crimes that are past, but those that are future.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>The answer, that by the law of nature men were from the beginning liable to judgment and
punishment.</head>
<p>Serenus: God at man’s creation implanted in him naturally complete knowledge of the
law, and if this had been kept by man, as at the beginning, according to the Lord’s purposes,
there would not have been any need for another law to be given, which He afterwards proclaimed
in writing: for it were superfluous for an external remedy to be offered, where an
internal one was still implanted and vigorous. But since this had been, as we have said, utterly
corrupted by freedom and the opportunity of sinning, the severe restrictions of the law of
Moses were added as the executor and vindicator of this (earlier law) and to use the expressions
of Scripture, as its helper, that through fear of immediate punishment men might be
kept from altogether losing the good of natural knowledge, according to the word of the
prophet who says “He gave the law to help them:”476 and it is also described by the Apostle
as having been given as a schoolmaster477 to little children, as it instructs and guards them
to prevent them from departing through sheer forgetfulness from the teaching in which
they had been instructed by the light of nature: for that the complete knowledge of the law
was implanted in man at his first creation, is clearly proved from this; viz., that we know
that before the law, aye, and even before the flood, all holy men observed the commands of
the law without having the letter to read. For how could Abel, without the command of the
law, have known that he ought to offer to God a sacrifice of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof,478 unless he had been taught by the law which was naturally implanted in
him? How could Noah have distinguished what animals were clean and what were unclean,479
when the commandment of the law had not yet made a distinction, unless he had been
taught by a natural knowledge? Whence did Enoch learn how to “walk with God,”480 having
never acquired any light of the law from another? Where had Shem and Japheth read “Thou
shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father,” so that they went backwards and covered
the shame of their father?481 How was Abraham taught to abstain from the spoils of the
enemy which were offered to him, that he might not receive any recompense for his toil, or
to pay to the priest Melchizedec the tithes which are ordered by the law of Moses?482 How

was it too that the same Abraham and Lot also humbly offered to passers by and strangers
offices of kindness and the washing of their feet, while yet the Evangelic command had not
shone forth?483 Whence did Job obtain such earnestness of faith, such purity of chastity,
such knowledge of humility, gentleness, pity and kindness, as we now see shown not even
by those who know the gospels by heart? Which of the saints do we read of as not having
observed some commandment of the law before the giving of the law? Which of them failed
to keep this: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord?”484 Which of them did not fulfil
this: “Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of anything which
is in heaven or in the earth or under the earth?” Which of them did not observe this:
“Honour thy father and thy mother,” or what follows in the Decalogue: “Thou shalt do no
murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false
witness; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife,”485 and many other things besides, in
which they anticipated the commands not only of the law but even of the gospel?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>Of the fact that they were justly punished, who sinned before the flood.</head>
<p>And so then we see that from the beginning God created everything perfect, nor would
there have been need for anything to have been added to His original arrangement—as if
it were shortsighted and imperfect—if everything had continued in that state and condition
in which it had been created by Him. And therefore in the case of those who sinned before
the law and even before the flood we see that God visited them with a righteous judgment,
because they deserved to be punished without any excuse, for having transgressed the law
of nature; nor should we fall into the blasphemous slanders of those who are ignorant of
this reason, and so depreciate the God of the Old Testament, and run down our faith, and
say with a sneer: Why then did it please your God to will to promulgate the law after so
many thousand years, while He suffered such long ages to pass without any law? But if He
afterwards discovered something better, then it appears that at the beginning of the world
His wisdom was inferior and poorer, and that afterwards as if taught by experience He began
to provide for something better, and to amend and improve His original arrangements. A
thing which certainly cannot happen to the infinite foreknowledge of God, nor can these
assertions be made about Him by the mad folly of heretics without grievous blasphemy, as
Ecclesiastes says: “I have learnt that all the words which God hath made from the beginning
shall continue forever: nothing can be added to them, and nothing can be taken away from
them,”486 and therefore “the law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous, and
insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the wicked and profane.”487 For as they had
the sound and complete system of natural laws implanted in them they had no need of this
external law in addition, and one committed to writing, and what was given as an aid to
that natural law. From which we infer by the clearest of reasonings that that law committed
to writing need not have been given at the beginning (for it was unnecessary for this to be
done while the natural law still remained, and was not utterly violated) nor could evangelical
perfection have been granted before the law had been kept. For they could not have listened
to this saying: “If a man strikes thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also,”488 who
were not content to avenge wrongs done to them with the even justice of the lex talionis,
but repaid a very slight touch with deadly kicks and wounds with weapons, and for a single
truth sought to take the life of those who had struck them. Nor could it be said to them,
“love your enemies,”489 among whom it was considered a great thing and most important

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>How this that is said of the devil in the gospel is to be understood; viz., that “he is a liar, and
his father.”</head>
<p>But as for this which disturbed you about the devil, that “he is a liar and his father,”490
as if it seemed that he and his father were pronounced by the Lord to be liars, it is sufficiently
ridiculous to imagine this even cursorily. For as we said a little while ago spirit does not
beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul, though we do not doubt that the compacting
of flesh is formed from man’s seed, as the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both
substances; viz., flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as its author, and says:
“Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall
we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?”491 What could show
more clearly than this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our flesh,
but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls. Although even in the actual
compacting of this body a ministerial office alone must be attributed to men, but the chief
part of its formation to God the Creator of all, as David says: “Thy hands have made me
and fashioned me:”492 And the blessed Job: “Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled
me as cheese? Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews;”493 and the Lord to
Jeremiah: “Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.”494 But Ecclesiastes very clearly
and accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its beginning, by an examination
of the rise and commencement, from which each originated, and by a consideration of the
end to which each is tending, and decides also of the division of this body and soul, and
discourses as follows: “Before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns
unto God who gave it.”495 But what could be said with greater plainness than that he declares
that the matter of the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the seed of man,
and seems to be sown by his ministration, must, as it was taken from the earth, again return
to the earth, while he points out that the spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between
the sexes, but belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And this also is
clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which Adam in the first instance received
his life. And so from these passages we clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of
spirits but God alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can

only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as much as he was created
a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his Father but God his Maker. But when he had
become puffed up by pride and had said in his heart: “I will ascend above the heights of the
clouds, I will be like the Most High,”496 he became a liar, and “abode not in the truth;”497
but brought forth a lie from his own storehouse of wickedness and so became not only a liar,
but also the father of the actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and said
“Ye shall be as gods,”498 he abode not in the truth, but from the beginning became a murderer,
both by bringing Adam into a state of mortality, and by slaying Abel by the hand of
his brother at his suggestion. But already the approach of dawn is bringing to a close our
discussion, which has occupied nearly two whole nights, and our brief and simple words
have drawn our bark of this Conference from the deep sea of questions to a safe harbour of
silence, in which deep indeed, as the breath of the Divine Spirit drives us further in, so is
there ever opened out a wider and boundless space reaching beyond the sight of our eye,
and, as Solomon says, “It will become much further from us than it was, and a great depth;
who shall find it out?”499 Wherefore let us pray the Lord that both His fear and His love,
which cannot fail, may continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever
shield us unharmed, from the darts of the devil. For with these guards it is impossible for
anyone to fall into the snares of death. But there is this difference between the perfect and
imperfect, that in the case of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts
more abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly and more easily,
while in the case of the latter its position is weaker and it more easily grows cold, and so
quickly and more frequently allows them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we
heard this, the words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the old
man’s cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we first came, for the fulfilment
of his teaching.</p>

<head>IX. THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ISAAC.
ON PRAYER.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="978"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Introduction to the Conference.</head>
<p>What was promised in the second book of the Institutes500 on continual and unceasing
perseverance in prayer, shall be by the Lord’s help fulfilled by the Conferences of this Elder,
whom we will now bring forward; viz., Abbot Isaac:501 and when these have been propounded
I think that I shall have satisfied the commands of Pope Castor of blessed memory, and your
wishes, O blessed Pope Leontius and holy brother Helladius, and the length of the book in
its earlier part may be excused, though, in spite of our endeavour not only to compress what
had to be told into a brief discourse, but also to pass over very many points in silence, it has
been extended to a greater length than we intended. For having commenced with a full
discourse on various regulations which we have thought it well to curtail for the sake of
brevity, at the close the blessed Isaac spoke these words.</p>
<note type="footnote">500 See the Institutes Book II. c. ix.</note>
<note type="footnote">501 Isaac was, as we gathered from c. xxxi., a disciple of St. Antony, and is mentioned by Palladius Dial. de

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The words of Abbot Isaac on the nature of prayer.</head>
<p>The aim of every monk and the perfection of his heart tends to continual and unbroken
perseverance in prayer, and, as far as it is allowed to human frailty, strives to acquire an
immovable tranquillity of mind and a perpetual purity, for the sake of which we seek unweariedly
and constantly to practise all bodily labours as well as contrition of spirit. And
there is between these two a sort of reciprocal and inseparable union. For just as the crown
of the building of all virtues is the perfection of prayer, so unless everything has been united
and compacted by this as its crown, it cannot possibly continue strong and stable. For lasting
and continual calmness in prayer, of which we are speaking, cannot be secured or consummated
without them, so neither can those virtues which lay its foundations be fully gained
without persistence in it. And so we shall not be able either to treat properly of the effect of
prayer, or in a rapid discourse to penetrate to its main end, which is acquired by labouring
at all virtues, unless first all those things which for its sake must be either rejected or secured,
are singly enumerated and discussed, and, as the Parable in the gospel teaches,502 whatever
concerns the building of that spiritual and most lofty tower, is reckoned up and carefully
considered beforehand. But yet these things when prepared will be of no use nor allow the
lofty height of perfection to be properly placed upon them unless a clearance of all faults be
first undertaken, and the decayed and dead rubbish of the passions be dug up, and the strong
foundations of simplicity and humility be laid on the solid and (so to speak) living soil of
our breast, or rather on that rock of the gospel,503 and by being built in this way this tower
of spiritual virtues will rise, and be able to stand unmoved, and be raised to the utmost
heights of heaven in full assurance of its stability. For if it rests on such foundations, then
though heavy storms of passions break over it, though mighty torrents of persecutions beat
against it like a battering ram, though a furious tempest of spiritual foes dash against it and
attack it, yet not only will no ruin overtake it, but the onslaught will not injure it even in the
slightest degree.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How pure and sincere prayer can be gained.</head>
<p>And therefore in order that prayer may be offered up with that earnestness and purity
with which it ought to be, we must by all means observe these rules. First all anxiety about
carnal things must be entirely got rid of; next we must leave no room for not merely the
care but even the recollection of any business affairs, and in like manner also must lay aside
all backbitings, vain and incessant chattering, and buffoonery; anger above all and disturbing
moroseness must be entirely destroyed, and the deadly taint of carnal lust and covetousness
be torn up by the roots. And so when these and such like faults which are also visible to the
eyes of men, are entirely removed and cut off, and when such a purification and cleansing,
as we spoke of, has first taken place, which is brought about by pure simplicity and innocence,
then first there must be laid the secure foundations of a deep humility, which may be able
to support a tower that shall reach the sky; and next the spiritual structure of the virtues
must be built up upon them, and the soul kept free from all conversation and from roving
thoughts that thus it may by little and little begin to rise to the contemplation of God and
to spiritual insight. For whatever our mind has been thinking of before the hour of prayer,
is sure to occur to us while we are praying through the activity of the memory. Wherefore
what we want to find ourselves like while we are praying, that we ought to prepare ourselves
to be before the time for prayer. For the mind in prayer is formed by its previous condition,
and when we are applying ourselves to prayer the images of the same actions and words
and thoughts will dance before our eyes, and make us either angry, as in our previous condition,
or gloomy, or recall our former lust and business, or make us shake with foolish
laughter (which I am ashamed to speak of) at some silly joke, or smile at some action, or fly
back to our previous conversation. And therefore if we do not want anything to haunt us
while we are praying, we should be careful before our prayer, to exclude it from the shrine
of our heart, that we may thus fulfill the Apostle’s injunction: “Pray without ceasing;” and:
“In every place lifting up holy hands without wrath or disputing.”504 For otherwise we shall
not be able to carry out that charge unless our mind, purified from all stains of sin, and
given over to virtue as to its natural good, feed on the continual contemplation of Almighty
God.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of the lightness of the soul which may be compared to a wing or feather.</head>
<p>For the nature of the soul is not inaptly compared to a very fine feather or very light
wing, which, if it has not been damaged or affected by being spoilt by any moisture falling
on it from without, is borne aloft almost naturally to the heights of heaven by the lightness
of its nature, and the aid of the slightest breath: but if it is weighted by any moisture falling
upon it and penetrating into it, it will not only not be carried away by its natural lightness
into any aerial flights but will actually be borne down to the depths of earth by the weight
of the moisture it has received. So also our soul, if it is not weighted with faults that touch
it, and the cares of this world, or damaged by the moisture of injurious lusts, will be raised
as it were by the natural blessing of its own purity and borne aloft to the heights by the light
breath of spiritual meditation; and leaving things low and earthly will be transported to
those that are heavenly and invisible. Wherefore we are well warned by the Lord’s command:
“Take heed that your hearts be not weighed down by surfeiting and drunkenness and the
cares of this world.”505 And therefore if we want our prayers to reach not only the sky, but
what is beyond the sky, let us be careful to reduce our soul, purged from all earthly faults
and purified from every stain, to its natural lightness, that so our prayer may rise to God
unchecked by the weight of any sin.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of the ways in which our soul is weighed down.</head>
<p>But we should notice the ways in which the Lord points out that the soul is weighed
down: for He did not mention adultery, or fornication, or murder, or blasphemy, or rapine,
which everybody knows to be deadly and damnable, but surfeiting and drunkenness, and
the cares or anxieties of this world: which men of this world are so far from avoiding or
considering damnable that actually some who (I am ashamed to say) call themselves monks
entangle themselves in these very occupations as if they were harmless or useful. And though
these three things, when literally given way to weigh down the soul, and separate it from
God, and bear it down to things earthly, yet it is very easy to avoid them, especially for us
who are separated by so great a distance from all converse with this world, and who do not
on any occasion have anything to do with those visible cares and drunkenness and surfeiting.
But there is another surfeiting which is no less dangerous, and a spiritual drunkenness which
it is harder to avoid, and a care and anxiety of this world, which often ensnares us even after
the perfect renunciation of all our goods, and abstinence from wine and all feastings and
even when we are living in solitude—and of such the prophet says: “Awake, ye that are
drunk but not with wine;”506 and another: “Be astonished and wonder and stagger: be drunk
and not with wine: be moved, but not with drunkenness.”507 And of this drunkenness the
wine must consequently be what the prophet calls “the fury of dragons”: and from what
root the wine comes you may hear: “From the vineyard of Sodom,” he says, “is their vine,
and their branches from Gomorrha.” Would you also know about the fruit of that vine and
the seed of that branch? “Their grape is a grape of gall, theirs is a cluster of bitterness”508
for unless we are altogether cleansed from all faults and abstaining from the surfeit of all
passions, our heart will without drunkenness from wine and excess of any feasting be weighed
down by a drunkenness and surfeiting that is still more dangerous. For that worldly cares
can sometimes fall on us who mix with no actions of this world, is clearly shown according
to the rule of the Elders, who have laid down that anything which goes beyond the necessities
of daily food, and the unavoidable needs of the flesh, belongs to worldly cares and anxieties,
as for example if, when a job bringing in a penny would satisfy the needs of our body, we
try to extend it by a longer toil and work in order to get twopence or threepence; and when
a covering of two tunics would be enough for our use both by night and day, we manage to
become the owners of three or four, or when a hut containing one or two cells would be
sufficient, in the pride of worldly ambition and greatness we build four or five cells, and

these splendidly decorated, and larger than our needs required, thus showing the passion
of worldly lusts whenever we can.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the vision which a certain Elder saw concerning the restless work of a brother.</head>
<p>And that this is not done without the prompting of devils we are taught by the surest
proofs, for when one very highly esteemed Elder was passing by the cell of a certain brother
who was suffering from this mental disease of which we have spoken, as he was restlessly
toiling in his daily occupations in building and repairing what was unnecessary, he watched
him from a distance breaking a very hard stone with a heavy hammer, and saw a certain
Ethiopian standing over him and together with him striking the blows of the hammer with
joined and clasped hands, and urging him on with fiery incitements to diligence in the work:
and so he stood still for a long while in astonishment at the force of the fierce demon and
the deceitfulness of such an illusion. For when the brother was worn out and tired and
wanted to rest and put an end to his toil, he was stimulated by the spirit’s prompting and
urged on to resume his hammer again and not to cease from devoting himself to the work
which he had begun, so that being unweariedly supported by his incitements he did not feel
the harm that so great labour was doing him. At last then the old man, disgusted at such a
horrid mystification by a demon, turned aside to the brother’s cell and saluted him, and
asked “what work is it, brother, that you are doing?” and he replied: “We are working at this
awfully hard stone, and we can hardly break it at all.” Whereupon the Elder replied: “You
were right in saying ‘we can,’ for you were not alone, when you were striking it, but there
was another with you whom you did not see, who was standing over you not so much to
help you as urge you on with all his force.” And thus the fact that the disease of worldly
vanity has not got hold of our hearts, will be proved by no mere abstinence from those affairs
which even if we want to engage in, we cannot carry out, nor by the despising of those
matters which if we pursued them would make us remarkable in the front rank among
spiritual persons as well as among worldly men, but only when we reject with inflexible
firmness of mind whatever ministers to our power and seems to be veiled in a show of right.
And in reality these things which seem trivial and of no consequence, and which we see to
be permitted indifferently by those who belong to our calling, none the less by their character
affect the soul than those more important things, which according to their condition usually
intoxicate the senses of worldly people and which do not allow509 a monk to lay aside earthly
impurities and aspire to God, on whom his attention should ever be fixed; for in his case
even a slight separation from that highest good must be regarded as present death and most
dangerous destruction. And when the soul has been established in such a peaceful condition,
and has been freed from the meshes of all carnal desires, and the purpose of the heart has
<note type="footnote">509 Sinentes, though the reading of almost all mss. must be an error either of the author or of a copyist for
sinentia.</note>

<pb n="985"/>
been steadily fixed on that which is the only highest good, he will then fulfil this Apostolic
precept: “Pray without ceasing;” and: “in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath
and disputing:”510 for when by this purity (if we can say so) the thoughts of the soul are
engrossed, and are re-fashioned out of their earthly condition to bear a spiritual and angelic
likeness, whatever it receives, whatever it takes in hand, whatever it does, the prayer will be
perfectly pure and sincere.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>A question how it is that it is harder work to preserve than to originate good thoughts.</head>
<p>Germanus: If only we could keep as a lasting possession those spiritual thoughts in the
same way and with the same ease with which we generally conceive their germs! for when
they have been conceived in our hearts either through the recollection of the Scriptures or
by the memory of some spiritual actions, or by gazing upon heavenly mysteries, they vanish
all too soon and disappear by a sort of unnoticed flight. And when our soul has discovered
some other occasions for spiritual emotions, different ones again crowd in upon us, and
those which we had grasped are scattered, and lightly fly away so that the mind retaining
no persistency, and keeping of its own power no firm hand over holy thoughts, must be
thought, even when it does seem to retain them for a while, to have conceived them at random
and not of set purpose. For how can we think that their rise should be ascribed to our own
will, if they do not last and remain with us? But that we may not owing to the consideration
of this question wander any further from the plan of the discourse we had commenced, or
delay any longer the explanation promised of the nature of prayer, we will keep this for its
own time, and ask to be informed at once of the character of prayer, especially as the blessed
Apostle exhorts us at no time to cease from it, saying “Pray without ceasing.” And so we
want to be taught first of its character, i.e., how prayer ought always to be offered up, and
then how we can secure this, whatever it is, and practise it without ceasing. For that it cannot
be done by any light purpose of heart both daily experience and the explanation of four
holiness show us, as you have laid it down that the aim of a monk, and the height of all
perfection consist in the consummation of prayer.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
<pb n="987"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the different characters of prayer.</head>
<p>Isaac: I imagine that all kinds of prayers cannot be grasped without great purity of heart
and soul and the illumination of the Holy Spirit. For there are as many of them as there can
be conditions and characters produced in one soul or rather in all souls. And so although
we know that owing to our dulness of heart we cannot see all kinds of prayers, yet we will
try to relate them in some order, as far as our slender experience enables us to succeed. For
according to the degree of the purity to which each soul attains, and the character of the
state in which it is sunk owing to what happens to it, or is by its own efforts renewing itself,
its very prayers will each moment be altered: and therefore it is quite clear that no one can
always offer up uniform prayers. For every one prays in one way when he is brisk, in another
when he is oppressed with a weight of sadness or despair, in another when he is invigorated
by spiritual achievements, in another when cast down by the burden of attacks, in another
when he is asking pardon for his sins, in another when he asks to obtain grace or some virtue
or else prays for the destruction of some sin, in another when he is pricked to the heart by
the thought of hell and the fear of future judgment, in another when he is aglow with the
hope and desire of good things to come, in another when he is taken up with affairs and
dangers, in another when he is in peace and security, in another when he is enlightened by
the revelation of heavenly mysteries, and in another when he is depressed by a sense of
barrenness in virtues and dryness in feeling.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"> 
<pb n="988"/>
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of the fourfold nature of prayer.</head>
<p>And therefore, when we have laid this down with regard to the character of prayer, although
not so fully as the importance of the subject requires, but as fully as the exigencies
of time permit, and at any rate as our slender abilities admit, and our dulness of heart enables
us,—a still greater difficulty now awaits us; viz., to expound one by one the different kinds
of prayer, which the Apostle divides in a fourfold manner, when he says as follows: “I exhort
therefore first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made.”511
And we cannot possibly doubt that this division was not idly made by the Apostle. And to
begin with we must investigate what is meant by supplication, by prayer, by intercession,
and by thanksgiving. Next we must inquire whether these four kinds are to be taken in hand
by him who prays all at once, i.e., are they all to be joined together in every prayer,—or
whether they are to be offered up in turns and one by one, as, for instance, ought at one
time supplications, at another prayers, at another intercessions, and at another thanksgivings
to be offered, or should one man present to God supplications, another prayers, another
intercessions, another thanksgivings, in accordance with that measure of age, to which each
soul is advancing by earnestness of purpose?</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Of the order of the different kinds laid down with regard to the character of prayer.</head>
<p>And so to begin with we must consider the actual force of the names and words, and
discuss what is the difference between prayer and supplication and intercession; then in like
manner we must investigate whether they are to be offered separately or all together; and
in the third place must examine whether the particular order which is thus arranged by the
Apostle’s authority has anything further to teach the hearer, or whether the distinction
simply is to be taken, and it should be considered that they were arranged by him indifferently
in such a way: a thing which seems to me utterly absurd. For one must not believe that the
Holy Spirit uttered anything casually or without reason through the Apostle. And so we
will, as the Lord grants us, consider them in the same order in which we began.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of Supplications.</head>
<p>“I exhort therefore first of all that supplications be made.” Supplication is an imploring
or petition concerning sins, in which one who is sorry for his present or past deeds asks for
pardon.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12"> 
<pb n="991"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Of Prayer.</head>
<p>Prayers are those by which we offer or vow something to God, what the Greeks call
εὐκή, i.e., a vow. For where we read in Greek ἰὰς ἐυκάς μου τῶ κυρίῶ ἀποδώσω, in Latin
we read: “I will pay my vows unto the Lord;”512 where according to the exact force of the
words it may be thus represented: “I will pay my prayers unto the Lord.” And this which
we find in Ecclesiastes: “If thou vowest a vow unto the Lord do not delay to pay it,” is written
in Greek likewise: ἐάν ἐύξῃ ἐυχὴν τῶ κυρίῶ, i.e., “If thou prayest a prayer unto the Lord,
do not delay to pay it,”513 which will be fulfilled in this way by each one of us. We pray,
when we renounce this world and promise that being dead to all worldly actions and the
life of this world we will serve the Lord with full purpose of heart. We pray when we promise
that despising secular honours and scorning earthly riches we will cleave to the Lord in all
sorrow of heart and humility of spirit. We pray when we promise that we will ever maintain
the most perfect purity of body and steadfast patience, or when we vow that we will utterly
root out of our heart the roots of anger or of sorrow that worketh death. And if, enervated
by sloth and returning to our former sins we fail to do this we shall be guilty as regards our
prayers and vows, and these words will apply to us: “It is better not to vow, than to vow and
not to pay,” which can be rendered in accordance with the Greek: “It is better for thee not
to pray than to pray and not to pay.”514</p>

<head>Of Intercession.</head>
<p>In the third place stand intercessions, which we are wont to offer up for others also,
while we are filled with fervour of spirit, making request either for those dear to us or for
the peace of the whole world, and to use the Apostle’s own phrase, we pray “for all men, for
kings and all that are in authority.”515</p>

<head>Of Thanksgiving.</head>
<p>Then in the fourth place there stand thanksgivings which the mind in ineffable transports
offers up to God, either when it recalls God’s past benefits or when it contemplates His
present ones, or when it looks forward to those great ones in the future which God has
prepared for them that love Him. And with this purpose too sometimes we are wont to pour
forth richer prayers, while, as we gaze with pure eyes on those rewards of the saints which
are laid up in store hereafter, our spirit is stimulated to offer up unspeakable thanks to God
with boundless joy.</p>
</div>

<pb n="994"/>
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Whether these four kinds of prayers are necessary for everyone to offer all at once or separately
and in turns.</head>
<p>And of these four kinds, although sometimes occasions arise for richer and fuller prayers
(for from the class of supplications which arises from sorrow for sin, and from the kind of
prayer which flows from confidence in our offerings and the performance of our vows in
accordance with a pure conscience, and from the intercession which proceeds from fervour
of love, and from the thanksgiving which is born of the consideration of God’s blessings
and His greatness and goodness, we know that oftentimes there proceed most fervent and
ardent prayers so that it is clear that all these kinds of prayer of which we have spoken are
found to be useful and needful for all men, so that in one and the same man his changing
feelings will give utterance to pure and fervent petitions now of supplications, now of
prayers, now of intercessions) yet the first seems to belong more especially to beginners,
who are still troubled by the stings and recollection of their sins; the second to those who
have already attained some loftiness of mind in their spiritual progress and the quest of
virtue; the third to those who fulfil the completion of their vows by their works, and are so
stimulated to intercede for others also through the consideration of their weakness, and the
earnestness of their love; the fourth to those who have already torn from their hearts the
guilty thorns of conscience, and thus being now free from care can contemplate with a pure
mind the beneficence of God and His compassions, which He has either granted in the past,
or is giving in the present, or preparing for the future, and thus are borne onward with fervent
hearts to that ardent prayer which cannot be embraced or expressed by the mouth of men.
Sometimes however the mind which is advancing to that perfect state of purity and which
is already beginning to be established in it, will take in all these at one and the same time,
and like some incomprehensible and all-devouring flame, dart through them all and offer
up to God inexpressible prayers of the purest force, which the Spirit Itself, intervening with
groanings that cannot be uttered, while we ourselves understand not, pours forth to God,
grasping at that hour and ineffably pouring forth in its supplications things so great that
they cannot be uttered with the mouth nor even at any other time be recollected by the
mind. And thence it comes that in whatever degree any one stands, he is found sometimes
to offer up pure and devout prayers; as even in that first and lowly station which has to do
with the recollection of future judgment, he who still remains under the punishment of
terror and the fear of judgment is so smitten with sorrow for the time being that he is filled
with no less keenness of spirit from the richness of his supplications than he who through
the purity of his heart gazes on and considers the blessings of God and is overcome with

<pb n="995"/>
ineffable joy and delight. For, as the Lord Himself says, he begins to love the more, who
knows that he has been forgiven the more.516</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>Of the kinds of prayer to which we ought to direct ourselves.</head>
<p>Yet we ought by advancing in life and attaining to virtue to aim rather at those kinds
of prayer which are poured forth either from the contemplation of the good things to come
or from fervour of love, or which at least, to speak more humbly and in accordance with
the measure of beginners, arise for the acquirement of some virtue or the extinction of some
fault. For otherwise we shall not possibly attain to those sublimer kinds of supplication of
which we spoke, unless our mind has been little by little and by degrees raised through the
regular course of those intercessions.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17"> 
<pb n="997"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>How the four kinds of supplication were originated by the Lord.</head>
<p>These four kinds of supplication the Lord Himself by His own example vouchsafed to
originate for us, so that in this too He might fulfil that which was said of Him: “which Jesus
began both to do and to teach.”517 For He made use of the class of supplication when He
said: “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;” or this which is chanted in His
Person in the Psalm: “My God, My God, look upon Me, why hast Thou forsaken me,”518
and others like it. It is prayer where He says: “I have magnified Thee upon the earth, I have
finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do,” and this: “And for their sakes I sanctify
Myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth.”519 It is intercession when He says:
“Father, those Whom Thou hast given me, I will that they also may be with Me that they
may see My glory which Thou hast given Me;” or at any rate when He says: “Father, forgive
them for they know not what they do.”520 It is thanksgiving when He says: “I confess to
Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy
sight:” or at least when He says: “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. But I knew
that Thou hearest Me always.”521 But though our Lord made a distinction between these
four kinds of prayers as to be offered separately and one by one according to the scheme
which we know of, yet that they can all be embraced in a perfect prayer at one and the same
time He showed by His own example in that prayer which at the close of S. John’s gospel
we read that He offered up with such fulness. From the words of which (as it is too long to
repeat it all) the careful inquirer can discover by the order of the passage that this is so. And
the Apostle also in his Epistle to the Philippians has expressed the same meaning, by putting
these four kinds of prayers in a slightly different order, and has shown that they ought
sometimes to be offered together in the fervour of a single prayer, saying as follows: “But
in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
unto God.”522 And by this he wanted us especially to understand that in prayer and supplication
thanksgiving ought to be mingled with our requests.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>Of the Lord’s Prayer.</head>
<p>And so there follows after these different kinds of supplication a still more sublime and
exalted condition which is brought about by the contemplation of God alone and by fervent
love, by which the mind, transporting and flinging itself into love for Him, addresses God
most familiarly as its own Father with a piety of its own. And that we ought earnestly to
seek after this condition the formula of the Lord’s prayer teaches us, saying “Our Father.”
When then we confess with our own mouths that the God and Lord of the universe is our
Father, we profess forthwith that we have been called from our condition as slaves to the
adoption of sons, adding next “Which art in heaven,” that, by shunning with the utmost
horror all lingering in this present life, which we pass upon this earth as a pilgrimage, and
what separates us by a great distance from our Father, we may the rather hasten with all
eagerness to that country where we confess that our Father dwells, and may not allow anything
of this kind, which would make us unworthy of this our profession and the dignity of
an adoption of this kind, and so deprive us as a disgrace to our Father’s inheritance, and
make us incur the wrath of His justice and severity. To which state and condition of sonship
when we have advanced, we shall forthwith be inflamed with the piety which belongs to
good sons, so that we shall bend all our energies to the advance not of our own profit, but
of our Father’s glory, saying to Him: “Hallowed be Thy name,” testifying that our desire
and our joy is His glory, becoming imitators of Him who said: “He who speaketh of himself,
seeketh his own glory. But He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, the same is true
and there is no unrighteousness in Him.”523 Finally the chosen vessel being filled with this
feeling wished that he could be anathema from Christ524 if only the people belonging to
Him might be increased and multiplied, and the salvation of the whole nation of Israel accrue
to the glory of His Father; for with all assurance could he wish to die for Christ as he knew
that no one perished for life. And again he says: “We rejoice when we are weak but ye are
strong.”525 And what wonder if the chosen vessel wished to be anathema from Christ for
the sake of Christ’s glory and the conversion of His own brethren and the privilege of the
nation, when the prophet Micah wished that he might be a liar and a stranger to the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, if only the people of the Jews might escape those plagues and the
going forth into captivity which he had announced in his prophecy, saying: “Would that I
were not a man that hath the Spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie;”526—to pass over that wish
<note type="footnote">523 S. John vii. 18.</note>

of the Lawgiver, who did not refuse to die together with his brethren who were doomed to
death, saying: “I beseech Thee, O Lord; this people hath sinned a heinous sin; either forgive
them this trespass, or if Thou do not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written.”527
But where it is said “Hallowed be Thy name,” it may also be very fairly taken in this way:
“The hallowing of God is our perfection.” And so when we say to Him “Hallowed be Thy
name” we say in other words, make us, O Father, such that we maybe able both to understand
and take in what the hallowing of Thee is, or at any rate that Thou mayest be seen to be
hallowed in our spiritual converse. And this is effectually fulfilled in our case when “men
see our good works, and glorify our Father Which is in heaven.”528</p>

<head>Of the clause “Thy kingdom come.”</head>
<p>The second petition of the pure heart desires that the kingdom of its Father may come
at once; viz., either that whereby Christ reigns day by day in the saints (which comes to pass
when the devil’s rule is cast out of our hearts by the destruction of foul sins, and God begins
to hold sway over us by the sweet odour of virtues, and, fornication being overcome, charity
reigns in our hearts together with tranquillity, when rage is conquered; and humility, when
pride is trampled under foot) or else that which is promised in due time to all who are perfect,
and to all the sons of God, when it will be said to them by Christ: “Come ye blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;”529 (as the
heart) with fixed and steadfast gaze, so to speak, yearns and longs for it and says to Him
“Thy kingdom come.” For it knows by the witness of its own conscience that when He shall
appear, it will presently share His lot. For no guilty person would dare either to say or to
wish for this, for no one would want to face the tribunal of the Judge, who knew that at His
coming he would forthwith receive not the prize or reward of his merits but only punishment.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>Of the clause “Thy will be done.”</head>
<p>The third petition is that of sons: “Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth.” There
can now be no grander prayer than to wish that earthly things may be made equal with
things heavenly: for what else is it to say “Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth,” than
to ask that men may be like angels and that as God’s will is ever fulfilled by them in heaven,
so also all those who are on earth may do not their own but His will? This too no one could
say from the heart but only one who believed that God disposes for our good all things
which are seen, whether fortunate or unfortunate, and that He is more careful and provident
for our good and salvation than we ourselves are for ourselves. Or at any rate it may be taken
in this way: The will of God is the salvation of all men, according to these words of the
blessed Paul: “Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.”530
Of which will also the prophet Isaiah says in the Person of God the Father: “And all Thy
will shall be done.”531 When we say then “Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth,” we
pray in other words for this; viz., that as those who are in heaven, so also may all those who
dwell on earth be saved, O Father, by the knowledge of Thee.</p>

<p>Next: “Give us this day our bread which is ἐπιούσιον,” i.e., “supersubstantial,” which
another Evangelist calls “daily.”532 The former indicates the quality of its nobility and sub-
stance, in virtue of which it is above all substances and the loftiness of its grandeur and
holiness exceeds all creatures, while the latter intimates the purpose of its use and value. For
where it says “daily” it shows that without it we cannot live a spiritual life for a single day.
Where it says “today” it shows that it must be received daily and that yesterday’s supply of
it is not enough, but at it must be given to us today also in like manner. And our daily need
of it suggests to us that we ought at all times to offer up this prayer, because there is no day
on which we have no need to strengthen the heart of our inner man, by eating and receiving
it, although the expression used, “today” may be taken to apply to his present life, i.e., while
we are living in this world supply us with this bread. For we know that it will be given to
those who deserve it by Thee hereafter, but we ask that Thou wouldest grant it to us today,
because unless it has been vouchsafed to a man to receive it in this life he will never be partaker
of it in that.</p>
<note type="footnote">532 Here Cassian is relying entirely on Jerome’s revised text of the Latin, which has supersubstantialis in S.
Matt. vi. 11, as the rendering of ἐπιούσιος but translates the same word by quotidianum in the parallel passage
in S. Luke xi. 3. It is curious that Cassian should have been thus misled, with his knowledge of Greek, as well as
his acquaintance with the old Latin version which has quotidianum in both gospels. Cf. Bishop Lightfoot “On
a Fresh Revision of the New Testament,” p. 219.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>Of the clause: “Forgive us our debts, etc.”</head>
<p>“And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.” O unspeakable mercy of God,
which has not only given us a form of prayer and taught us a system of life acceptable to
Him, and by the requirements of the form given, in which He charged us always to pray,
has torn up the roots of both anger and sorrow, but also gives to those who pray an opportunity
and reveals to them a way by which they may move a merciful and kindly judgment
of God to be pronounced over them and which somehow gives us a power by which we can
moderate the sentence of our Judge, drawing Him to forgive our offences by the example
of our forgiveness: when we say to Him: “Forgive us as we also forgive.” And so without
anxiety and in confidence from this prayer a man may ask for pardon of his own offences,
if he has been forgiving towards his own debtors, and not towards those of his Lord. For
some of us, which is very bad, are inclined to show ourselves calm and most merciful in regard
to those things which are done to God’s detriment, however great the crimes may be, but
to be found most hard and inexorable exactors of debts to ourselves even in the case of the
most trifling wrongs. Whoever then does not from his heart forgive his brother who has
offended him, by this prayer calls down upon himself not forgiveness but condemnation,
and by his own profession asks that he himself may be judged more severely, saying: Forgive
me as I also have forgiven. And if he is repaid according to his own request, what else will
follow but that he will be punished after his own example with implacable wrath and a
sentence that cannot be remitted? And so if we want to be judged mercifully, we ought also
to be merciful towards those who have sinned against us. For only so much will be remitted
to us, as we have remitted to those who have injured us however spitefully. And some
dreading this, when this prayer is chanted by all the people in church, silently omit this
clause, for fear lest they may seem by their own utterance to bind themselves rather than to
excuse themselves, as they do not understand that it is in vain that they try to offer these
quibbles to the Judge of all men, who has willed to show us beforehand how He will judge
His suppliants. For as He does not wish to be found harsh and inexorable towards them,
He has marked out the manner of His judgment, that just as we desire to be judged by Him,
so we should also judge our brethren, if they have wronged us in anything, for “he shall have
judgment without mercy who hath shown no mercy.”533</p>

<head>Of the clause: “Lead us not into temptation.”</head>
<p>Next there follows: “And lead us not into temptation,” on which there arises no unimportant
question, for if we pray that we may not be suffered to be tempted, how then will
our power of endurance be proved, according to this text: “Every one who is not tempted
is not proved;”534 and again: “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation?”535 The clause
then, “Lead us not into temptation,” does not mean this; viz., do not permit us ever to be
tempted, but do not permit us when we fall into temptation to be overcome. For Job was
tempted, but was not led into temptation. For he did not ascribe folly to God nor blasphemy,
nor with impious mouth did he yield to that wish of the tempter toward which he was drawn.
Abraham was tempted, Joseph was tempted, but neither of them was led into temptation
for neither of them yielded his consent to the tempter. Next there follows: “But deliver us
from evil,” i.e., do not suffer us to be tempted by the devil above that we are able, but “make
with the temptation a way also of escape that we may be able to bear it.”536</p>

<head>How we ought not to ask for other things, except only those which are contained in the limits
of the Lord’s Prayer.</head>
<p>You see then what is the method and form of prayer proposed to us by the Judge Himself,
who is to be prayed to by it, a form in which there is contained no petition for riches, no
thought of honours, no request for power and might, no mention of bodily health and of
temporal life. For He who is the Author of Eternity would have men ask of Him nothing
uncertain, nothing paltry, and nothing temporal. And so a man will offer the greatest insult
to His Majesty and Bounty, if he leaves on one side these eternal petitions and chooses rather
to ask of Him something transitory and uncertain; and will also incur the indignation rather
than the propitiation of the Judge by the pettiness of his prayer.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Of the character of the sublimer prayer.</head>
<p>This prayer then though it seems to contain all the fulness of perfection, as being what
was originated and appointed by the Lord’s own authority, yet lifts those to whom it belongs
to that still higher condition of which we spoke above, and carries them on by a loftier stage
to that ardent prayer which is known and tried by but very few, and which to speak more
truly is ineffable; which transcends all human thoughts, and is distinguished, I will not say
by any sound of the voice, but by no movement of the tongue, or utterance of words, but
which the mind enlightened by the infusion of that heavenly light describes in no human
and confined language, but pours forth richly as from copious fountain in an accumulation
of thoughts, and ineffably utters to God, expressing in the shortest possible space of time
such great things that the mind when it returns to its usual condition cannot easily utter or
relate. And this condition our Lord also similarly prefigured by the form of those supplications
which, when he retired alone in the mountain He is said to have poured forth in silence,
and when being in an agony of prayer He shed forth even drops of blood, as an example of
a purpose which it is hard to imitate.</p>

<head>Of the different causes of conviction.</head>
<p>But who is able, with whatever experience he may be endowed, to give a sufficient account
of the varieties and reasons and grounds of conviction, by which the mind is inflamed and
set on fire and incited to pure and most fervent prayers? And of these we will now by way
of specimen set forth a few, as far as we can by God’s enlightenment recollect them. For
sometimes a verse of any one of the Psalms gives us an occasion of ardent prayer while we
are singing. Sometimes the harmonious modulation of a brother’s voice stirs up the minds
of dullards to intense supplication. We know also that the enunciation and the reverence
of the chanter adds greatly to the fervour of those who stand by. Moreover the exhortation
of a perfect man, and a spiritual conference has often raised the affections of those present
to the richest prayer. We know too that by the death of a brother or some one dear to us,
we are no less carried away to full conviction. The recollection also of our coldness and
carelessness has sometimes aroused in us a healthful fervour of spirit. And in this way no
one can doubt that numberless opportunities are not wanting, by which through God’s
grace the coldness and sleepiness of our minds can be shaken off.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>Of the different sorts of conviction.</head>
<p>But how and in what way those very convictions are produced from the inmost recesses
of the soul it is no less difficult to trace out. For often through some inexpressible delight
and keenness of spirit the fruit of a most salutary conviction arises so that it actually breaks
forth into shouts owing to the greatness of its incontrollable joy; and the delight of the heart
and greatness of exultation makes itself heard even in the cell of a neighbour. But sometimes
the mind hides itself in complete silence within the secrets of a profound quiet, so that the
amazement of a sudden illumination chokes all sounds of words and the overawed spirit
either keeps all its feelings to itself or loses537 them and pours forth its desires to God with
groanings that cannot be uttered. But sometimes it is filled with such overwhelming conviction
and grief that it cannot express it except by floods of tears.</p>

<head>A question about the fact that a plentiful supply of tears is not in our own power.</head>
<p>Germanus: My own poor self indeed is not altogether ignorant of this feeling of conviction.
For often when tears arise at the recollection of my faults, I have been by the Lord’s
visitation so refreshed by this ineffable joy which you describe that the greatness of the joy
has assured me that I ought not to despair of their forgiveness. Than which state of mind I
think there is nothing more sublime if only it could be recalled at our own will. For sometimes
when I am desirous to stir myself up with all my power to the same conviction and tears,
and place before my eyes all my faults and sins, I am unable to bring back that copiousness
of tears, and so my eyes are dry and hard like some hardest flint, so that not a single tear
trickles from them. And so in proportion as I congratulate myself on that copiousness of
tears, just so do I mourn that I cannot bring it back again whenever I wish.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29"> 
<pb n="1010"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<head>The answer on the varieties of conviction which spring from tears.</head>
<p>Isaac: Not every kind of shedding of tears is produced by one feeling or one virtue. For
in one way does that weeping originate which is caused by the pricks of our sins smiting
our heart, of which we read: “I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my
bed; I will water my couch with my tears.”538 And again: “Let tears run down like a torrent
day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of thine eye cease.”539 In another,
that which arises from the contemplation of eternal good things and the desire of that future
glory, owing to which even richer well-springs of tears burst forth from uncontrollable delights
and boundless exultation, while our soul is athirst for the mighty Living God, saying,
“When shall I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat
day and night,”540 declaring with daily crying and lamentation: “Woe is me that my sojourning
is prolonged;” and: “Too long hath my soul been a sojourner.”541 In another way do the
tears flow forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed from the fear
of hell and the recollection of that terrible judgment, with the terror of which the prophet
was smitten and prayed to God, saying: “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in
Thy sight shall no man living be justified.”542 There is too another kind of tears, which are
caused not by knowledge of one’s self but by the hardness and sins of others; whereby Samuel
is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former
days for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: “Oh, that my head were water and mine
eyes a fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
people.”543 Or also such as were those tears of which we hear in the hundred and first Psalm:
“For I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my cup with weeping.”544 And these
were certainty not caused by the same feeling as those which arise in the sixth Psalm from
the person of the penitent, but were due to the anxieties of this life and its distresses and
losses, by which the righteous who are living in this world are oppressed. And this is clearly
shown not only by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its title, which runs as follows
in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the gospel that “blessed are the

<head>How tears ought not to be squeezed out, when they do not flow spontaneously.</head>
<p>From these tears those are vastly different which are squeezed out from dry eyes while
the heart is hard: and although we cannot believe that these are altogether fruitless (for the
attempt to shed them is made with a good intention, especially by those who have not yet
been able to attain to perfect knowledge or to be thoroughly cleansed from the stains of past
or present sins), yet certainly the flow of tears ought not to be thus forced out by those who
have already advanced to the love of virtue, nor should the weeping of the outward man be
with great labour attempted, as even if it is produced it will never attain the rich copiousness
of spontaneous tears. For it will rather cast down the soul of the suppliant by his endeavours,
and humiliate him, and plunge him in human affairs and draw him away from the celestial
heights, wherein the awed mind of one who prays should be steadfastly fixed, and will force
it to relax its hold on its prayers and grow sick from barren and forced tears.</p>

<p>And that you may see the character of true prayer I will give you not my own opinion
but that of the blessed Antony: whom we have known sometimes to have been so persistent
in prayer that often as he was praying in a transport of mind, when the sunrise began to
appear, we have heard him in the fervour of his spirit declaiming: Why do you hinder me,
O sun, who art arising for this very purpose; viz., to withdraw me from the brightness of
this true light? And his also is this heavenly and more than human utterance on the end of
prayer: That is not, said he, a perfect prayer, wherein a monk understands himself and the
words which he prays. And if we too, as far as our slender ability allows, may venture to add
anything to this splendid utterance, we will bring forward the marks of prayer which are
heard from the Lord, as far as we have tried them.</p>

<head>Of the proof of prayer being heard.</head>
<p>When, while we are praying, no hesitation intervenes and breaks down the confidence
of our petition by a sort of despair, but we feel that by pouring forth our prayer we have
obtained what we are asking for, we have no doubt that our prayers have effectually reached
God. For so far will one be heard and obtain an answer, as he believes that he is regarded
by God, and that God can grant it. For this saying of our Lord cannot be retracted: “Whatsoever
ye ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come to you.”547</p>

<head>An objection that the confidence of being thus heard as described belongs only to saints.</head>
<p>Germanus: We certainly believe that this confidence of being heard flows from purity
of conscience, but for us, whose heart is still smitten by the pricks of sins, how can we have
it, as we have no merits to plead for us, whereby we might confidently presume that our
prayers would be heard?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34"> 
<pb n="1016"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
<head>Answer on the different reasons for prayer being heard.</head>
<p>Isaac: That there are different reasons for prayer being heard in accordance with the
varied and changing condition of souls the words of the gospels and of the prophets teach
us. For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord’s words in the case of the
agreement of two persons; as it is said: “If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything
for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.”548 You
have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. “For,”
He says, “if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be
thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.”549 You
have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord’s words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance
in petitioning, importunity: “For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his
friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.”550
You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: “Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall
pray for thee in the time of tribulation.”551 You have it in the purifying of life and in works
of mercy, as it is said: “Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;” and
after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, “then,” he says,
“thou shalt call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.”552
Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: “When I was in trouble
I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;”553 and again: “Afflict not the stranger for if he
crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.”554 You see then in how many ways the
gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his
conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating
our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned
above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which
is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes,
surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing
to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give.
And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the

<pb n="1017"/>
least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked
according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and
eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not
despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously
promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, “Ask and ye
shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one
that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened;”555 and again: “All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive,
and nothing shall be impossible to you.”556 And therefore even if all the grounds for being
heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity
may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the
difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will
not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought
from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though
he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of
his petition after one and twenty days.557 Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the
earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for
fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God’s providence delayed, or the angel, who
was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the
Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit
and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the
petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet
unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers
until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence
of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we
prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord’s promise where He says: “All
things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.”558 For it is well for us
to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question
is clearly solved: “This is,” he says, “the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever
we ask according to His will, He heareth us.”559 He bids us then have a full and undoubting
confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for
temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord’s will. And we are also taught to put

<pb n="1018"/>
this into our prayers by the Lord’s Prayer, where we say “Thy will be done,”—Thine not
ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that “we know not what to pray
for as we ought”560 we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation
and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for
us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the
teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his
good allowed by the Lord’s will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: “For which I besought
the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.”561 And this feeling even our
Lord expressed when He prayed in the character562 of man which He had taken, that He
might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: “Father, if
it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,”563
though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father’s will, “For He had come to
save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;”564 as He Himself says: “No man
taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have
power to take it again.”565 In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following
sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father:
“To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.”566 For even if we read of the Father: “For God
so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,”567 we find none the less of the Son:
“Who gave Himself for our sins.”568 And as it is said of the One: “Who spared not His own
Son, but gave Him for all of us,”569 so it is written of the other: “He was offered because He
Himself willed it.”570 And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things
one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord’s resurrection we are taught that there
was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought

about the resurrection of His body, saying: “And God the Father, who raised Him from the
dead,”571 so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body,
saying: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”572 And therefore we
being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to
end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our
petitions: “Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.”573 But it is clear enough that one

<p>Of prayer to be offered within the chamber and with the door shut.</p>
<p>Before all things however we ought most carefully to observe the Evangelic precept,
which tells us to enter into our chamber and shut the door and pray to our Father, which
may be fulfilled by us as follows: We pray within our chamber, when removing our hearts
inwardly from the din of all thoughts and anxieties, we disclose our prayers in secret and
in closest intercourse to the Lord. We pray with closed doors when with closed lips and
complete silence we pray to the searcher not of words but of hearts. We pray in secret when
from the heart and fervent mind we disclose our petitions to God alone, so that no hostile
powers are even able to discover the character of our petition. Wherefore we should pray
in complete silence, not only to avoid distracting the brethren standing near by our whispers
or louder utterances, and disturbing the thoughts of those who are praying, but also that
the purport of our petition may be concealed from our enemies who are especially on the
watch against us while we are praying. For so we shall fulfil this injunction: “Keep the doors

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
<head>Of the value of short and silent prayer.</head>
<p>Wherefore we ought to pray often but briefly, lest if we are long about it our crafty foe
may succeed in implanting something in our heart. For that is the true sacrifice, as “the
sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.” This is the salutary offering, these are pure drink offerings,
that is the “sacrifice of righteousness,” the “sacrifice of praise,” these are true and fat victims,
“holocausts full of marrow,” which are offered by contrite and humble hearts, and which
those who practise this control and fervour of spirit, of which we have spoken, with effectual
power can sing: “Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense: let the lifting up of
my hands be an evening sacrifice.”577 But the approach of the right hour and of night warns
us that we ought with fitting devotion to do this very thing, of which, as our slender ability
allowed, we seem to have propounded a great deal, and to have prolonged our conference
considerably, though we believe that we have discoursed very little when the magnificence
and difficulty of the subject are taken into account.</p>
<p>With these words of the holy Isaac we were dazzled rather than satisfied, and after
evening service had been held, rested our limbs for a short time, and intending at the first
dawn again to return under promise of a fuller discussion departed, rejoicing over the acquisition
of these precepts as well as over the assurance of his promises. Since we felt that
though the excellence of prayer had been shown to us, still we had not yet understood from
his discourse its nature, and the power by which continuance in it might be gained and kept.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>Among the sublime customs of the anchorites which by God’s help have been set forth
although in plain and unadorned style, the course of our narration compels us to insert and
find a place for something, which may seem so to speak to cause a blemish on a fair body:
although I have no doubt that by it no small instruction on the image of Almighty God of
which we read in Genesis will be conferred on some of the simpler sort, especially when the
grounds are considered of a doctrine so important that men cannot be ignorant of it without
terrible blasphemy and serious harm to the Catholic faith.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the custom which is kept up in the Province of Egypt for signifying the time of Easter.</head>
<p>In the country of Egypt this custom is by ancient tradition observed that—when Epiphany
is past, which the priests of that province regard as the time, both of our Lord’s baptism and
also of His birth in the flesh, and so celebrate the commemoration of either mystery not
separately as in the Western provinces but on the single festival of this day,578—letters are
sent from the Bishop of Alexandria through all the Churches of Egypt, by which the beginning
of Lent, and the day of Easter are pointed out not only in all the cities but also in all the
monasteries.579 In accordance then with this custom, a very few days after the previous
conference had been held with Abbot Isaac, there arrived the festal letters of Theophilus580
<note type="footnote">578 The observance of Epiphany can be traced back in the Christian Church to the second century, and, as
Cassian tells us here, in the East (in which its observance apparently originated) it was in the first instance a
double festival commemorating both the Nativity and the Baptism of our Lord. From the East its observance
passed over to the West, where however the Nativity was already observed as a separate festival, and hence the
special reference of Epiphany was somewhat altered, and the manifestation to the Magi was coupled with that
at the Baptism: hence the plural Epiphaniorum dies. Meanwhile, as the West adopted the observance of this
festival from the East, so the East followed the West in observing a separate feast of the Nativity. Cassian’s words
show us that when he wrote the two festivals were both observed separately in the West, though apparently not
yet (to the best of his belief) in the East, but the language of a homily by S. Chrysostom (Vol. ii. p. 354 Ed.
Montfaucon) delivered in a.d. 386 shows that the separation of the two festivals had already begun at Antioch,
and all the evidence goes to show that “the Western plan was being gradually adopted in the period which we
may roughly define as the last quarter of the 4th and the first quarter of the 5th century.” Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities, Vol. i. p. 361. See further Origines du Culte Chrétien, par L’Abbé Duchesne, p. 247 sq.</note>
<note type="footnote">579 The “Festal letters” (ἑοταστικαὶ ἐπιστολαί, Euseb. VII. xx., xxi.) were delivered by the Bishop of Alexandria
as Homilies, and then put into the form of an Epistle and sent round to all the churches of Egypt; and, according
to some late writers, to the Bishops of all the principal sees, in accordance with a decision of the Council of
Nicæa, in order to inform them of the right day on which Easter should be celebrated. Cassian here speaks of
them as sent immediately after Epiphany, and this was certainly the time at which the announcement of the
date of Easter was made in the West shortly after his day (so the Council of Orleans, Canon i., a.d. 541); that of
Braga a.d. 572, Canon ix., and that of Auxerre a.d. 572, Canon ii.), but there is ample evidence in the Festal letters
both of S. Athanasius and of S. Cyril that at Alexandria the homilies were preached on the previous Easter, and
it is difficult to resist the inference that Cassian’s memory is here at fault as to the exact time at which the incident
related really occurred, and that he is transferring to Egypt the custom with which he was familiar in the West,
assigning to the festival of Epiphany what really must have taken place at Easter.</note>
<note type="footnote">580 Theophilus succeeded Timothy as Bishop of Alexandria in the summer of 385. The festal letters of which
Cassian here speaks were issued by him in the year 399.</note>

<pb n="1025"/>
the Bishop of the aforesaid city, in which together with the announcement of Easter he
considered as well the foolish heresy of the Anthropomorphites581 at great length, and
abundantly refuted it. And this was received by almost all the body of monks residing in
the whole province of Egypt with such bitterness owing to their simplicity and error, that
the greater part of the Elders decreed that on the contrary the aforesaid Bishop ought to be
abhorred by the whole body of the brethren as tainted with heresy of the worst kind, because
he seemed to impugn the teaching of holy Scripture by the denial that Almighty God was
formed in the fashion of a human figure, though Scripture teaches with perfect clearness
that Adam was created in His image. Lastly this letter was rejected also by those who were
living in the desert of Scete and who excelled all who were in the monasteries of Egypt, in
perfection and in knowledge, so that except Abbot Paphnutius the presbyter of our congregation,
not one of the other presbyters, who presided over the other three churches in the
same desert, would suffer it to be even read or repeated at all in their meetings.</p>
<note type="footnote">581 The Anthropomorphite heresy, into which the monks of Egypt had fallen, “supposed that God possesses
eyes, a face, and hands and other members of a bodily organization.” It arose from taking too literally those
passages of the Old Testament in which God is spoken of in human terms, out of condescension to man’s limited
powers of grasping the Divine nature and appears historically to have been a recoil from the allegorism of Origen
and others of the Alexandrian school. The Festal letter of Theophilus in which he condemned these views, and
maintained the incorporeal nature of God is no longer extant, but is alluded to also by Sozomen, H. E. VIII. xi.,
where an account is given of the Origenistic controversy of which it was the occasion, and out of which Theophilus
came so badly. On the heresy see also Epiphanius, Hær. lxx.; Augustine. Hær. l. and lxxvi.; and Theodoret, H.
E. IV. x.</note>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of Abbot Sarapion and the heresy of the Anthropomorphites into which he fell in the error of
simplicity.</head>
<p>Among those then who were caught by this mistaken notion was one named Sarapion,
a man of long-standing strictness of life, and one who was altogether perfect in actual discipline,
whose ignorance with regard to the view of the doctrine first mentioned was so far
a stumbling block to all who held the true faith, as he himself outstripped almost all the
monks both in the merits of his life and in the length of time (he had been there). And when
this man could not be brought back to the way of the right faith by many exhortations of
the holy presbyter Paphnutius, because this view seemed to him a novelty, and one that was
not ever known to or handed down by his predecessors, it chanced that a certain deacon, a
man of very great learning, named Photinus, arrived from the region of Cappadocia with
the desire of visiting the brethren living in the same desert: whom the blessed Paphnutius
received with the warmest welcome, and in order to confirm the faith which had been stated
in the letters of the aforesaid Bishop, placed him in the midst and asked him before all the
brethren how the Catholic Churches throughout the East interpreted the passage in Genesis
where it says “Let us make man after our image and likeness.”582 And when he explained
that the image and likeness of God was taken by all the leaders of the churches not according
to the base sound of the letters, but spiritually, and supported this very fully and by many
passages of Scripture, and showed that nothing of this sort could happen to that infinite
and incomprehensible and invisible glory, so that it could be comprised in a human form
and likeness, since its nature is incorporeal and uncompounded and simple, and what can
neither be apprehended by the eyes nor conceived by the mind, at length the old man was
shaken by the numerous and very weighty assertions of this most learned man, and was
drawn to the faith of the Catholic tradition. And when both Abbot Paphnutius and all of
us were filled with intense delight at his adhesion, for this reason; viz., that the Lord had
not permitted a man of such age and crowned with such virtues, and one who erred only
from ignorance and rustic simplicity, to wander from the path of the right faith up to the
very last, and when we arose to give thanks, and were all together offering up our prayers
to the Lord, the old man was so bewildered in mind during his prayer because he felt that
the Anthropomorphic image of the Godhead which he used to set before himself in prayer,
was banished from his heart, that on a sudden he burst into a flood of bitter tears and continual
sobs, and cast himself down on the ground and exclaimed with strong groanings:
“Alas! wretched man that I am! they have taken away my God from me, and I have now
none to lay hold of; and whom to worship and address I know not.” By which scene we were
<note type="footnote">582 Gen. i. 26.</note>

<pb n="1027"/>
terribly disturbed, and moreover with the effect of the former Conference still remaining
in our hearts, we returned to Abbot Isaac, whom when we saw close at hand, we addressed
with these words.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1028"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of our return to Abbot Isaac and question concerning the error into which the aforesaid old
man had fallen.</head>
<p>Although even besides the fresh matter which has lately arisen, our delight in the former
conference which was held on the character of prayer would summon us to postpone
everything else and return to your holiness, yet this grievous error of Abbot Sarapion, conceived,
as we fancy, by the craft of most vile demons, adds somewhat to this desire of ours.
For it is no small despair by which we are cast down when we consider that through the
fault of this ignorance he has not only utterly lost all those labours which he has performed
in so praiseworthy a manner for fifty years in this desert, but has also incurred the risk of
eternal death. And so we want first to know why and wherefore so grievous an error has
crept into him. And next we should like to be taught how we can arrive at that condition in
prayer, of which you discoursed some time back not only fully but splendidly. For that ad-
mirable Conference has had this effect upon us, that it has only dazzled our minds and has
not shown us how to perform or secure it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="1029"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>The answer on the heresy described above.</head>
<p>Isaac: We need not be surprised that a really simple man who had never received any
instruction on the substance and nature of the Godhead could still be entangled and deceived
by an error of simplicity and the habit of a longstanding mistake, and (to speak more truly)
continue in the original error which is brought about, not as you suppose by a new illusion
of the demons, but by the ignorance of the ancient heathen world, while in accordance with
the custom of that erroneous notion, by which they used to worship devils formed in the
figure of men, they even now think that the incomprehensible and ineffable glory of the
true Deity should be worshipped under the limitations of some figure, as they believe that
they can grasp and hold nothing if they have not some image set before them, which they
can continually address while they are at their devotions, and which they can carry about
in their mind and have always fixed before their eyes. And against this mistake of theirs this
text may be used: “And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness
of the image of corruptible man.”583 Jeremiah also says: “My people have changed their
glory for an idol.584 Which error although by this its origin, of which we have spoken, it is
engrained in the notions of some, yet none the less is it contracted in the hearts also of those
who have never been stained with the superstition of the heathen world, under the colour
of this passage where it is said “Let us make man after our image and our likeness,”585 ignorance
and simplicity being its authors, so that actually there has arisen owing to this hateful
interpretation a heresy called that of the Anthropomorphites, which maintains with obstinate
perverseness that the infinite and simple substance of the Godhead is fashioned in our lineaments
and human configuration. Which however any one who has been taught the
Catholic doctrine will abhor as heathenish blasphemy, and so will arrive at that perfectly
pure condition in prayer which will not only not connect with its prayers any figure of the
Godhead or bodily lineaments (which it is a sin even to speak of), but will not even allow
in itself even the memory of a name, or the appearance of an action, or an outline of any
character.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the reasons why Jesus Christ appears to each one of us either in His humility or in His
glorified condition.</head>
<p>For according to the measure of its purity, as I said in the former Conference, each mind
is both raised and moulded in its prayers if it forsakes the consideration of earthly and material
things so far as the condition of its purity may carry it forward, and enable it with the
inner eyes of the soul to see Jesus either still in His humility and in the flesh, or glorified
and coming in the glory of His Majesty: for those cannot see Jesus coming in His Kingdom
who are still kept back in a sort of state of Jewish weakness, and cannot say with the Apostle:
“And if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know Him so no more;”586 but
only those can look with purest eyes on His Godhead, who rise with Him from low and
earthly works and thoughts and go apart in the lofty mountain of solitude which is free from
the disturbance of all earthly thoughts and troubles, and secure from the interference of all
sins, and being exalted by pure faith and the heights of virtue reveals the glory of His Face
and the image of His splendour to those who are able to look on Him with pure eyes of the
soul. But Jesus is seen as well by those who live in towns and villages and hamlets, i.e., who
are occupied in practical affairs and works, but not with the same brightness with which He
appeared to those who can go up with Him into the aforesaid mount of virtues, i.e., Peter,
James, and John. For so in solitude He appeared to Moses and spoke with Elias. And as our
Lord wished to establish this and to leave us examples of perfect purity, although He Himself,
the very fount of inviolable sanctity, had no need of external help and the assistance of
solitude in order to secure it (for the fulness of purity could not be soiled by any stain from
crowds, nor could He be contaminated by intercourse with men, who cleanses and sanctifies
all things that are polluted) yet still He retired into the mountain alone to pray, thus teaching
us by the example of His retirement that if we too wish to approach God with a pure and
spotless affection of heart, we should also retire from all the disturbance and confusion of
crowds, so that while still living in the body we may manage in some degree to adapt ourselves
to some likeness of that bliss which is promised hereafter to the saints, and that “God may
be” to us “all in all.”587</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>What constitutes our end and perfect bliss.</head>
<p>For then will be perfectly fulfilled in our case that prayer of our Saviour in which He
prayed for His disciples to the Father saying “that the love wherewith Thou lovedst Me may
be in them and they in us;” and again: “that they all may be one as Thou, Father, in Me and
I in Thee, that they also may be one in us,”588 when that perfect love of God, wherewith
“He first loved us”589 has passed into the feelings of our heart as well, by the fulfilment of
this prayer of the Lord which we believe cannot possibly be ineffectual. And this will come
to pass when God shall be all our love, and every desire and wish and effort, every thought
of ours, and all our life and words and breath, and that unity which already exists between
the Father and the Son, and the Son and the Father, has been shed abroad in our hearts and
minds, so that as He loves us with a pure and unfeigned and indissoluble love, so we also
may be joined to Him by a lasting and inseparable affection, since we are so united to Him
that whatever we breathe or think, or speak is God, since, as I say, we attain to that end of
which we spoke before, which the same Lord in His prayer hopes may be fulfilled in us:
“that they all may be one as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me, that they also may be
made perfect in one;” and again: “Father, those whom Thou hast given Me, I will that where
I am, they may also be with Me.”590 This then ought to be the destination of the solitary,
this should be all his aim that it may be vouchsafed to him to possess even in the body an
image of future bliss, and that he may begin in this world to have a foretaste of a sort of
earnest of that celestial life and glory. This, I say, is the end of all perfection, that the mind
purged from all carnal desires may daily be lifted towards spiritual things, until the whole
life and all the thoughts of the heart become one continuous prayer.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>A question on the training in perfection by which we can arrive at perpetual recollection of
God.</head>
<p>Germanus: The extent of our bewilderment at our wondering awe at the former Conference,
because of which we came back again, increases still more. For in proportion as by
the incitements of this teaching we are fired with the desire of perfect bliss, so do we fall
back into greater despair, as we know not how to seek or obtain training for such lofty
heights. Wherefore we entreat that you will patiently allow us (for it must perhaps be set
forth and unfolded with a good deal of talk) to explain what while sitting in the cell we had
begun to revolve in a lengthy meditation, although we know that your holiness is not at all
troubled by the infirmities of the weak, which even for this reason should be openly set
forth, that what is out of place in them may receive correction. Our notion then is that the
perfection of any art or system of training must begin with some simple rudiments, and
grow accustomed first to somewhat easy and tender beginnings, so that being nourished
and trained little by little by a sort of reasonable milk, it may grow up and so by degrees and
step by step mount up from the lowest depths to the heights: and when by these means it
has entered on the plainer principles and so to speak passed the gates of the entrance of the
profession, it will consequently arrive without difficulty at the inmost shrine and lofty heights
of perfection. For how could any boy manage to pronounce the simplest union of syllables
unless he had first carefully learnt the letters of the alphabet? Or how can any one learn to
read quickly, who is still unfit to connect together short and simple sentences? But by what
means will one who is ill instructed in the science of grammar attain eloquence in rhetoric
or the knowledge of philosophy? Wherefore for this highest learning also, by which we are
taught even to cleave to God, I have no doubt that there are some foundations of the system,
which must first be firmly laid and afterwards the towering heights of perfection may be
placed and raised upon them. And we have a slight idea that these are its first principles;
viz., that we should first learn by what meditations God may be grasped and contemplated,
and next that we should manage to keep a very firm hold of this topic whatever it is which
we do not doubt is the height of all perfection. And therefore we want you to show us some
material for this recollection, by which we may conceive and ever keep the idea of God in
the mind, so that by always keeping it before our eyes, when we find that we have dropped
away from Him, we may at once be able to recover ourselves and return thither and may
succeed in laying hold of it again without any delay from wandering around the subject and
searching for it. For it happens that when we have wandered away from our spiritual spec-

<pb n="1033"/>
ulations and have come back to ourselves as if waking from a deadly sleep, and, being
thoroughly roused, look for the subject matter, by which we may be able to revive that
spiritual recollection which has been destroyed, we are hindered by the delay of the actual
search before we find it, and are once more drawn aside from our endeavour, and before
the spiritual insight is brought about, the purpose of heart which had been conceived, has
disappeared. And this trouble is certain to happen to us for this reason because we do not
keep something special firmly set before our eyes like some principle to which the wandering
thoughts may be recalled after many digressions and varied excursions; and, if I may use
the expression, after long storms enter a quiet haven. And so it comes to pass that as the
mind is constantly hindered by this want of knowledge and difficulty, and is always tossed
about vaguely, and as if intoxicated, among various matters, and cannot even retain firm
hold for any length of time of anything spiritual which has occurred to it by chance rather
than of set purpose: while, as it is always receiving one thing after another, it does not notice
either their beginning and origin or even their end.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="1034"/>
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>The answer on the efficacy of understanding, which is gained by experience.</head>
<p>Isaac: Your minute and subtle inquiry affords an indication of purity being very nearly
reached. For no one would be able even to make inquiries on these matters, I will not say
to look within and discriminate,—except one who had been urged to sound the depths of
such questions by careful and effectual diligence of mind, and watchful anxiety, and one
whom the constant aim after a well controlled life had taught by practical experience to attempt
the entrance to this purity and to knock at its doors. And therefore as I see you, I will
not say, standing before the doors of that true prayer of which we have been speaking, but
touching its inner chambers and inward parts as it were with the hands of experience, and
already laying hold of some parts of it, I do not think that I shall find any difficulty in introducing
you now within what I may call its hall, for you to roam about its recesses, as the
Lord may direct; nor do I think that you will be hindered from investigating what is to be
shown you by any obstacles or difficulties. For he is next door to understanding who carefully
recognizes what he ought to ask about, nor is he far from knowledge, who begins to understand
how ignorant he is. And therefore I am not afraid of the charge of betraying secrets,
and of levity, if I divulge what when speaking in my former discourse on the perfection of
prayer I had kept back from discussing, as I think that its force was to be explained to us
who are occupied with this subject and interest even without the aid of my words, by the
grace of God.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<pb n="1035"/>
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Of the method of continual prayer.</head>
<p>Wherefore in accordance with that system, which you admirably compared to teaching
children (who can only take in the first lessons on the alphabet and recognize the shapes of
the letters, and trace out their characters with a steady hand if they have, by means of some
copies and shapes carefully impressed on wax, got accustomed to express their figures, by
constantly looking at them and imitating them daily), we must give you also the form of
this spiritual contemplation, on which you may always fix your gaze with the utmost
steadiness, and both learn to consider it to your profit in unbroken continuance, and also
manage by the practice of it and by meditation to climb to a still loftier insight. This formula
then shall be proposed to you of this system, which you want, and of prayer, which every
monk in his progress towards continual recollection of God, is accustomed to ponder,
ceaselessly revolving it in his heart, having got rid of all kinds of other thoughts; for he
cannot possibly keep his hold over it unless he has freed himself from all bodily cares and
anxieties. And as this was delivered to us by a few of those who were left of the oldest fathers,
so it is only divulged by us to a very few and to those who are really keen. And so for keeping
up continual recollection of God this pious formula is to be ever set before you. “O God,
make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me,”591 for this verse has not unreasonably
been picked out from the whole of Scripture for this purpose. For it embraces all the
feelings which can be implanted in human nature, and can be fitly and satisfactorily adapted
to every condition, and all assaults. Since it contains an invocation of God against every
danger, it contains humble and pious confession, it contains the watchfulness of anxiety
and continual fear, it contains the thought of one’s own weakness, confidence in the answer,
and the assurance of a present and ever ready help. For one who is constantly calling on his
protector, is certain that He is always at hand. It contains the glow of love and charity, it
contains a view of the plots, and a dread of the enemies, from which one, who sees himself
day and night hemmed in by them, confesses that he cannot be set free without the aid of
his defender. This verse is an impregnable wall for all who are labouring under the attacks
of demons, as well as impenetrable coat of mail and a strong shield. It does not suffer those
who are in a state of moroseness and anxiety of mind, or depressed by sadness or all kinds
of thoughts to despair of saving remedies, as it shows that He, who is invoked, is ever looking
on at our struggles and is not far from His suppliants. It warns us whose lot is spiritual
success and delight of heart that we ought not to be at all elated or puffed up by our happy

condition, which it assures us cannot last without God as our protector, while it implores
Him not only always but even speedily to help us. This verse, I say, will be found helpful
and useful to every one of us in whatever condition we may be. For one who always and in
all matters wants to be helped, shows that he needs the assistance of God not only in sorrowful
or hard matters but also equally in prosperous and happy ones, that he may be delivered
from the one and also made to continue in the other, as he knows that in both of them human
weakness is unable to endure without His assistance. I am affected by the passion of gluttony.
I ask for food of which the desert knows nothing, and in the squalid desert there are wafted
to me odours of royal dainties and I find that even against my will I am drawn to long for
them. I must at once say: “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.”
I am incited to anticipate the hour fixed for supper, or I am trying with great sorrow of heart
to keep to the limits of the right and regular meagre fare. I must cry out with groans: “O
God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” Weakness of the stomach
hinders me when wanting severer fasts, on account of the assaults of the flesh, or dryness
of the belly and constipation frightens me. In order that effect may be given to my wishes,
or else that the fire of carnal lust may be quenched without the remedy of a stricter fast, I
must pray: “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” When I come
to supper, at the bidding of the proper hour I loathe taking food and am prevented from
eating anything to satisfy the requirements of nature: I must cry with a sigh: “O God, make
speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” When I want for the sake of steadfastness
of heart to apply myself to reading a headache interferes and stops me, and at the third hour
sleep glues my head to the sacred page, and I am forced either to overstep or to anticipate
the time assigned to rest; and finally an overpowering desire to sleep forces me to cut short
the canonical rule for service in the Psalms: in the same way I must cry out: “O God, make
speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” Sleep is withdrawn from my eyes, and
for many nights I find myself wearied out with sleeplessness caused by the devil, and all repose
and rest by night is kept away from my eyelids; I must sigh and pray: “O God, make speed
to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” While I am still in the midst of a struggle with
sin suddenly an irritation of the flesh affects me and tries by a pleasant sensation to draw
me to consent while in my sleep. In order that a raging fire from without may not burn up
the fragrant blossoms of chastity, I must cry out: “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord,
make haste to help me.” I feel that the incentive to lust is removed, and that the heat of
passion has died away in my members: In order that this good condition acquired, or rather
that this grace of God may continue still longer or forever with me, I must earnestly say: “O
God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” I am disturbed by the pangs
of anger, covetousness, gloominess, and driven to disturb the peaceful state in which I was,
and which was dear to me: In order that I may not be carried away by raging passion into
the bitterness of gall, I must cry out with deep groans: “O God, make speed to save me: O

<pb n="1037"/>
Lord, make haste to help me.” I am tried by being puffed up by accidie, vainglory, and pride,
and my mind with subtle thoughts flatters itself somewhat on account of the coldness and
carelessness of others: In order that this dangerous suggestion of the enemy may not get the
mastery over me, I must pray with all contrition of heart: “O God, make speed to save me:
O Lord, make haste to help me.” I have gained the grace of humility and simplicity, and by
continually mortifying my spirit have got rid of the swellings of pride: In order that the “foot
of pride” may not again “come against me,” and “the hand of the sinner disturb me,”592 and
that I may not be more seriously damaged by elation at my success, I must cry with all my
might, “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” I am on fire with
innumerable and various wanderings of soul and shiftiness of heart, and cannot collect my
scattered thoughts, nor can I even pour forth my prayer without interruption and images
of vain figures, and the recollection of conversations and actions, and I feel myself tied down
by such dryness and barrenness that I feel I cannot give birth to any offspring in the shape
of spiritual ideas: In order that it may be vouchsafed to me to be set free from this wretched
state of mind, from which I cannot extricate myself by any number of sighs and groans, I
must full surely cry out: “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.”
Again, I feel that by the visitation of the Holy Spirit I have gained purpose of soul, steadfastness
of thought, keenness of heart, together with an ineffable joy and transport of mind,
and in the exuberance of spiritual feelings I have perceived by a sudden illumination from
the Lord an abounding revelation of most holy ideas which were formerly altogether hidden
from me: In order that it may be vouchsafed to me to linger for a longer time in them I must
often and anxiously exclaim: “O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help
me.” Encompassed by nightly horrors of devils I am agitated, and am disturbed by the appearances
of unclean spirits, my very hope of life and salvation is withdrawn by the horror
of fear. Flying to the safe refuge of this verse, I will cry out with all my might: “O God, make
speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” Again, when I have been restored by the
Lord’s consolation, and, cheered by His coming, feel myself encompassed as if by countless
thousands of angels, so that all of a sudden I can venture to seek the conflict and provoke a
battle with those whom a while ago I dreaded worse than death, and whose touch or even
approach I felt with a shudder both of mind and body: In order that the vigour of this
courage may, by God’s grace, continue in me still longer, I must cry out with all my powers:
“O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.” We must then ceaselessly
and continuously pour forth the prayer of this verse, in adversity that we may be delivered,
in prosperity that we may be preserved and not puffed up. Let the thought of this verse, I
tell you, be conned over in your breast without ceasing. Whatever work you are doing, or
office you are holding, or journey you are going, do not cease to chant this. When you are
<note type="footnote">592 Ps. xxxv. (xxxvi.) 12.</note>

<pb n="1038"/>
going to bed, or eating, and in the last necessities of nature, think on this. This thought in
your heart maybe to you a saving formula, and not only keep you unharmed by all attacks
of devils, but also purify you from all faults and earthly stains, and lead you to that invisible
and celestial contemplation, and carry you on to that ineffable glow of prayer, of which so
few have any experience. Let sleep come upon you still considering this verse, till having
been moulded by the constant use of it, you grow accustomed to repeat it even in your sleep.
When you wake let it be the first thing to come into your mind, let it anticipate all your
waking thoughts, let it when you rise from your bed send you down on your knees, and
thence send you forth to all your work and business, and let it follow you about all day long.
This you should think about, according to the Lawgiver’s charge, “at home and walking
forth on a journey,”593 sleeping and waking. This you should write on the threshold and
door of your mouth, this you should place on the walls of your house and in the recesses of
your heart so that when you fall on your knees in prayer this may be your chant as you kneel,
and when you rise up from it to go forth to all the necessary business of life it may be your
constant prayer as you stand.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the perfection of prayer to which we can rise by the system described.</head>
<p>This, this is the formula which the mind should unceasingly cling to until, strengthened
by the constant use of it and by continual meditation, it casts off and rejects the rich and
full material of all manner of thoughts and restricts itself to the poverty of this one verse,
and so arrives with ready ease at that beatitude of the gospel, which holds the first place
among the other beatitudes: for He says “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.”594 And so one who becomes grandly poor by a poverty of this sort
will fulfil this saying of the prophet: “The poor and needy shall praise the name of the
Lord.”595 And indeed what greater or holier poverty can there be than that of one who
knowing that he has no defence and no strength of his own, asks for daily help from another’s
bounty, and as he is aware that every single moment his life and substance depend on Divine
assistance, professes himself not without reason the Lord’s bedesman, and cries to Him daily
in prayer: “But I am poor and needy: the Lord helpeth me.”596 And so by the illumination
of God Himself he mounts to that manifold knowledge of Him and begins henceforward
to be nourished on sublimer and still more sacred mysteries, in accordance with these words
of the prophet: “The high hills are a refuge for the stags, the rocks for the hedgehogs,”597
which is very fairly applied in the sense we have given, because whosoever continues in
simplicity and innocence is not injurious or offensive to any one, but being content with
his own simple condition endeavours simply to defend himself from being spoiled by his
foes, and becomes a sort of spiritual hedgehog and is protected by the continual shield of
that rock of the gospel, i.e., being sheltered by the recollection of the Lord’s passion and by
ceaseless meditation on the verse given above he escapes the snares of his opposing enemies.
And of these spiritual hedgehogs we read in Proverbs as follows: “And the hedgehogs are a
feeble folk, who have made their homes in the rocks.”598 And indeed what is feebler than
a Christian, what is weaker than a monk, who is not only not permitted any vengeance for
wrongs done to him but is actually not allowed to suffer even a slight and silent feeling of
irritation to spring up within? But whoever advances from this condition and not only secures
the simplicity of innocence, but is also shielded by the virtue of discretion, becomes an exterminator
of deadly serpents, and has Satan crushed beneath his feet, and by his quickness
of mind answers to the figure of the reasonable stag, this man will feed on the mountains

of the prophets and Apostles, i.e., on their highest and loftiest mysteries. And thriving on
this pasture continually, he will take in to himself all the thoughts of the Psalms and will
begin to sing them in such a way that he will utter them with the deepest emotion of heart
not as if they were the compositions of the Psalmist, but rather as if they were his own utterances
and his very own prayer; and will certainly take them as aimed at himself, and will
recognize that their words were not only fulfilled formerly by or in the person of the
prophet, but that they are fulfilled and carried out daily in his own case. For then the Holy
Scriptures lie open to us with greater clearness and as it were their very veins and marrow
are exposed, when our experience not only perceives but actually anticipates their meaning,
and the sense of the words is revealed to us not by an exposition of them but by practical
proof. For if we have experience of the very state of mind in which each Psalm was sung
and written, we become like their authors and anticipate the meaning rather than follow it,
i.e., gathering the force of the words before we really know them, we remember what has
happened to us, and what is happening in daily assaults when the thoughts of them come
over us, and while we sing them we call to mind all that our carelessness has brought upon
us, or our earnestness has secured, or Divine Providence has granted or the promptings of
the foe have deprived us of, or slippery and subtle forgetfulness has carried off, or human
weakness has brought about, or thoughtless ignorance has cheated us of. For all these feelings
we find expressed in the Psalms so that by seeing whatever happens as in a very clear mirror
we understand it better, and so instructed by our feelings as our teachers we lay hold of it
as something not merely heard but actually seen, and, as if it were not committed to memory,
but implanted in the very nature of things, we are affected from the very bottom of the heart,
so that we get at its meaning not by reading the text but by experience anticipating it. And
so our mind will reach that incorruptible prayer to which in our former treatise, as the Lord
vouchsafed to grant, the scheme of our Conference mounted, and this is not merely not
engaged in gazing on any image, but is actually distinguished by the use of no words or utterances;
but with the purpose of the mind all on fire, is produced through ecstasy of heart
by some unaccountable keenness of spirit, and the mind being thus affected without the aid
of the senses or any visible material pours it forth to God with groanings and sighs that
cannot be uttered.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>A question as to how spiritual thoughts can be retained without losing them.</head>
<p>Germanus: We think that you have described to us not only the system of this spiritual
discipline for which we asked, but perfection itself; and this with great clearness and openness.
For what can be more perfect and sublime than for the recollection of God to be embraced
in so brief a meditation, and for it, dwelling on a single verse, to escape from all the limitations
of things visible, and to comprise in one short word the thoughts of all our prayers. And
therefore we beg you to explain to us one thing which still remains; viz., how we can keep
firm hold of this verse which you have given us as a formula, in such a way that, as we have
been by God’s grace set free from the trifles of worldly thoughts, so we may also keep a
steady grasp on all spiritual ones.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="1042"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>On the lightness of thoughts.</head>
<p>For when the mind has taken in the meaning of a passage in any Psalm, this insensibly
slips away from it, and ignorantly and thoughtlessly it passes on to a text of some other
Scripture. And when it has begun to consider this with itself, while it is still not thoroughly
explored, the recollection of some other passage springs up, and shuts out the consideration
of the former subject. From this too it is transferred to some other, by the entrance of some
fresh consideration, and the soul always turns about from Psalm to Psalm and jumps from
a passage in the Gospels to read one in the Epistles, and from this passes on to the prophetic
writings, and thence is carried to some spiritual history, and so it wanders about vaguely
and uncertainly through the whole body of the Scriptures, unable, as it may choose, either
to reject or keep hold of anything, or to finish anything by fully considering and examining
it, and so becomes only a toucher or taster of spiritual meanings, not an author and possessor
of them. And so the mind, as it is always light and wandering, is distracted even in time of
service by all sorts of things, as if it were intoxicated, and does not perform any office
properly. For instance, while it is praying, it is recalling some Psalm or passage of Scripture.
While it is chanting, it is thinking about something else besides what the text of the Psalm
itself contains. When it repeats a passage of Scripture, it is thinking about something that
has to be done, or remembering something that has been done. And in this way it takes in
and rejects nothing in a disciplined and proper way, and seems to be driven about by random
incursions, without the power either of retaining what it likes or lingering over it. It is then
well for us before everything else to know how we can properly perform these spiritual offices,
and keep firm hold of this particular verse which you have given us as a formula, so that the
rise and fall of our feelings may not be in a state of fluctuation from their own lightness, but
may lie under our own control.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="1043"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>The answer how we can gain stability of heart or of thoughts.</head>
<p>Isaac: Although, in our former discussion on the character of prayer, enough was, as I
think, said on this subject, yet as you want it repeated to you again, I will give you a brief
instruction on steadfastness of heart. There are three things which make a shifting heart
steadfast, watchings, meditation, and prayer, diligence in which and constant attention will
produce steadfast firmness of mind. But this cannot be secured in any other way unless all
cares and anxieties of this present life have been first got rid of by indefatigable persistence
in work dedicated not to covetousness but to the sacred uses of the monastery, that we may
thus be able to fulfil the Apostle’s command: “Pray without ceasing.”599 For he prays too
little, who is accustomed only to pray at the times when he bends his knees. But he never
prays, who even while on his bended knees is distracted by all kinds of wanderings of heart.
And therefore what we would be found when at our prayers, that we ought to be before the
time of prayer. For at the time of its prayers the mind cannot help being affected by its previous
condition, and while it is praying, will be either transported to things heavenly, or
dragged down to earthly things by those thoughts in which it had been lingering before
prayer.</p>
<p>Thus far did Abbot Isaac carry on his Second Conference on the character of Prayer to
us astonished hearers; whose instruction on the consideration of that verse quoted above
(which he gave as a sort of outline for beginners to hold) we greatly admired, and wished
to follow very closely, as we fancied that it would be a short and easy method; but we have
found it even harder to observe than that system of ours by which we used formerly to
wander here and there in varied meditations through the whole body of the Scriptures
without being tied by any chains of perseverance. It is then certain that no one is kept away
from perfection of heart by not being able to read, nor is rustic simplicity any hindrance to
the possession of purity of heart and mind, which lies close at hand for all, if only they will
by constant meditation on this verse keep the thoughts of the mind safe and sound towards
God.</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="Preface">
<pb n="1045"/>
<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>Although many of the saints who are taught by your example can scarcely emulate the
greatness of your perfection, with which you shine like great luminaries with marvellous
brightness in this world, yet still you, O holy brothers Honoratus and Eucherius,1 are so
stirred by the great glory of those splendid men from whom we received the first principles
of monasticism, that one of you, presiding as he does over a large monastery of the brethren,
is hoping that his congregation, which learns a lesson from the daily sight of your saintly
life, may be instructed in the precepts of those fathers, while the other has been anxious to
make his way to Egypt to be edified by the sight of these in the flesh, that he might leave this
province that is frozen as it were with the cold of Gaul, and like some pure turtle dove fly
to those lands on which the sun of righteousness looks and to which it approaches nearest,
and which abound with the ripe fruits of virtues. As a matter of course the greatness of my
love wrings this from me; viz., that considering the desire of the one and the labour of the
other, I should not decline the danger and peril of writing, if only to the one there may be
added authority among his children, and from the other may be removed the necessity for
so risky a journey. Further since neither the Institutes of the Coenobia which we wrote to
the best of our ability in twelve books for Bishop Castor of blessed memory, nor the ten
Conferences of the fathers living in the desert of Scete, which we composed somehow or
other at the bidding of Saints Helladius and Leontius the Bishops,2 were able to satisfy your
faith and zeal, now in order that the reason for our journey may be also known, I have
thought that seven Conferences of the three fathers whom we first saw living in another
desert, might be written in the same style and dedicated to you, in which whatever has been
in our previous works perhaps obscurely explained or even omitted on the subject of perfection,
may be supplied. But if even this is not enough to satisfy the holy thirst of your desires,
seven other Conferences, which are to be sent to the holy brethren living in the islands of
the Stoechades,3 will, I fancy, satisfy your wants and your ardour.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Description of the town of Thennesus.</head>
<p>When we were living in a monastery in Syria after our first infancy in the faith, and
when after we had grown somewhat we had begun to long for some greater grace of perfection,
we determined straightway to seek Egypt and penetrating even to the remotest desert
of the Thebaid,4 to visit very many of the saints, whose glory and fame had spread abroad
everywhere, with the wish if not to emulate them at any rate to know them. And so we came
by a very lengthy voyage to a town of Egypt named Thennesus,5 whose inhabitants are so
surrounded either by the sea or by salt lakes that they devote themselves to business alone
and get their wealth and substance by naval commerce as the land fails them, so that indeed
when they want to build houses, there is no soil sufficient for this, unless it is brought by
boat from a distance.</p>
<note type="footnote">4 It is very doubtful whether Cassian ever carried out the intention, of which he here speaks, of visiting the
Thebaid. So far as we can trace the course of his wanderings, he does not seem to have penetrated farther into
Egypt than the desert of Scete.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1048"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of Bishop Archebius.</head>
<p>And when we arrived there, God gratified our wishes, and had brought about the arrival
of that most blessed and excellent man Bishop Archebius,6 who had been carried off from
the assembly of anchorites and given as Bishop to the town of Panephysis,7 and who kept
all his life long to his purpose of solitude with such strictness that he relaxed nothing of the
character of his former humility, nor flattered himself on the honour that had been added
to him (for he vowed that he had not been summoned to that office as fit for it, but complained
that he had been expelled from the monastic system as unworthy of it because
though he had spent thirty-seven years in it he had never been able to arrive at the purity
so high a profession demands); he then when he had received us kindly and most graciously
in the aforesaid Thennesus whither the business of electing a Bishop there had brought him,
as soon as he heard of our wish and desire to inquire of the holy fathers even in still more
remote parts of Egypt: “Come,” said he, “see in the meanwhile the old men who live not far
from our monastery, the length of whose service is shown by their bent bodies, as their
holiness shines forth in their appearance, so that even the mere sight of them will give a
great lesson to those who see them: and from them you can learn not so much by their words
as by the actual example of their holy life, what I grieve that I have lost, and having lost
cannot give to you. But I think that my poverty will be somewhat lessened by this zeal of
mine, if when you are seeking that pearl of the Gospel which I have not, I at least provide
where you can conveniently procure it.”</p>
<note type="footnote">6 Archebius has already been mentioned in Conference VII. xxvi; and in the Institutes V. xxxvii., xxxviii.,
two stories are told illustrative of his kindness and goodness of disposition; but he is not known to us from any
other source except Cassian’s writings.</note>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Description of the desert where Chæremon, Nesteros, and Joseph lived.</head>
<p>And so he took his staff and scrip, as is there the custom for all monks starting on a
journey, and himself led us as guide of our road to his own city, i.e., Panephysis, the lands
of which and indeed the greater part of the neighbouring region (formerly an extremely
rich one since from it, as report says, everything was supplied for the royal table), had been
covered by the sea which was disturbed by a sudden earthquake and overflowed its banks,
and so (almost all the villages being in ruins) covered what were formerly rich lands with
salt marshes, so that you might think that what is spiritually sung in the psalm was a literal
prophecy of that region. “He hath turned rivers into a wilderness; and the springs of waters
into a thirsty land: a fruitful land into saltness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.”8
In these districts then many towns perched in this way on the higher hills were deserted by
their inhabitants and turned by the inundation into islands, and these afforded the desired
solitude to the holy anchorites, among whom three old men; viz., Chæremon, Nesteros and
Joseph, stood out as anchorites of the longest standing.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of Abbot Chæremon and his excuse about the teaching which we asked for.</head>
<p>And so the blessed Archebius thought it best to take us first to Chæremon,9 because he
was nearer to his monastery, and because he was more advanced than the other two in age:
for he had passed the hundredth year of his life, vigorous only in spirit, but with his back
bowed with age and constant prayer, so that, as if he were once more in his childhood he
crawled with his hands hanging down and resting on the ground. Gazing then at one and
the same time on this man’s wonderful face and on his walk (for though all his limbs had
already failed and were dead yet he had lost none of the severity of his previous strictness)
when we humbly asked for the word and doctrine, and declared that longing for spiritual
instruction was the only reason for our coming, he sighed deeply and said: What doctrine
can I teach you, I in whom the feebleness of age has relaxed my former strictness, as it has
also destroyed my confidence in speaking? For how could I presume to teach what I do not
do, or instruct another in what I know I now practise but feebly and coldly? Wherefore I
do not allow any of the younger men to live with me now that I am of such an advanced
age, lest the other’s strictness should be relaxed owing to my example. For the authority of
a teacher will never be strong unless he fixes it in the heart of his hearer by the actual performance
of his duty.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of our answer to his excuse.</head>
<p>At this we were overwhelmed with no slight confusion and replied as follows: Although
both the difficulty of the place and the solitary life itself, which even a robust youth could
scarcely put up with, ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and indeed without your
saying anything they do teach and impress us a very great deal) yet still we ask you to lay
aside your silence for a little and in a more worthy manner implant in us those principles
by which we may be able to embrace, not so much by imitating it as by admiring it, that
goodness which we see in you. For even if our coldness is known to you, and does not deserve
to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be
repaid by it, as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the monastery of
Bethlehem, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="1052"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Abbot Chæremon’s statement that faults can be overcome in three ways.</head>
<p>Then the blessed Chæremon: There are, said he, three things which enable men to
control their faults; viz., either the fear of hell or of laws even now imposed; or the hope and
desire of the kingdom of heaven; or a liking for goodness itself and the love of virtue. For
then we read that the fear of evil loathes contamination: “The fear of the Lord hateth evil.”10
Hope also shuts out the assaults of all faults: for “all who hope in Him shall not fail.”11 Love
also fears no destruction from sins, for “love never faileth;”12 and again: “love covers a
multitude of sins.”13 And therefore the blessed Apostle confines the whole sum of salvation
in the attainment of those three virtues, saying “Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three.”14
For faith is what makes us shun the stains of sin from fear of future judgment and punishment;
hope is what withdraws our mind from present things, and despises all bodily pleasures
from its expectation of heavenly rewards; love is what inflames us with keenness of heart
for the love of Christ and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us hate with a perfect
hatred whatever is opposed to these. And these three things although they all seem to aim
at one and the same end (for they incite us to abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ
from each other greatly in the degrees of their excellence. For the two former belong properly
to those men who in their aim at goodness have not yet acquired the love of virtue, and the
third belongs specially to God and to those who have received into themselves the image
and likeness of God. For He alone does the things that are good, with no fear and no thanks
or reward to stir Him up, but simply from the love of goodness. For, as Solomon says, “The
Lord hath made all things for Himself.”15 For under cover of His own goodness He bestows
all the fulness of good things on the worthy and the unworthy because He cannot be wearied
by wrongs, nor be moved by passions at the sins of men, as He ever remains perfect goodness
and unchangeable in His nature.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>By what steps we can ascend to the heights of love and what permanence there is in it.</head>
<p>If then any one is aiming at perfection, from that first stage of fear which we rightly
termed servile (of which it is said: “When ye have done all things say: we are unprofitable
servants,”16) he should by advancing a step mount to the higher path of hope—which is
compared not to a slave but to a hireling, because it looks for the payment of its recompense,
and as if it were free from care concerning absolution of its sins and fear of punishment,
and conscious of its own good works, though it seems to look for the promised reward, yet
it cannot attain to that love of a son who, trusting in his father’s kindness and liberality, has
no doubt that all that the father has is his, to which also that prodigal who together with his
father’s substance had lost the very name of son, did not venture to aspire, when he said: “I
am no more worthy to be called thy son;” for after those husks which the swine ate, satisfaction
from which was denied to him, i.e., the disgusting food of sin, as he “came to himself,”
and was overcome by a salutary fear, he already began to loathe the uncleanness of the swine,
and to dread the punishment of gnawing hunger, and as if he had already been made a servant,
desires the condition of a hireling and thinks about the remuneration, and says: “How
many hired servants of my father have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger.
I will then return to my father and will say unto him, ‘Father I have sinned against heaven
and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired
servants.’”17 But those words of humble penitence his father who ran to meet him received
with greater affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow
him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to his
former dignity of sonship. We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble
grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all
that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and
likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: “All that
the Father hath is mine.”18 Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: “All things
are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come; all are yours.”19 And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour
also summon us: “Be ye,” says He, “perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.”20 For
in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour

of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell
for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to
some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward
we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for “fear,” says one, “is
not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not
perfect in love. We therefore love because God first loved us.”21 We can then only ascend
to that true perfection when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation,
we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must
do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the
love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love
of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what
is good.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How greatly those excel who depart from sin through the feeling of love.</head>
<p>For there is a great difference between one who puts out the fire of sin within him by
fear of hell or hope of future reward, and one who from the feeling of divine love has a
horror of sin itself and of uncleanness, and keeps hold of the virtue of purity simply from
the love and longing for purity, and looks for no reward from a promise for the future, but,
delighted with the knowledge of good things present, does everything not from regard to
punishment but from delight in virtue. For this condition can neither abuse an opportunity
to sin when all human witnesses are absent, nor be corrupted by the secret allurements of
thoughts, while, keeping in its very marrow the love of virtue itself, it not only does not admit
into the heart anything that is opposed to it, but actually hates it with the utmost horror.
For it is one thing for a man in his delight at some present good to hate the stains of sins
and of the flesh, and another thing to check unlawful desires by contemplating the future
reward; and it is one thing to fear present loss and another to dread future punishment.
Lastly it is a much greater thing to be unwilling to forsake good for good’s own sake, than
it is to withhold consent from evil for fear of evil. For in the former case the good is voluntary,
but in the latter it is constrained and as it were violently forced out of a reluctant party either
by fear of punishment or by greed of reward. For one who abstains from the allurements of
sin owing to fear, will whenever the obstacle of fear is removed, once more return to what
he loves and thus will not continually acquire any stability in good, nor will he ever rest free
from attacks because he will not secure the sure and lasting peace of chastity. For where
there is the disturbance of warfare there cannot help being the danger of wounds. For one
who is in the midst of the conflict, even though he is a warrior and by fighting bravely inflicts
frequent and deadly wounds on his foes, must still sometimes be pierced by the point of the
enemy’s sword. But one who has defeated the attack of sins and is now in the enjoyment of
the security of peace, and has passed on to the love of virtue itself, will keep this condition
of good continually, as he is entirely wrapped up in it, because he believes that nothing can
be worse than the loss of his inmost chastity. For he deems nothing dearer or more precious
than present purity, to whom a dangerous departure from virtue or a poisonous stain of sin
is a grievous punishment. To such an one, I say, neither will regard for the presence of another
add anything to his goodness nor will solitude take anything away from it: but as always
and everywhere he bears about with him his conscience as a judge not only of his actions
but also of his thoughts, he will especially try to please it, as he knows that it cannot be
cheated nor deceived, and that he cannot escape it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>That love not only makes sons out of servants, but also bestows the image and likeness of God.</head>
<p>And if to anyone relying on the help of God and not on his own efforts, it has been
vouchsafed to acquire this state, from the condition of a servant, wherein is fear, and from
a mercenary greed of hope, whereby there is sought not so much the good of the donor as
the recompense of reward, he will begin to pass on to the adoption of sons, where there is
no longer fear, nor greed, but that love which never faileth continually endures. Of which
fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: “A son knoweth
his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and
if I be a Lord, where is my fear?”22 For one who is a servant must needs fear because “if
knowing his lord’s will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many
stripes.”23 Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now
delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling
of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his
compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering
that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord’s mercy
he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his
own exertions but by God’s protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who
go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: “Thou hast
broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;” and: “except the Lord had
helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.”24 And while he continues in this humility of
mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: “Love your enemies,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you.”25
And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall
not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: “that ye may be,”
says He “sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good
and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:”26 and this feeling the blessed John
knew that he had attained when he said: “that we may have confidence in the day of judgment,
because as He is so are we also in this world.”27 For in what can a weak and fragile human
nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and

evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness
itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle
speaks as follows: “Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and
he cannot sin, because he is born of God;” and again: “We know that every one who is born
of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him
not?”28 And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if
any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells
us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: “If a man knows his brother to
be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not
unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it.”29 But of those
which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot,
with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: “If we say that we have
no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;” and again: “If we say that we have
not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.”30 For it is an impossibility for
any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and
thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which
though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from
fault and blame.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>How it is the perfection of love to pray for one’s enemies and by what signs we may recognize
a mind that is not yet purified.</head>
<p>When then any one has acquired this love of goodness of which we have been speaking,
and the imitation of God, then he will be endowed with the Lord’s heart of compassion, and
will pray also for his persecutors, saying in like manner: “Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do.”31 But it is a clear sign of a soul that is not yet thoroughly purged from
the dregs of sin, not to sorrow with a feeling of pity at the offences of others, but to keep to
the rigid censure of the judge: for how will he be able to obtain perfection of heart, who is
without that by which, as the Apostle has pointed out, the full requirements of the law can
be fulfilled, saying: “Bear one another’s burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ,”32 and who
has not that virtue of love, which “is not grieved, is not puffed up, thinketh no evil,” which
“endureth all things, beareth all things.”33 For “a righteous man pitieth the life of his beasts:
but the heart of the ungodly is without pity.”34 And so a monk is quite certain to fall into
the same sins which he condemns in another with merciless and inhuman severity, for “a
stern king will fall into misfortunes,” and “one who stops his ears so as not to hear the weak,
shall himself cry, and there shall be none to hear him.”35</p>

<head>A question why he has called the feeling of fear and hope imperfect.</head>
<p>Germanus: You have indeed spoken powerfully and grandly of the perfect love of God.
But still this fact disturbs us; viz., that while you were exalting it with such praise, you said
that the fear of God and the hope of eternal reward were imperfect, though the prophet
seems to have thought quite differently about them, where he said: “Fear the Lord, all ye
His saints, for they that fear Him lack nothing.”36 And again in the matter of observing
God’s righteous acts he admits that he has done them from consideration of the reward,
saying: “I have inclined my heart to do thy righteous acts forever, for the reward.”37 And
the Apostle says: “By faith Moses when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of
Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of God than to have the
pleasure of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure
of the Egyptians; for he looked unto the reward.”38 How then can we think that they are
imperfect, if the blessed David boasted that he did the righteous acts of God in hope of a
recompense, and the giver of the Law is said to have looked for a future reward and so to
have despised the adoption to royal dignity, and to have preferred the most terrible affliction
to the treasures of the Egyptians?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The answer on the different kinds of perfection.</head>
<p>Chæremon: In accordance with the condition and measure of every mind Holy Scripture
summons our free wills to different grades of perfection. For no uniform crown of perfection
can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and
so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of
perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For
though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who
shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed
are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations
of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also
between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and
that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall
be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. “For there is one glory of the
sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from
star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.”39 While therefore in accordance with
this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says “Blessed are all they that fear
the Lord,”40 and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: “There is
no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that feareth
is not yet perfect in love.”41 And again, though it is a grand thing to serve God, and it is
said: “Serve the Lord in fear;” and: “It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;” and:
“Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,”42 yet it is
said to the Apostles: “I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his
Lord doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I
have made known unto you.”43 And once more: “Ye are My friends, if ye do whatever I
command you.”44 You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are
called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become
blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written “from strength to strength,”45
and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope,

<pb n="1061"/>
is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has been
“a faithful and wise servant”46 will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption
of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not
that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense
which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce
those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein
is already fuller confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary
hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow
make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father’s
house are “many mansions,”47 and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is
a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that
of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it
not only above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful,
and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of
spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: “And yet I
show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels,
and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though
I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed
the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.” You
see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if
I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For “whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be
knowledge, it shall be destroyed,” but “love never faileth,”48 and without it not only those
most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will fail.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Of the fear which is the outcome of the greatest love.</head>
<p>Whoever then has been established in this perfect love is sure to mount by a higher
stage to that still more sublime fear belonging to love, which is the outcome of no dread of
punishment or greed of reward, but of the greatest love; whereby a son fears with earnest
affection a most indulgent father, or a brother fears his brother, a friend his friend, or a wife
her husband, while there is no dread of his blows or reproaches, but only of a slight injury
to his love, and while in every word as well as act there is ever care taken by anxious affection
lest the warmth of his love should cool in the very slightest degree towards the object of it.
And one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: “Wisdom
and knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.”49 He could
not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by saying that the
riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be
preserved by the fear of the Lord. To this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the
prophetic word where the Psalmist says: “O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints: for they that
fear Him lack nothing.”50 For where a man fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that
nothing is lacking to his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the Apostle
John said that “He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for fear hath punishment.”51
There is then a great difference between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the
treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called “the beginning
of wisdom,”52 and which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those
who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For “there is no fear in love, but
perfect love casteth out fear.”53 And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear,
what will its perfection be except in the love of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear
which belongs to perfect love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and
knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for
those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: “And the servant
shall fear his Lord;”54 and in the gospel: “I no longer call you servants, for the servant
knoweth not what his Lord doeth;” and therefore “the servant,” He tells us, “abideth not in
the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.”55 For He is instructing us to pass on from

<note type="footnote">55 S. John xv. 15; viii. 35.</note>

<pb n="1063"/>
that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of
God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord’s love already passed
through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched
with good things by the Lord, “for God hath not given us” he says “a spirit of fear but of
power and of love and of a sound mind.”56 Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love
of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of
servants, he addresses in these words: “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again
to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”57 It is of this
fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according
to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:58 “And there shall
rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit
of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness,” and in the last place
he adds as something special these words: “And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill
Him.”59 Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say “and there
shall rest upon Him the Spirit of fear,” as he said in the earlier cases, but he says “there shall
fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.” For such is the greatness of its richness that when
once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole
mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which “never
faileth,” it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession
of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights,
as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging
to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,60 who came not only to redeem
mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled.
For the true Son of God “who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,”61 could
not feel that servile fear of punishment.</p>

heights of love, by which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to the image and likeness
of God, cannot possibly exist without perfect purity. But we should like to know whether a
lasting grant of it can be secured so that no incitement to lust may ever disturb the serenity
of our heart, and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our sojourneying in the
flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to be inflamed by the fire of excitement.</p>

on Him may, as the Psalmist says, occupy all the days and nights of our life,62 and may
support our soul, which insatiably hungers and thirsts after righteousness, by continually
chewing the cud of this heavenly food. But we must also, in accordance with the kindly
forethought of our Saviour, make some provision for the food of the body, that we faint not
by the way,63 for “the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”64 And this we must
now secure by taking a little food, so that after supper, the mind may be rendered more attentive
for the careful tracing out of what you want.</p>

<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>When after a short sleep we returned for morning service and were waiting for the old
man, Abbot Germanus was troubled by great scruples because in the previous discussion,
the force of which had inspired us with the utmost longing for this chastity which was till
now unknown to us, the blessed old man had by the addition of a single sentence broken
down the claims of man’s exertions, adding that man even though he strive with all his
might for a good result, yet cannot become master of what is good unless he has acquired
it simply by the gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil. While then we
were puzzling over this question the blessed Chæremon arrived at the cell, and as he saw
that we were whispering together about something, he cut the service of prayers and Psalms
shorter than usual, and asked us what was the matter.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>A question why the merit of good deeds may not be ascribed to the exertions of the man who
does them.</head>
<p>Then Germanus: As we are almost shut out, so to speak, by the greatness of that splendid
virtue, which was described in last night’s discussion, from believing in the possibility of it,
so, if you will pardon my saying so, it seems to us absurd for the reward of our efforts, i.e.,
perfect chastity, which is gained by the earnestness of one’s own toil, not to be ascribed
chiefly to the exertions of the man who makes the effort. For it is foolish, if, when for example,
we see a husbandman taking the utmost pains over the cultivation of the ground, we do not
ascribe the fruits to his exertions.</p>

<head>The answer that without God’s help not only perfect chastity but all good of every kind cannot
be performed.</head>
<p>Chæremon: By this very instance which you bring forward we can still more clearly
prove that the exertions of the worker can do nothing without God’s aid. For neither can
the husbandman, when he has spent the utmost pains in cultivating the ground, forthwith
ascribe the produce of the crops and the rich fruits to his own exertions, as he finds that
these are often in vain unless opportune rains and a quiet and calm winter aids them, so
that we have often seen fruits already ripe and set and thoroughly matured snatched as it
were from the hands of those who were grasping them; and their continuous and earnest
efforts were of no use to the workers because they were not under the guidance of the Lord’s
assistance. As then the Divine goodness does not grant these rich crops to idle husbandmen
who do not till their fields by frequent ploughing, so also toil all night long is of no use to
the workers unless the mercy of the Lord prospers it. But herein human pride should never
try to put itself on a level with the grace of God or to intermingle itself with it, so as to fancy
that its own efforts were the cause of Divine bounty, or to boast that a very plentiful crop
of fruits was an answer to the merits of its own exertions. For a man should consider and
with a most careful scrutiny weigh the fact that he could not by his own strength apply those
very efforts which he has earnestly used in his desire for wealth, unless the Lord’s protection
and pity had given him strength for the performance of all agricultural labours; and that his
own will and strength would have been powerless unless Divine compassion had supplied
the means for the completion of them, as they sometimes fail either from too much or from
too little rain. For when vigour has been granted by the Lord to the oxen, and bodily health
and the power to do all the work, and prosperity in undertakings, still a man must pray lest
there come to him, as Scripture says, “a heaven of brass and an earth of iron,” and “the
cankerworm eat what the locust hath left, and the palmerworm eat what the cankerworm
hath left, and the mildew destroys what the palmerworm hath left.”66 Nor is it only in this
that the efforts of the husbandman in his work need God’s help, unless it also averts unlooked
for accidents by which, even when the field is rich with the expected fruitful crops, not only
is the man deprived of what he has vainly hoped and looked for, but actually loses the
abundant fruits which he has already gathered and stored up in the threshing floor or in
the barn. From which we clearly infer that the initiative not only of our actions but also of
good thoughts comes from God, who inspires us with a good will to begin with, and supplies
us with the opportunity of carrying out what we rightly desire: for “every good gift and every
perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of lights,”67 who both begins what
<note type="footnote">66 Deut. xxviii. 23; Joel i. 4.</note>

<pb n="1071"/>
is good, and continues it and completes it in us, as the Apostle says: “But He who giveth
seed to the sower will both provide bread to eat and will multiply your seed and make the
fruits of your righteousness to increase.”68 But it is for us, humbly to follow day by day the
grace of God which is drawing us, or else if we resist with “a stiff neck,” and (to use the
words of Scripture) “uncircumcised ears,”69 we shall deserve to hear the words of Jeremiah:
“Shall he that falleth, not rise again? and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again?
Why then is this people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have
stiffened their necks and refused to return.”70</p>

<head>An objection, asking how the Gentiles can be said to have chastity without the grace of God.</head>
<p>Germanus: To this explanation, the excellence of which we cannot hastily disprove, it
seems a difficulty that it tends to destroy free will. For as we see that many of the heathen
to whom the assistance of Divine grace has certainly not been vouchsafed, are eminent not
only in the virtues of frugality and patience, but (which is more remarkable) in that of
chastity, how can we think that the freedom of their will is taken captive and that these virtues
are granted to them by God’s gift, especially as in following after the wisdom of this world,
and in their utter ignorance not only of God’s grace but even of the existence of the true
God, as we have known Him by the course of our reading and the teaching of others—they
are said to have gained the most perfect purity of chastity by their own efforts and exertions.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>The answer on the imaginary chastity of the philosophers.</head>
<p>Chæremon: I am pleased that, though you are fired with the greatest longing to know
the truth, yet you bring forward some foolish points, as by your raising these objections the
value of the Catholic faith may seem better established, and if I may use the expression,
more thoroughly explored. For what wise man would make such contradictory statements
as yesterday to maintain that the heavenly purity of chastity could not possibly even by
God’s grace be bestowed on any mortals, and now to hold that it was obtained even by the
heathen by their own strength? But as you have certainly, as I said, made these objections
from the desire of getting at the truth, consider what we hold on these points. First we certainly
must not think that the philosophers attained such chastity of soul, as is required of
us, on whom it is enjoined that not fornication only, but uncleanness be not so much as
named among us. But they had a sort of μερική, i.e., some particle of chastity; viz. continence
of the flesh, by which they could restrain their lust from carnal intercourse: but this internal
purity of mind and continual purity of body they could not attain, I will not say, in act, but
even in thought. Finally Socrates, the most famous of them all, as they themselves esteem
him, was not ashamed to profess this of himself. For when one who judged a man’s character
by his looks (ψυσιογνώμοιν) looked at him, and said ὄμματα παιδ εραστοῦ, i.e., “the eyes
of a corrupter of boys,” and his scholars rushed at him, and brought him to their master
and wanted to avenge the insult, it is said that he checked their indignation with these words:
παύσαοθε, ἐταῖροι · εἰμὶ γάρ, ἐπέκω δέ, i.e., Stop, my friends, for I am, but I restrain myself.
It is then quite clearly shown not only by our assertions but actually by their own admissions
that it was only the performance of indecent acts, i.e., the disgrace of intercourse, that was
by force of necessity checked by them, and that the desire and delight in this passion was
not shut out from their hearts. But with what horror must one bring forward this saying of
Diogenes? For a thing which the philosophers of this world were not ashamed to bring forward
as something remarkable, cannot be spoken or heard by us without shame: for to one
to be punished for the crime of adultery they relate that he said τὸ δωρεὰν πωλούμενον
θανάτω μὴ ἀγόραζε, i.e., you should not buy with your death what is sold for nothing.71 It
is clear then that they did not recognize the virtue of the true chastity which we seek for,
and so it is quite certain that our circumcision which is in the spirit cannot be acquired save
only by the gift of God, and that it belongs only to those who serve God with full contrition
of their spirit.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>That without the grace of God we cannot make any diligent efforts.</head>
<p>And therefore though in many things, indeed in everything, it can be shown that men
always have need of God’s help, and that human weakness cannot accomplish anything that
has to do with salvation by itself alone, i.e., without the aid of God, yet in nothing is this
more clearly shown than in the acquisition and preservation of chastity. For as the discussion
on the difficulty of its perfection is put off for so long, let us meanwhile discourse briefly on
the instruments of it. Who, I ask, could, however fervent he might be in spirit, relying on
his own strength with no praise from men endure the squalor of the desert, and I will not
say the daily lack but the supply of dry bread? Who without the Lord’s consolation, could
put up with the continual thirst for water, or deprive his human eyes of that sweet and delicious
morning sleep, and regularly compress his whole time of rest and repose into the
limits of four hours? Who would be sufficient without God’s grace to give continual attend-
ance to reading and constant earnestness in work, receiving no advantage of present gain?
And all these matters, as we cannot desire them continuously without divine inspiration,
so in no respect whatever can we perform them without His help. And that we may ensure
that these things are not only proved to us by the teaching of experience, but also made still
clearer by sure proof and arguments, does not some weakness intervene in the case of many
things which we wish usefully to perform, and though the full keenness of our desire and
the perfection of our will be not wanting, yet interfere with the wish we have conceived, so
that there is no carrying out of our purpose, unless the power to perform it has been granted
by the mercy of the Lord, so that, although there are countless swarms of people who are
anxious to stick faithfully to the pursuit of virtue, you can scarcely find any who are able to
carry it out and endure it, to say nothing of the fact that, even when no weakness at all
hinders us, the opportunity for doing everything that we wish does not lie in our own power.
For it is not in our power to secure the silence of solitude and severe fasts and undisturbed
study even when we could use such opportunities, but by a chapter of accidents we are often
very much against our will kept away from the salutary ordinances so that we have to pray
to the Lord for opportunities of place or time in which to practise them. And it is clear that
the ability for these is not sufficient for us unless there be also granted to us by the Lord an
opportunity of doing what we are capable of (as the Apostle also says: “For we wanted to
come to you once and again, but Satan hindered us”72), so that sometimes we find for our
advantage we are called away from these spiritual exercises in order that while without our
own consent the regularity of our routine is broken and we yield something to weakness of
the flesh, we may even against our will be brought to a salutary patience. Of which provid-
<note type="footnote">72 1 Thess. ii. 18.</note>

<pb n="1075"/>
ential arrangement of God the blessed Apostle says something similar: “For which I besought
the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And He said to me: My grace is sufficient for
thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness:” and again: “For we know not what to
pray for as we ought.”73</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of the main purpose of God and His daily Providence.</head>
<p>For the purpose of God whereby He made man not to perish but to live for ever, stands
immovable. And when His goodness sees in us even the very smallest spark of good will
shining forth, which He Himself has struck as it were out of the hard flints of our hearts,
He fans and fosters it and nurses it with His breath, as He “willeth all men to be saved and
to come to the knowledge of the truth,” for as He says, “it is not the will of your Father which
is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish,” and again it says: “Neither will God
have a soul to perish, but recalleth,” meaning that he that is cast off should not altogether
perish.74 For He is true, and lieth not when He lays down with an oath: “As I live, saith the
Lord God, for I will not the death of a sinner, but that he should turn from his way and
live.”75 For if He willeth not that one of His little ones should perish, how can we imagine
without grievous blasphemy that He does not generally will all men, but only some instead
of all to be saved? Those then who perish, perish against His will, as He testifies against each
one of them day by day: “Turn from your evil ways, and why will ye die, O house of Israel?”76
And again: “How often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not;” and: “Wherefore is this people in Jerusalem
turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have hardened their faces and refused to return.”
77 The grace of Christ then is at hand every day, which, while it “willeth all men to be
saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,” calleth all without any exception, saying:
“Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.”78 But if He
calls not all generally but only some, it follows that not all are heavy laden either with original
or actual sin, and that this saying is not a true one: “For all have sinned and come short of
the glory of God;” nor can we believe that “death passed on all men.”79 And so far do all
who perish, perish against the will of God, that God cannot be said to have made death, as
Scripture itself testifies: “For God made not death, neither rejoiceth in the destruction of
the living.”80 And hence it comes that for the most part when instead of good things we ask
for the opposite, our prayer is either heard but tardily or not at all; and again the Lord
vouchsafes to bring upon us even against our will, like some most beneficent physician, for

our good what we think is opposed to it, and sometimes He delays and hinders our injurious
purposes and deadly attempts from having their horrible effects, and, while we are rushing
headlong towards death, draws us back to salvation, and rescues us without our knowing
it from the jaws of hell.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the grace of God and the freedom of the will.</head>
<p>And this care of His and providence with regard to us the Divine word has finely described
by the prophet Hosea under the figure of Jerusalem as an harlot, and inclining with
disgraceful eagerness to the worship of idols, where when she says: “I will go after my lovers,
who give me my bread, and my water, and my wool, and my flax, and my oil, and my drink;”
the Divine consideration replies having regard to her salvation and not to her wishes: “Behold
I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find
her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them: and she shall
seek them, and shall not find them, and shall say: I will return to my first husband, because
it was better with me then than now.”81 And again our obstinacy, and scorn, with which
we in our rebellious spirit disdain Him when He urges us to a salutary return, is described
in the following comparison: He says: “And I said thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt not
cease to walk after Me. But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel
despised Me, saith the Lord.”82 Aptly then, as He has compared Jerusalem to an adulteress
forsaking her husband, He compares His own love and persevering goodness to a man who
is dying of love for a woman. For the goodness and love of God, which He ever shows to
mankind,—since it is overcome by no injuries so as to cease from caring for our salvation,
or be driven from His first intention, as if vanquished by our iniquities,—could not be more
fitly described by any comparison than the case of a man inflamed with most ardent love
for a woman, who is consumed by a more burning passion for her, the more he sees that he
is slighted and despised by her. The Divine protection then is inseparably present with us,
and so great is the kindness of the Creator towards His creatures, that His Providence not
only accompanies it, but actually constantly precedes it, as the prophet experienced and
plainly confessed, saying: “My God will prevent me with His mercy.”83 And when He sees
in us some beginnings of a good will, He at once enlightens it and strengthens it and urges
it on towards salvation, increasing that which He Himself implanted or which He sees to
have arisen from our own efforts. For He says “Before they cry, I will hear them: While they
are still speaking I will hear them;” and again: “As soon as He hears the voice of thy crying,
He will answer thee.”84 And in His goodness, not only does He inspire us with holy desires,
but actually creates occasions for life and opportunities for good results, and shows to those
in error the direction of the way of salvation.</p>

<head>Of the power of our good will, and the grace of God.</head>
<p>Whence human reason cannot easily decide how the Lord gives to those that ask, is
found by those that seek, and opens to those that knock, and on the other hand is found by
those that sought Him not, appears openly among those who asked not for Him, and all the
day long stretches forth His hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people, calls those who
resist and stand afar off, draws men against their will to salvation, takes away from those
who want to sin the faculty of carrying out their desire, in His goodness stands in the way
of those who are rushing into wickedness. But who can easily see how it is that the completion
of our salvation is assigned to our own will, of which it is said: “If ye be willing, and hearken
unto Me, ye shall eat the good things of the land,”85 and how it is “not of him that willeth
or runneth, but of God that hath mercy?”86 What too is this, that God “will render to every
man according to his works;”87 and “it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do,
of His good pleasure;”88 and “this is not of yourselves but it is the gift of God: not of works,
that no man may boast?”89 What is this too which is said: “Draw near to the Lord, and He
will draw near to you,”90 and what He says elsewhere: “No man cometh unto Me except the
Father who sent Me draw Him?”91 What is it that we find: “Make straight paths for your
feet and direct your ways,”92 and what is it that we say in our prayers: “Direct my way in
Thy sight,” and “establish my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps be not moved?”93 What
is it again that we are admonished: “Make you a new heart and a new spirit,”94 and what is
this which is promised to us: “I will give them one heart and will put a new spirit within
them:” and “I will take away the stony heart from their flesh and will give them an heart of
flesh that they may walk in Thy statutes and keep My judgments?”95 What is it that the Lord
commands, where He says: “Wash thine heart of iniquity, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest
be saved,”96 and what is it that the prophet asks for from the Lord, when he says “Create in

snow?”97 What is it that is said to us: “Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge;”98
and this which is said of God: “Who teacheth man knowledge;”99 and: “the Lord enlightens
the blind,”100 or at any rate this, which we say in our prayers with the prophet: “Lighten
mine eyes that I sleep not in death,”101 unless in all these there is a declaration of the grace
of God and the freedom of our will, because even of his own motion a man can be led to
the quest of virtue, but always stands in need of the help of the Lord? For neither does anyone
enjoy good health whenever he will, nor is he at his own will and pleasure set free from
disease and sickness. But what good is it to have desired the blessing of health, unless God,
who grants us the enjoyments of life itself, grant also vigorous and sound health? But that
it may be still clearer that through the excellence of nature which is granted by the goodness
of the Creator, sometimes first beginnings of a good will arise, which however cannot attain
to the complete performance of what is good unless it is guided by the Lord, the Apostle
bears witness and says: “For to will is present with me, but to perform what is good I find
not.”102</p>

<head>On the weakness of free will.</head>
<p>For Holy Scripture supports the freedom of the will where it says: “Keep thy heart with
all diligence,”103 but the Apostle indicates its weakness by saying “The Lord keep your hearts
and minds in Christ Jesus.”104 David asserts the power of free will, where he says “I have
inclined my heart to do Thy righteous acts,”105 but the same man in like manner teaches
us its weakness, by praying and saying, “Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies and not to
covetousness:”106 Solomon also: “The Lord incline our hearts unto Himself that we may
walk in all His ways and keep His commandments, and ordinances and judgments.”107 The
Psalmist denotes the power of our will, where he says: “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy
lips that they speak no guile,”108 our prayer testifies to its weakness, when we say: “O Lord,
set a watch before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.”109 The importance of our will
is maintained by the Lord, when we find “Break the chains of thy neck, O captive daughter
of Zion:”110 of its weakness the prophet sings, when he says: “The Lord looseth them that
are bound:” and “Thou hast broken my chains: To Thee will I offer the sacrifice of praise.”111
We hear in the gospel the Lord summoning us to come speedily to Him by our free will:
“Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,”112 but the
same Lord testifies to its weakness, by saying: “No man can come unto Me except the
Father which sent Me draw him.”113 The Apostle indicates our free will by saying: “So run
that ye may obtain:”114 but to its weakness John Baptist bears witness where he says: “No
man can receive anything of himself, except it be given him from above.”115 We are commanded
to keep our souls with all care, when the Prophet says: “Keep your souls,”116 but

by the same spirit another Prophet proclaims: “Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman
waketh but in vain.”117 The Apostle writing to the Philippians, to show that their will is
free, says “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,” but to point out its
weakness, he adds: “For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of His good
pleasure.”118</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Whether the grace of God precedes or follows our good will.</head>
<p>And so these are somehow mixed up and indiscriminately confused, so that among
many persons, which depends on the other is involved in great questionings, i.e., does God
have compassion upon us because we have shown the beginning of a good will, or does the
beginning of a good will follow because God has had compassion upon us? For many believing
each of these and asserting them more widely than is right are entangled in all kinds of
opposite errors. For if we say that the beginning of free will is in our own power, what about
Paul the persecutor, what about Matthew the publican, of whom the one was drawn to salvation
while eager for bloodshed and the punishment of the innocent, the other for violence
and rapine? But if we say that the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration
of the grace of God, what about the faith of Zaccheus, or what are we to say of the goodness
of the thief on the cross, who by their own desires brought violence to bear on the kingdom
of heaven and so prevented the special leadings of their vocation? But if we attribute the
performance of virtuous acts, and the execution of God’s commands to our own will, how
do we pray: “Strengthen, O God, what Thou hast wrought in us;” and “The work of our
hands stablish Thou upon us?”119 We know that Balaam was brought to curse Israel, but
we see that when he wished to curse he was not permitted to. Abimelech is preserved from
touching Rebecca and so sinning against God. Joseph is sold by the envy of his brethren, in
order to bring about the descent of the children of Israel into Egypt, and that while they
were contemplating the death of their brother provision might be made for them against
the famine to come: as Joseph shows when he makes himself known to his brethren and
says: “Fear not, neither let it be grievous unto you that ye sold me into these parts: for for
your salvation God sent me before you;” and below: “For God sent me before that ye might
be preserved upon the earth and might have food whereby to live. Not by your design was
I sent but by the will of God, who has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house,
and chief over all the land of Egypt.” And when his brethren were alarmed after the death
of his father, he removed their suspicions and terror by saying: “Fear not: Can ye resist the
will of God? You imagined evil against me but God turned it into good, that He might exalt
me, as ye see at the present time, that He might save much people.”120 And that this was
brought about providentially the blessed David likewise declared saying in the hundred and
fourth Psalm: “And He called for a dearth upon the land: and brake all the staff of bread.
He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold for a slave.”121 These two then; viz., the grace

of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather
from the system of goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of
them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church’s faith: for when God
sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for “At the voice
of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer thee;” and: “Call upon Me,” He says, “in
the day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”122 And again, if He
finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations,
by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us.</p>

<head>That a good will should not always be attributed to grace, nor always to man himself.</head>
<p>For we should not hold that God made man such that he can never will or be capable
of what is good: or else He has not granted him a free will, if He has suffered him only to
will or be capable of evil, but neither to will or be capable of what is good of himself. And,
in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand:
“Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?”123 For we cannot think
that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to
admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd
and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: “God
made man upright,” i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, “But they have sought
out many imaginations,”124 for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam
therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did
not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle’s words very clearly
show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says:
“For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these,
though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law
written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within
them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets
of men.”125 And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but
freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves,
saying: “Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant?
and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?”126 And that no one might ascribe
this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: “Bring forth
the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;” and again: “having
eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.”127 The Lord also says in the gospel: “Because
seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.”128 And in them
is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: “Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand:
and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their
ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes

and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal
them.”129 Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the
Pharisees, He says: “But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?”130 And this
he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment
they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of
the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to
human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon,
or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple
was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: “And David my father would have
built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father:
Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done
in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shalt not build a house to My
name.”131 This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from
God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by
whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from
man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from
man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only
to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine
anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of
goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are
quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection,
for, as the blessed Apostle says: “Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth,
but God that giveth the increase.”132 But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a
man’s own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,133 where two angels
are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man’s
own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man,
and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded
saying: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,” had he not known
that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had
no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: “For it is God that worketh in
you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.”134 And therefore he warns Timothy and

says: “Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;” and again: “For which cause I exhort
thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.”135 Hence also in writing to the Corinthians
he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy
of the grace of God, saying: “And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of
God in vain:”136 for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because
he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who
said: “Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be
forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.”137
It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: “My God will prevent me with His
mercy;”138 and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires
to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: “And in the morning my prayer shall prevent
Thee;” and again: “I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;” and: “Mine eyes have
prevented the morning.”139 For He calls and invites us, when He says: “All the day long I
stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;”140 and He is invited by
us when we say to Him: “All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee.”141
He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: “Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have com-
passion upon us;”142 and He is waited for by us, when we say: “I waited patiently for the
Lord, and He inclined unto me;” and: “I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.”143 He
strengthens us when He says: “And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and
they have imagined evil against me;”144 and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when
He says: “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.”145 Jesus cries:
“If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;”146 the prophet also cries to Him: “I
have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope
in my God.”147 The Lord seeks us, when He says: “I sought and there was no man. I called,

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>How human efforts cannot be set against the grace of God.</head>
<p>And so the grace of God always co-operates with our will for its advantage, and in all
things assists, protects, and defends it, in such a way as sometimes even to require and look
for some efforts of good will from it that it may not appear to confer its gifts on one who is
asleep or relaxed in sluggish ease, as it seeks opportunities to show that as the torpor of
man’s sluggishness is shaken off its bounty is not unreasonable, when it bestows it on account
of some desire and efforts to gain it. And none the less does God’s grace continue to be free
grace while in return for some small and trivial efforts it bestows with priceless bounty such
glory of immortality, and such gifts of eternal bliss. For because the faith of the thief on the
cross came as the first thing, no one would say that therefore the blessed abode of Paradise
was not promised to him as a free gift, nor could we hold that it was the penitence of King
David’s single word which he uttered: “I have sinned against the Lord,” and not rather the
mercy of God which removed those two grievous sins of his, so that it was vouchsafed to
him to hear from the prophet Nathan: “The Lord also hath put away thine iniquity: thou
shalt not die.”150 The fact then that he added murder to adultery, was certainly due to free
will: but that he was reproved by the prophet, this was the grace of Divine Compassion.
Again it was his own doing that he was humbled and acknowledged his guilt; but that in a
very short interval of time he was granted pardon for such sins, this was the gift of the
merciful Lord. And what shall we say of this brief confession and of the incomparable infinity
of Divine reward, when it is easy to see what the blessed Apostle, as he fixes his gaze on the
greatness of future remuneration, announced on those countless persecutions of his? “for,”
says he, “our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of glory,”151 of which elsewhere he constantly affirms, saying that “the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which
shall be revealed in us.”152 However much then human weakness may strive, it cannot come
up to the future reward, nor by its efforts so take off from Divine grace that it should not
always remain a free gift. And therefore the aforesaid teacher of the Gentiles, though he
bears his witness that he had obtained the grade of the Apostolate by the grace of God, saying:
“By the grace of God I am what I am,” yet also declares that he himself had corresponded
to Divine Grace, where he says: “And His Grace in me was not in vain; but I laboured more
abundantly than they all: and yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.”153 For when he says:</p>

<pb n="1090"/>
<p>“I laboured,” he shows the effort of his own will; when he says: “yet not I, but the grace of
God,” he points out the value of Divine protection; when he says: “with me,” he affirms that
it cooperates with him when he was not idle or careless, but working and making an effort.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How God makes trial of the strength of man’s will by means of his temptations.</head>
<p>And this too we read that the Divine righteousness provided for in the case of Job His
well tried athlete, when the devil had challenged him to single combat. For if he had advanced
against his foe, not with his own strength, but solely with the protection of God’s grace; and,
supported only by Divine aid without any virtue of patience on his own part, had borne that
manifold weight of temptations and losses, contrived with all the cruelty of his foe, how
would the devil have repeated with some justice that slanderous speech which he had previously
uttered: “Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast Thou not hedged him in, and all his
substance round about? but take away thine hand,” i.e., allow him to fight with me in his
own strength, “and he will curse Thee to Thy face.”154 But as after the struggle the slanderous
foe dare not give vent to any such murmur as this, he admired that he was vanquished by
his strength and not by that of God; although too we must not hold that the grace of God
was altogether wanting to him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in proportion
to that which it knew that he had of resisting, without protecting him from his attacks in
such a way as to leave no room for human virtue, but only providing for this; viz., that the
most fierce foe should not drive him out of his mind and overwhelm him when weakened,
with unequal thoughts and in an unfair contest. But that the Lord is sometimes wont to
tempt our faith that it may be made stronger and more glorious, we are taught by the example
of the centurion in the gospel, in whose case though the Lord knew that He would cure his
servant by the power of His word, yet He chose to offer His bodily presence, saying: “I will
come and heal him:” but when the centurion overcame this offer of His by the ardour of
still more fervent faith, and said: “Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under
my roof: but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,” the Lord marvelled at
him and praised him, and put him before all those of the people of Israel who had believed,
saying: “Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.”155 For there would
have been no ground for praise or merit, if Christ had only preferred in him what He
Himself had given. And this searching trial of faith we read that the Divine righteousness
brought about also in the case of the grandest of the patriarchs; where it is said: “And it
came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham.”156 For the Divine righteousness
wished to try not that faith with which the Lord had inspired him, but that which when
called and enlightened by the Lord he could show forth by his own free will. Wherefore the
firmness of his faith was not without reason proved, and when the grace of God, which had

<pb n="1092"/>
for a while left him to prove him, came to his aid, it was said: “Lay not thine hand on the
lad, and do nothing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest the Lord, and for my sake
hast not spared thy beloved son.”157 And that this kind of temptation can befall us, for the
sake of proving us, is sufficiently clearly foretold by the giver of the Law in Deuteronomy:
“If there rise in the midst of you a prophet or one that saith he hath seen a dream, and
foretell a sign and wonder; and that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us
go and serve strange gods which ye know not, thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet
or dreamer; for the Lord your God surely trieth thee, whether thou lovest Him with all thine
heart, and keepest His Commandments, or no.”158 What then follows? When God has
permitted that prophet or dreamer to arise, must we hold that He will protect those whose
faith He is purposing to try, in such a way as to leave no place for their own free will, where
they can fight with the tempter with their own strength? And why is it necessary for them
even to be tried if He knows them to be so weak and feeble as not to be able by their own
power to resist the tempter? But certainly the Divine righteousness would not have permitted
them to be tempted, unless it knew that there was within them an equal power of resistance,
by which they could by an equitable judgment be found in either result either guilty or
worthy of praise. To the same effect also is this which the Apostle says: “Therefore let him
that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but
such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a way of escape that ye may be able
to bear it.”159 For when he says “Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall” he sets free will
on its guard, as he certainly knew that, after grace had been received, it could either stand
by its exertions or fall through carelessness. But when he adds: “there hath no temptation
taken you but what is common to man” he chides their weakness and the frailty of their
heart that is not yet strengthened, as they could not yet resist the attacks of the hosts of
spiritual wickedness, against which he knew that he and those who were perfect daily fought;
of which also he says to the Ephesians: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against
spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.”160 But when he subjoins: “But God is faithful who
will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,” he certainly is not hoping that the
Lord will not suffer them to be tempted, but that they may not be tempted above what they

<pb n="1093"/>
are able to bear. For the one shows the power of man’s will, the other denotes the grace of
the Lord who moderates the violence of temptations. In all these phrases then there is proof
that Divine grace ever stirs up the will of man, not so as to protect and defend it in all things
in such a way as to cause it not to fight by its own efforts against its spiritual adversaries,
the victor over whom may set it down to God’s grace, and the vanquished to his own
weakness, and thus learn that his hope is always not in his own courage but in the Divine
assistance, and that he must ever fly to his Protector. And to prove this not by our own
conjecture but by still clearer passages of Holy Scripture let us consider what we read in
Joshuah the son of Nun: “The Lord,” it says, “left these nations and would not destroy them,
that by them He might try Israel, whether they would keep the commandments of the Lord
their God, and that they might learn to fight with their enemies.”161 And if we may illustrate
the incomparable mercy of our Creator from something earthly, not as being equal in
kindness, but as an illustration of mercy: if a tender and anxious nurse carries an infant in
her bosom for a long time in order sometime to teach it to walk, and first allows it to crawl,
then supports it that by the aid of her right hand it may lean on its alternate steps, presently
leaves it for a little and if she sees it tottering at all, catches hold of it, and grabs at it when
falling, when down picks it up, and either shields it from a fall, or allows it to fall lightly,
and sets it up again after a tumble, but when she has brought it up to boyhood or the strength
of youth or early manhood, lays upon it some burdens or labours by which it may be not
overwhelmed but exercised, and allows it to vie with those of its own age; how much more
does the heavenly Father of all know whom to carry in the bosom of His grace, whom to
train to virtue in His sight by the exercise of free will, and yet He helps him in his efforts,
hears him when he calls, leaves him not when he seeks Him, and sometimes snatches him
from peril even without his knowing it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Of the manifold grace of men’s calls.</head>
<p>And by this it is clearly shown that God’s “judgments are inscrutable and His ways past
finding out,”162 by which He draws mankind to salvation. And this too we can prove by the
instances of calls in the gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles
by the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of their healing and
salvation. Zacchæus, when in his faithfulness he was struggling to see the Lord, and making
up for his littleness of stature by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but
actually honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his will and
resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him so closely that when he
asked for the shortest possible delay in order to bury his father He did not grant it. To
Cornelius when constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown
by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon Peter,
and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be saved with all his. And so
the manifold wisdom of God grants with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to
men; and imparts to each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He
wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty but according
to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to
each one. For when one believed that for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was
sufficient He healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: “I will, be thou clean.”163
When another prayed that He would come and raise his dead daughter by laying His hands
on her, He entered his house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of Him. When
another believed that what was essential for his salvation depended on His command, and
answered: “Speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed,”164 He restored to their
former strength the limbs that were relaxed, by the power of a word, saying: “Go thy way,
and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee.”165 To others hoping for restoration from the
touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of healing. To some, when asked, He bestowed
remedies for their diseases. To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He
urged on to hope, saying: “Willest thou to be made whole?”166 to others when they were
without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out before
satisfying their wants, saying: “What will ye that I should do for you?”167 To another who

knew not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: “If thou
believest thou shalt see the glory of God.”168 Among some so richly did He pour forth the
mighty works of His cures that of them the Evangelist says: “And He healed all their sick.”169
But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ’s beneficence was so stopped up, that
it was said: “And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.”170 And
so the bounty of God is actually shaped according to the capacity of man’s faith, so that to
one it is said: “According to thy faith be it unto thee:”171 and to another: “Go thy way, and
as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;”172 to another “Be it unto thee according as thou
wilt,”173 and again to another: “Thy faith hath made thee whole.”174</p>

<head>Of the grace of God; to the effect that it transcends the narrow limits of human faith.</head>
<p>But let no one imagine that we have brought forward these instances to try to make out
that the chief share in our salvation rests with our faith, according to the profane notion of
some who attribute everything to free will and lay down that the grace of God is dispensed
in accordance with the desert of each man: but we plainly assert our unconditional opinion
that the grace of God is superabounding, and sometimes overflows the narrow limits of
man’s lack of faith. And this, as we remember, happened in the case of the ruler in the gospel,
who, as he believed that it was an easier thing for his son to be cured when sick than to be
raised when dead, implored the Lord to come at once, saying: “Lord, come down ere my
child die;” and though Christ reproved his lack of faith with these words: “Except ye see
signs and wonders ye will not believe,” yet He did not manifest the grace of His Divinity in
proportion to the weakness of his faith, nor did He expell the deadly disease of the fever by
His bodily presence, as the man believed he would, but by the word of His power, saying:
“Go thy way, thy son liveth.”175 And we read also that the Lord poured forth this superabundance
of grace in the case of the cure of the paralytic, when, though he only asked for
the healing of the weakness by which his body was enervated, He first brought health to the
soul by saying: “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.” After which, when the
scribes did not believe that He could forgive men’s sins, in order to confound their incredulity,
He set free by the power of His word the man’s limb, and put an end to his disease of
paralysis, by saying: “Why think ye evil in your hearts? Whether is easier to say, thy sins be
forgiven thee, or to say, arise and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath
power on earth to forgive sins, then saith He to the sick of the palsy: Arise, take up thy bed,
and go unto thine house.”176 And in the same way in the case of the man who had been lying
for thirty-eight years near the edge of the pool, and hoping for a cure from the moving of
the water, He showed the princely character of His bounty unasked. For when in His wish
to arouse him for the saving remedy, He had said to him: “willest thou to be made whole,”
and when the man complained of his lack of human assistance and said: “I have no man to
put me into the pool when the water is troubled,” the Lord in His pity granted pardon to
his unbelief and ignorance, and restored him to his former health, not in the way which he
expected, but in the way which He Himself willed, saying: “Arise, take up thy bed and go
unto thine house.”177 And what wonder if these acts are told of the Lord’s power, when
Divine grace has actually wrought similar works by means of His servants! For when Peter

and John were entering the temple, when the man who was lame from his mother’s womb
and had no idea how to walk, asked an alms, they gave him not the miserable coppers which
the sick man asked for, but the power to walk, and when he was only expecting the smallest
of gifts to console him, enriched him with the prize of unlooked for health, as Peter said:
“Silver and gold have I none: but such as I have, give I unto thee. In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise up and walk.”178</p>

<head>Of the inscrutable providence of God.</head>
<p>By those instances then which we have brought forward from the gospel records we can
very clearly perceive that God brings salvation to mankind in diverse and innumerable
methods and inscrutable ways, and that He stirs up the course of some, who are already
wanting it, and thirsting for it, to greater zeal, while He forces some even against their will,
and resisting. And that at one time He gives his assistance for the fulfilment of those things
which he sees that we desire for our good, while at another time He puts into us the very
beginnings of holy desire, and grants both the commencement of a good work and persever-
ance in it. Hence it comes that in our prayers we proclaim God as not only our Protector
and Saviour, but actually as our Helper and Sponsor. For whereas He first calls us to Him,
and while we are still ignorant and unwilling, draws us towards salvation, He is our Protector
and Saviour, but whereas when we are already striving, He is wont to bring us help, and to
receive and defend those who fly to Him for refuge, He is termed our Sponsor and Refuge.
Finally the blessed Apostle when revolving in his mind this manifold bounty of God’s
providence, as he sees that he has fallen into some vast and boundless ocean of God’s
goodness, exclaims: “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
inscrutable are the judgments of God and His ways past finding out! For who hath known
the mind of the Lord?”179 Whoever then imagines that he can by human reason fathom the
depths of that inconceivable abyss, will be trying to explain away the astonishment at that
knowledge, at which that great and mighty teacher of the gentiles was awed. For if a man
thinks that he can either conceive in his mind or discuss exhaustively the dispensation of
God whereby He works salvation in men, he certainly impugns the truth of the Apostle’s
words and asserts with profane audacity that His judgments can be scrutinized, and His
ways searched out. This providence and love of God therefore, which the Lord in His unwearied
goodness vouchsafes to show us, He compares to the tenderest heart of a kind
mother, as He wishes to express it by a figure of human affection, and finds in His creatures
no such feeling of love, to which he could better compare it. And He uses this example, because
nothing dearer can be found in human nature, saying: “Can a mother forget her child,
that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?” But not content with this
comparison He at once goes beyond it, and subjoins these words: “And though she may
forget, yet will not I forget thee.”180</p>

<head>The decision of the fathers that free will is not equal to save a man.</head>
<p>And from this it is clearly gathered by those who, led not by chattering words but by
experience, measure the magnitude of grace, and the paltry limits of man’s will, that “the
race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, nor food to the wise, nor riches to the
prudent, nor grace to the learned,” but that “all these worketh that one and the selfsame
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.”181 And therefore it is proved by no
doubtful faith but by experience which can (so to speak) be laid hold of, that God the Father
of all things worketh indifferently all things in all, as the Apostle says, like some most kind
father and most benign physician; and that now He puts into us the very beginnings of salvation,
and gives to each the zeal of his free will; and now grants the carrying out of the
work, and the perfecting of goodness; and now saves men, even against their will and without
their knowledge, from ruin that is close at hand, and a headlong fall; and now affords them
occasions and opportunities of salvation, and wards off headlong and violent attacks from
purposes that would bring death; and assists some who are already willing and running,
while He draws others who are unwilling and resisting, and forces them to a good will. But
that, when we do not always resist or remain persistently unwilling, everything is granted
to us by God, and that the main share in our salvation is to be ascribed not to the merit of
our own works but to heavenly grace, we are thus taught by the words of the Lord Himself:
“And you shall remember your ways and all your wicked doings with which you have been
defiled; and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight for all your wicked
deeds which you have committed. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have
done well by you for My own name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according
to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel.”182 And therefore it is laid down by all the Catholic
fathers who have taught perfection of heart not by empty disputes of words, but in deed
and act, that the first stage in the Divine gift is for each man to be inflamed with the desire
of everything that is good, but in such a way that the choice of free will is open to either
side: and that the second stage in Divine grace is for the aforesaid practices of virtue to be
able to be performed, but in such a way that the possibilities of the will are not destroyed:
the third stage also belongs to the gifts of God, so that it may be held by the persistence of
the goodness already acquired, and in such a way that the liberty may not be surrendered
and experience bondage. For the God of all must be held to work in all, so as to incite, protect,
and strengthen, but not to take away the freedom of the will which He Himself has once

given. If however any more subtle inference of man’s argumentation and reasoning seems
opposed to this interpretation, it should be avoided rather than brought forward to the destruction
of the faith (for we gain not faith from understanding, but understanding from
faith, as it is written: “Except ye believe, ye will not understand”183) for how God works all
things in us and yet everything can be ascribed to free will, cannot be fully grasped by the
mind and reason of man.</p>

<head>XIV. THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT NESTEROS.</head>
<head>ON SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<pb n="1102"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>The words of Abbot Nesteros on the knowledge of the religious.</head>
<p>The order of our promise and course demands that there should follow the instruction
of Abbot Nesteros,184 a man of excellence in all points and of the greatest knowledge: who
when he had seen that we had committed some parts of Holy Scripture to memory and desired
to understand them, addressed us in these words. There are indeed many different
kinds of knowledge in this world, since there is as great a variety of them as there is of the
arts and sciences. But, while all are either utterly useless or only useful for the good of this
present life, there is yet none which has not its own system and method for learning it, by
which it can be grasped by those who seek it. If then those arts are guided by certain special
rules for their publication, how much more does the system and expression of our religion,
which tends to the contemplation of the secrets of invisible mysteries, and seeks no present
gain but the reward of an eternal recompense, depend on a fixed order and scheme. And
the knowledge of this is twofold: first, πρακτική, i.e., practical, which is brought about by
an improvement of morals and purification from faults: secondly, θεωρητική, which consists
in the contemplation of things Divine and the knowledge of most sacred thoughts.</p>
<note type="footnote">184 Nesteros. In the Vitæ Patrum there are some stories of one or two of this name (for it is not quite clear
whether they are distinct persons or one and the same to whom the stories refer). One was known as ὁ μέγας,
and was a friend of St. Antony, and is supposed by some to be the same whose Conferences Cassian here relates,
but nothing certain is known of him.</note>

<head>On grasping the knowledge of spiritual things.</head>
<p>Whoever then would arrive at this theoretical knowledge must first pursue practical
knowledge with all his might and main. For this practical knowledge can be acquired without
theoretical, but theoretical cannot possibly be gained without practical. For there are certain
stages, so distinct, and arranged in such a way that man’s humility may be able to mount
on high; and if these follow each other in turn in the order of which we have spoken, man
can attain to a height to which he could not fly, if the first step were wanting. In vain then
does one strive for the vision of God, who does not shun the stains of sins: “For the spirit
of God hates deception, and dwells not in a body subject to sins.”185</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How practical perfection depends on a double system.</head>
<p>But this practical perfection depends on a double system; for its first method is to know
the nature of all faults and the manner of their cure. Its second, to discover the order of the
virtues, and form our mind by their perfection so that it may be obedient to them, not as if
it were forced and subject to some fierce sway, but as if it delighted in its natural good, and
throve upon it, and mounted by that steep and narrow way with real pleasure. For in what
way will one, who has neither succeeded in understanding the nature of his own faults, nor
tried to eradicate them, be able to gain an understanding of virtues, which is the second
stage of practical training, or the mysteries of spiritual and heavenly things, which exist in
the higher stage of theoretical knowledge? For it will necessarily be maintained that he
cannot advance to more lofty heights who has not surmounted the lower ones, and much
less will he be able to grasp those things that are without, who has not succeeded in understanding
what is within his comprehension. But you should know that we must make an
effort with a twofold purpose in our exertion; both for the expulsion of vice, and for the attainment
of virtue. And this we do not gather from our own conjecture, but are taught by
the words of Him who alone knows the strength and method of His work: “Behold,” He
says: “I have set thee this day over the nations and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull
down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build and to plant.”186 He points out that for
getting rid of noxious things four things are requisite; viz., to root up, to pull down, to waste,
and to destroy: but for the performance of what is good, and the acquisition of what pertains
to righteousness only to build and to plant. Whence it is perfectly evident that it is a harder
thing to tear up and eradicate the inveterate passions of body and soul than to introduce
and plant spiritual virtues.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How practical life is distributed among many different professions and interests.</head>
<p>This practical life then, which as has been said rests on a double system, is distributed
among many different professions and interests. For some make it their whole purpose to
aim at the secrecy of an anchorite and purity of heart, as we know that in the past Elijah and
Elisha, and in our own day the blessed Antony and others who followed with the same object,
were joined most closely to God by the silence of solitude. Some have given all their efforts
and interests towards the system of the brethren and the watchful care of the Coenobium;
as we remember that recently Abbot John, who presided over a big monastery in the
neighbourhood of the city Thmuis,187 and some other men of like merits were eminent
with the signs of Apostles. Some are pleased with the kindly service of the guest house and
reception, by which in the past the patriarch Abraham and Lot pleased the Lord, and recently
the blessed Macarius,188 a man of singular courtesy and patience who presided over the
guest house at Alexandria in such a way as to be considered inferior to none of those who
aimed at the retirement of the desert. Some choose the care of the sick, others devote
themselves to intercession, which is offered up for the oppressed and afflicted, or give
themselves up to teaching, or give alms to the poor, and flourish among men of excellence
and renown, by reason of their love and goodness.</p>
<note type="footnote">187 It is doubtful whether this is the same John mentioned in the Institutes V. xxviii. and to whom the xixth
Conference is assigned. Thmuis is the coptic Thmoui, a little to the south of the Mendesian branch of the Nile.

<head>On perseverance in the line that has been chosen.</head>
<p>Wherefore it is good and profitable for each one to endeavour with all his might and
main to attain perfection in the work that has been begun, according to the line which he
has chosen as the grace which he has received; and while he praises and admires the virtues
of others, not to swerve from his own line which he has once for all chosen, as he knows
that, as the Apostle says, the body of the Church indeed is one, but the members many, and
that it has “gifts differing according to the grace which is given us, whether prophecy, according
to the proportion of the faith, whether ministry, in ministering, or he that teacheth,
in doctrine, or he that exhorteth in exhortation, he that giveth, in simplicity, he that ruleth,
with carefulness, he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.”189 For no members can claim
the offices of other members, because the eyes cannot perform the duties of the hands, nor
the nostrils of the ears. And so not all are Apostles, not all prophets, not all doctors, not all
have the gifts of healing, not all speak with tongues, not all interpret.190</p>

<head>How the weak are easily moved.</head>
<p>For those who are not yet settled in the line which they have taken up are often, when
they hear some praised for different interests and virtues, so excited by the praise of them
that they try forthwith to imitate their method: and in this human weakness is sure to expend
its efforts to no purpose. For it is an impossibility for one and the same man to excel at once
in all those good deeds which I enumerated above. And if anyone is anxious equally to affect
them all, he is quite sure to come to this; viz., that while he pursues them all, he will not
thoroughly succeed in any one, and will lose more than he will gain from this changing and
shifting about. For in many ways men advance towards God, and so each man should
complete that one which he has once fixed upon, never changing the course of his purpose,
so that he may be perfect in whatever line of life his may be.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>An instance of chastity which teaches us that all men should not be emulous of all things.</head>
<p>For apart from that loss, which we have said that a monk incurs who wants in lightmindedness
to pass from one pursuit to another, there is a risk of death that is hence incurred,
because at times things which are rightly done by some are wrongly taken by others as an
example, and things which turned out well for some, are found to be injurious to others.
For, to give an instance, it is as if one wished to imitate the good deed of that man, which
Abbot John is wont to bring forward, not for the sake of imitating him but simply out of
admiration for him; for one came to the aforesaid old man in a secular dress and when he
had brought him some of the first fruits of his crops, he found some one there possessed by
a most fierce devil. And this one though he scorned the adjurations and commands of Abbot
John, and vowed that he would never at his bidding leave the body which he had occupied,
yet was terrified at the coming of this other, and departed with a most humble utterance of
his name. And the old man marvelled not a little at his so evident grace and was the more
astonished at him because he saw that he had on a secular dress; and so began carefully to
ask of him the manner of his life and pursuit. And when he said that he was living in the
world and bound by the ties of marriage, the blessed John, considering in his mind the
greatness of his virtue and grace, searched out still more carefully what his manner of life
might be. He declared that he was a countryman, and that he sought his food by the daily
toil of his hands, and was not conscious of anything good about him except that he never
went forth to his work in the fields in the morning nor came home in the evening without
having returned thanks in Church for the food of his daily life, to God Who gave it; and
that he had never used any of his crops without having first offered to God their first fruits
and tithes; and that he had never driven his oxen over the bounds of another’s harvest
without having first muzzled them that his neighbour might not sustain the slightest loss
through his carelessness. And when these things did not seem to Abbot John sufficient to
procure such grace as that with which he saw that he was endowed, and he inquired of him
and investigated what it was which could be connected with the merits of such grace, he
was induced by respect for such anxious inquiries to confess that, when he wanted to be
professed as a monk, he had been compelled by force and his parents’ command, twelve
years before to take a wife, who, without any body to that day being aware of it, was kept
by him as a virgin in the place of a sister. And when the old man heard this, he was so
overcome with admiration that he announced publicly in his presence that it was not without
good reason that the devil who had scorned him himself, could not endure the presence of
this man, whose virtue he himself, not only in the ardour of youth, but even now, would
not dare to aim at without risk of his chastity. And though Abbot John would tell this story
with the utmost admiration, yet he never advised any monk to try this plan as he knew that

<pb n="1109"/>
many things which are rightly done by some involved others who imitate them in great
danger, and that that cannot be tried by all, which the Lord bestowed upon a few by a special
gift.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of spiritual knowledge.</head>
<p>But to return to the explanation of the knowledge from which our discourse took its
rise. Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is distributed among many subjects and
interests, but theoretical is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the
spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold grace of the
Church, added: “for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.”191 But of
spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,192 of which
we read as follows in Proverbs: “But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways
according to the largeness of your heart.”193 And so the history embraces the knowledge of
things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: “For it is written that
Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of
the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.” But
to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured
the form of some mystery: “For these,” says he, “are the two covenants, the one from Mount
Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia,
which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.” But
the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred
secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: “But Jerusalem which is
above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest
not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate
more than of her that hath an husband.”194 The tropological sense is the moral explanation
which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand
by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to
want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: “Praise the Lord, O
<note type="footnote">191 Prov. xxxi. 21 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">192 The meaning of the four senses of Scripture here spoken of; viz., the historical, tropological, allegorical,
and anagogical, is well summed up in these lines: Litera, gesta docet; quid credas, allegoria; Moralis, quid agas;
quo tendas anagogia. Or, as the lines are sometimes given: Litera scripta docet; quod credas, allegoria; Quod
speres, anagoge: quid agas, tropologia. Both Origen and Jerome had spoken of the threefold sense of scripture,
referring to the LXX. rendering of Proverbs xxii. 20 (which Cassian quotes below): but in general the Latin
Fathers, and the Schoolmen after them, separated the third of Origen’s senses; viz., the spiritual, into two, the
allegorical and the anagogical: and so the “fourfold” sense became the established method of interpretation in
the West.</note>
<note type="footnote">193 Prov. xxii. 20 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">194 Gal. iv. 22–27.</note>

<pb n="1111"/>
Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.”195 And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce,
if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four
senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as
the heavenly city of God “which is the mother of us all,” tropologically, as the soul of man,
which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four
kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: “But now, brethren, if I come
to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation
or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?”196 For “revelation” belongs to allegory
whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense
and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how “all our fathers were under
the cloud and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,” and how they “all
ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed
them. But the rock was Christ.”197 And this explanation where there is a comparison of the
figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense.
But the knowledge, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle, is tropological, as
by it we can by a careful study see of all things that have to do with practical discernment
whether they are useful and good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves
“whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered.”198 And this
system, as has been said, contains the moral meaning. So “prophecy” which the Apostle
puts in the third place, alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to
things future and invisible, as here: “But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning
those that sleep: that ye be not sorry as others also who have no hope. For if we believe
that Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which are alive at the coming of
the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in Christ, for the Lord Himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and
the dead in Christ shall rise first.”199 In which kind of exhortation the figure of anagoge is
brought forward. But “doctrine” unfolds the simple course of historical exposition, under
which is contained no more secret sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in this
passage: “For I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ died for
our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again on the
third day, and that he was seen of Cephas;”200 and: “God sent His Son, made of a woman,

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>How from practical knowledge we must proceed to spiritual.</head>
<p>Wherefore if you are anxious to attain to the light of spiritual knowledge, not wrongly
for an idle boast but for the sake of being made better men, you are first inflamed with the
longing for that blessedness, of which we read: “blessed are the pure in heart for they shall
see God,”203 that you may also attain to that of which the angel said to Daniel: “But they
that are learned shall shine as the splendor of the firmament: and they that turn many to
righteousness as the stars for ever and ever;” and in another prophet: “Enlighten yourselves
with the light of knowledge while there is time.”204 And so keeping up that diligence in
reading, which I see that you have, endeavour with all eagerness to gain in the first place a
thorough grasp of practical, i.e., ethical knowledge. For without this that theoretical purity
of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only, who are perfected not by
the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after
much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge
not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the
Psalmist: “From Thy commandments I have understanding;” and having overcome all their
passions, they say with confidence: “I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.”205
For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm,
understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart
a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid
yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up
even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an
author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore
in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather
to be careful about what I am going to say—that you may enjoin absolute silence on your
lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed
by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations
and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently
to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them.
For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of
spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the
conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which
it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory,
<note type="footnote">203 S. Matt. v. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">204 Dan. xii. 3; Hos. x. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">205 Ps. cxviii. (cxix.) 104; c. (ci.) 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="1114"/>
pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess.
For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of
gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is
bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially
to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his encounter with practical and ethical knowledge,
he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all
things “swift to hear, but slow to speak,”206 lest there come upon you that which is noted
by Solomon: “If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a
fool than of him;”207 and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not
already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to
keep to this order, as of Him it is said: “what Jesus began to do and to teach.”208 Take care
then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number
of those of whom the Lord speaks in the gospel to the disciples: “What they say unto you,
that observe and do, but not after their words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy
burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves
will not move them with one of their fingers.”209 For if he who shall “break one of these
commands, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,”210 it
follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men
so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the
punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example
of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because
they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess
spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character.
For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate
into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul
on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man’s, nor
condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy

<head>How to embrace the system of true knowledge.</head>
<p>You must then, if you want to get at the true knowledge of the Scriptures, endeavour
first to secure steadfast humility of heart, to carry you on by the perfection of love not to
the knowledge which puffeth up, but to that which enlightens. For it is an impossibility for
an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual knowledge. And therefore with every possible
care avoid this, lest through your zeal for reading there arise in you not the light of knowledge
nor the lasting glory which is promised through the light that comes from learning but only
the instruments of your destruction from vain arrogance. Next you must by all means strive
to get rid of all anxiety and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or rather
continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills your heart, and fashions
you so to speak after its own likeness, making of it, in a way, an ark of the testimony,211
which has within it two tables of stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments;212
and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and undefiled memory which preserves by a constant tenacity
the manna stored up in it, i.e., the enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual sense
and the bread of angels; moreover also the rod of Aaron, i.e., the saving standard of Jesus
Christ our true High Priest, that ever buds with the freshness of immortal memory. For this
is the rod which after it had been cut from the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with
a more vigorous life. But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the fulness of historical
and spiritual knowledge. For the Cherubim mean a multitude of knowledge: and these
continually protect the mercy seat of God, i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it
from all the assaults of spiritual wickedness. And so your soul will be carried forward not
only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the priestly kingdom, and owing to its
unbroken love of purity being as it were engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command
given to the priests, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: “And he shall not go forth
from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of God,”213 i.e., his heart, in which the
Lord promised that he would ever dwell, saying: “I will dwell in them and will walk among
them.”214 Wherefore the whole series of the Holy Scriptures should be diligently committed
to memory and ceaselessly repeated. For this continual meditation will bring us a twofold
fruit: first, that while the attention of the mind is taken up in reading and preparing the

lessons it cannot possibly be taken captive in any snares of bad thoughts: next that those
things which were conned over and frequently repeated and which while we were trying to
commit them to memory we could not understand as the mind was at that time taken up,
we can afterward see more clearly, when we are free from the distraction of all acts and visions,
and especially when we reflect on them in silence in our meditation by night. So that
when we are at rest, and as it were plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the
understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours we had not the
remotest conception.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="1117"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the manifold meaning of the Holy Scriptures.</head>
<p>But as the renewal of our soul grows by means of this study, Scripture also will begin
to put on a new face, and the beauty of the holier meanings will somehow grow with our
growth. For their form is adapted to the capacity of man’s understanding, and will appear
earthly to carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so that those to whom it formerly appeared
to be involved in thick clouds, cannot apprehend its subtleties nor endure its light.
But to make this which we are aiming at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be enough
to produce a single passage of the law, by which we can prove that all the heavenly commands
as well are applied to men in accordance with the measure of our state. For it is written in
the law: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”215 This is rightly observed according to the
simple meaning of the letter, by a man who is still in bondage to foul passions. But by one
who has already forsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in the
spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of idols but also all heathen superstitions
and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs and days and times, or at any rate
that he be not entangled in the conjectures of words and names which destroy the simplicity
of our faith. For by fornication of this kind we read that Jerusalem was defiled, as she committed
adultery “on every high hill and under every green tree,”216 whom also the Lord rebuked
by the prophet, saying: “Let now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed
at the stars and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things that shall
come to thee,”217 of which fornication elsewhere also the Lord says in rebuking them: “The
spirit of fornication deceived them, and they went a whoring from their God.”218 But one
who has forsaken both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to avoid, which is
contained in the superstitions of the law and of Judaism; of which the Apostle says: “Ye
observe days and months and times and years;” and again: Touch not, taste not, handle
not.”219 And there is no doubt that this is said of the superstitions of the law, into which
one who has fallen has certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy to hear this
from the Apostle: “For I have espoused you to one husband, to exhibit you as a chaste virgin
to Christ.”220 But this that follows will be directed to him by the words of the same Apostle:
“But I am afraid lest as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your minds should be

<pb n="1118"/>
corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus.”221 But if one has escaped
the uncleanness even of this fornication there will still be a fourth, which is committed by
adulterous intercourse with heretical teaching. Of which too the blessed Apostle speaks: “I
know that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the
flock, and of yourselves also shall arise men speaking perverse things so as to lead astray the
disciples after them.”222 But if a man has succeeded in avoiding even this, let him beware
lest he fall by a more subtle sin into the guilt of fornication. I mean that which consists in
wandering thoughts, because every thought which is not only shameful but even idle, and
departing in however small a degree from God is regarded by the perfect man as the foulest
fornication.</p>

<head>A question how we can attain to forgetfulness of the cares of this world.</head>
<p>Upon this I was at first moved by a secret emotion, and then groaned deeply and said,
All these things which you have set forth so fully have affected me with still greater despair
than that which I had previously endured: as besides those general captivities of the soul
whereby I doubt not that weak people are smitten from without, a special hindrance to salvation
is added by that knowledge of literature which I seem already to have in some slight
measure attained, in which the efforts of my tutor, or my attention to continual reading
have so weakened me that now my mind is filled with those songs of the poets so that even
at the hour of prayer it is thinking about those trifling fables, and the stories of battles with
which from its earliest infancy it was stored by its childish lessons: and when singing Psalms
or asking forgiveness of sins either some wanton recollection of the poems intrudes itself
or the images of heroes fighting presents itself before the eyes, and an imagination of such
phantoms is always tricking me and does not suffer my soul to aspire to an insight into
things above, so that this cannot be got rid of by my daily lamentations.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="1120"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Of the method by which we can remove the dross from our memory.</head>
<p>Nesteros: From this very fact, from which there springs up for you the utmost despair
of your purification, a speedy and effectual remedy may arise if only you will transfer to the
reading of and meditation upon the writings of the Spirit, the same diligence and earnestness
which you say that you showed in those secular studies of yours. For your mind is sure to
be taken up with those poems until it is gaining with the same zeal and assiduity other
matters for it to reflect upon, and is in labour with spiritual and divine things instead of
unprofitable earthly ones. But when these are thoroughly and entirely conceived and it has
been nourished upon them, then by degrees the former thoughts can be expelled and utterly
got rid of. For the mind of man cannot be emptied of all thoughts, and so as long as it is not
taken up with spiritual interests, is sure to be occupied with what it learnt long since. For
as long as it has nothing to recur to and exercise itself upon unweariedly, it is sure to fall
back upon what it learnt in childhood, and ever to think about what it took in by long use
and meditation. In order then that this spiritual knowledge may be strengthened in you
with a lasting steadfastness, and that you may not enjoy it only for a time like those who
just touch it not by their own exertions but at the recital of another, and if I may use the
expression, perceive its scent in the air; but that it may be laid up in your heart, and deeply
noted in it, and thoroughly seen and handled, it is well for you to use the utmost care in securing
that, even if perhaps you hear things that you know very well produced in the Conference,
you do not regard them in a scornful and disdainful way because you already know
them, but that you lay them to your heart with the same eagerness, with which the words
of salvation which we are longing for ought to be constantly poured into our ears or should
ever proceed from our lips. For although the narration of holy things be often repeated, yet
in a mind that feels a thirst for true knowledge the satiety will never create disgust, but as it
receives it every day as if it were something new and what it wanted however often it may
have taken it in, it will so much the more eagerly either hear or speak, and from the repetition
of these things will gain confirmation of the knowledge it already possesses, rather than
weariness of any sort from the frequent Conference. For it is a sure sign of a mind that is
cold and proud, if it receives with disdain and carelessness the medicine of the words of
salvation, although it be offered with the zeal of excessive persistence. For “a soul that is full
jeers at honeycomb: but to a soul that is in want even little things appear sweet.”223 And so
if these things have been carefully taken in and stored up in the recesses of the soul and
stamped with the seal of silence, afterwards like some sweet scented wine that maketh glad
the heart of man, they will, when mellowed by the antiquity of the thoughts and by long-
<note type="footnote">223 Prov. xxvii. 7.</note>

<pb n="1121"/>
standing patience, be brought forth from the jar of your heart with great fragrance, and like
some perennial fountain will flow abundantly from the veins of experience and irrigating
channels of virtue and will pour forth copious streams as if from some deep well in your
heart. For that will happen in your case, which is spoken in Proverbs to one who has achieved
this in his work: “Drink waters from your own cisterns and from the fount of your own
wells. Let waters from your own fountain flow in abundance for you, but let your waters
pass through into your streets.”224 And according to the prophet Isaiah: “Thou shalt be like
a watered garden, and like a fountain of water whose waters shall not fail. And the places
that have been desolate for ages shall be built in thee; thou shalt raise up the foundations of
generation and generation; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the fences, turning the
paths into rest.”225 And that blessedness shall come upon thee which the same prophet
promises: “And the Lord will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and
thine eyes shall see thy teacher. And thine ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee
behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it, and go not aside either to the right hand or
to the left.”226 And so it will come to pass that not only every purpose and thought of your
heart, but also all the wanderings and rovings of your imagination will become to you a holy
and unceasing pondering of the Divine law.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How an unclean soul can neither give nor receive spiritual knowledge.</head>
<p>But it is, as we have already said, impossible for a novice either to understand or to teach
this. For if one is incapable of receiving it how can he be fit to pass it on to another? But if
he has had the audacity to teach anything on these matters, most certainly his words will
be idle and useless and only reach the ears of his hearers, without being able to touch their
hearts, uttered as they were in sheer idleness and unfruitful vanity, for they do not proceed
from the treasure of a good conscience, but from the empty impertinence of boastfulness.
For it is impossible for an impure soul (however earnestly it may devote itself to reading)
to obtain spiritual knowledge. For no one pours any rich ointment or fine honey or any
precious liquid into a dirty and stinking vessel. For a jar that has once been filled with foul
odours spoils the sweetest myrrh more readily than it receives any sweetness or grace from
it, for what is pure is corrupted much more quickly than what is corrupt is purified. And
so the vessel of our bosom unless it has first been purified from all the foul stains of sin will
not be worthy to receive that blessed ointment of which it is said by the prophet: “Like the
ointment upon the head, which ran down upon the beard of Aaron, which ran down upon
the edge of his garment,”227 nor will it keep undefiled that spiritual knowledge and the
words of Scripture which are “sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.”228 “For what share
hath righteousness with iniquity? or what agreement hath light with darkness? or what
concord has Christ with Belial?”229</p>

<head>An objection owing to the fact that many impure persons have knowledge while saints have
not.</head>
<p>Germanus: This assertion does not seem to us founded on truth, or based on solid
reasoning. For if it is clear that all who either never receive the faith of Christ at all or who
corrupt it by the wicked sin of heresy, are of unclean hearts, how is it that many Jews and
heretics, and Catholics also who are entangled in various sins, have acquired perfect knowledge
of the Scriptures and boast of the greatness of their spiritual learning, and on the
other hand countless swarms of saintly men, whose heart has been purified from all stain
of sin, are content with the piety of simple faith and know nothing of the mysteries of a
deeper knowledge? How then will that opinion stand, which attributes spiritual knowledge
solely to purity of heart?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1124"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>The answer to the effect that bad men cannot possess true knowledge.</head>
<p>Nesteros: One who does not carefully weigh every word of the opinions uttered cannot
rightly discover the value of the assertion. For we said to begin with that men of this sort
only possess skill in disputation and ornaments of speech; but cannot penetrate to the very
heart of Scripture and the mysteries of its spiritual meanings. For true knowledge is only
acquired by true worshippers of God; and certainly this people does not possess it to whom
it is said: “Hear, O, foolish people, thou who hast no heart: ye who having eyes see not, and
having ears, hear not.” And again: “Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I also will reject
thee from acting as My priest.”230 For as it is said that in Christ “all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge are hid,”231 how can we hold that he who has scorned to find Christ, or,
when He is found blasphemes Him with impious lips, or at least defiles the Catholic faith
by his impure deeds, has acquired spiritual knowledge? “For the Spirit of God will avoid
deception, and dwelleth not in a body that is subject to sin.”232 There is then no way of arriving
at spiritual knowledge but this which one of the prophets has finely described: “Sow
to yourselves for righteousness: reap the hope of life. Enlighten yourselves with the light of
knowledge.”233 First then we must sow for righteousness, i.e., by works of righteousness we
must extend practical perfection; next we must reap the hope of life, i.e., by the expulsion
of carnal sins must gather the fruits of spiritual virtues: and so we shall succeed in enlightening
ourselves with the light of knowledge. And the Psalmist also sees that this system
ought to be followed, when he says: “Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way: who
walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that seek His testimonies.”234 For he does not
say in the first place: “Blessed are they that seek His testimonies, and afterwards add: Blessed
are they that are undefiled in the way;” but he begins by saying: “Blessed are they that are
undefiled in the way;” and by this clearly shows that no one can properly come to seek God’s
testimonies unless he first walks undefiled in the way of Christ by his practical life. Those
therefore whom you mentioned do not possess that knowledge which the impure cannot
attain, but ψευδώνυμον , i.e., what is falsely so called, of which the blessed Apostle speaks:
“O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thee, avoiding profane novelties of words,
and oppositions of the knowledge that is falsely so called;”235 which is in the Greek τάς

ἀντιθέσεις τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως. Of those then who seem to acquire some show of
knowledge or of those who while they devote themselves diligently to reading the sacred
volume and to committing the Scriptures to memory, yet forsake not carnal sins, it is well
said in Proverbs: “Like as a golden ring in a swine’s snout so is the beauty of an evil-disposed
woman.”236 For what does it profit a man to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and
the most precious beauty of the Scriptures if by clinging to filthy deeds and thoughts he
destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground, or defiles it by the dirty wallowing of his own
lusts? For the result will be that which is an ornament to those who rightly use it, is not only
unable to adorn them, but actually becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud. For “from
the mouth of a sinner praise is not comely;”237 as to him it is said by the prophet: “Wherefore
dost thou declare My righteous acts, and takest My covenant in thy lips?”238 of souls like
this, who never possess in any lasting fashion the fear of the Lord of which it is said: “the
fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom,”239 and yet try to get at the meaning of Scripture
by continual meditation on them, it is appropriately asked in Proverbs: “What use are riches
to a fool? For a senseless man cannot possess wisdom.”240 But so far is this true and spiritual
knowledge removed from that worldly erudition, which is defiled by the stains of carnal
sins, that we know that it has sometimes flourished most grandly in some who were without
eloquence and almost illiterate. And this is very clearly shown by the case of the Apostles
and many holy men, who did not spread themselves out with an empty show of leaves, but
were bowed down by the weight of the true fruits of spiritual knowledge: of whom it is
written in the Acts of the Apostles: “But when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men, they were astonished.”241 And
therefore if you are anxious to attain to that never-failing fragrance, you must first strive
with all your might to obtain from the Lord the purity of chastity. For no one, in whom the
love of carnal passions and especially of fornication still holds sway, can acquire spiritual
knowledge. For “in a good heart wisdom will rest;” and: “He that feareth the Lord shall find
knowledge with righteousness.”242 But that we must attain to spiritual knowledge in the
order of which we have already spoken, we are taught also by the blessed Apostle. For when
he wanted not merely to draw up a list of all his own virtues, but rather to describe their
order, that he might explain which follows what, and which gives birth to what, after some

others he proceeds as follows: “In watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, in long
suffering, in gentleness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned.”243 And by this enumeration
of virtues he evidently meant to teach us that we must come from watchings and fastings
to chastity, from chastity to knowledge, from knowledge to long suffering, from long suffering
to gentleness, from gentleness to the Holy Ghost, from the Holy Ghost to the rewards of
love unfeigned. When then by this system and in this order you too have come to spiritual
knowledge, you will certainly have, as we said, not barren or idle learning but what is vigorous
and fruitful; and the seed of the word of salvation which has been committed by you to the
hearts of your hearers, will be watered by the plentiful showers of the Holy Ghost that will
follow; and, according to this that the prophet promised, “the rain will be given to your seed,
wherever you shall sow in the land, and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most
plentiful and fat.”244</p>

<head>To whom the method of perfection should be laid open.</head>
<p>Take care too, when your riper age leads you to teach, lest you be led astray by the love
of vainglory, and teach at random to the most impure persons these things which you have
learnt not so much by reading as by the effects of experience, and so incur what Solomon,
that wisest of men, denounced: “Attach not a wicked man to the pastures of the just, and
be not led astray by the fulness of the belly,” for “delicacies are not good for a fool, nor is
there room for wisdom where sense is wanting: for folly is the more led on, because a stubborn
servant is not improved by words, for even though he understands, he will not obey.”
And “Do not say anything in the ears of an imprudent man, lest haply he mock at thy wise
speeches.”245 And “give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
swine, lest haply they trample them under foot and turn again and rend you.”246 It is right
then to hide the mysteries of spiritual meanings from men of this sort, that you may effectually
sing: “Thy words have I hid within my heart: that I should not sin against Thee.”247
But you will perhaps say: And to whom are the mysteries of Holy Scripture to be dispensed?
Solomon, the wisest of men, shall teach you: “Give, says he, strong drink to those who are
in sorrow, and give wine to drink, to those who are in pain, that they may forget their poverty,
and remember their pain no more,”248 i.e., to those who in consequence of the punishment
of their past actions are oppressed with grief and sorrow, supply richly the joys of spiritual
knowledge like “wine that maketh glad the heart of man,”249 and restore them with the
strong drink of the word of salvation, lest haply they be plunged in continual sorrow and a
despair that brings death, and so those who are of this sort be “swallowed up in overmuch
sorrow.”250 But of those who remain in coldness and carelessness, and are smitten by no
sorrow of heart we read as follows: “For one who is kindly and without sorrow, shall be in
want.”251 With all possible care therefore avoid being puffed up with the love of vainglory,
and so failing to become a partaker with him whom the prophet praises, “who hath not
given his money upon usury.”252 For every one who, from love of the praise of men dispenses

<head>Of the reasons for which spiritual learning is unfruitful.</head>
<p>But it is certain that for two reasons the teaching of spiritual things is ineffectual. For
either the teacher is commending what he has no experience of, and is trying with emptysounding
words to instruct his hearer, or else the hearer is a bad man and full of faults and
cannot receive in his hard heart the holy and saving doctrine of the spiritual man; and of
these it is said by the prophet: “For the heart of this people is blinded, and their ears are dull
of hearing and their eyes have they closed: lest at any time they should see with their eyes
and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and be converted and I should
heal them.”255</p>

learnt from the tradition of the Elders is a threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of
healing, when the grace of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous men on account
of the merits of their holiness, as it is clear that the apostles and many of the saints wrought
signs and wonders in accordance with the authority of the Lord Who says: “Heal the sick,
raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”257 The
second when for the edification of the church or on account of the faith of those who bring
their sick, or of those who are to be cured, the virtue of health proceeds even from sinners
and men unworthy of it. Of whom the Saviour says in the gospel: “Many shall say to Me in
that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils,
and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then I will confess to them, I never knew
you: Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.”258 And on the other hand, if the faith of those
who bring them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those on whom the gifts of healing are
conferred from exercising their powers of healing. On which subject Luke the Evangelist
says: “And Jesus could not there do any mighty work because of their unbelief.”259 Whence
also the Lord Himself says: “Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet,
and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.”260 The third method of healing is
copied by the deceit and contrivance of devils, that, when a man who is enslaved to evident
sins is out of admiration for his miracles regarded as a saint and a servant of God, men may
be persuaded to copy his sins and thus an opening being made for cavilling, the sanctity of
religion may be brought into disgrace, or else that he, who believes that he possesses the gift
of healing, may be puffed up by pride of heart and so fall more grievously. Hence it is that
invoking the names of those, who, as they know, have no merits of holiness or any spiritual
fruits, they pretend that by their merits they are disturbed and made to flee from the bodies
they have possessed. Of which it says in Deuteronomy: “If there rise up in the midst of thee
a prophet, or one who says that he has seen a dream, and declare a sign and a wonder, and
that which he hath spoken cometh to pass, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow after

other gods whom thou knowest not, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hear the words
of that prophet or of that dreamer, for the Lord thy God is tempting thee that it may appear
whether thou lovest Him or not, with all thy heart and with all thy soul.”261 And in the
gospel it says: “There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs
and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should be led astray.”262</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Wherein one ought to admire the saints.</head>
<p>Wherefore we never ought to admire those who affect these things, for these powers,
but rather to look whether they are perfect in driving out all sins, and amending their ways,
for this is granted to each man not for the faith of some other, or for a variety of reasons,
but for his own earnestness, by the action of God’s grace. For this is practical knowledge
which is termed by another name by the Apostle; viz., love, and is by the authority of the
Apostle preferred to all tongues of men and of angels, and to full assurance of faith which
can even remove mountains, and to all knowledge, and prophecy, and to the distribution
of all one’s goods, and finally to the glory of martyrdom itself. For when he had enumerated
all kinds of gifts and had said: “To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another
the word of knowledge, to another faith, to another the gift of healing, to another the
working of miracles, etc.:”263 when he was going to speak about love notice how in a few
words he put it before all gifts: “And yet,” he says, “I show unto you a still more excellent
way.”264 By which it is clearly shown that the height of perfection and blessedness does not
consist in the performance of those wonderful works but in the purity of love. And this not
without good reason. For all those things are to pass away and be destroyed, but love is to
abide for ever. And so we have never found that those works and signs were affected by our
fathers: nay, rather when they did possess them by the grace of the Holy Spirit they would
never use them, unless perhaps extreme and unavoidable necessity drove them to do so.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of a dead man raised to life by Abbot Macarius.</head>
<p>As also we remember that a dead man was raised to life by Abbot Macarius who was
the first to find a home in the desert of Scete.265 For when a certain heretic who followed
the error of Eunomius was trying by dialectic subtlety to destroy the simplicity of the
Catholic faith, and had already deceived a large number of men, the blessed Macarius was
asked by some Catholics, who were terribly disturbed by the horror of such an upset, to set
free the simple folk of all Egypt from the peril of infidelity, and came for this purpose. And
when the heretic had approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag him away
in his ignorance to the thorns of Aristotle, the blessed Macarius put a stop to his chatter
with apostolic brevity, saying: “the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.”266 Let us
go therefore to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord over the first dead man
we find, and let us, as it is written, “show our faith by our works,”267 that by His testimony
the manifest proofs of a right faith may be shown, and we may prove the clear truth not by
an empty discussion of words but by the power of miracles and that judgment which cannot
be deceived. And when he heard this the heretic was overwhelmed with shame before the
people who were present, and pretended for the moment that he consented to the terms
proposed, and promised that he would come on the morrow, but the next day when they
were all in expectation who had come together with greater eagerness to the appointed place,
owing to their desire for the spectacle, he was terrified by the consciousness of his want of
faith, and fled away, and at once escaped out of all Egypt. And when the blessed Macarius
had waited together with the people till the ninth hour, and saw that he had owing to his
guilty conscience avoided him, he took the people, who had been perverted by him and
went to the tombs determined upon. Now in Egypt the overflow of the river Nile has introduced
this custom that, since the whole breadth of that country is covered for no small part
of the year by the regular flood of waters like a great sea so that there is no means of getting
about except by a passage in boats, the bodies of the dead are embalmed and stored away
in cells an good height up. For the soil of that land being damp from the continual moisture
prevents them from burying them. For if it receives any bodies buried in it, it is forced by
the excessive inundations to cast them forth on its surface. When then the blessed Macarius
had taken up his position by a most ancient corpse, he said “O man, if that heretic and son

is also given by Rufinus, History of the Monks, c. xxviii.; as well as Sozomen, H.E. III. xiv., and by both of these
writers is expressly ascribed to the Egyptian Macarius.</note>

of perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was standing by, I had exclaimed and
invoked the name of Christ my God, say in the presence of these who were almost perverted
by his fraud, whether you would have arisen.” Then he arose and replied with words of assent.
And then Abbot Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he enjoyed life here,
or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then known the name of Christ, and he
replied that he had lived under kings of most ancient date, and declared that in those days
he had never heard the name of Christ. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: “Sleep,” said
he, “in peace with the others in your own order, to be roused again by Christ in the end.”
All this power then and grace of his which was in him would perhaps have always been
hidden, unless the needs of the whole province which was endangered, and his entire devotion
to Christ, and unfeigned love, had forced him to perform this miracle. And certainly it was
not the ostentation of glory but the love of Christ and the good of all the people that wrung
from him the performance of it. As the passage in the book of Kings shows us that the blessed
Elijah also did, who asked that fire might descend from heaven on the sacrifices laid on the
pyre, for this reason that he might set free the faith of the whole people which was endangered
by the tricks of the false prophets.</p>

with tears and prayers by a woman who brought her little child, already pining away and
half dead from lack of milk; he gave her a cup of water to drink signed with the sign of the

<p>Or when the same man as he went to a village was surrounded by mocking crowds, who

walking from a contracted knee, and crawled from a weakness of long standing, they
tempted him and said, “Show us, father Abraham, if you are the servant of God, and restore
this man to his former health, that we may believe that the name of Christ, whom you
worship, is not vain.” Then he at once invoked the name of Christ, and stooped down and
laid hold of the man’s withered foot and pulled it. And immediately at his touch the dried
and bent knee was straightened, and he got back the use of his legs, which he had forgotten
how to use in his long years of weakness, and went away rejoicing.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>How the merits of each man should not be judged by his miracles.</head>
<p>And so these men gave no credit to themselves for their power of working such wonders,
because they confessed that they were done not by their own merits but by the compassion
of the Lord and with the words of the Apostle they refused the human honour offered out
of admiration for their miracles: “Men and brethren, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye
on us as though by our own power or holiness we had caused this man to walk.”270 Nor did
they think that any one should be renowned for the gifts and marvels of God, but rather for
the fruits of his own good deeds, which are brought about by the efforts of his mind and
the power of his works. For often, as was said above, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
the truth, both cast out devils and perform the greatest miracles in the name of the
Lord. Of whom when the Apostles complained and said: “Master, we saw one casting out
devils in Thy name, and we forbade him because he followeth not with us,” though for the
present Christ replied to them “Forbid him not, for he that is not against you is for you,”271
still when they say at the end: “Lord, Lord, have we not in Thy name prophesied, and in
Thy name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works?” He testifies that
then He will answer: “I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.”272 And
therefore He actually warns those, to whom He Himself has given this glory of miracles and
mighty works because of their holiness, that they be not puffed up by them, saying: “Rejoice
not because the devils are subject to you, but rejoice rather because your names are written
in heaven.”273</p>

<pb n="1140"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How the excellence of gifts consists not in miracles but in humility.</head>
<p>Finally the Author Himself of all miracles and mighty works, when He called His disciples
to learn His teaching, clearly showed what those true and specially chosen followers ought
chiefly to learn from Him, saying: “Come and learn of Me,” not chiefly to cast out devils by
the power of heaven, not to cleanse the lepers, not to give sight to the blind, not to raise the
dead: for even though I do these things by some of My servants, yet man’s estate cannot
insert itself into the praises of God, nor can a minister and servant gather hereby any portion
for himself there where is the glory of Deity alone. But do ye, says He, learn this of Me, “for
I am meek and lowly of heart.”274 For this it is which it is possible for all men generally to
learn and practise, but the working of miracles and signs is not always necessary, nor good
for all, nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all virtues, it is the surest
foundation of the heavenly building, it is the special and splendid gift of the Saviour. For
he can perform all the miracles which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up,
who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His miracles, but in the virtues of patience
and humility. But he who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing,
or showing some wonderful miracle to the people, even though when he is showing off he
invokes the name of Christ, yet he is far from Christ, because in his pride of heart he does
not follow his humble Teacher. For when He was returning to the Father, He prepared, so
to speak, His will and left this to His disciples: “A new commandment,” said He, “give I
unto you that ye love one another; as I have loved you, so do ye also love one another:” and
at once He subjoined: “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love
to one another.”275 He says not: “if ye do signs and miracles in the same way,” but “if ye
have love to one another;” and this it is certain that none but the meek and humble can
keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good monks or free from the
fault of vainglory, who professed themselves exorcists among men, and proclaimed with
boastful ostentation among admiring crowds the grace which they had either obtained or
which they claimed. But in vain, for “he who trusteth in lies feedeth the winds: and the same
runneth after birds that fly away.”276 For without doubt that will happen to them which we
find in Proverbs: “As the winds and clouds and rain are very clear so are these who boast
of a fictitious gift.”277 And so if any one does any of these things in our presence, he ought
to meet with commendation from us not from admiration of his miracles, but from the

<head>How it is more wonderful to have cast out one’s faults from one’s self than devils from another.</head>
<p>And in truth it is a greater miracle to root out from one’s own flesh the incentives to
wantonness than to cast out unclean spirits from the bodies of others, and it is a grander
sign to restrain the fierce passions of anger by the virtue of patience than to command the
powers of the air, and it is a greater thing to have shut out the devouring pangs of gloominess
from one’s own heart than to have expelled the sickness of another and the fever of his body.
Finally it is in many ways a grander virtue and a more splendid achievement to cure the
weaknesses’ of one’s own soul than those of the body of another. For just as the soul is
higher than the flesh, so is its salvation of more importance, and as its nature is more precious
and excellent, so is its destruction more grievous and dangerous.</p>

subject to you.”278 For this was wrought not by their own power, but by the might of the
name invoked. And therefore they are warned not to presume to claim for themselves any
blessedness or glory on this account as it was done simply by the power and might of God,
but only on account of the inward purity of their life and heart, for which it was vouchsafed
to them to have their names written in heaven.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>A revelation on the trial of perfect chastity.</head>
<p>And to prove this that we have said both by the testimony of the ancients and divine
oracles, we had better bring forward in his own words and experience what the blessed
Paphnutius279 felt on the subject of admiration of miracles and the grace of purity, or rather
what he learnt from the revelation of an angel. For this man had been famous for many
years for his signal strictness so that he fancied that he was completely free from the snares
of carnal concupiscence because he felt himself superior to all the attacks of the demons
with whom he had fought openly and for a long while; and when some holy men had come
to him, he was preparing for them a porridge of lentiles which they call Athera,280 and his
hand, as it happened, was burnt in the oven, by a flame that darted up. And when this
happened he was much mortified and began silently to consider with himself, and ask why
was not the fire at peace with me, when my more serious contests with demons have ceased?
or how will that unquenchable fire which searches out the deserts of all pass me by in that
dread day of judgment, and fail to detain me, if this trivial temporal fire from without has
not spared me? And as he was troubled by thoughts of this kind and vexation a sudden sleep
overcame him and an angel of the Lord came to him and said: “Paphnutius, why are you
vexed because that earthly fire is not yet at peace with you, while there still remains in your
members some disturbance of carnal motions that is not completely removed? For as long
as the roots of this flourish within you, they will not suffer that material fire to be at peace
with you. And certainly you could not feel it harmless unless you found by such proofs as
these that all these internal motions within you were destroyed. Go, take a naked and most
beautiful virgin, and if while you hold her you find that the peace of your heart remains
steadfast, and that carnal heat is still and quiet within you, then the touch of this visible
flame also shall pass over you gently and without harming you as it did over the three children
in Babylon.” And so the Elder was impressed by this revelation and did not try the dangers
of the experiment divinely shown to him, but asked his own conscience and examined the
purity of his heart; and, guessing that the weight of purity was not yet sufficient to outweigh
the force of this trial, it is no wonder, said he, if when the battles with unclean spirits come
upon me, I still feel the flames of the fire, which I used to think of less importance than the
savage attacks of demons, still raging against me. Since it is a greater virtue and a grander
grace to extinguish the inward lust of the flesh than by the sign of the Lord281 and the power

of the might of the Most High to subdue the wicked demons which rush upon one from
without, or to drive them by invoking the Divine name from the bodies which they have
possessed. So far Abbot Nesteros, finishing the account of the true working of the gifts of
grace accompanied us to the cell of the Elder Joseph which was nearly six miles distant from
his, as we were eager for instruction in his doctrine.</p>

<head>XVI. THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH.
ON FRIENDSHIP.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1147"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>What Abbot Joseph asked us in the first instance.</head>
<p>The blessed Joseph,282 whose instructions and precepts are now to be set forth, and
who was one of the three whom we mentioned in the first Conference,283 belonged to a
most illustrious family, and was the chief man of his city in Egypt, which was named
Thmuis,284 and so was carefully trained in the eloquence of Greece as well as Egypt, so that
he could talk admirably with us or with those who were utterly ignorant of Egyptian, not
as the others did through an interpreter, but in his own person. And when he found that
we were anxious for instruction from him, he first inquired whether we were own brothers,
and when he heard that we were united in a tie of spiritual and not carnal brotherhood, and
that from the first commencement of our renunciation of the world we had always been
joined together in an unbroken bond as well in our travels, which we had both undertaken
for the sake of spiritual service, as also in the pursuits of the monastery, he began his discourse
as follows.</p>
<note type="footnote">282 Nothing further appears to be known of this Joseph than what Cassian here states.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1148"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Discourse of the same elder on the untrustworthy sort of friendship.</head>
<p>There are many kinds of friendship and companionship which unite men in very different
ways in the bonds of love. For some a previous recommendation makes to enter upon an
intercourse first of acquaintance and afterwards even of friendship. In the case of others
some bargain or an agreement to give and take something has joined them in the bonds of
love. Others a similarity and union of business or science or art or study has united in the
chain of friendship, by which even fierce souls become kindly disposed to each other, so
that those, who in forests and mountains delight in robbery and revel in human bloodshed,
embrace and cherish the partners of their crimes. But there is another kind of love, where
the union is from the instincts of nature and the laws of consanguinity, whereby those of
the same tribe, wives and parents, and brothers and children are naturally preferred to
others, a thing which we find is the case not only with mankind but with all birds and beasts.
For at the prompting of a natural instinct they protect and defend their offspring and their
young ones so that often they are not afraid to expose themselves to danger and death for
their sakes. Indeed those kinds of beasts and serpents and birds, which are cut off and separated
from all others by their intolerable ferocity or deadly poison, as basilisks, unicorns
and vultures, though by their very look they are said to be dangerous to every one, yet among
themselves they remain peaceful and harmless owing to community of origin and fellowfeeling.
But we see that all these kinds of love of which we have spoken, as they are common
both to the good and bad, and to beasts and serpents, certainly cannot last for ever. For often
separation of place interrupts and breaks them off, as well as forgetfulness from lapse of
time, and the transaction of affairs and business and words. For as they are generally due
to different kinds of connexions either of gain, or desires, or kinship, or business, so when
any occasion for separation intervenes they are broken off.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1149"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How friendship is indissoluble.</head>
<p>Among all these then there is one kind of love which is indissoluble, where the union
is owing not to the favour of a recommendation, or some great kindness or gifts, or the
reason of some bargain, or the necessities of nature, but simply to similarity of virtue. This,
I say, is what is broken by no chances, what no interval of time or space can sever or destroy,
and what even death itself cannot part. This is true and unbroken love which grows by
means of the double perfection and goodness of friends, and which, when once its bonds
have been entered, no difference of liking and no disturbing opposition of wishes can sever.
But we have known many set on this purpose, who though they had been joined together
in companionship out of their burning love for Christ, yet could not maintain it continually
and unbrokenly, because although they relied on a good beginning for their friendship, yet
they did not with one and the same zeal maintain the purpose on which they had entered,
and so there was between them a sort of love only for a while, for it was not maintained by
the goodness of both alike, but by the patience of the one party, and so although it is held
to by the one with unwearied heroism, yet it is sure to be broken by the pettiness of the
other. For the infirmities of those who are somewhat cold in seeking the healthy condition
of perfection, however patiently they may be borne by the strong, are yet not put up with
by those who are weaker themselves. For they have implanted within them causes of disturbance
which do not allow them to be at ease, just as those, who are affected by bodily weakness,
generally impute the delicacy of their stomach and weak health to the carelessness of their
cooks and servants, and however carefully their attendants may serve them, yet nevertheless
they ascribe the grounds of their upset to those who are in good health, as they do not see
that they are really due to the failure of their own health. Wherefore this, as we said, is the
sure and indissoluble union of friendship, where the tie consists only in likeness in goodness.
For “the Lord maketh men to be of one mind in an house.”285 And therefore love can only
continue undisturbed in those in whom there is but one purpose and mind to will and to
refuse the same things. And if you also wish to keep this unbroken, you must be careful that
having first got rid of your faults, you mortify your own desires, and with united zeal and
purpose diligently fulfil that in which the prophet specially delights: “Behold how good and
joyful a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.”286 Which should be taken of
unity of spirit rather than of place. For it is of no use for those who differ in character and
purpose to be united in one dwelling, nor is it an hindrance for those who are grounded on
equal goodness to be separated by distance of place. For with God the union of character,
<note type="footnote">285 Ps. lxvii. (lxviii.) 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">286 Ps. cxxxii. (cxxxiii.) 1.</note>

<pb n="1150"/>
not of place, joins brethren together in a common dwelling, nor can unruffled peace ever
be maintained where difference of will appears.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>A question whether anything that is really useful should be performed even against a brother’s
wish.</head>
<p>Germanus: What then? If when one party wants to do something which he sees is useful
and profitable according to the mind of God, the other does not give his consent, ought it
to be performed even against the wish of the brother, or should it be thrown on one side as
he wants?</p>

<pb n="1152"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>The answer, how a lasting friendship can only exist among those who are perfect.</head>
<p>Joseph: For this reason we said that the full and perfect grace of friendship can only last
among those who are perfect and of equal goodness, whose likemindedness and common
purpose allows them either never, or at any rate hardly ever, to disagree, or to differ in those
matters which concern their progress in the spiritual life. But if they begin to get hot with
eager disputes, it is clear that they have never been at one in accordance with the rule which
we gave above. But because no one can start from perfection except one who has begun
from the very foundation, and your inquiring is not with regard to its greatness, but as to
how you can attain to it, I think it well to explain to you, in a few words, the rule for it and
the sort of path along which your steps should be directed, that you may be able more easily
to secure the blessing of patience and peace.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>By what means union can be preserved unbroken.</head>
<p>The first foundation then, of true friendship consists in contempt for worldly substance
and scorn for all things that we possess. For it is utterly wrong and unjustifiable if, after the
vanity of the world and all that is in it has been renounced, whatever miserable furniture
remains is more regarded than what is most valuable; viz., the love of a brother. The second
is for each man so to prune his own wishes that he may not imagine himself to be a wise
and experienced person, and so prefer his own opinions to those of his neighbour. The third
is for him to recognize that everything, even what he deems useful and necessary, must
come after the blessing of love and peace. The fourth for him to realize that he should never
be angry for any reason good or bad. The fifth for him to try to cure any wrath which a
brother may have conceived against him however unreasonably, in the same way that he
would cure his own, knowing that the vexation of another is equally bad for him, as if he
himself were stirred against another, unless he removes it, to the best of his ability, from his
brother’s mind. The last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in regard to all faults; viz.,
that he should realize daily that he is to pass away from this world; as the realization of this
not only permits no vexation to linger in the heart, but also represses all the motions of lusts
and sins of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can neither suffer nor be the cause
of bitter wrath and discord. But when this fails, as soon as he who is jealous of love has little
by little infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain that owing to
frequent quarrels love will gradually grow cool, and at sometime or other he will part the
hearts of the lovers, that have been for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along
the course previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if he claims
nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first cause of quarrel (which generally springs
from trivial things and most unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power
what we read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of believers: “But the multitude of
believers was of one heart and soul; neither did any of them say that any of the things which
he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.”287 Then how can any seeds of
discussion arise from him who serves not his own but his brother’s will, and becomes a
follower of his Lord and Master, who speaking in the character288 of man which He had
taken, said: “I am not come to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me?”289 But
how can he arouse any incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so much
to his own judgment as to his brother’s decision, on his own intelligence and meaning, in
<note type="footnote">287 Acts iv. 32.</note>

accordance with his will either approving or disapproving his discoveries, and fulfilling in
the humility of a pious heart these words from the Gospel: “Nevertheless, not as I will, but
as Thou wilt.”290 Or in what way will he admit anything which grieves the brother, who
thinks that nothing is more precious than the blessing of peace, and never forgets these
words of the Lord: “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, that ye love one
another;”291 for by this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock of His sheep should
be known in this world, and be separated from all others by this stamp, so to speak? But on
what grounds will he endure either to admit the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to
remain in another, if his firm decision is that there cannot be any good ground for anger,
as it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his broker is angry with him he cannot pray,
in just the same way as when he himself is angry with his brother, as he ever keeps in an
humble heart these words of our Lord and Saviour: “If thou bring thy gift to the altar and
there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar,
and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”292 For
it will be of no use for you to declare that you are not angry, and to believe that you are fulfilling
the command which says: “Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath;” and: “Whosoever
is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment,”293 if you are with obstinate
heart disregarding the vexation of another which you could smooth down by kindness on
your part. For in the same way you will be punished for violating the Lord’s command. For
He who said that you should not be angry with another, said also that you should not disregard
the vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the sight of God, “Who willeth
all men to be saved,”294 whether you destroy yourself or someone else. Since the death of
any one is equally a loss to God, and at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom
all destruction is delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by the death of your
brother. Lastly, how can he retain even the least vexation with his brother, who realizes daily
that he is presently to depart from this world?</p>

<head>How nothing should be put before love, or after anger.</head>
<p>As then nothing should be put before love, so on the other hand nothing should be put
below rage and anger. For all things, however useful and necessary they seem, should yet
be disregarded that disturbing anger may be avoided, and all things even which we think
are unfortunate should be undertaken and endured that the calm of love and peace may be
preserved unimpaired, because we should reckon nothing more damaging than anger and
vexation, and nothing more advantageous than love.</p>

<head>On what grounds a dispute can arise among spiritual persons.</head>
<p>For as our enemy separates brethren who are still weak and carnal by a sudden burst of
rage on account of some trifling and earthly matter, so he sows the seeds of discord even
between spiritual persons, on the ground of some difference of thoughts, from which certainly
those contentions and strifes about words, which the Apostle condemns, for the most part
arise: whereby consequently our spiteful and malignant enemy sows discord between brethren
who were of one mind. For these words of wise Solomon are true: “Contention breeds hatred:
but friendship will be a defence to all who do not strive.”295</p>

<head>How to get rid even of spiritual grounds of discord.</head>
<p>Wherefore for the preservation of lasting and unbroken love, it is of no use to have removed
the first ground of discord, which generally arises from frail and earthly things, or
to have disregarded all carnal things, and to have permitted to our brethren an unrestricted
share in everything which our needs require, unless too we cut off in like manner the second,
which generally arises under the guise of spiritual feelings; and unless we gain in everything
humble thoughts and harmonious wills.</p>

<head>On the best tests of truth.</head>
<p>For I remember, that when my youthful age suggested to me to cling to a partner,
thoughts of this sort often mingled with our moral training and the Holy Scriptures, so that
we fancied that nothing could be truer or more reasonable: but when we came together and
began to produce our ideas, in the general discussion which was held, some things were first
noted by the others as false and dangerous, and then presently were condemned and pronounced
by common consent to be injurious; though before they had seemed to shine as if
with a light infused by the devil, so that they would easily have caused discord, had not the
charge of the Elders, observed like some divine oracle, restrained us from all strife, that
charge; namely, whereby it was ordered by them almost with the force of a law, that neither
of us should trust to his own judgments more than his brother’s, if he wanted never to be
deceived by the craft of the devil.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>How it is impossible for one who trusts to his own judgment to escape being deceived by the
devil’s illusions.</head>
<p>For often it has been proved that what the Apostle says really takes place. “For Satan
himself transforms himself into an angel of light,”296 so that he deceitfully sheds abroad a
confusing and foul obscuration of the thoughts instead of the true light of knowledge. And
unless these thoughts are received in a humble and gentle heart, and kept for the consideration
of some more experienced brother or approved Elder, and when thoroughly sifted by
their judgment, either rejected or admitted by us, we shall be sure to venerate in our thoughts
an angel of darkness instead of an angel of light, and be smitten with a grievous destruction:
an injury which it is impossible for any one to avoid who trusts in his own judgment, unless
he becomes a lover and follower of true humility and with all contrition of heart fulfils what
the Apostle chiefly prays for: “If then there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
love, if any bowels of compassion, fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same
love, being of one accord, doing nothing by contention, neither by vainglory; but in humility
each esteeming others better than themselves;” and this: “in honour preferring one another,”
297 that each may think more of the knowledge and holiness of his partner, and hold
that the better part of true discretion is to be found in the judgment of another rather than
in his own.</p>

<head>Why inferiors should not be despised in Conference.</head>
<p>For it often happens either by an illusion of the devil or by the occurrence of a human
mistake (by which every man in this life is liable to be deceived) that sometimes one who is
keener in intellect and more learned, gets some wrong notion in his head, while he who is
duller in wits and of less worth, conceives the matter better and more truly. And therefore
no one, however learned he may be, should persuade himself in his empty vanity that he
cannot require conference with another. For even if no deception of the devil blinds his
judgment, yet he cannot avoid the noxious snares of pride and conceit. For who can arrogate
this to himself without great danger, when the chosen vessel in whom, as he maintained,
Christ Himself spoke, declares that he went up to Jerusalem simply and solely for this reason,
that he might in a secret discussion confer with his fellow-Apostles on the gospel which he
preached to the gentiles by the revelation and co-operation of the Lord? By which fact we
are shown that we ought not only by these precepts to preserve unanimity and harmony,
but that we need not fear any crafts of the devil opposing us, or snares of his illusions.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>How love does not only belong to God but is God.</head>
<p>Finally so highly is the virtue of love extolled that the blessed Apostle John declares that
it not only belongs to God but that it is God, saying: “God is love: he therefore that abideth
in love, abideth in God, and God in him.”298 For so far do we see that it is divine, that we
find that what the Apostle says is plainly a living truth in us: “For the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who dwelleth in us.”299 For it is the same thing as
if he said that God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who dwelleth in us: who
also, when we know not what we should pray for, “makes intercession for us with groanings
that cannot be uttered: But He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit desireth,
for He asketh for the saints according to God.”300</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>On the different grades of love.</head>
<p>It is possible then for all to show that love which is called ἀγάπη, of which the blessed
Apostle says: “While therefore we have time, let us do good unto all men, but specially to
them that are of the household of faith.”301 And this should be shown to all men in general
to such an extent that we are actually commanded by our Lord to yield it to our enemies,
for He says: “Love your enemies.”302 But διάθεσις, i.e., affection is shown to but a few and
those who are united to us by kindred dispositions or by a tie of goodness; though indeed
affection seems to have many degrees of difference. For in one way we love our parents, in
another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide
difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor is the love of parents towards
their children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who,
though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a father’s love, yet loved
Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: “But his brethren envied him, because
his father loved him;”303 evidently not that that good man his father failed in greatly loving
the rest of his children, but that in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type
of the Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in
the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: “that disciple whom Jesus
loved,”304 though certainly He embraced all the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the
same way, with His special love, as this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where
He says: “As I have loved you, so do ye also love one another;” of whom elsewhere also it is
said: “Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even to the end.”305 But this
love of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in love for the rest of the disciples,
but only a fuller and more abundant love towards the one, which his prerogative of virginity
and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional
treatment, as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with others,
but a richer grace of superabundant love singled it out. Something of this sort too we have
in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says: “Set in order love in

me.”306 For this is true love set in order, which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still
more by reason of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles out for
itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special affection, and again among
those, who are the special and chief objects of its love, singles out some who are preferred
to others in affection.</p>

<head>Of those who only increase their own or their brother’s grievances by hiding them.</head>
<p>On the other hand we know (and O! would that we did not know) some of the brethren
who are so hard and obstinate, that when they know that their own feelings are aroused
against their brother, or that their brother’s are against them, in order to conceal their vexation
of mind, which is caused by indignation at the grievance of one or the other, go apart
from those whom they ought to smooth down by humbly making up to them and talking
with them; and begin to sing some verses of the Psalms. And these while they fancy that
they are softening the bitter thoughts which have arisen in their heart, increase by their insolent
conduct what they could have got rid of at once if they had been willing to show more
care and humility, for a well-timed expression of regret would cure their own feelings and
soften their brother’s heart. For by that plan they nourish and cherish the sin of meanness
or rather of pride, instead of stamping out all inducement to quarrelling, and they forget
the charge of the Lord which says: “Whosoever is angry with his brother, is in danger of the
judgment;” and: “if thou remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy
gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift.”307</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>How it is that, if our brother has any grudge against us, the gifts of our prayers are rejected
by the Lord.</head>
<p>So far therefore is our Lord anxious that we should not disregard the vexation of another
that He does not accept our offerings if our brother has anything against us, i.e., He does
not allow prayers to be offered by us to Him until by speedy amends we remove from his
(our brother’s) mind the vexation which he whether rightly or wrongly feels. For He does
not say: “if thy brother hath a true ground for complaint against thee leave thy gift at the
altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to him;” but He says: “if thou remember that thy
brother hath aught against thee,” i.e., if there be anything however trivial or small, owing
to which your brother’s anger is roused against you, and this comes back to your recollection
by a sudden remembrance, you must know that you ought not to offer the spiritual gift of
your prayers until by kindly amends you have removed from your brother’s heart the vexation
arising from whatever cause. If then the words of the Gospel bid us make satisfaction to
those who are angry for past and utterly trivial grounds of quarrel, and those which have
arisen from the slightest causes, what will become of us wretches who with obstinate hypocrisy
disregard more recent grounds of offence, and those of the utmost importance, and
due to our own faults; and being puffed up with the devil’s own pride, as we are ashamed
to humble ourselves, deny that we are the cause of our brother’s vexation and in a spirit of
rebellion disdaining to be subject to the Lord’s commands, contend that they never ought
to be observed and never can be fulfilled? And so it comes to pass that as we make up our
minds that He has commanded things which are impossible and unsuitable, we become, to
use the Apostle’s expression, “not doers but judges of the law.”308</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Of those who hold that patience should be shown to worldly people rather than to the brethren.</head>
<p>This too should be bitterly lamented; namely, that some of the brethren, when angered
by some reproachful words, if they are besieged by the prayers of some one else who wants
to smooth them down, when they hear that vexation ought not to be admitted or retained
against a brother, according to what is written: “Whoever is angry with his brother is in
danger of the judgment;” and: “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,”309 instantly assert
that if a heathen or one living in the world had said or done this, it rightly ought to be endured.
But who could stand a brother who was accessory to so great a fault, or gave utterance
to so insolent a reproach with his lips! As if patience were to be shown only to unbelievers
and blasphemers, and not to all in general, or as if anger should be reckoned as bad when
it is against a heathen, but good when it is against a brother; whereas certainly the obstinate
rage of an angry soul brings about the same injury to one’s self whoever may be the subject
against whom it is aroused. But how terribly obstinate, aye and senseless is it for them, owing
to the stupidity of their dull mind, not to be able to discern the meaning of these words, for
it is not said: “Every one who is angry with a stranger shall be in danger of the judgment,”
which might perhaps according to their interpretation except those who are partners of our
faith and life, but the word of the Gospel most significantly expresses it by saying: “Every
one who is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment.” And so though we
ought according to the rule of truth to regard every man as a brother, yet in this passage
one of the faithful and a partaker of our mode of life is denoted by the title of brother rather
than a heathen.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>Of those who pretend to patience but excite their brethren to anger by their silence.</head>
<p>But what sort of a thing is this, that sometimes we fancy that we are patient because
when provoked we scorn to answer, but by sullen silence or scornful motions and gestures
so mock at our angry brothers that by our silent looks we provoke them to anger more than
angry reproaches would have excited them, meanwhile thinking that we are in no way guilty
before God, because we have let nothing fall from our lips which could brand us or condemn
us in the judgment of men. As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly the will
was called in fault, and as if only the actual deed of sin, and not also the wish and purpose,
was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what each one had
done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the anger
roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the
true scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it
arose: for the purpose of the sin, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be
taken into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with a sword by
himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles
and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down with one’s own hand,
though he is equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when fallen
and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a
man with the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for him, or who
would not set him free when he might have done so. So then it is of no good to hold one’s
tongue, if we impose silence upon ourselves for this reason that by our silence we may do
what would have been done by an outcry on our part, simulating certain gestures by which
he whom we ought to have cured, may be made still more angry, while we are commended
for all this, to his loss and damage: as if a man were not for this very reason the more guilty,
because he tried to get glory for himself out of his brother’s fall. For such a silence will be
equally bad for both because while it increases the vexation in the heart of another, so it
prevents it from being removed from one’s own: and against such persons the prophet’s
curse is with good reason directed: “Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and
presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. He is filled
with shame instead of glory.”310 And this too which is said of such people by another: “For
every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall
mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth, for they have bent their tongue like a
bow for lies and not for truth.”311 But often a feigned patience excites to anger more keenly
<note type="footnote">310 Hab. ii. 15, 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">311 Jer. ix. 4, 5.</note>

<pb n="1168"/>
than words, and a spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the wounds
of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment of mockers, of which it
is well said by the prophet: “Their words are smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:” and
elsewhere “the words of the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:” to which this
also may be finely applied: “With the mouth he speaks peace to his friend, but secretly he
layeth snares for him;” with which however the deceiver is rather deceived, for “if a man
prepares a net before his friend, it surrounds his own feet;” and: “if a man digs a pit for his
neighbour, he shall fall into it himself.”312 Lastly when a great multitude had come with
swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the murderers of the author of our life stood
forth as more cruel than he who advanced before them all with a counterfeit respect and
salutation and offered a kiss of feigned love; to whom the Lord said: “Judas, betrayest thou
the Son of man with a kiss?”313 i.e., the bitterness of thy persecution and hatred has taken
as a cloke this which expresses the sweetness of true love. More openly too and more energetically
does He emphasize the force of this grief by the prophet, saying: “For if mine enemy
had cursed me, I would have borne it: and if he who hated me had spoken great things
against me, I would have hid myself from him. But it was thou, a man of one mind, my
guide, and my familiar friend: who didst take sweet meats together with me: in the house
of God we walked with consent.”314</p>

<p>There is too another evil sort of vexation which would not be worth mentioning were
it not that we know it is allowed by some of the brethren who, when they have been vexed
or enraged actually abstain persistently from food, so that (a thing which we cannot mention
without shame) those who when they are calm declare that they cannot possibly put off
their refreshment to the sixth or at most the ninth hour, when they are filled with vexation
and rage do not feel fasts even for two days, and support themselves, when exhausted by
such abstinence, by a surfeit of anger. Wherein they are plainly guilty of the sin of sacrilege,
as out of the devil’s own rage they endure fasts which ought specially to be offered to God
alone out of desire for humiliation of heart and purification from sin: which is much the
same as if they were to offer prayers and sacrifices not to God but to devils, and so be worthy
of hearing this rebuke of Moses: “They sacrificed to devils and not to God; to gods whom
they knew not.”315</p>

<p>We are not ignorant also of another kind of insanity, which we find in some of the
brethren under colour of a counterfeit patience, as in this case it is not enough to have stirred
up quarrels unless they incite them with irritating words so as to get themselves smitten,
and when they have been touched by the slightest blow, at once they offer another part of
their body to be smitten, as if in this way they could fulfil to perfection that command which
says: “If a man smite thee on the right cheek, offer him the other also;”316 while they totally
ignore the meaning and purpose of the passage. For they fancy that they are practising
evangelical patience through the sin of anger, for the utter eradication of which not only
was the exchange of retaliation and the irritation of strife forbidden, but the command was
actually given us to mitigate the wrath of the striker by the endurance of a double wrong.</p>

<head>The answer that Christ looks not only at the action but also at the will.</head>
<p>Joseph: As was said a little before, we must look not only at the thing which is done, but
also at the character of the mind and the purpose of the doer. And therefore if you weigh
with a careful scrutiny of heart what is done by each man and consider with what mind it
is done or from what feeling it proceeds, you will see that the virtue of patience and gentleness
cannot possibly be fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e., that of impatience and rage. Since our
Lord and Saviour, when giving us a thorough lesson on the virtue of patience and gentleness
(i.e., teaching us not only to profess it with our lips, but to store it up in the inmost recesses
of the soul) gave us this summary of evangelical perfection, saying: “If any one smites thee
on thy right cheek, offer him the other also”317 (doubtless the “right” cheek is mentioned,
as another “right” cheek cannot be found except in the face of the inner man, so to speak),
as by this He desires entirely to remove all incitement to anger from the deepest recesses of
the soul, i.e., that if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker, the inner
man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be smitten, sympathizing with the
suffering of the outward man, and in a way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong
from the striker, that the inner man may not even silently be disturbed in itself at the blows
of the outward man. You see then that they are very far from evangelical perfection, which
teaches that patience must be maintained, not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart,
and which bids us preserve it whatever evil happens, that we may not only keep ourselves
always from disturbing anger, but also by submitting to their injuries compel those, who
are disturbed by their own fault, to become calm, when they have had their fill of blows;
and so overcome their rage by our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the
Apostle: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”318 And it is quite clear
that this cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of gentleness and humility in such a
spirit and rage that they not only fail to lessen the fire of wrath which has been kindled, but
rather make it blaze up the more fiercely both in their own feelings and in those of their
enraged brother. But these, even if they could in some way keep calm and quiet themselves,
would yet not bear any fruits of righteousness, while they claim the glory of patience on
their part by their neighbour’s loss, and are thus altogether removed from that Apostolic
love which “Seeketh not her own,”319 but the things of others. For it does not so desire riches
in such a way as to make profit for itself out of one’s neighbour’s loss, nor does it wish to
gain anything if it involves the spoiling of another.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>How he is the strong and vigorous man, who yields to the will of another.</head>
<p>But you must certainly know that in general he plays a stronger part who subjects his
own will to his brother’s, than he who is found to be the more pertinacious in defending
and clinging to his own decisions. For the former by bearing and putting up with his
neighbour gains the character of being strong and vigorous, while the latter gains that of
being weak and sickly, who must be pampered and petted so that sometimes for the sake
of his peace and quiet it is a good thing to relax something even in necessary matters. And
indeed in this he need not fancy that he has lost anything of his own perfection, though by
yielding he has given up something of his intended strictness, but on the contrary he may
be sure that he has gained much more by his virtue of long-suffering and patience. For this
is the Apostle’s command: “Ye who are strong should bear the infirmities of the weak;” and:
“Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”320 For a weak man will
never support a weak man, nor can one who is suffering in the same way, bear or cure one
in feeble health, but one who is himself not subject to infirmity brings remedies to one in
weak health. For it is rightly said to him: “Physician, heal thyself.”321</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>How the weak are harmful and cannot bear wrongs.</head>
<p>We must note too the fact that the nature of the weak is always such that they are quick
and ready to offer reproaches and sow the seeds of quarrels, while they themselves cannot
bear to be touched by the shadow of the very slightest wrong, and while they are riding
roughshod over us and flinging about wanton charges, they are not able to bear even the
slightest and most trivial ones themselves. And so according to the aforesaid opinion of the
Elders love cannot last firm and unbroken except among men of the same purpose and
goodness. For at some time or other it is sure to be broken, however carefully it may be
guarded by one of them.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
<pb n="1176"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>The answer that the weak does not always allow himself to be borne.</head>
<p>Joseph: I did not say that the virtue and endurance of one who is strong and robust
would be overcome, but that the miserable condition of the weak, encouraged by the tolerance
of the perfect, and daily growing worse, is sure to give rise to reasons on account of which
he himself ought no longer to be borne; or else with a shrewd suspicion that the patience of
his neighbour shows up and sets off his own impatience at some time or other he chooses
to make off rather than always to be borne by the magnanimity of the other. This then we
think should be above all else observed by those who want to keep the affection of their
companions unimpaired; viz., that first of all when provoked by any wrongs, a monk should
keep not only his lips but even the depth of his breast unmoved: but if he finds that they are
even slightly disturbed, let him keep himself in by entire silence, and diligently observe what
the Psalmist speaks of: “I was troubled and spake nothing;” and: “I said I will take heed to
thy ways that I offend not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner
stood against me. I was dumb and was humbled, and kept silence from good things;”322
and he should not pay any heed to his present state, nor give vent to what his violent rage
suggests and his exasperated mind expresses at the moment, but should dwell on the grace
of past love or look forward in his mind to the renewal and restoration of peace, and contemplate
it even in the very hour of rage, as if it were sure presently to return. And while he
is reserving himself for the delight of harmony soon to come, he will not feel the bitterness
of the present quarrel and will easily make such answers that, when love is restored, he will
not be able to accuse himself as guilty or be blamed by the other; and thus he will fulfil these
words of the prophet: “In wrath remember mercy.”323</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>How anger should be repressed.</head>
<p>We ought then to restrain every movement of anger and moderate it under the direction
of discretion, that we may not by blind rage be hurried into that which is condemned by
Solomon: “The wicked man expends all his anger, but the wise man dispenses it bit by
bit,”324 i.e., a fool is inflamed by the passion of his anger to avenge himself; but a wise man,
by the ripeness of his counsel and moderation little by little diminishes it, and gets rid of it.
Something of the same kind too is this which is said by the Apostle: “Not avenging yourselves,
dearly beloved: but give place to wrath,”325 i.e., do not under the compulsion of wrath proceed
to vengeance, but give place to wrath, i.e., do not let your hearts be confined in the straits
of impatience and cowardice so that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot endure
it; but be ye enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse waves of anger in the wide gulf
of that love which “suffereth all things, beareth all things;”326 and so your mind will be enlarged
with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have within it safe recesses of counsel,
in which the foul smoke of anger will be received and be diffused and forthwith vanish away;
or else the passage may be taken in this way: we give place to wrath, as often as we yield with
humble and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow to the impatience of the
passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved any kind of wrong. But those who twist the
meaning of the perfection of which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give
place to anger, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but rather to
foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a neighbour’s wrath is overcome at once
by amends being humbly made, a man provokes rather than avoids it by his flight. And
there is something like this that Solomon says: “Be not hasty in thy spirit to be wroth, for
anger reposes in the bosom of fools;” and: “Be not quick to rush into a quarrel, lest thou
repent thereof at the last.”327 For he does not blame a hasty exhibition of quarrelling and
anger in such a way as to praise a tardy one. In the same way too must this be taken: “A fool
declares his anger in the very same hour, but a prudent man hides his shame.”328 For he
does not lay it down that a shameful outburst of anger ought to be hidden by wise men in
such a way that while he blames a speedy outburst of anger he fails to forbid a tardy one, as
certainly, if owing to human weakness it does burst forth, he means that it should be hidden
for this reason, that while for the moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever.

For the nature of anger is such that when it is given room it languishes and perishes, but if
openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts then should be enlarged and opened
wide, lest they be confined in the narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling
surge of wrath, and so we become unable to receive what the prophet calls the “exceeding
broad” commandment of God in our narrow heart, or to say with the prophet: “I have run
the way of thy commandments for thou hast enlarged my heart.”329 For that long-suffering
is wisdom we are taught by very clear passages of Scripture: for “a man who is long-suffering
is great in prudence; but a coward is very foolish.”330 And therefore Scripture says of him
who to his credit asked the gift of wisdom from the Lord: “God gave Solomon wisdom and
prudence exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand of the sea for multitude.”331</p>

<head>How friendships entered upon by conspiracy cannot be lasting ones.</head>
<p>This too has been often proved by many experiments; viz., that those who entered the
bonds of friendship from a beginning of conspiracy, cannot possibly preserve their harmony
unbroken; either because they tried to keep it not out of their desire for perfection nor because
of the sway of Apostolic love, but out of earthly love, and because of their wants and the
bonds of their agreement; or else because that most crafty foe of ours hurries them on the
more speedily to break the chains of their friendship in order that he may make them
breakers of their oath. This opinion then of the most prudent men is most certainly established;
viz., that true harmony and undivided union can only exist among those whose life
is pure, and who are men of the same goodness and purpose.</p>
<p>Thus much the blessed Joseph discoursed in his spiritual talk on friendship, and fired
us with a more ardent desire to preserve the love of our fellowship as a lasting one.</p>

<head>XVII. THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH.</head>
<head>ON MAKING PROMISES.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1181"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the vigils which we endured.</head>
<p>When then the previous Conference was ended, and the intervening silence of night as
well, as we had been conducted by the holy Abbot Joseph to a separate cell for the sake of
quiet, but had passed the whole night without sleep (since owing to his words a fire was raging
in our hearts), we came forth from the cell and retired about a hundred yards from it and
sat down in a secluded spot. And so as an opportunity was given by the shades of night for
secret and familiar converse together, as we sat there Abbot Germanus groaned heavily.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1182"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of the anxiety of Abbot Germanus at the recollection of our promise.</head>
<p>What are we doing? said he. For we see that we are involved in a great difficulty and are
in an evil plight, as reason itself and the life of the saints is effectually teaching us what is
the best thing for our progress in the spiritual life, and yet our promise given to the Elders
does not allow us to choose what is helpful. For we might, by the examples of such great
men, be formed for a more perfect life and aim, were it not that the terms of our promise
compelled us to return at once to the monastery. But if we return thither, we shall never get
another chance of coming here again. But if we stay here and choose to carry out our wishes,
what becomes of the faith of the oath which we are aware that we gave to our Elders promising
a speedy return; that we might be allowed to make a hasty round of the monasteries
and saints of this province? And when in this state of tumult we could not make up our
minds what we ought to decide on the state of our salvation we simply testified by our groans
the hard fate of our condition, upbraiding the audacity of our impudence, and yet hating
the shame which was natural to us, weighed down by which we could not in any other way
resist the prayers of those who kept us back against our profit and purpose, except by the
promise of a speedy return, as we wept indeed that we laboured under the fault of that
shame, of which it is said “There is a shame that bringeth sin.”332</p>
<note type="footnote">332 Prov. xxvi. 11.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1183"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>My ideas on this subject.</head>
<p>Then I replied: The counsel or rather the authority of the Elder to whom we ought to
refer our anxieties would make a short way out of our difficulties, and whatever is decided
by his verdict, may, like a divine and heavenly reply, put an end to all our troubles. And we
need not have any doubt of what is given to us by the Lord through the lips of this Elder,
both for the sake of his merits and for our own faith. For by His gift believers have often
obtained saving counsel from unworthy people, and unbelievers from saints, as the Lord
grants this either on account of the merit of those who answer, or on account of the faith
of those who ask advice. And so the holy Abbot Germanus caught eagerly at these words as
if I had uttered them not of myself but at the prompting of the Lord, and when we had
waited a little for the coming of the Elder and the approaching hour of the nocturnal service,
after we had welcomed him with the usual greeting and finished reciting the right number
of Psalms and prayers, we sat down again as usual on the same mats on which we had settled
ourselves to sleep.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1184"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Abbot Joseph’s question and our answer on the origin of our anxiety.</head>
<p>Then the venerable Joseph saw that we were in rather low spirits, and, guessing that this
was not the case without reason, addressed us in these words of the patriarch Joseph: “Why
are your faces sad today?”333 to whom we answered: We are not like those bond slaves of
Pharaoh who have seen a dream and there is none to interpret it, but I admit that we have
passed a sleepless night and there is no one to lighten the weight of our troubles unless the
Lord may remove them by your wisdom. Then he, who recalled the excellence of the patriarch
both by his merits and name, said: Does not the cure of man’s perplexities come from the
Lord? Let them be brought forward: for the Divine Compassion is able to give a remedy for
them by means of our advice according to your faith.</p>

<pb n="1185"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>The explanation of Abbot Germanus why we wanted to stay in Egypt, and were drawn back
to Syria.</head>
<p>To this Germanus: We used to think, said he, that we should go back to our monastery
abundantly filled not only with spiritual joy but also with what is profitable by the sight of
your holiness, and that after our return we should follow, though with but a feeble rivalry,
what we had learnt from your teaching. For this our love for our Elders led us to promise
them, while we fancied that we could in some degree follow in that monastery your sublime
life and doctrine. Wherefore as we thought that by this means all joy would be bestowed
upon us, so on the other hand we are overwhelmed with intolerable grief, as we find that
we cannot possibly obtain in this way what we know to be good for us. On both sides then
we are now hemmed in. For if we want to keep our promise which we made in the presence
of all the brethren in the cave where our Lord Himself shone forth from His chamber in the
Virgin’s womb,334 and which He Himself witnessed, we shall incur the greatest loss in our
spiritual life. But if we ignore our promise and stay in this district, and choose to consider
that oath of ours as of less importance than our perfection, we are afraid of the awful dangers
of falsehood and perjury. But not even by this plan can we lighten our burdens; viz., by fulfilling
the terms of our oath by a very hasty return, and then coming back again as quickly
as possible to these parts. For although even a small delay is dangerous and hurtful for those
who are aiming at goodness and advance in spiritual things, yet still we would keep our faith
and promise, though by an unwilling return, were it not that we felt sure that we should be
so tightly bound down both by the authority and also by the love of the Elders, that we
should henceforth have no opportunity at all to come back again to this place.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="1187"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>The answer on the difference of customs in the two countries.</head>
<p>Germanus: Although we ought to be most grateful for the teaching of those men who
taught us from our youth up to attempt great things, and, by giving us a taste of their excel-
lence, implanted in our hearts a splendid thirst for perfection, yet if any reliance is to be
placed on our judgment, we cannot draw any comparison between these customs and those
which we learnt there, so as to hold our tongues about the inimitable purity of your life,
which we believe is granted to you not only owing to the concentration of your mind and
aim, but also owing to the aid and assistance of the place itself. Wherefore we do not doubt
that for the following of your grand perfection this instruction which is given to us is not
enough by itself, unless we have also the help of the life, and a long course of instruction
somewhat dissolves the coldness of our heart by daily training.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="1188"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How those who are perfect ought not to make any promises absolutely, and whether decisions
can be reversed without sin.</head>
<p>Joseph: It is good indeed and right and altogether in accordance with our profession,
for us effectually to perform what we decided to do in the case of any promise. Wherefore
a monk ought not to make any promise hastily, lest he may be forced to do what he incautiously
promised, or if he is kept back by consideration of a sounder view, appear as a
breaker of his promise. But because at the present moment our purpose is to treat not so
much of a state of health as of the cure of sickness we must with salutary counsel consider
not what you ought to have done in the first instance, but how you can escape from the
rocks of this perilous shipwreck. When then no chains impede us and no conditions restrict
us, in the case of a comparison of good things, if a choice is proposed, that which is most
advantageous should be preferred: but when some detriment and loss stands in the way, in
a comparison of things to our hurt, that should be sought which exposes us to the smallest
loss. Further, as your assertion shows, when your heedless promise has brought you to this
state that in either case some serious loss and inconvenience must result to you, the will in
choosing should incline to that side which involves a loss that is more tolerable, or can be
more easily made up for by the remedy of making amends. If then you think that you will
get more good for your spirit by staying here than what accrued to you from your life in
that monastery, and that the terms of your promise cannot be fulfilled without the loss of
great good, it is better for you to undergo the loss from a falsehood and an unfulfilled
promise (as it is done once for all, and need not any longer be repeated or be the cause of
other sins) than for you to incur that loss, through which you say that your state of life would
become colder, and which would affect you with a daily and unceasing injury. For a careless
promise is changed in such a way that it may be pardoned or indeed praised, if it is turned
into a better path, nor need we take it as a failure in consistency, but as a correction of
rashness, whenever a promise that was faulty is corrected. And all this may be proved by
most certain witness from Scripture, that for many the fulfilment of their promise has led
to death, and on the other hand that for many it has been good and profitable to have refused
it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="1189"/>
<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>How it is often better to break one’s engagements than to fulfil them.</head>
<p>And both these points are very clearly shown by the cases of S. Peter the Apostle and
Herod. For the former, because he departed from his expressed determination which he
had as it were confirmed with an oath saying “Thou shalt never wash my feet,”335 gained
an immortal partnership with Christ, whereas he would certainly have been cut off from
the grace of this blessedness, if he had clung obstinately to his word. But the latter, by
clinging to the pledge of his ill-considered oath, became the bloody murderer of the Lord’s
forerunner, and through the vain fear of perjury plunged himself into condemnation and
the punishment of everlasting death. In everything then we must consider the end, and must
according to it direct our course and aim, and if when some wiser counsel supervenes, we
see it diverging to the worse part, it is better to discard the unsuitable arrangement, and to
come to a better mind rather than to cling obstinately to our engagements and so become
involved in worse sins.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Our question about our fear of the oath which we gave in the monastery in Syria.</head>
<p>Germanus: In so far as it concerns our desire, which we undertook to carry out for the
sake of spiritual profit, we were hoping to be edified by continual intercourse with you. For
if we were to return to our monastery it is certain that we should not only fail of so sublime
a purpose, but that we should also suffer grievous loss from the mediocrity of the manner
of life there. But that command of the gospel frightens us terribly: “Let your speech be yea,
yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is more than these, is from the evil one.”336 For we hold that
we cannot compensate for transgressing so important a command by any righteousness,
nor can that finally turn out well which has once been started with a bad beginning.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>The answer that we must take into account the purpose of the doer rather than the execution
of the business.</head>
<p>Joseph: In every case, as we said, we must look not at the progress of the work but at
the intention of the worker, nor must we inquire to begin with what a man has done, but
with what purpose, so that we may find that some have been condemned for those deeds
from which good has afterwards arisen, and on the other hand that some have arrived by
means of acts in themselves reprehensible at the height of righteousness. And in the case of
the former the good result of their actions was of no avail to them as they took the matter
in and with an evil purpose, and wanted to bring about—not the good which actually resulted,
but something of the opposite character; nor was the bad beginning injurious to the latter,
as he put up with the necessity of a blameworthy start; not out of disregard for God, or with
the purpose of doing wrong, but with an eye to a needful and holy end.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1192"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>How a fortunate issue will be of no avail to evil doers, while bad deeds will not injure good
men.</head>
<p>And that we may make these statements clear by instances from Holy Scripture, what
could be brought about that was more salutary and more to the good of the whole world,
than the saving remedy of the Lord’s Passion? And yet it was not only of no advantage, but
was actually to the disadvantage of the traitor by whose means it is shown to have been
brought about, so that it is absolutely said of him: “It were good for that man if he had
never been born.”337 For the fruits of his labour will not be repaid to him according to the
actual result, but according to what he wanted to do, and believed that he would accomplish.
And again, what could there be more culpable than craft and deceit shown even to a stranger,
not to mention one’s brother and father? And yet the patriarch Jacob not only met with no
condemnation or blame for such things but was actually dowered with the everlasting heritage
of the blessing. And not without reason, for the last mentioned desired the blessing
destined for the first-born not out of a greedy desire for present gain but because of his faith
in everlasting sanctification; while the former (Judas) delivered the Redeemer of all to death,
not for the sake of man’s salvation, but from the sin of covetousness. And therefore in each
case the fruits of their action are reckoned according to the intention of the mind and purpose
of the will, according to which the object of the one was not to work fraud, nor was that of
the other to work salvation. For justly is there repayment to each man as the recompense
of reward, for what he conceived in the first instance in his mind, and not for what resulted
from it either well or badly, against the wish of the worker. And so the most just Judge regarded
him who ventured on such a falsehood as excusable and indeed worthy of praise,
because without it he could not secure the blessing of the first-born; and that should not be
reckoned as a sin, which arose from desire of the blessing. Otherwise the aforesaid patriarch
would have been not only unfair to his brother, but also a cheat of his father and a blasphemer,
if there had been any other way by which he could secure the gift of that blessing,
and he had preferred to follow this which would damage and injure his brother. You see
then that with God the inquiry is not into the carrying out of the act, but into the purpose
of the mind. With this preparation then for a return to the question proposed (for which
all this has been premised) I want you first to tell me for what reason you bound yourselves
in the fetters of that promise.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="1193"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Our answer as to the reason which demanded an oath from us.</head>
<p>Germanus: The first reason, as we said, was that we were afraid of vexing our Elders
and resisting their orders; the second was that we very foolishly believed that, if we had
learnt from you anything perfect or splendid to hear or look at, when we returned to the
monastery, we should be able to perform it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="1194"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>The discourse of the Elder showing how the plan of action may be changed without fault
provided that one keeps to the carrying out of a good intention.</head>
<p>Joseph: As we premised, the intent of the mind brings a man either reward or condemnation,
according to this passage: “Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending
one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men;” and this too: “But
I am coming to gather together their works and thoughts together with all nations and
tongues.”338 Wherefore it was, as I see, from a desire for perfection that you bound yourselves
with the chain of these oaths, as you then thought that by this plan it could be gained, while
now that a riper judgment has supervened, you see that you cannot by this means scale its
heights. And so any departure from that arrangement, which may seem to have happened,
will be no hindrance, if only no change in that first purpose follows. For a change of instrument
does not imply a desertion of the work, nor does the choice of a shorter and more
direct road argue laziness on the path of the traveller. And so in this matter an improvement
in a short-sighted arrangement is not to be reckoned a breach of a spiritual promise. For
whatever is done out of the love of God and desire for goodness, which has “promise of the
life that now is and of that which is to come,”339 even though it may appear to commence
with a hard and adverse beginning, is most worthy, not only of no blame, but actually of
praise. And therefore the breaking of a careless promise will be no hindrance, if in every
case the end, i.e., the proposed aim at goodness, be maintained. For we do all for this reason,
that we may be able to show to God a clean heart, and if the attainment of this is considered
to be easier in this country the alteration of the agreement extracted from you will be no
hindrance to you, if only the perfection of that purity for the sake of which your promise
was originally made, be the sooner secured according to the Lord’s will.</p>

<head>A question whether it can be without sin that our knowledge affords to weak brethren an opportunity
for lying.</head>
<p>Germanus: As far as the force of the words which have been reasonably and carefully
considered, is concerned, our scruple about our promise would have easily been removed
from us were it not that we were terribly alarmed lest by this example an opportunity for
lying might be offered to certain weaker brethren, if they knew that the faith of an agreement
could be in any way lawfully broken, whereas this very thing is forbidden in such vigorous
and threatening terms by the prophet when he says: “Thou shalt destroy all those who utter
a lie;” and: “the mouth that speaketh a lie, shall slay the soul.”340</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>The answer that Scripture truth is not to be altered on account of an offence given to the weak.</head>
<p>Joseph: Occasions and opportunities for destroying themselves cannot possibly be
wanting to those who are on the road to ruin, or rather who are anxious to destroy themselves;
nor are those passages of Scripture to be rejected and altogether torn out of the volume, by
which the perversity of heretics is encouraged, or the unbelief of the Jews increased, or the
pride of heathen wisdom offended; but surely they are to be piously believed, and firmly
held, and preached according to the rule of truth. And therefore we should not, because of
another’s unbelief, reject the οἰκονομίας, i.e., the “economy” of the prophets and saints
which Scripture relates, lest while we are thinking that we ought to condescend to their infirmities,
we stain ourselves with the sin not only of lying but of sacrilege. But, as we said,
we ought to admit these according to the letter, and explain how they were rightly done.
But for those who are wrongly disposed, the opening for lies will not be blocked up by this
means, if we are trying either altogether to deny or to explain away by allegorical interpretations
the truth of those things which we are going to bring forward or have already brought
forward. For how will the authority of these passages injure them if their corrupt will is
alone sufficient to lead them to sin?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>How the saints have profitably employed a lie like hellebore.</head>
<p>And so we ought to regard a lie and to employ it as if its nature were that of hellebore;
which is useful if taken when some deadly disease is threatening, but if taken without being
required by some great danger is the cause of immediate death. For so also we read that holy
men and those most approved by God employed lying, so as not only to incur no guilt of
sin from it, but even to attain the greatest goodness; and if deceit could confer glory on
them, what on the other hand would the truth have brought them but condemnation? Just
as Rahab, of whom Scripture gives a record not only of no good deed but actually of unchastity,
yet simply for the lie, by means of which she preferred to hide the spies instead of
betraying them, had it vouchsafed to her to be joined with the people of God in everlasting
blessing. But if she had preferred to speak the truth and to regard the safety of the citizens,
there is no doubt that she and all her house would not have escaped the coming destruction,
nor would it have been vouchsafed to her to be inserted in the progenitors of our Lord’s
nativity,341 and reckoned in the list of the patriarchs, and through her descendants that
followed, to become the mother of the Saviour of all. Again Dalila, who to provide for the
safety of her fellow citizens betrayed the truth she had discovered, obtained in exchange
eternal destruction, and has left to all men nothing but the memory of her sin. When then
any grave danger hangs on confession of the truth, then we must take to lying as a refuge,
yet in such a way as to be for our salvation troubled by the guilt of a humbled conscience.
But where there is no call of the utmost necessity present, there a lie should be most carefully
avoided as if it were something deadly: just as we said of a cup of hellebore which is indeed
useful if it is only taken in the last resort when a deadly and inevitable disease is threatening,
while if it is taken when the body is in a state of sound and rude health, its deadly properties
at once go to find out the vital parts. And this was clearly shown of Rahab of Jericho, and
the patriarch Jacob; the former of whom could only escape death by means of this remedy,
while the latter could not secure the blessing of the first-born without it. For God is not only
the Judge and inspector of our words and actions, but He also looks into their purpose and
aim. And if He sees that anything has been done or promised by some one for the sake of
eternal salvation and shows insight into Divine contemplation, even though it may appear
to men to be hard and unfair, yet He looks at the inner goodness of the heart and regards
the desire of the will rather than the actual words spoken, because He must take into account
the aim of the work and the disposition of the doer, whereby, as was said above, one man
may be justified by means of a lie, while another may be guilty of a sin of everlasting death
by telling the truth. To which end the patriarch Jacob also had regard when he was not afraid
<note type="footnote">341 Cf. S. Matt. i. 5.</note>

<pb n="1198"/>
to imitate the hairy appearance of his brother’s body by wrapping himself up in skins, and
to his credit acquiesced in his mother’s instigation of a lie for this object. For he saw that in
this way there would be bestowed on him greater gains of blessing and righteousness than
by keeping to the path of simplicity: for he did not doubt that the stain of this lie would at
once be washed away by the flood of the paternal blessing, and would speedily be dissolved
like a little cloud by the breath of the Holy Spirit; and that richer rewards of merit would be
bestowed on him by means of this dissimulation which he put on than by means of the
truth, which was natural to him.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>An objection that only those men employed lies with impunity, who lived under the law.</head>
<p>Germanus: It is no wonder that these schemes were properly employed in the Old
Testament, and that some holy men laudably or at any rate venially told lies, as we see that
many worse things were permitted to them owing to the rude character of the times. For
why should we wonder that when the blessed David was fleeing from Saul, in answer to the
inquiry of Abimelech the priest who said: “Why art thou alone, and is no man with thee?”
he replied as follows: “The king hath commanded me a business, and said, Let no man know
the thing for which thou art sent by me, for I have appointed my servants to such and such
a place;” and again: “Hast thou here at hand a spear or a sword, for I brought not my own
sword nor my own weapon with me, for the king’s business required haste;” or this, when
he was brought to Achish king of Gath, and feigned himself mad and frantic, “and changed
his countenance before them, and slipped down between their hands; and stumbled against
the doors of the gate and his spittle ran down on his beard;”342 when they were even allowed
to enjoy crowds of wives and concubines, and no sin was on this account imputed to them,
and when moreover they often shed the blood of their enemies with their own hand, and
this was thought not only worthy of no blame, but actually praiseworthy? And all these
things we see by the light of the gospel are utterly forbidden, so that not one of them can be
done without great sin and guilt. And in the same way we hold that no lie can be employed
by any one, I will not say rightly, but not even venially, however it may be covered with the
colour of piety, as the Lord says: “Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is
more than these is of the evil one;” and the Apostle also agrees with this: “And lie not one
to another.”343</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>The answer, that leave to lie, which was not even granted under the old Covenant, has rightly
been taken by many.</head>
<p>Joseph: All liberty in the matter of wives and many concubines, as the end of time is
approaching and the multiplying of the human race completed, ought rightly to be cut off
by evangelical perfection, as being no longer necessary. For up to the coming of Christ it
was well that the blessing of the original sentence should be in full vigour, whereby it was
said: “Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.”344 And therefore it was quite right that from
the root of human fecundity which happily flourished in the synagogue, in accordance with
that dispensation of the times, the buds of angelical virginity should spring, and the fragrant
flowers of continence be produced in the Church. But that lying was even then condemned
the text of the whole Old Testament clearly shows, as it says: “Thou shalt destroy all them
that speak lies;” and again: “The bread of lying is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth
is filled with gravel;” and the Giver of the law himself says: “Thou shalt avoid a lie.”345 But
we said that it was then properly employed as a last resort when some need or plan of salvation
was linked on to it, on account of which it ought not to be condemned. As is the case,
which you mentioned, of king David when in his flight from the unjust persecution of Saul,
to Abimelech the priest he used lying words, not with the object of getting any gain nor with
the desire to injure anybody, but simply to save himself from that most iniquitous persecution;
inasmuch as he would not stain his hands with the blood of the hostile king, so often
delivered up to him by God; as he said: “The Lord be merciful to me that I may do no such
thing to my master the Lord’s anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord’s
anointed.”346 And therefore these plans which we hear that holy men under the old covenant
adopted either from the will of God, or for the prefiguring of spiritual mysteries or for the
salvation of some people, we too cannot refuse altogether, when necessity constrains us, as
we see that even apostles did not avoid them, where the consideration of something profitable
required them: which in the meanwhile we will for a time postpone, while we first discuss
those instances which we propose still to bring forward from the Old Testament, and afterwards
we shall more suitably introduce them so as more readily to prove that good and holy
men, both in the Old and in the New Testament, were entirely at one with each other in
these contrivances. For what shall we say of that pious fraud of Hushai to Absalom for the
salvation of king David, which though uttered with all appearance of good-will by the deceiver
and cheat, and opposed to the good of him who asked advice, is yet commended by
<note type="footnote">344 Gen. i. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">345 Ps. v. 7; Prov. xx. 17; Exod. xxiii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">346 1 Sam. xxiv. 7.</note>

<pb n="1201"/>
the authority of Holy Scripture, which says: “But by the will of the Lord the profitable
counsel of Ahithophel was defeated that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom?”347 Nor
could that be blamed which was done for the right side with a right purpose and pious intent,
and was planned for the salvation and victory of one whose piety was pleasing to God, by
a holy dissimulation. What too shall we say of the deed of that woman, who received the
men who had been sent to king David by the aforesaid Hushai, and hid them in a well, and
spread a cloth over its mouth, and pretended that she was drying pearl-barley, and said
“They passed on after tasting a little water”;348 and by this invention saved them from the
hands of their pursuers? Wherefore answer me, I pray you, and say what you would have
done, if any similar situation had arisen for you, living now under the gospel; would you
prefer to hide them with a similar falsehood, saying in the same way: “They passed on after
tasting a little water,” and thus fulfil the command: “Deliver those who are being led to
death, and spare not to redeem those who are being killed;”349 or by speaking the truth,
would you have given up those in hiding to the men who would kill them? And what then
becomes of the Apostle’s words: “Let no man seek his own but the things of another:” and:
“Love seeketh not her own, but the things of others;” and of himself he says: “I seek not
mine own good but the good of many that they may be saved?”350 For if we seek our own,
and want obstinately to keep what is good for ourselves, we must even in urgent cases of
this sort speak the truth, and so become guilty of the death of another: but if we prefer what
is for another’s advantage to our own good, and satisfy the demands of the Apostle, we shall
certainly have to put up with the necessity of lying. And therefore we shall not be able to
keep a perfect heart of love, or to seek, as Apostolic perfection requires, the things of others,
unless we relax a little in those things which concern the strictness and perfection of our
own lives, and choose to condescend with ready affection to what is useful to others, and
so with the Apostle become weak to the weak, that we may be able to gain the weak.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>How even Apostles thought that a lie was often useful and the truth injurious.</head>
<p>Instructed by which examples, the blessed Apostle James also, and all the chief princes
of the primitive Church urged the Apostle Paul in consequence of the weakness of feeble
persons to condescend to a fictitious arrangement and insisted on his purifying himself according
to the requirements of the law, and shaving his head and paying his vows, as they
thought that the present harm which would come from this hypocrisy was of no account,
but had regard rather to the gain which would result from his still continued preaching. For
the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to
all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the
whole Church unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching
of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when,
as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to
us from speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And
elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this
disposition; for when he says: “To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to
those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that
I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as
without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I
might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the
weak: I became all things to all men, that I might save all;”351 what does he show but that
according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always
lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what
his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the
weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount
one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed
Apostle can be proved to have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the
Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart
the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: “Behold, I, Paul, say unto you
that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,”352 yet by circumcising Timothy
he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to
those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the
Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of
Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound
<note type="footnote">351 1 Cor. ix. 20–22.</note>
<note type="footnote">352 Gal. v. 2.</note>

<pb n="1203"/>
by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and
advice, and said: “Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who
have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou
teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they
ought not to circumcise their children;” and below: “Do therefore this that we say unto thee:
we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and
bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which
they have heard of thee are false, but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.”353 And
so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict
view which he had expressed: “For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live
unto God;”354 and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and
pay his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of
those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law?
Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing:
“As I passed by,” he says, “I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown
God;” and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had
been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of
Christ, saying: “What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.” And after
a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a
verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: “As some also of
your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.” And when he had thus approached
them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by
things false, he added and said: “Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of
man.”355 But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command,
he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,356 or when he
fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness
and fear and much trembling.357 But he became all things to all men that he might save all,
when he says: “He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that
eateth not judge him that eateth:” and: “He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well,
and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;” and elsewhere: “Who,” says he, “is
weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?” and in this way he fulfilled

<pb n="1204"/>
what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: “Be ye without offence to
Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking
mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.”358 For it had certainly been
profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification,
not to practice going barefoot,359 not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things
because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done
with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who
through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made
and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he
might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor
is it right to believe that he who had said: “For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I
make myself a transgressor,”360 would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to
such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the
disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured
some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about
David’s flight, and saying: “Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make
you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no
one to inform me,” did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: “I
saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted
the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?”
361 For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living,
and it is said of him by the prophet: “Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck
thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:”362 He
then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the
harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson
most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time
by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconsiderately disclosed was the cause of his own deception,
because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: “Keep the doors of thy
mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.”363</p>

<head>Whether secret abstinence ought to be made known, without telling a lie about it, to those
who ask, and whether what has once been declined may be taken in hand.</head>
<p>And to bring forward some instances from our unavoidable and almost daily wants
which with all our care we can never so guard against as not to be driven to incur them
whether with or against our will: what, I ask you, is to be done when, while we are proposing
to put off our supper, a brother comes and asks us if we have had it: is our fast to be concealed,
and the good act of abstinence hidden, or is it to be proclaimed by telling the truth? If we
conceal it, to satisfy the Lord’s command which says: “Thou shalt not appear unto men to
fast but unto thy Father Who is in secret;” and again: “Let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth,”364 we must at once tell a lie. If we make manifest the good act of abstinence,
the word of the gospel rightly discourages us: “Verily I say unto you, they have their
reward.”365 But what if any one has refused with determination a cup offered to him by
some brother, denying altogether that he will take what the other, rejoicing at his arrival,
begs and intreats him to receive? Is it right that he should force himself to yield to his
brother who goes on his knees and bows himself to the ground, and who thinks that he can
only show his loving heart by this service, or should he obstinately cling to his own word

once intended. But our Elders, to whose faith the signs of Apostolical powers have borne
witness, and who have treated everything with judgment and discretion of spirit rather than
with stiff obstinacy of mind, have laid down that those men who give in to the infirmities
of others, receive much richer fruits than those who persist in their determinations, and
have declared that it is a better deed to conceal abstinence, as was said, by this needful and
humble lie, rather than to display it with a proud show of truth.</p>

<head>How Abbot Piamun chose to hide his abstinence.</head>
<p>Finally Abbot Piamun366 after twenty-five years did not hesitate to receive some grapes
and wine offered to him by a certain brother, and at once preferred, against his rule, to taste
what was brought him rather than to display his abstinence which was a secret from everybody.
For if we would also bear in mind what we remember that our Elders always did, who
used to conceal the marvels of their own good deeds, and their own acts, which they were
obliged to bring forward in Conference for the instruction of the juniors, under cover of
other persons, what else can we consider them but an open lie? And O that we too had
anything worthy which we could bring forward for stirring up the faith of the juniors! Certainly
we should have no scruples in following their fictions of that kind. For it is better
under the colour of a figure like that to tell a lie than for the sake of maintaining that unreasonable
truthfulness either hide in ill-advised silence what might be edifying to the hearers,
or run into the display of an objectionable vanity by telling them truthfully in our own
character. And the teacher of the Gentiles clearly teaches us the same lesson by his teaching,
as he chose to bring forward the great revelations made to him, under the character of some
one else, saying: “I know a man in Christ, whether in the body or out of the body I cannot
tell, God knoweth, caught up even unto the third heaven: and I know such a man, that he
was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man
to utter.”367</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>The evidence of Scripture on changes of determination.</head>
<p>It is impossible for us briefly to run through everything. For who could count up almost
all the patriarchs and numberless saints, some of whom for the preservation of life, others
out of desire for a blessing, others out of pity, others to conceal some secret, others out of
zeal for God, others in searching for the truth, became, so to speak, patrons of lying? And
as all cannot be enumerated, so all ought not to be altogether passed over. For piety forced
the blessed Joseph to raise a false charge against his brethren even with an oath by the life
of the king, saying: “Ye are spies: to see the nakedness of the land are ye come;” and below:
“send,” says he, “one of you, and bring your brothers hither: but ye shall be kept here until
your words are made manifest whether ye speak the truth or no: but if not, by the life of
Pharaoh, ye are spies.”368 For if he had not out of pity alarmed them by this lie, he would
not have been able to see again his father and his brother, nor to preserve them in their great
danger of starvation, nor to free the conscience of his brethren from the guilt of selling him.
The act then of striking his brethren with fear by means of a lie was not so reprehensible as
was it a holy and laudable act to urge his enemies and seekers to a salutary penitence by
means of a feigned danger. Finally when they were weighed down by the odium of the very
serious accusation, they were conscience-stricken not at the charge falsely raised against
them, but at the thought of their earlier crime, and said to one another: “We suffer this
rightly because we sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when
he asked us and we did not hearken to him: wherefore all this trouble hath come upon
us.”369 And this confession, we think, expiated by most salutary humility their terrible sin
not only against their brother, against whom they had sinned with wicked cruelty, but also
against God. What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested the gift of wisdom,
which he had received of God, only by making use of falsehood? For in order to get at the
truth which was hidden by the woman’s lie, even he used the help of a lie most cunningly
invented, saying: “Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts, and give the
one half to the one and the other half to the other.” And when this pretended cruelty stirred
the heart of the true mother, but was received with approval by her who was not the true
mother, then at last by this most sagacious discovery of the truth he pronounced the judgment
which every one has felt to have been inspired by God, saying: “Give her the living child
and slay it not: she is the mother of it.”370 Further we are more fully taught by other passages
of Scripture as well that we neither can nor should carry out everything which we determine

either with peace or disturbance of mind, as we often hear that holy men and angels and
even Almighty God Himself have changed what they had decided upon. For the blessed
David determined and confirmed it by an oath, saying: “May God do so and add more to
the foes of David if I leave of all that belong unto Nabal until the morning a single male.”
And presently when Abigail his wife interceded and intreated for him, he gave up his threats,
lightened the sentence, and preferred to be regarded as a breaker of his word rather than to
keep his pledged oath by cruelly executing it, saying: “As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst not
quickly come to meet me there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light a single
male.”371 And as we do not hold that his readiness to take a rash oath (which resulted from
his anger and disturbance of mind) ought to be copied by us, so we do think that the pardon
and revision of his determination is to be followed. The “chosen vessel,” in writing to the
Corinthians, promises unconditionally to return, saying: “But I will come to you when I
pass through Macedonia: for I will pass through Macedonia. But I will stay or even pass the
winter with you that you may conduct me whithersoever I shall go. For I do not want only
to see you in passing: for I hope to stay with you for some time.”372 And this fact he remembers
in the Second Epistle, thus: “And in this confidence I was minded first to come unto
you, that ye might receive a second favour, and by you to pass into Macedonia and again
to come to you from Macedonia and by you be conducted to Judæa.” But a better plan
suggested itself and he plainly admits that he is not going to fulfil what he had promised.
“When then,” says he, “I purposed this, did I use light-mindedness? or the things that I
think, do I think after the flesh, that there should be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay?” Lastly,
he declares even with the affirmation of an oath, why it was that he preferred to put on one
side his pledged word rather than by his presence to bring a burden and grief to his disciples:
“But I call God to witness against my soul that it was to spare you that I came not as far as
Corinth. For I determined this with myself that I would not come unto you in sorrow.”373
Though when the angels had refused to enter the house of Lot at Sodom, saying to him:
“We will not enter but will remain in the street,” they were presently forced by his prayers
to change their determination, as Scripture subjoins: “And Lot constrained them, and they
turned in to him.”374 And certainly if they knew that they would turn in to him, they refused
his request with a sham excuse: but if their excuse was a real one, then they are clearly shown
to have changed their mind. And certainly we hold that the Holy Spirit inserted this in the
sacred volume for no other reason but to teach us by their examples that we ought not to
cling obstinately to our own determinations, but to subject them to our will, and so to keep

our judgment free from all the chains of law that it may be ready to follow the call of good
counsel in any direction, and may not delay or refuse to pass without any delay to whatever
a sound discretion may find to be the better choice. And to rise to still higher instances,
when king Hezekiah was lying on his bed and afflicted with grievous sickness the prophet
Isaiah addressed him in the person of God, and said: “Thus saith the Lord: set thine house
in order for thou shalt die and not live. And Hezekiah,” it says, “turned his face to the wall
and prayed to the Lord and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before
Thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was right in Thy sight.
And Hezekiah wept sore.” After which it was again said to him: “Go, return, and speak to
Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father: I have heard
thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: and behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will
deliver thee out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for thy
sake and for my servant David’s sake.”375 What can be clearer than this proof that out of
consideration for mercy and goodness the Lord would rather break His word and instead
of the pre-arranged limit of death extend the life of him who prayed, for fifteen years, rather
than be found inexorable because of His unchangeable decree? In the same way too the
Divine sentence says to the men of Nineveh: “Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown;”
376 and presently this stern and abrupt sentence is softened by their penitence and
fasting, and is turned to the side of mercy with goodness that is easy to be intreated. But if
any one maintains that the Lord had threatened the destruction of their city (while He
foreknew that they would be converted) for this reason, that He might incite them to a
salutary penitence, it follows that those who are set over their brethren may, if need arises,
without any blame for telling lies, threaten those who need improvement with severer
treatment than they are really going to inflict. But if one says that God revoked that severe
sentence in consideration of their penitence, according to what he says by Ezekiel: “If I say
to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: and he becomes penitent for his sin, and doeth judgment
and justice, he shall surely live, he shall not die;”377 we are similarly taught that we ought
not obstinately to stick to our determination, but that we should with gentle pity soften
down the threats which necessity called forth. And that we may not fancy that the Lord
granted this specially to the Ninevites, He continually affirms by Jeremiah that He will do
the same in general towards all, and promises that without delay He will change His sentence
in accordance with our deserts; saying: “I will suddenly speak against a nation and against
a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation repent of the evil,
which I have spoken against it, I also will repent of the evil which I thought to do to them.

<note type="footnote">376 Jonah iii. 4 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">377 Ezek. xxxiii. 14, 15.</note>

<pb n="1212"/>
And I will suddenly speak of a nation and a kingdom, to build up and to plant it. If it shall
do evil in My sight, that it obey not My voice: I will repent of the good that I thought to do
to it.” To Ezekiel also: “Leave out not a word, if so be they will hearken and be converted
every one from his evil way: that I may repent Me of the evil that I thought to do to them
for the wickedness of their doings.”378 And by these passages it is declared that we ought
not obstinately to stick to our decisions, but to modify them with reason and judgment, and
that better courses should always be adopted and preferred, and that we should turn without
any delay to that course which is considered the more profitable. For this above all that invaluable
sentence teaches us, because though each man’s end is known beforehand to Him
before his birth, yet somehow He so orders all things by a plan and method for all, and with
regard to man’s disposition, that He decides on everything not by the mere exercise of His
power, nor according to the ineffable knowledge which His Prescience possesses, but according
to the present actions of men, and rejects or draws to Himself each one, and daily either
grants or withholds His grace. And that this is so the election of Saul also shows us, of whose
miserable end the foreknowledge of God certainly could not be ignorant, and yet He chose
him out of so many thousands of Israel and anointed him king, rewarding the then existing
merits of his life, and not considering the sin of his coming fall, so that after he became
reprobate, God complains almost in human terms and, with man’s feelings, as if He repented
of his choice, saying: “It repenteth Me that I have appointed Saul king: for he hath forsaken
Me, and hath not performed My words;” and again: “But Samuel was grieved for Saul because
the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.”379 Finally this that He afterwards
executed, that the Lord also declares by the prophet Ezekiel that He will by His daily judgment
do with all men, saying: “Yea, if I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live, and he
trusting in his righteousness commit iniquity: all his righteousness shall be forgotten, and
in his iniquity which he hath committed, in the same he shall die. And if I shall say to the
wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and if he repent of his sin and do judgment and righteousness,
and if that wicked man restore the pledge and render what he hath robbed, and walk in the
commandments of life, and do no righteous thing, he shall surely live, he shall not die. None
of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed unto him.”380 Finally, when the Lord
would for their speedy fall turn away His merciful countenance from the people, whom He
had chosen out of all nations, the giver of the law interposes on their behalf and cries out:
“I beseech Thee, O Lord, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves
gods of gold; and now if Thou forgivest their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Thy
book which Thou hast written. To whom the Lord answered: If any man hath sinned before

<note type="footnote">380 Ezek. xxxiii. 13–16.</note>

<pb n="1213"/>
Me, I will blot him out of My book.”381 David also, when complaining in prophetic spirit
of Judas and the Lord’s persecutors, says: “Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;”
and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of the guilt of their
great sin, he subjoins: “And let them not be written among the righteous.”382 Finally in the
case of Judas himself the meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his
deadly sin was completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might not after his name
was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve to be once more written among the
righteous in heaven. We must therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by
Christ and obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of
the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the words: “Rejoice not because the devils
are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”383 But because
he was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out from that
heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him by the prophet: “O Lord, let all
those that forsake Thee be confounded. Let them that depart from Thee be written in the
earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.” And elsewhere: “They
shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house
of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel.”384</p>

<head>How saintly men cannot be hard and obstinate.</head>
<p>Nor must we emit the value of that command because even if we have bound ourselves
by some oath under the influence of anger or some other passion, (a thing which ought
never to be done by a monk) still the case for each side should be weighed by a thorough
judgment of the mind, and the course on which we have determined should be compared
to that which we are urged to adopt, and we should without hesitation adopt that which on
the occurrence of sounder considerations is decided to be the best. For it is better to put our
promise on one side than to undergo the loss of something good and more desirable. Finally
we never remember that venerable and approved fathers were hard and unyielding in decisions
of this sort, but as wax under the influence of heat, so they were modified by reason,
and when sounder counsels prevailed, did not hesitate to give in to the better side. But those
whom we have seen obstinately clinging to their determinations we have always set down
as unreasonable and wanting in judgment.</p>

<p>Germanus: So far as this consideration is concerned which has been clearly and fully
treated of, a monk ought never to determine anything for fear lest he turn out a breaker of
his word or else obstinate. And what then can we make of this saying of the Psalmist: “I
have sworn and am purposed to keep Thy righteous judgments?”385 What is “to swear and
purpose” except to keep one’s determinations fixedly?</p>

<pb n="1216"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<head>The answer telling in what cases the determination is to be kept fixedly, and in what cases it
may be broken if need be.</head>
<p>Joseph: We do not lay this down with regard to those fundamental commands, without
which our salvation cannot in any way exist, but with regard to those which we can either
relax or hold fast to without endangering our state, as for instance, an unbroken and strict
fast, or total abstinence from wine or oil, or entire prohibition to leave one’s cell, or incessant
attention to reading and meditation, all of which can be practised at pleasure, without
damage to our profession and purpose, and, if need be, can be given up without blame. But
we must most resolutely make up our minds to observe those fundamental commands, and
not even, if need arise, to avoid death in their cause, with regard to which we must immovably
assert: “I have sworn and am purposed.” And this should be done for the preservation of
love, for which all things else should be disregarded lest the beauty and perfection of its
calm should suffer a stain. In the same way we must swear for the purity of our chastity,
and we ought to do the same for faith, and sobriety and justice, to all of which we must cling
with unchangeable persistence, and to forsake which even for a little is worthy of blame.
But in the case of those bodily exercises, which are said to be profitable for a little,386 we
must, as we said, decide in such a way that, if there occurs any more decided opportunity
for a good act, which would lead us to relax them, we need not be bound by any rule about
them, but may give them up and freely adopt what is more useful. For in the case of those
bodily exercises, if they are dropped for a time, there is no danger: but to have given up
these others even for a moment is deadly.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<head>How we ought to do those things which are to be kept secret.</head>
<p>You must also provide with the same care that if by chance some word has slipped out
of your mouth which you want to be a secret, no injunction to secrecy may trouble the
hearer. For it will be more likely to be unheeded if it is let pass carelessly and simply, because
the brother, whoever he is, will not be tormented with such a temptation to divulge it, as he
will take it as something trivial dropped in casual conversation, and as what is for this very
reason of less account, because it was not committed to the hearer’s mind with a strict injunction
to silence. For even if you bind his faith by exacting an oath from him, you need
not doubt that it will very soon be divulged; for a fiercer assault of the devil’s power will be
made upon him, both to annoy and betray you, and to make him break his oath as quickly
as possible.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
<pb n="1218"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
<head>That no determination should be made on those things which concern the needs of the common
life.</head>
<p>And therefore a monk ought not hastily to make any promise on those things which
merely concern bodily exercise, for fear lest he may stir up the enemy still more to attack
what he is keeping as it were under the observance of the law, and so he may be more
readily compelled to break it. Since every one who lives under the grace of liberty, and sets
himself a law, thereby binds himself in a dangerous slavery, so that if by chance necessity
constrains him to do what he might have ventured on lawfully, and indeed laudably and
with thanksgiving, he is forced to act as a transgressor, and to fall into sin: “for where there
is no law there is no transgression.”387</p>
<p>By this instruction and the teaching of the blessed Joseph we were confirmed as by a
Divine oracle and made up our minds to stop in Egypt. But though henceforward we were
but a little anxious about our promise, yet when seven years were over we were very glad to
fulfil it. For we hastened to our monastery, at a time when we were confident of obtaining
permission to return to the desert, and first paid our respects properly to our Elders; next
we revived the former love in their minds as out of the ardour of their love they had not
been at all softened by our very frequent letters to satisfy them, and in the last place, we entirely
removed the sting of our broken promise and returned to the recesses of the desert of
Scete, as they themselves forwarded us with joy.</p>
<p>This learning and doctrine of the illustrious fathers, our ignorance, O holy brother, has
to the best of its ability made plain to you. And if perhaps our clumsy style has confused it
instead of setting it in order, I trust that the blame which our clumsiness deserves will not
interfere with the praise due to these grand men. Since it seemed to us a safer course in the
sight of our Judge to state even in unadorned style this splendid doctrine rather than to hold
our tongues about it, since if he considers the grandeur of the thoughts, the fact that the
awkwardness of our style annoys him, need not be prejudicial to the profit of the reader,
and for our part we are more anxious about its usefulness than its being praised. This at
least I charge all those into whose hand this little book may fall; viz., that they must know
that whatever in it pleases them belongs to the fathers, and whatever they dislike is all our
own.388</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>When by the help of the grace of Christ I had published ten Conferences of the Fathers,
which were composed at the urgent request of the most blessed Helladius and Leontius, I
dedicated seven others to Honoratus, a Bishop blessed in name as well as merits, and also
to that holy servant of Christ, Eucherius. The same number also I have thought good to
dedicate now to you, O holy brothers, Jovinianus, Minervius, Leontius, and Theodore.1
Since the last named of you founded that holy and splendid monastic rule in the province
of Gaul, with the strictness of ancient virtue, while the rest of you by your instructions have
stirred up monks not only before all to seek the common life of the Coenobia, but even to
thirst eagerly for the sublime life of the anchorite. For those Conferences of the best of the
fathers are arranged with such care, and so carefully considered in all respects, that they are
suited to both modes of life whereby you have made not only the countries of the West, but
even the isles to flourish with great crowds of brethren; i.e., I mean that not only those who
still remain in congregations with praiseworthy subjection to rule, but those also who retire
to no great distance from your monasteries, and try to carry out the rule of anchorites, may
be more fully instructed, according as the nature of the place and the character of their
condition may require. And to this your previous efforts and labours have especially contributed
this, that, as they are already prepared and practiced in these exercises, they can
more readily receive the precepts and institutes of the Elders, and receiving into their cells
the authors of the Conferences together with the actual volumes of the Conferences and
talking with them after a fashion by daily questions and answers, they may not be left to
their own resources to find that way which is difficult and almost unknown in this country,
but full of danger even there where well-worn paths and numberless instances of those who
have gone before are not wanting, but may rather learn to follow the rule of the anchorite’s
life taught by their examples, whom ancient tradition and industry and long experience
have thoroughly instructed.</p>

<head>THE THIRD PART OF THE CONFERENCES

<head>XVIII. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PIAMUN.
ON THE THREE SORTS OF MONKS.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1222"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How we came to Diolcos and were received by Abbot Piamun.2</head>
<p>After visiting and conversing with those three Elders, whose Conferences we have at
the instance of our brother Eucherius tried to describe, as we were still more ardently desirous
to seek out the further parts of Egypt, in which a larger and more perfect company of saints
dwelt, we came—urged not so much by the necessities of our journey as by the desire of
visiting the saints who were dwelling there—to a village named Diolcos,3 lying on one of
the seven mouths of the river Nile. For when we heard of very many and very celebrated
monasteries founded by the ancient fathers, like most eager merchants, at once we undertook
the journey on an uncertain quest, urged on by the hope of greater gain. And when we
wandered about there for some long time and fixed our curious eyes on those mountains
of virtue conspicuous for their lofty height, the gaze of those around first singled out Abbot
Piamun, the senior of all the anchorites living there and their presbyter, as if he were some
tall lighthouse. For he was set on the top of a high mountain like that city in the gospel,4
and at once shed his light on our faces, whose virtues and miracles, which were wrought by
him under our very eyes, Divine Grace thus bearing witness to his excellence, if we are not
to exceed the plan and limits of this volume, we feel we must pass over in silence. For we
promised to commit to memory what we could recollect, not of the miracles of God, but of
the institutes and pursuits of the saints, so as to supply our readers merely with necessary
instruction for the perfect life, and not with matter for idle and useless admiration without
any correction of their faults. And so when Abbot Piamun had received us with welcome,
and had refreshed us with becoming kindness, as he understood that we were not of the
same country, he first asked us anxiously whence or why we had visited Egypt, and when
he discovered that we had come thither from a monastery in Syria out of desire for perfection
he began as follows:—</p>
<note type="footnote">2 Piamun, who has been already spoken of in XVII. xxiv., is also mentioned by Rufinus (History of the Monks,
c. xxxii.), Palladius (the Lausiac History, clxxii.), and Sozomen (H. E. VI. xxix.), all of whom tell, with slight
variations, the same story, how that one day while he was officiating at the altar, he saw an angel writing down
the names of some of the brethren, and passing by the names of others, all of whom Piamun on subsequent inquiry
found to have been guilty of some grievous sin.</note>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The words of Abbot Piamun, how monks who were novices ought to be taught by the example
of their elders.</head>
<p>Whatever man, my children, is desirous to attain skill in any art, unless he gives himself
up with the utmost pains and carefulness to the study of that system which he is anxious to
learn, and observes the rules and orders of the best masters of that work or science, is indulging
in a vain hope to reach by idle wishes any similarity to those whose pains and diligence
he avoids copying. For we know that some have come from your country to these parts,
only to go round the monasteries for the sake of getting to know the brethren, not meaning
to adopt the rules and regulations, for the sake of which they travelled hither, nor to retire
to the cells and aim at carrying out in action what they had learnt by sight or by teaching.
And these people retained their character and pursuits to which they had grown accustomed,
and, as is thrown in their teeth by some, are held to have changed their country not for the
sake of their profit, but owing to the need of escaping want. For in the obstinacy of their
stubborn mind, they not only could learn nothing, but actually would not stay any longer
in these parts. For if they changed neither their method of fasting, nor their scheme of
Psalms, nor even the fashion of their garments, what else could we think that they were after
in this country, except only the supply of their victuals.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How the juniors ought not to discuss the orders of the seniors.</head>
<p>Wherefore if, as we believe, the cause of God has drawn you to try to copy our knowledge,
you must utterly ignore all the rules by which your early beginnings were trained, and must
with all humility follow whatever you see our Elders do or teach. And do not be troubled
or drawn away and diverted from imitating it, even if for the moment the cause or reason
of any deed or action is not clear to you, because if men have good and simple ideas on all
things and are anxious faithfully to copy whatever they see taught or done by their Elders,
instead of discussing it, then the knowledge of all things will follow through experience of
the work. But he will never enter into the reason of the truth, who begins to learn by discussion,
because as the enemy sees that he trusts to his own judgment rather than to that of the
fathers’ he easily urges him on so far till those things which are especially useful and helpful
seem to him unnecessary or injurious, and the crafty foe so plays upon his presumption,
that by obstinately clinging to his own opinion he persuades himself that only that is holy,
which he himself in his pig-headed error thinks to be good and right.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1225"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of the three sorts of monks which there are in Egypt.</head>
<p>Wherefore you should first hear how or whence the system and beginning of our order
took its rise. For only then can a man at all effectually be trained in any art he may wish,
and be urged on to practise it diligently, when he has learnt the glory of its authors and
founders. There are three kinds of monks in Egypt, of which two are admirable, the third
is a poor sort of thing and by all means to be avoided. The first is that of the Coenobites, who
live together in a congregation and are governed by the direction of a single Elder: and of
this kind there is the largest number of monks dwelling throughout the whole of Egypt. The
second is that of the anchorites, who were first trained in the Coenobium and then being
made perfect in practical life chose the recesses of the desert: and in this order we also hope
to gain a place. The third is the reprehensible one of the Sarabaites.5 And of these we will
discourse more fully one by one in order. Of these three orders then you ought, as we said,
first to know about the founders. For at once from this there may arise either a hatred for
the order which is to be avoided, or a longing for that which is to be followed, because each
way is sure to carry the man who follows it, to that end which its author and discoverer has
reached.</p>

<head>Of the founders who originated the order of Coenobites.</head>
<p>And so the system of Coenobites took its rise in the days of the preaching of the Apostles.
For such was all that multitude of believers in Jerusalem, which is thus described in the Acts
of the Apostles: “But the multitude of believers was of one heart and one soul, neither said
any of them that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things
common. They sold their possessions and property and divided them to all, as any man had
need.” And again: “For neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as possessed
fields or houses, sold them and brought the price of the things that they sold and laid
them before the feet of the Apostles: and distribution was made to every man as he had
need.”6 The whole Church, I say, was then such as now are those few who can be found
with difficulty in Coenobia. But when at the death of the Apostles the multitude of believers
began to wax cold, and especially that multitude which had come to the faith of Christ from
diverse foreign nations, from whom the Apostles out of consideration for the infancy of
their faith and their ingrained heathen habits, required nothing more than that they should
“abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from fornication, and from things strangled,
and from blood,”7 and so that liberty which was conceded to the Gentiles because of the
weakness of their newly-born faith, had by degrees begun to mar the perfection of that
Church which existed at Jerusalem, and the fervour of that early faith cooled down owing
to the daily increasing number both of natives and foreigners, and not only those who had
accepted the faith of Christ, but even those who were the leaders of the Church relaxed
somewhat of that strictness. For some fancying that what they saw permitted to the Gentiles
because of their weakness, was also allowable for themselves, thought that they would suffer
no loss if they followed the faith and confession of Christ keeping their property and possessions.
But those who still maintained the fervour of the apostles, mindful of that former
perfection left their cities and intercourse with those who thought that carelessness and a
laxer life was permissible to themselves and the Church of God, and began to live in rural
and more sequestered spots, and there, in private and on their own account, to practise
those things which they had learnt to have been ordered by the apostles throughout the
whole body of the Church in general: and so that whole system of which we have spoken
grew up from those disciples who had separated themselves from the evil that was spreading.
And these, as by degrees time went on, were separated from the great mass of believers and
because they abstained from marriage and cut themselves off from intercourse with their
kinsmen and the life of this world, were termed monks or solitaries from the strictness of
<note type="footnote">6 Acts iv. 32; ii. 45; iv. 34, 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">7 Acts xv. 29.</note>

<pb n="1227"/>
their lonely and solitary life. Whence it followed that from their common life they were
called Coenobites and their cells and lodgings Coenobia. That then alone was the earliest
kind of monks, which is first not only in time but also in grace, and which continued unbroken
for a very long period up to the time of Abbot Paul and Antony; and even to this
day we see its traces remaining in strict coenobia.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the system of the Anchorites and its beginning.</head>
<p>Out of this number of the perfect, and, if I may use the expression, this most fruitful
root of saints, were produced afterwards the flowers and fruits of the anchorites as well.
And of this order we have heard that the originators were those whom we mentioned just
now; viz., Saint Paul8 and Antony, men who frequented the recesses of the desert, not as
some from faintheartedness, and the evil of impatience, but from a desire for loftier heights
of perfection and divine contemplation, although the former of them is said to have found
his way to the desert by reason of necessity, while during the time of persecution he was
avoiding the plots of his neighbours. So then there sprang from that system of which we
have spoken another sort of perfection, whose followers are rightly termed anchorites; i.e.,
withdrawers, because, being by no means satisfied with that victory whereby they had
trodden under foot the hidden snares of the devil, while still living among men, they were
eager to fight with the devils in open conflict, and a straightforward battle, and so feared
not to penetrate the vast recesses of the desert, imitating, to wit, John the Baptist, who passed
all his life in the desert, and Elijah and Elisha and those of whom the Apostle speaks as follows:
“They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted,
of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, in mountains and in dens and in
caves of the earth.” Of whom too the Lord speaks figuratively to Job: “But who hath sent
out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bands? To whom I have given the wilderness
for an house, and a barren land for his dwelling. He scorneth the multitude of the city and
heareth not the cry of the driver; he looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and
seeketh for every green thing.” In the Psalms also: “Let now the redeemed of the Lord say,
those whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;” and after a little: “They
wandered in a wilderness in a place without water: they found not the way of a city of habitation.
They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them. And they cried unto the
Lord in their trouble and He delivered them out of their distress;” whom Jeremiah too describes
as follows: “Blessed is the man that hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit
solitary and hold his peace because he hath taken it up upon himself,” and there sing in
<note type="footnote">8 Paul was from very early days celebrated as the first of the anchorites. Indeed S. Jerome, who wrote his life
(Works, Vol. ii. p. 13 ed. Migne) calls him “auctor vitæ monasticæ” (Ep. xxii. ad Eustochium). He is said to have
fled to the Thebaid from the terrors of the Decian persecution, and to have died there in extreme old age. Antony
has already been several times mentioned by Cassian. See the Institutes V. iv.: Conference II. ii.; III. iv., etc.</note>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>Of the origin of the Sarabaites and their mode of life.</head>
<p>And while the Christian religion was rejoicing in these two orders of monks though
this system had begun by degrees to deteriorate, there arose afterwards that disgusting and
unfaithful kind of monks; or rather, that baleful plant revived and sprang up again which
when it first shot up in the persons of Ananias and Sapphira in the early Church was cut off
by the severity of the Apostle Peter—a kind which among monks has been for a long while
considered detestable and execrable, and which was adopted by no one any more, so long
as there remained stamped on the memory of the faithful the dread of that very severe sentence,
in which the blessed Apostle not merely refused to allow the aforesaid originators of
the novel crime to be cured by penitence or any amends, but actually destroyed that most
dangerous germ by their speedy death. When then that precedent, which was punished with
Apostolical severity in the case of Ananias and Sapphira had by degrees faded from the
minds of some, owing to long carelessness and forgetfulness from lapse of time, there arose
the race of Sarabaites, who owing to the fact that they have broken away from the congregations
of the Coenobites and each look after their own affairs, are rightly named in the
Egyptian language Sarabaites,10 and these spring from the number of those, whom we have
mentioned, who wanted to imitate rather than truly to aim at Evangelical perfection, urged
thereto by rivalry or by the praises of those who preferred the complete poverty of Christ
to all manner of riches. These then while in their feeble mind they make a pretence of the
greatest goodness and are forced by necessity to join this order, while they are anxious to
be reckoned by the name of monks without emulating their pursuits, in no sort of way
practise discipline, or are subject to the will of the Elders, or, taught by their traditions, learn
to govern their own wills or take up and properly learn any rule of sound discretion; but
making their renunciation only as a public profession, i.e., before the face of men, either
continue in their homes devoted to the same occupations as before, though dignified by
this title, or building cells for themselves and calling them monasteries remain in them
perfectly free and their own masters, never submitting to the precepts of the gospel, which
forbid them to be busied with any anxiety for the day’s food, or troubles about domestic
<note type="footnote">10 Sarabaites, this third sort of monks whom Cassian here paints in such dark colours, are spoken of by S.
Jerome (Ep. xxii. ad Eustochium) under the name of Remoboth. The origin of both names is obscure, but Jerome
and Cassian are quite at one in their scorn for these pretended monks. S. Benedict begins his monastic rule by
describing the four kinds of monks, coenobites, anchorites, sarabaites, and a fourth class to which he gives the
name of “gyrovagi,” i e., wandering monks; these must be those of whom Cassian speaks below in c. viii. without
giving them any definite name. See further Bingham, Antiquities VII. ii., and the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,

matters: commands which those alone fulfil with no unbelieving doubt, who have freed
themselves from all the goods of this world and subjected themselves to the superiors of the
Coenobia so that they cannot admit that they are at all their own masters. But those who,
as we said, shirk the severity of the monastery, and live two or three together in their cells,
not satisfied to be under the charge and rule of an Abbot, but arranging chiefly for this; viz.,
that they may get rid of the yoke of the Elders and have liberty to carry out their wishes and
go and wander where they will, and do what they like, these men are more taken up both
day and night in daily business than those who live in the Coenobia, but not with the same
faith and purpose. For these Sarabaites do it not to submit the fruits of their labours to the
will of the steward, but to procure money to lay by. And see what a difference there is between
them. For the others think nothing of the morrow, and offer to God the most acceptable
fruits of their toil: while these extend their faithless anxiety not only to the morrow, but
even to the space of many years, and so fancy that God is either false or impotent as He
either could not or would not grant them the promised supply of food and clothing. The
one seek this in all their prayers; viz., that they may gain ἀκτημοσύνην, i.e., the deprivation
of all things, and lasting poverty: the other that they may secure a rich quantity of all sorts
of supplies. The one eagerly strive to go beyond the fixed rule of daily work that whatever
is not wanted for the sacred purposes of the monastery, may be distributed at the will of the
Abbot either among the prisons, or in the guest-chamber or in the infirmary or to the poor;
the others that whatever the day’s gorge leaves over, may be useful for extravagant wants or
else laid by through the sin of covetousness. Lastly, if we grant that what has been collected
by them with no good design, may be disposed of in better ways than we have men tioned,
yet not even thus do they rise to the merits of goodness and perfection. For the others bring
in such returns to the monastery, and daily report to them, and continue in such humility
and subjection that they are deprived of their rights over what they gain by their own efforts,
just as they are of their rights over themselves, as they constantly renew the fervour of their
original act of renunciation, while they daily deprive themselves of the fruits of their labours:
but these are puffed up by the fact that they are bestowing something on the poor, and daily
fall headlong into sin. The one party are by patience and the strictness whereby they continue
devoutly in the order which they have once embraced, so as never to fulfil their own will,
crucified daily to this world and made living martyrs; the others are cast down into hell by
the lukewarmness of their purpose. These two sorts of monks then vie with each other in
almost equal numbers in this province; but in other provinces, which the need of the Catholic
faith compelled me to visit, we have found that this third class of Sarabaites flourishes
and is almost the only one, since in the time of Lucius who was a Bishop of Arian misbelief11
<note type="footnote">11 Lucius took the lead of the Arian party at Alexandria after the murder of George of Cappadocia in 361,
and was put forward by his party as the candidate for the see which they regarded as vacant. In 373, after the
death of Athanasius, he was forced upon the reluctant Church of Alexandria by the Arian Emperor Valens, and</note>

in the reign of Valens, while we carried alms12 to our brethren; viz., those from Egypt and
the Thebaid, who had been consigned to the mines of Pontus and Armenia13 for their
steadfastness in the Catholic faith, though we found the system of Coenobia in some cities
few and far between, yet we never made out that even the name of anchorites was heard
among them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of a fourth sort of monks.</head>
<p>There is however another and a fourth kind, which we have lately seen springing up
among those who flatter themselves with the appearance and form of anchorites, and who
in their early days seem in a brief fervour to seek the perfection of the Coenobium, but
presently cool off, and, as they dislike to put an end to their former habits and faults, and
are not satisfied to bear the yoke of humility and patience any longer, and scorn to be in
subjection to the rule of the Elders, look out for separate cells and want to remain by themselves
alone, that as they are provoked by nobody they may be regarded by men as patient,
gentle, and humble: and, this arrangement, or rather this lukewarmness never suffers those,
of whom it has once got hold, to approach to perfection. For in this way their faults are not
merely not rooted up, but actually grow worse, while they are excited by no one, like some
deadly and internal poison which the more it is concealed, so much the more deeply does
it creep in and cause an incurable disease to the sick person. For out of respect for each
man’s own cell no one ventures to reprove the faults of a solitary, which he would rather
have ignored than cured. Moreover virtues are created not by hiding faults but by driving
them out.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>The answer.</head>
<p>Piamun: Although many people indifferently speak of monasteries instead of Coenobia,
yet there is this difference, that monastery is the title of the dwelling, and means nothing
more than the place, i.e., the habitation of monks, while Coenobium describes the character
of the life and its system: and monastery may mean the dwelling of a single monk, while a
Coenobium cannot be spoken of except where dwells a united community of a large number
of men living together. They are however termed monasteries in which groups of Sarabaites
live.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of true humility, and how Abbot Serapion exposed the mock humility of a certain man.</head>
<p>Wherefore as I see that you have learnt the first principles of this life from the best sort
of monks, i.e., that starting from the excellent school of the coenobium you are aiming at
the lofty heights of the anchorite’s rule, you should with genuine feeling of heart pursue the
virtue of humility and patience, which I doubt not that you learnt there; and not feign it, as
some do, by mock humility in words, or by an artificial and unnecessary readiness for some
duties of the body. And this sham humility Abbot Serapion14 once laughed to scorn most
capitally. For when one had come to him making a great display of his lowliness by his dress
and words, and the old man urged him, after his custom, to “collect the prayer”15 he would
not consent to his request, but debasing himself declared that he was involved in such crimes
that he did not deserve even to breathe the air which is common to all, and refusing even
the use of the mat preferred to sit down on the bare ground. But when he had shown still
less inclination for the washing of the feet, then Abbot Serapion, when supper was finished,
and the customary Conference gave him an opportunity, began kindly and gently to urge
him not to roam with shifty lightmindedness over the whole world, idly and vaguely, especially
as he was young and strong, but to keep to his cell in accordance with the rule of the
Elders and to elect to be supported by his own efforts rather than by the bounty of others;
which even the Apostle Paul would not allow, and though when he was labouring in the
cause of the gospel this provision might lightly have been made for him, yet he preferred to
work night and day, to provide daily food for himself and for those who were ministering
to him and could not do the work with their own hands. Whereupon the other was filled
with such vexation and disgust that he could not hide by his looks the annoyance which he
felt in his heart. To whom the Elder: Thus far, my son, you have loaded yourself with the
weight of all kinds of crimes, not fearing lest by the confession of such awful sins you bring
a reproach upon your reputation; how is it then, I pray, that now, at our simple admonition,
which involved no reproof, but simply showed a feeling for your edification and love, I see
that you are moved with such disgust that you cannot hide it by your looks, or conceal it by
an appearance of calmness? Perhaps while you were humiliating yourself, you were hoping
to hear from our lips this saying: “The righteous man is the accuser of himself in the opening
of his discourse?”16 Further, true humility of heart must be preserved, which comes not
from an affected humbling of body and in word, but from an inward humbling of the soul:
and this will only then shine forth with clear evidences of patience when a man does not

boast about sins, which nobody will believe, but, when another insolently accuses him of
them, thinks nothing of it, and when with gentle equanimity of spirit he puts up with wrongs
offered to him.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1238"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>A question how true patience can be gained.</head>
<p>Germanus: We should like to know how that calmness can be secured and maintained,
that, as when silence is enjoined on us we shut the door of our mouth, and lay an embargo
on speech, so also we may be able to preserve gentleness of heart, which sometimes even
when the tongue is restrained loses its state of calmness within: and for this reason we think
that the blessing of gentleness can only be preserved by one in a remote cell and solitary
dwelling.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="1239"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The answer.</head>
<p>Piamun: True patience and tranquillity is neither gained nor retained without profound
humility of heart: and if it has sprung from this source, there will be no need either of the
good offices of the cell or of the refuge of the desert. For it will seek no external support
from anything, if it has the internal support of the virtue of humility, its mother and its
guardian. But if we are disturbed when attacked by anyone it is clear that the foundations
of humility have not been securely laid in us, and therefore at the outbreak even of a small
storm, our whole edifice is shaken and ruinously disturbed. For patience would not be
worthy of praise and admiration if it only preserved its purposed tranquillity when attacked
by no darts of enemies, but it is grand and glorious because when the storms of temptation
beat upon it, it remains unmoved. For wherein it is believed that a man is annoyed and hurt
by adversity, therein is he strengthened the more; and he is therein the more exercised,
wherein he is thought to be annoyed. For everybody knows that patience gets its name from
the passions and endurance, and so it is clear that no one can be called patient but one who
bears without annoyance all the indignities offered to him, and so it is not without reason
that he is praised by Solomon: “Better is the patient man than the strong, and he who restrains
his anger than he who takes a city;” and again: “For a long-suffering man is mighty in
prudence, but a faint-hearted man is very foolish.”17 When then anyone is overcome by a
wrong, and blazes up in a fire of anger, we should not hold that the bitterness of the insult
offered to him is the cause of his sin, but rather the manifestation of secret weakness, in accordance
with the parable of our Lord and Saviour which He spoke about the two houses,18
one of which was founded upon a rock, and the other upon the sand, on both of which He
says that the tempest of rain and waters and storm beat equally: but that one which was
founded on the solid rock felt no harm at all from the violence of the shock, while that which
was built on the shifting and moving sand at once collapsed. And it certainly appears that
it fell, not because it was struck by the rush of the storms and torrents, but because it was
imprudently built upon the sand. For a saint does not differ from a sinner in this, that he is
not himself tempted in the same way, but because he is not worsted even by a great assault,
while the other is overcome even by a slight temptation. For the fortitude of any good man
would not, as we said, be worthy of praise, if his victory was gained without his being
tempted, as most certainly there is no room for victory where there is no struggle and conflict:
for “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he has been proved he shall receive
the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love Him.”19 According to the
<note type="footnote">17 Prov. xvi. 32; xiv. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">18 Cf. S. Matt. vii. 24, 59.</note>
<note type="footnote">19 S. James i. 12.</note>

<pb n="1240"/>
Apostle Paul also “Strength is made perfect” not in ease and delights but “in weakness.”
“For behold,” says He, “I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a
wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and to the princes thereof, and to the
priests thereof, and to all the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee, and shall
not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.”20</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>Of the example of patience given by a certain religious woman.</head>
<p>Of this patience then I want to give you at least two examples: one of a certain religious
woman, who aimed at the virtue of patience so eagerly that she not only did not avoid the
assaults of temptation, but actually made for herself occasions of trouble that she might not
cease to be tried more often. For this woman as she was living at Alexandria and was born
of no mean ancestors, and was serving the Lord religiously in the house which had been left
to her by her parents, came to Athanasius the Bishop, of blessed memory, and entreated
him to give her some other widow to support, who was being provided for at the expense
of the Church. And, to give her petition in her own words: “Give me,” she said, “one of the
sisters to look after.” When then the Bishop had commended the woman’s purpose because
he saw that she was very ready for a work of a mercy, he ordered a widow to be chosen out
of the whole number, who was preferred to all the rest for the goodness of her character,
and her grave and well-regulated life, for fear lest her wish to be liberal might be overcome
by the fault of the recipient of her bounty, and she who sought gain out of the poor might
be disgusted at her bad character and so suffer an injury to her faith. And when the woman
was brought home, she ministered to her with all kinds of service, and found out her excellent
modesty and gentleness, and saw that every minute she was honoured by thanks from her
for her kind offices, and so after a few days she came back to the aforesaid Bishop, and said:
I asked you to bid that a woman be given to me for me to support and to serve with obedient
complaisance. And when he, not yet understanding the woman’s object and desire, thought
that her petition had been neglected by the deceitfulness of the superior, and inquired not
without some anger in his mind, what was the reason of the delay, at once he discovered
that a widow who was better than all the rest had been assigned to her, and so he secretly
gave orders that the one who was the worst of all should be given to her, the one, I mean,
who surpassed in anger and quarrelling and wine-bibbing and talkativeness all who were
under the power of these faults. And when she was only too easily found and given to her,
she began to keep her at home, and to minister to her with the same care as to the former
widow, or even more attentively, and this was all the thanks which she got from her for her
services; viz., to be constantly tried by unworthy wrongs and continually annoyed by her
by reproaches and upbraiding, as she complained of her, and chid her with spiteful and
disparaging remarks, because she had asked for her from the Bishop not for her refreshment
but rather for her torment and annoyance, and had taken her away from rest to labour instead
of from labour to rest. When then her continual reproaches broke out so far that the wanton
woman did not restrain herself from laying hands on her, the other only redoubled her
services in still humbler offices, and learnt to overcome the vixen not by resisting her, but
by subjecting herself still more humbly, so that, when provoked by all kinds of indignities,

<pb n="1242"/>
she might smooth down the madness of the shrew by gentleness and kindness. And when
she had been thoroughly strengthened by these exercises, and had attained the perfect virtue
of the patience she had longed for, she came to the aforesaid Bishop to thank him for his
decision and choice as well as for the blessing of her exercise, because he had at last as she
wished provided her with a most worthy mistress for her patience, strengthened daily by
whose constant annoyance as by some oil for wrestling, she had arrived at complete patience
of mind; and, at last, said she, you have given me one to support, for the former one rather
honoured and refreshed me by her services. This may be sufficient to have told about the
female sex, that by this tale we may not only be edified, but even confounded, as we cannot
maintain our patience unless we are like wild beasts removed in caves and cells.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>Of the example of patience given by Abbot Paphnutius.</head>
<p>Now let us give the other instance of Abbot Paphnutius, who always remained so zealously
in the recesses of that renowned and far-famed desert of Scete, in which he is now
Presbyter, so that the rest of the anchorites gave him the name of Bubalis,21 because he always
delighted in dwelling in the desert as if with a sort of innate liking. And so as even in boyhood
he was so good and full of grace that even the renowned and great men of that time admired
his gravity and steadfast constancy, and although he was younger in age, yet put him on a
level with the Elders out of regard for his virtues, and thought fit to admit him to their order,
the same envy, which formerly excited the minds of his brethren against the patriarch Joseph,
inflamed one out of the number of his brethren with a burning and consuming jealousy.
And this man wanting to mar his beauty by some blemish or spot, hit on this kind of devilry,
so as to seize an opportunity when Paphnutius had left his cell to go to Church on Sunday:
and secretly entering his cell he slyly hid his own book among the boughs which he used to
weave of palm branches, and, secure of his well-planned trick, himself went off as if with a
pure and clean conscience to Church. And when the whole service was ended as usual, in
the presence of all the brethren he brought his complaint to S. Isidore22 who was Presbyter
of this desert before this same Paphnutius, and declared that his book had been stolen from
his cell. And when his complaint had so disturbed the minds of all the brethren, and more
especially of the Presbyter, so that they knew not what first to suspect or think, as all were
overcome with the utmost astonishment at so new and unheard of a crime, such as no one
remembered ever to have been committed in that desert before that time, and which has
never happened since, he who had brought forward the matter as the accuser urged that
they should all be kept in Church and certain selected men be sent to search the cells of the
brethren one by one. And when this had been entrusted to three of the Elders by the Presbyter,
they turned over the bed-chambers of them all, and at last found the book hidden in
the cell of Paphnutius among the boughs of the palms which they call σειρά, just as the
plotter had hidden it. And when the inquisitors at once brought it back to the Church and
produced it before all, Paphnutius, although he was perfectly clear in the sincerity of his
conscience, yet like one who acknowledged the guilt of thieving, gave himself up entirely
to make amends and humbly asked for a plan of repentance, as he was so careful of his
shame and modesty (and feared) lest if he tried to remove the stain of the theft by words,

he might further be branded as a liar, as no one would believe anything but what had been
found out. And when he had immediately left the Church not cast down in mind but rather
trusting to the judgment of God, he continually shed tears at his prayers, and fasted thrice
as often as before, and prostrated himself in the sight of men with all humility of mind. But
when he had thus submitted himself with all contrition of flesh and spirit for almost a fortnight,
so that he came early on the morning of Saturday and Sunday not to receive the Holy
Communion23 but to prostrate himself on the threshold of the Church and humbly ask for
pardon, He, Who is the witness of all secret things and knows them, suffered him to be no
longer tried by Himself or defamed by others. For what the author of the crime, the wicked
thief of his own property, the cunning defamer of another’s credit, had done with no man
there as a witness, that He made known by means of the devil who was himself the instigator
of the sin. For possessed by a most fierce demon, he made known all the craft of his secret
plot, and the same man who had conceived the accusation and the cheat betrayed it. But he
was so long and grievously vexed by that unclean spirit that he could not even be restored
by the prayers of the saints living there, who by means of divine gifts can command the
devils, nor could the special grace of the Presbyter Isidore himself cast out from him his
cruel tormentor, though by the Lord’s bounty such power was given him that no one who
was possessed was ever brought to his doors without being at once healed; for Christ was
reserving this glory for the young Paphnutius, that the man should be cleansed only by the
prayers of him against whom he had plotted, and that the jealous enemy should receive
pardon for his offence and an end of his present punishment, only by proclaiming his name,
from whose credit he had thought that he could detract. He then in his early youth already
gave these signs of his future character, and even in his boyish years sketched the lines of
that perfection which was to grow up in mature age. If then we want to attain to his height
of virtue, we must lay the same foundation to begin with.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>On the perfection of patience.</head>
<p>A twofold reason however led me to relate this fact, first that we may weigh this steadfastness
and constancy of the man, and as we are attacked by less serious wiles of the enemy,
may the better secure a greater feeling of calmness and patience, secondly that we may with
resolute decision hold that we cannot be safe from the storms of temptation and assaults of
the devil if we make all the protection for our patience and all our confidence consist not
in the strength of our inner man but in the doors of our cell or the recesses of the desert,
and companionship of the saints, or the safeguard of anything else outside us. For unless
our mind is strengthened by the power of His protection Who says in the gospel “the kingdom
of God is within you,”24 in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy
foe by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by distance of place,
or exclude them by the protection of walls. For though none of these things was wanting to
Saint Paphnutius yet the tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack
him; nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the merits of all those saints
in the congregation repulse that most foul spirit. But because the holy servant of God had
fixed the hope of his heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all
secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an assault as that. On the
other hand did not the man whom envy had hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit
of solitude and the protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed Abbot
and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm raised by the devil found
him upon the sand, it not only drove in his house but actually overturned it. We need not
then seek for our peace in externals, nor fancy that another person’s patience can be of any
use to the faults of our impatience. For just as “the kingdom of God is within you,” so “a
man’s foes are they of his own household.”25 For no one is more my enemy than my own
heart which is truly the one of my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful,
we cannot possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own household
are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is secured in peace of heart. For if you
diligently investigate the matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do
not fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault is not owing to the
other’s attack, but to my own impatience. For as strong and solid food is good for a man in
good health, so it is bad for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the
weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any similar temptation ever arises
among brethren, we need never be shaken out of the even tenor of our ways and give an
<note type="footnote">24 S. Luke xvii. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">25 S. Matt. x. 36.</note>

<pb n="1246"/>
opening to the blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad
and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the saints, because so
long as we are trodden down and trampled in the threshing floor of this world, the chaff
which is destined for eternal fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat.
Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and Judas among the
apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable heresy among the deacons, it will be no
wonder that the basest of men are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some
maintain that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of the
ministry by the Apostles,26 nevertheless they cannot deny that he was of the number of the
disciples, all of whom were clearly of such a character and so perfect as those few whom we
can now with difficulty discover in the Coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of
the above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a collapse, nor that
horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the copious tears of his penitence, but the
example of the blessed Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former,
whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his affected piety, but let us
imitate with all our might the humility of the latter, which in his case was no sudden production
of the quiet of the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated
and perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is harder to be
cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a man whom it has once tainted with
the mischief of its poison is without a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively
said by the prophet: “Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there
is no charm: and they shall bite you.”27 Rightly then are the stings of envy compared by the
prophet to the deadly poison of basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their
chief perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was envious, and destroyed
himself before that he poured forth the poison of death against man: for “by the envy
of the devil death entered into the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him.”28
For just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that evil, admitted no remedy
of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so those also who have given themselves up to be
smitten by the same pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are
<note type="footnote">26 As Cassian here implies, considerable doubt exists whether the Nicholas from whom the sect of the Nicolaitans
(Rev. ii. 15) derive their name was the same person as Nicholas the last of the seven “deacons” mentioned
in Acts vi. 5. According to Irenæus (Hær. I. xxvi.) the Nicolaitans themselves claimed him as their founder, and
the claim is allowed by Hippolytus (Philos. vii. § 36), Epiphanius (Hær. I. ii. § 25), and other writers of the fourth
century. Clement of Alexandria however disputes the claim (Strom. III. iv. and cf. Euseb. H. E. III. xxix.), as
does Theodoret (Hær. Tab. iii. 1).</note>

tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they are jealous, they
are ashamed to display the real truth and look out for some external unnecessary and trifling
causes of offence: and of these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure,
while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their veins. Of which the
wisest of men has fitly said: “If a serpent bite without hissing, there is no supply for the
charmer.”29 For those are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no succour.
For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by attentions, it is increased by services,
is irritated by presents, because as the same Solomon says: “envy endures nothing.”30 For
just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or in the virtue of
patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man excited by worse pricks of envy, because
he desires nothing less than the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission
on the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven patriarchs, so
that Scripture relates of them: “But his brothers envied him because his father loved him,
and they could not speak peaceably unto him”31 until their jealousy, which would not listen
to any entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother, desired his death,
and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of selling a brother. It is plain then that envy is
worse than all faults, and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which
the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a loss that has been
caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation: one who is sore owing to a wrong done
to him, is appeased by humble satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is
the more offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is not aroused
to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or by any injurious attack or love
of vengeance, which is overcome by obsequious services; but is only irritated by another’s
success and happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him, would
wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or to be involved in some
calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible,
in order that the serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is
flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening power of the Holy
Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e., carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty
is easily entangled and from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds
in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously inflamed, yet if any
charmer well skilled in divine incantations applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of
words of salvation, the poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul.
But the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very life of religion and
<note type="footnote">29 Eccl. x. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">30 Prov. xxvii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">31 Gen. xxxvii. 4.</note>

<pb n="1248"/>
faith, even before the wound is perceived in the body. For he does not raise himself up
against men, but, in his blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except
his felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of God. This then is
that “root of bitterness springing up”32 which raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching
the very Author Who bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because
God threatens to send “serpents, basilisks,”33 to bite those by whose crimes He is offended.
For although it is certain that God cannot be the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of
the divine judgment that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the
proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be given over “to a reprobate
mind,”34 should be smitten and consumed by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this
passage: “They have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke
them to jealousy by them that are no nation.”35</p>
<p>By this discourse the blessed Piamun excited still more keenly our desire in which we
had begun to be promoted from the infant school of the Coenobium to the second standard
of the anchorites’ life. For it was under his instruction that we made our first start in solitary
living, the knowledge of which we afterwards followed up more thoroughly in Scete.</p>

<head>XIX. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOHN.
ON THE AIM OF THE COENOBITE AND HERMIT.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1250"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the Coenobium of Abbot Paul and the patience of a certain brother.</head>
<p>After only a few days we made our way once more with great alacrity, drawn by the
desire for further instruction, to the Coenobium of Abbot Paul, where though a greater
number than two hundred of the brethren dwell there, yet, in honour of the festival which
was then being held, an enormous collection of monks from other Coenobia had come there
as well: for the anniversary of the death36 of a former Abbot who had presided over the
same monastery was being solemnly kept. And we have mentioned this assembly for this
reason that we may briefly treat of the patience of a certain brother, which was remarkable
for immovable gentleness on his part in the presence of all this congregation. For though
the object of this work has regard to another person; viz., that we may produce the utterances
of Abbot John37 who left the desert and submitted himself to that Coenobium with the utmost
goodness and humility, yet we think it not at all absurd to relate without any unnecessary
verbiage, what we think is most instructive to those who are eager for goodness. And so
when the whole body of the monks was seated in separate parties of twelve, in the large open
court, when one of the brethren had been rather slow in fetching and bringing in a dish, the
aforesaid Abbot Paul, who was busily hurrying about among the troops of brethren who
were serving, saw it and struck him such a blow before them all on his open palm that the
sound of the hand which was struck actually reached the ears of those whose backs were
turned and who were sitting some way off. But the youth of remarkable patience received
it with such calmness of mind that not only did he let no word fall from his mouth or give
the slightest sign of murmuring by the silent movements of his lips, but actually did not
change colour in the slightest degree or (lose) the modest and peaceful look about his mouth.
And this fact struck with astonishment not merely us, who had lately come from a monastery
of Syria and had not learnt the blessing of this patience by such clear examples, but all those
as well who were not without experience of such earnestness, so that by it a great lesson was
taught even to those who were well advanced, because even if this paternal correction had
not disturbed his patience, neither did the presence of so great a number bring the slightest
sign of colour to his cheeks.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of Abbot John’s humility and our question.</head>
<p>In this Coenobium then we found a very old man named John, whose words and humility
we think ought certainly not to be passed over in silence as in them he excelled all the saints,
as we know that he was especially vigorous in this perfection, which though it is the mother
of all virtues and the surest foundation of the whole spiritual superstructure, yet is altogether
a stranger to our system. Wherefore it is no wonder that we cannot attain to the height of
those men, as we cannot stand the training of the Coenobium I will not say up to old age,
but are scarcely content to endure the yoke of subjection for a couple of years, and at once
escape to enjoy a dangerous liberty, while even for that short time we seem to be subject to
the rule of the Elder not according to any strict rule, but as our free will directs. When then
we had seen this old man in Abbot Paul’s Coenobium, we were struck, first by his age and
the grace with which the man was endowed, and with looks fixed on the ground began to
entreat him to vouchsafe to explain to us why he had forsaken the freedom of the desert
and that exalted profession, in which his fame and celebrity had raised him above others
who had adopted the same life, and why he had chosen to enter under the yoke of the
Coenobium. He said that as he was unequal to the system of the anchorites and unworthy
of the heights of such perfection, he had gone back to the infant school, that he might learn
to carry out the lessons taught there, according as the life demanded. And when our entreaties
were not satisfied and we refused to take this humble answer, at last he began as follows.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1252"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Abbot John’s answer why he had left the desert.</head>
<p>The system of the anchorites, which you are surprised at my leaving, I not only neither
reject nor refuse, but rather embrace and regard with the utmost veneration: in which system,
and after I had passed thirty years living in a Coenobium, I rejoice that I have also spent
twenty more, so that I can never be accused of sloth among those who tried it in a halfhearted
way. But because its purity, of which I had had some slight experience, was sometimes
soiled by the presence of anxiety about carnal matters, it seemed better to return to the
Coenobium to secure a readier attainment of an easier aim undertaken, and less danger from
venturing on the higher life of the humble solitary.38 For it is better to seem earnest with
smaller promises than careless in larger ones. And therefore if possibly I bring forward
anything somewhat arrogantly and indeed somewhat too freely, I beg that you will not think
it due to the sin of boasting but rather to my desire for your edification; and that, as I think
that, when you ask so earnestly, nothing of the truth should be kept back from you, you will
set it down to love rather than to boasting. For I think that some instruction may be given
to you if I lay aside my humility, and simply lay bare the whole truth about my aim. For I
trust that I shall not incur any reproach of vainglory from you because of the freedom of
my words, nor any charge of falsehood from my conscience because of any suppression of
the truth.</p>
<note type="footnote">38 The true reading, as given by Petschenig, appears to be the following: Et minus de præsumptæ sublimioris
professionis humilitate periculum. It is probably on account of its difficulty that humilitate has been altered into
difficultate, as in the text of Gazet (the two humilitate difficultate are found together in some mss.). But the fact
appears to be that humilitas is here used for the life of an anchorite, as in Conference XXIV. ix., where Abbot
Abraham uses the expression districtionem hujus humilitatis. The word is also used in a similar sense in Conf.
I. xx. and XI. ii.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1253"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>Of the excellence which the aforesaid old man showed in the system of the anchorites.</head>
<p>If then anyone else delights in the recesses of the desert and would forget all human
intercourse and say with Jeremiah: “I have not desired the day of man: Thou knowest,”39 I
confess that by the blessing of God’s grace, I also secured or at any rate tried to secure this.
And so by the kind gift of the Lord I remember that I was often caught up into such an ecstasy
as to forget that I was clothed with the burden of a weak body, and my soul on a sudden
forgot all external notions and entirely cut itself off from all material objects, so that neither
my eyes nor ears performed their proper functions. And my soul was so filled with divine
meditations and spiritual contemplations that often in the evening I did not know whether
I had taken any food and on the next day was very doubtful whether I had broken my fast
yesterday. For which reason, a supply of food for seven days, i.e., seven sets of biscuits were
set apart in a sort of hand-basket,40 and laid by on Saturday, that there might be no doubt
when supper had been omitted; and by this plan another mistake also from forgetfulness
was obviated, for when the number of cakes was finished it showed that the course of the
week was over, and that the services of the same day had come round, and that the festival
and holy day and services of the congregation could not escape the notice of the solitary.
But even if that ecstasy of mind of which we have spoken should happen to interfere with
this arrangement, yet still the method of the days’ work would show the number of the days
and check the mistake. And to pass over in silence the other advantages of the desert (for it
is not our business to treat of their number and quantity, but rather of the aim of solitude
and the Coenobium) I will the rather briefly explain the reasons why I preferred to leave it,
which you also wanted to know, and will in a concise discourse glance at all those fruits of
solitude which I mentioned, and show to what greater advantages on the other side they
ought to be held inferior.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of the advantages of the desert.</head>
<p>So long then as owing to the fewness of those who were then living in the desert, a
greater freedom was afforded to us in a wider expanse of the wilderness, so long as in the
seclusion of larger retreats we were caught up to those celestial ecstasies, and were not
overwhelmed by a great quantity of brethren to visit us, and thus owing to the necessity of
showing hospitality overburdened in our thoughts by the distractions of great cares, I frequented
with insatiable desire and all my heart the peaceful retreats of the desert and that
life which can only be compared to the bliss of the angels. But when, as I said, a larger
number of the brethren began to seek a dwelling in that desert, and by cramping the freedom
of the vast wilderness, not only caused that fire of divine contemplation to grow cold, but
also entangled the mind in many ways in the chains of carnal matters, I determined to carry
out my purpose in this system rather than to grow cold in that sublime mode of life, by
providing for carnal wants; so that, if that liberty and those spiritual ecstasies are denied
me, yet as all care for the morrow is avoided, I may console myself by fulfilling the precept
of the gospel, and what I lose in sublimity of contemplation, may be made up to me by
submission and obedience. For it is a wretched thing for a man to profess to learn any art
or pursuit, and never to arrive at perfection in it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="1255"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>Of the conveniences of the Coenobium.</head>
<p>Wherefore I will briefly explain what advantages I now enjoy in this manner of life. You
must consider my words and judge whether those advantages of the desert outweigh these
comforts, and by this you will also be able to prove whether I chose to be cramped within
the narrow limits of the Coenobium from dislike or from desire of that purity of the solitary
life. In this life then there is no providing for the day’s work, no distractions of buying and
selling, no unavoidable care for the year’s food, no anxiety about bodily things, by which
one has to get ready what is necessary not only for one’s own wants but also for those of
any number of visitors, finally no conceit from the praise of men, which is worse than all
these things and sometimes in the sight of God does away with the good of even great efforts
in the desert. But, to pass over those waves of spiritual pride and the deadly peril of vainglory
in the life of the anchorite, let us return to this general burden which affects everybody, i.e.,
the ordinary anxiety in providing food, which has so far exceeded I say not the measure of
that ancient strictness which altogether did without oil, but is beginning not to be content
even with the relaxation of our own time according to which the requirements of all the
supply of food for a year were satisfied by the preparation of a single pint of oil and a modius
of lentils prepared for the use of visitors; but now the needful supply of food is scarcely met
by two or three times that amount. And to such an extent has the force of this dangerous
relaxation grown among some that, when they mix vinegar and sauce, they do not add that
single drop of oil, which our predecessors who followed the rules of the desert with greater
powers of abstinence, were accustomed to pour in simply for the sake of avoiding vainglory,41
but they break an Egyptian cheese for luxury and pour over it more oil than is required, and
so take, under a single pleasant relish, two sorts of food which differ in their special flavour,
each of which ought singly to be a pleasant refreshment at different times for a monk. To
such a pitch however has this ὑλικὴ κτῆσις, i.e., acquisition of material things grown, that
actually under pretence of hospitality and welcoming guests anchorites have begun to keep
a blanket in their cells—a thing which I cannot mention without shame—to omit those
things by which the mind that is awed by and intent on spiritual meditation is more especially
hampered; viz., the concourse of brethren, the duties of receiving the coming and speeding
the parting guest, visits to each other and the endless worry of various confabulations and
occupations, the expectation of which owing to the continuous character of these customary
interruptions keeps the mind on the stretch even during the time when these bothers seem
to cease. And so the result is that the freedom of the anchorite’s life is so hindered by these
ties that it can never rise to that ineffable keenness of heart, and thus loses the fruits of its
<note type="footnote">41 Cf. Conference VIII.</note>

<pb n="1256"/>
hermit life. And if this is now denied to me while I am living in the congregation and among
others, at least there is no lack of peace of mind and tranquillity of heart that is freed from
all business. And unless this is ready at hand for those also who live in the desert, they will
indeed have to undergo the labours of the anchorite’s life, but will lose its fruits which can
only be gained in peaceful stability of mind. Finally even if there is any diminution of my
purity of heart while I am living in the Coenobium, I shall be satisfied by keeping in exchange
that one precept of the Gospel, which certainly cannot be less esteemed than all those fruits
of the desert; I mean that I should take no thought for the morrow, and submitting myself
completely to the Abbot seem in some degree to emulate</p>
<p>Him of whom it is said: “He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death; and
so be able humbly to make use of His words: “For I came not to do mine own will, but the
will of the Father which sent me.”42</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>A question on the fruits of the Coenobium and the desert.</head>
<p>Germanus: Since it is evident that you have not, like so many, just touched the mere
outskirts of each mode of life, but have ascended to the very heights, we should like to know
what is the end of the Coenobite’s life and what the end of the hermit’s. For no one can doubt
that no man can discourse with greater fulness or fidelity on these subjects than one who,
taught by long use and experience, has followed them both, and so can by veracious teaching
show us their value and aim.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="1258"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>The answer to the question proposed.</head>
<p>John: I should absolutely maintain that one and the same man could not attain perfection
in both lives unless I was hindered by the example of some few. And since it is no small
matter to find a man who is perfect in either of them, it is clear how much harder and I had
almost said impossible it is for a man to be thoroughly efficient in both. And if this has ever
happened, it cannot come under any general rule. For a general rule must be based not on
exceptional instances, i.e., on the experience of a very few, but on what is within the power
of the many or rather of all. But what is attained to here and there by but one or two, and
is beyond the capacity of ordinary goodness, must be kept out of general rules as something
permitted outside the condition and nature of human weakness, and should be brought
forward as a miracle rather than as an example. Wherefore I will, as my slender ability allows,
briefly intimate what you want to know. The aim indeed of the Coenobite is to mortify and
crucify all his desires and, according to that salutary command of evangelic perfection, to
take no thought for the morrow. And it is perfectly clear that this perfection cannot be attained
by any except a Coenobite, such a man as the prophet Isaiah describes and blesses
and praises as follows: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own
will in my holy day, and glorify Him, while thou dost not thine own ways, and thine own
will is not found to speak a word: then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and I will lift
thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob
thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”43 But the perfection for a hermit is
to have his mind freed from all earthly things, and to unite it, as far as human frailty allows,
with Christ: and such a man the prophet Jeremiah describes when he says: “Blessed is the
man who hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because
he hath taken it upon himself;” the Psalmist also: “I am become like a pelican in the desert.
I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.”44 To this aim then, which
we have described as that of either life, unless each of them attains, in vain does the one

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of true and complete perfection.</head>
<p>But this is μερική, i.e., no thorough and altogether complete perfection, but only a partial
one. Perfection then is very rare and granted by God’s gift to but a very few. For he is truly
and not partially perfect who with equal imperturbability can put up with the squalor of the
wilderness in the desert, as well as the infirmities of the brethren in the Coenobium. And so
it is hard to find one who is perfect in both lives, because the anchorite cannot thoroughly
acquire ἀκτημοσύνη , i.e., a disregard for and stripping oneself of material things, nor the
Coenobite purity in contemplation, although we know that Abbot Moses and Paphnutius
and the two Macarii45 were masters of both in perfection. And so they were perfect in either
life, and while they withdrew further than all the dwellers in the desert and delighted
themselves unceasingly in the retirement of the wilderness, and as far as in them lay never
sought intercourse with other men, yet they put up with the presence and the infirmities of
those who came to them so that when a large number of the brethren came to them for the
sake of seeing them and profiting by it, they endured this almost continuous trouble of receiving
them with imperturbable patience, and men fancied that all the days of their life
they had neither learnt nor practised anything but how to show common civility to those
who came, so that it was a puzzle to all to say in which life their zeal was mainly shown, i.e.,
whether their greatness adapted itself more remarkably to the purity of the hermitage or to
the common life.</p>
<note type="footnote">45 Moses, Paphnutius, and the two Macarii have all been mentioned frequently before. On Moses (to whom
the first two Conferences are assigned) see the note on the Institutes X. xxv.; on Paphnutius see on Conference

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>Of those who while still imperfect retire into the desert.</head>
<p>But some are sometimes so tantalized by the silence of the desert lasting all through the
day that they altogether dread intercourse with men, and, when they have even for a little
while broken through their habit of retirement owing to the accident of a visit from some
of the brethren, boil over with marked vexation of mind, and show clear signs of annoyance.
And this especially happens in the case of those who have betaken themselves to the solitary
life without a well-matured purpose and without being thoroughly trained in the Coenobium,
as these men are always imperfect and easily upset, and incline to one side or the other, as
the gales of trouble may drive them. For as they boil over impatiently at intercourse or
conversation with the brethren, so while they are living in solitude they cannot stand the
vastness of that silence which they themselves have courted, inasmuch as they themselves
do not even know the reason why solitude ought to be wanted and sought for, but imagine
that the value and the main part of this life consist in this; viz., in avoiding intercourse with
the brethren and simply shunning and loathing the sight of a man.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>A question how to cure those who have hastily left the congregation of the Coenobium.</head>
<p>Germanus: By what treatment can any help be given to us or to others who are thus
weak and only up to this; who had received but little instruction in the system of the Coenobium
when we began to aspire to dwell in solitude before we had got rid of our faults; or
by what means shall we be able to acquire the constancy of an imperturbable mind, and
immovable steadfastness of patience; we who all too soon gave up the common life in the
Coenobium, and forsook the schools and training ground for these exercises, in which our
principles ought first to have been thoroughly schooled and perfected? How then can we
now while we are living alone gain perfection in long-suffering and patience; or how can
conscience, that searcher out of inward motives, discover whether these virtues exist in us
or are wanting, so that because we are severed from intercourse with men, and not irritated
by any of their provocations, we may not be deceived by false notions, and fancy that we
have gained that imperturbable peace of mind?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1262"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The answer telling how a solitary can discover his faults.</head>
<p>John: To those who are really seeking relief, healing remedies from the true Physician
of souls will certainly not be wanting; and to those above all will they be given who do not
disregard their ill-condition (either because they despair of it, or because they do not care
about it), nor hide the danger they are in from their wound, nor in their wanton heart reject
the remedy of penitence, but with an humble and yet careful heart flee to the heavenly
Physician for the diseases they have contracted from ignorance or error or necessity. And
so we ought to know that if we retire to solitude or secret places, without our faults being
first cured, their operation is but repressed, while the power of feeling them is not extinguished.
For the root of all sins not having been eradicated is still lying hid in us, or rather
creeping up, and that it is still alive we can tell by these signs. For instance, if, when we are
living in solitude we receive the approach of some brethren, or any very slight tarrying on
their part, with any anxiety or fretfulness of mind, we should recognize that an incentive to
the most hasty impatience is still existing in us. But if when we are hoping for the coming
of a brother, and from some cause he perhaps delays a little, our mental indignation either
silently blames his slowness, and annoyance at this inconvenient waiting disturbs our mind,
the examination of our conscience will show that the sin of anger and vexation is plainly
still remaining in us. Again, if when a brother asks for our book to read, or for some other
article to use, his request annoys us, or a refusal on our part disgusts him, there can be no
doubt that we are still entangled in the meshes of avarice or covetousness. But if a sudden
thought or a passage of Holy Scripture brings up the recollection of a woman and we feel
that we are at all attracted towards her, we should know that the fire of fornication is not
yet extinguished in us. But if on a comparison of our own strictness with the laxity of another
even the slightest conceit tries our mind, it is clear that we are affected with the dreadful
plague of pride. When then we detect these signs of faults in our heart, we should clearly
recognize that it is only the opportunity and not the passion of sin of which we are deprived.
And certainly these passions, if at any time we were to mingle in the ordinary life of men,
would at once start up from their lurking places in our thoughts and prove that they did
not then for the first time come into existence when they broke out, but that they were then
at last made public, because they had been long lying hid. And so even a solitary can detect
by sure signs that the roots of each fault are still implanted in him, if he tries not to show
his purity to men, but to maintain it inviolate in His sight, from whom no secrets of the
heart can be hid.</p>

<pb n="1263"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>A question how a man can be cured who has entered on solitude without having his faults
eradicated.</head>
<p>Germanus: We very clearly and plainly see the proofs by which the signs of infirmities
are inferred, and the method of discerning diseases, i.e., how the faults which are concealed
in us can be detected: for our every day experience and the daily motions of our thoughts
show us all these as they have been stated. It remains then that as the proofs and causes of
our maladies have been exposed to us in a most clear way so their remedies and cures may
also be shown. For no one can doubt that one who has first discovered the grounds and
beginnings of ailments, with the approving witness of the conscience of those affected, can
best discourse on their remedies. And so though the teaching of your holiness has laid bare
the secrets of our wounds whereby we venture to have some hope of a remedy, because so
clear a diagnosis of the disease gives promise of the hope of a cure, yet because, as you say,
the first elements of salvation are acquired in the Coenobium, and men cannot be in a sound
condition in solitude, unless they have first been healed by the medicine of the Coenobium,
we have fallen again into a dangerous state of despair lest as we left the Coenobium in an
imperfect condition we may not now that we are in the desert succeed in becoming perfect.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="1264"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>The answer on their remedies.</head>
<p>John: For those who are anxious for the cure of their ailments a saving remedy is sure
not to be wanting, and therefore remedies should be sought by the same means that the
signs of each fault are discovered. For as we have said that the faults of men’s ordinary life
are not wanting to solitaries, so we do not deny that all zeal for virtue, and all the means of
healing are at the disposal of all those who are cut off from men’s ordinary life. When then
anyone discovers by those signs which we described above, that he is attacked by outbreaks
of impatience or anger, he should always practise himself in the opposite and contrary
things, and by setting before himself all sorts of injuries and wrongs, as if offered to him by
somebody else, accustom his mind to submit with perfect humility to everything that
wickedness can bring upon him; and by often representing to himself all kinds of rough and
intolerable things, continually consider with all sorrow of heart with what gentleness he
ought to meet them. And, by thus looking at the sufferings of all the saints, or indeed at
those of the Lord Himself, he will admit that the various reproaches as well as punishments
are less than he deserves, and prepare himself to endure all kinds of griefs. And when occasionally
he has been recalled by some invitation to the assembly of the brethren—a thing
which cannot but happen every now and then even to the strictest inmates of the desert,—if
he finds that his mind is silently disturbed even for trifles, he should like some stern censor
of his secret emotions charge himself with all those various hard wrongs, to the perfect endurance
of which he was training himself by his daily meditations, and blaming and chiding
himself as follows, say My good man, are you the fellow who while training yourself in the
practising ground of solitude, ventured most determinedly to think that you would get the
better of all bad qualities, and who just now, when you were representing to yourself not
only all sorts of bitter reproaches, but also intolerable punishments, fancied that you were
pretty strong and able to stand against all storms? How is it that that unconquered patience
of yours is upset by the first trial even of a light word? How is it that even a gentle breeze
has shaken that house of yours which you fancied was built so strongly on the solid rock?
Where is that which you announced when during a time of peace you were in your foolish
confidence longing for war? “I am ready, and am not troubled;” and this which you used
often to say with the prophet: “Prove me, O Lord, and try me: search out my reins and my
heart;” and: “prove me, O Lord, and know my heart: question me and know my paths; and
see if there be any way of wickedness in me.”46 How has a tiny ghost of an enemy frightened
your grand preparations for war? With such reproaches and remorse a man should condemn
himself and not allow the sudden temptation which has upset him to go unpunished, but
<note type="footnote">46 Ps. cxviii. (cxix.) 60; xxv. (xxvi.) 2; cxxxviii. (cxxxix.) 23, 24.</note>

<pb n="1265"/>
by chastising his flesh with a severer penalty of fasting and vigils; and, by punishing his sin
of lightness of mind by continual pains of self-restraint, he should while living in solitude
consume in this fire of practice what he ought to have thoroughly driven out in the life of
the Coenobium. This at any rate we must firmly and resolutely hold to in order to secure a
lasting and unbroken patience; viz., that for us, to whom by the Divine law not merely
vengeance for, but even the recollection of injuries is forbidden, it is not permissible to be
roused to anger because of some loss or annoyance. For what greater injury can happen to
the soul than for it, owing to some sudden blindness from rage, to lose the brightness of the
true and eternal light and to fail of the sight of Him “Who is meek and lowly of heart?”47
What I ask could be more dangerous or awkward than for a man to lose his power of judging
of goodness, and his standard and rule of true discernment, and for one in his sober senses
to do what even a drunken man, and a fool would not be pardoned for doing? One then
who carefully considers these and other injuries of the same kind, will readily endure and
disregard not only all kinds of losses, but also whatever wrongs and punishments can be
inflicted by the cruellest of men, as he will hold that there is nothing more damaging than
anger, nor more valuable than peace of mind and unbroken purity of heart, for the sake of
which we should think nothing of the advantages not merely of carnal matters but also of
those things which appear to be spiritual, if they cannot be gained or done without some
disturbance of this tranquillity.</p>

<head>A question whether chastity ought to be ascertained just as the other feelings.</head>
<p>Germanus: As the cure for other ailments, viz., anger, vexation, and impatience, has
been shown to consist in opposing to them their contraries, so also we should like to learn
what sort of treatment we ought to use against the spirit of fornication: I mean, whether the
fire of lust can be quenched by the representation, as in those other cases, of greater inducements
and things to excite it: because not merely to increase the incentives to lust within
us, but even to touch them with a passing look of the mind, we believe to be utterly fatal to
chastity.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1267"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>The answer giving the proofs by which it can be recognized.</p>
<p>John: Your shrewd question has anticipated the subject, which even if you had said
nothing must have arisen from our discourse, and therefore I do not doubt that it will be
effectually grasped by your minds, since indeed your sharp wits have outstripped our instruction.
For the puzzle of any question is easily removed, when the inquiry anticipates the answer,
and is the first to travel along the road which it is to follow. And so to the treatment
of those faults of which we have spoken above, intercourse with other men is not merely no
hindrance, but a considerable help, for the more often that the outbursts of their impatience
are exposed, the more thorough is the sorrow and compunction which they bring on those
who have failed, and the speedier is the recovery of health which they confer on those who
struggle against them. Wherefore even when we are living in solitude, though the incentive
to irritation and matter for it cannot arise from men, yet we ought of set purpose to meditate
on incitements to it, that as we are fighting against it with a continual struggle in our thoughts
a speedier cure for it may be found for us. But against the spirit of fornication the system is
different, and the method an altered one. For as we must deprive the body of opportunities
of lust, and contact with flesh, so we must deprive the mind of the recollection of it. For it
is sufficiently dangerous for bosoms that are still weak and infirm even to tolerate the
slightest recollection of this passion, in such a way that sometimes at the remembrance of
holy women, or in reading a story in Holy Scripture a stimulus of dangerous excitement is
aroused. For which reason our Elders used deliberately to omit passages of this kind when
any of the juniors were present. However for those who are perfect and established in the
feelings of chastity there can be no lack of proofs by which they may examine themselves,
and establish their perfect uprightness of heart by the uncorrupted judgment of their own
conscience. There will then be for the man who is thoroughly established a similar test even
in regard to this passion, so that one who is sure that he has altogether exterminated the
roots of this evil may for the sake of ascertaining his chastity, call up some picture as with
a lascivious mind. But it is by no means proper for such a test to be attempted by those who
are still weak (for to them it will be dangerous rather than useful), ut conjunctionem
femineam et palpationem quodammodo teneram atque mollissimam corde pertractent.
Cum ergo perfecta quis virtute fundatus ad illecebram blandissimorum tactuum, quos cogitando
confinxerit, nullum mentis assensum, nullam commotionem carnis in se deprehenderit
exagitatam, he will have a very sure proof of his purity, so that training himself to this
steadfast purity he will not only possess the blessing of chastity and freedom from defilement
in his heart, but even if he is obliged to touch the body of a woman, he will be horrified at
it.</p>

<head>XX. CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PINUFIUS.
ON THE END OF PENITENCE AND THE MARKS OF SATISFACTION.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1270"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Of the humility of Abbot Pinufius, and of his hiding-place.</head>
<p>Now that I am going to relate the precepts of that excellent and remarkable man, Abbot
Pinufius, on the end of penitence, I fancy that I can dispose of a very large part of my material,
if out of consideration lest I weary my reader, I here pass over in silence the praise of his
humility, which I touched on in a brief discourse in the fourth book of the Institutes,48
which was entitled “Of the rules to be observed by renunciants,” especially as many who
have no knowledge of that work, may happen to read this, and then all the authority of the
utterances will be weakened if there is no account of the virtues of the speaker. For this man
when he was presiding as Abbot and Presbyter over a large Coenobium not far from Panephysis,
a city, as was there said, of Egypt, and when all that province had praised him to
the skies for his virtues and miracles, so that he already seemed to himself to have received
the reward of his labours in the remuneration of the praise of men, as he was afraid lest the
emptiness of popular favour, which he especially disliked, might interfere with the fruits of
an eternal reward, he secretly fled from his monastery and made his way to the furthest recesses
of the monks of Tabennæ,49 where he chose not the solitude of the desert, not that
freedom from care of which the life of one alone affords, which even those who are imperfect
and who cannot endure the effort which obedience requires in the Coenobium, sometimes
seek after with proud presumption, but he chose to submit himself to a most famous monastery.
Where, however, that he might not be betrayed by any signs of his dress, he clothed
himself in a secular garb, and lay before the doors with tears, as is the custom there, for
many days, and clinging to the knees of all after being daily repulsed by those who to test
his purpose said that now in extreme old age he was seeking this holy life not in sincerity,
but driven by the lack of food, at last he obtained admission, and there he was told off to
help a young brother who had been given the charge of a garden, and when he not only
fulfilled with such marvellous and holy humility everything which his chief ordered him or
which the care of the work entrusted to him demanded, but also performed in stealthy labour
by night certain necessary offices which were avoided by the rest out of disgust for them,
so that when morning dawned, all the congregation was delighted at such useful works but
knew not their author; and when he had passed nearly three years there rejoicing in the labours,
which he had desired, but to which he was so unfairly subjected, it happened that a
certain brother known to him came there from the same parts of Egypt from which he
himself had come. And this man for a time hesitated because the meanness of his clothes
<note type="footnote">48 Cf. Institutes IV. c. xxx., xxxi. Nothing further is known of Pinufius than what we gather from these passages
of Cassian.</note>
<note type="footnote">49 On Tabennæ or Tabenna see the note on the Institutes IV. i.</note>

<pb n="1271"/>
and of his office prevented him from readily recognizing him at once, but after looking very
closely at him, fell at his feet, and first astonished all the brethren, and afterwards, when he
betrayed his name, which the fame of his special sanctity had made known to them also, he
smote them with sorrow and compunction because they had told off a man of his virtues
and a priest to such mean offices. But he, shedding copious tears, and charging the accident
of his betrayal to the serious envy of the devil, was brought in honourable custody by his
brethren surrounding him to the monastery; and after that he had stayed there for a short
time, he was once more troubled by the respect shown to his dignity and rank, and stealthily
embarked on board ship and sailed to the Palestinian province of Syria, where he was received
as a beginner and a novice in the house of that monastery in which we were living, and was
charged by the Abbot to stop in our cell. But not even there could his virtues and merits
long remain secret. For he was discovered and betrayed in the same way, and brought back
to his own monastery with the utmost honour and respect.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="1272"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>Of our coming to him.</head>
<p>When then after no long time a desire for holy instruction had urged us also to visit
Egypt, we sought him out with the utmost eagerness and devotion and were welcomed by
him with such kindness and courtesy that he actually honoured us, as former sharers of the
same cell with him, with a lodging in his own cell which he had built in the furthest corner
of his garden. And there when in the presence of all the brethren at service he had delivered
to one of the brethren who was submitting to the rule of the monastery sufficiently difficult
and elevated precepts, which as we said, I summarized as briefly as I could in the fourth
book of the Institutes, the heights of a true renunciation seemed to us so unattainable and
so marvellous that we did not think that such humble folks as we could ever scale them.
And therefore, cast down in despair, and not concealing in our looks the inner bitterness
of our thoughts, we came back to the blessed old man with a tolerably anxious heart: and
when he at once asked the reason why we were so sad, Abbot Germanus groaned deeply
and replied as follows.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="1273"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>A question on the end of penitence and the marks of satisfaction.</head>
<p>As your grand and splendid exposition of a doctrine new to us has opened out to us a
more difficult road to the most glorious renunciation, and has removed the scales from our
eyes, and shown to us its summit raised in the heavens, so are we proportionately cast down
with a greater weight of despair. Since, when we measure its vastness against our puny
strength, and compare the excessively humble character of our ignorance with the boundless
height of virtue shown to us, we feel that we are so small that we not only cannot attain to
it, but that we are sure to fall short in what we have. For as we are weighed down by the
burden of excessive despair, we fall away somehow from the lowest depths to still lower
ones. Accordingly there is one and only one support which can provide a cure for our
wounds; viz., for us to learn something of the end of penitence and especially on the marks
of satisfaction, that we may feel sure of the forgiveness of past sins, and so be spurred on to
scale the heights of the perfection described above.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="1274"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>The answer on the humility shown by our request.</head>
<p>Pinufius: I am indeed delighted at the very plentiful fruits of your humility, which indeed
I saw with no indifferent concern, when I was formerly received in the habitation of that
cell of yours, and I am very glad that you welcome with such respect the charge given by us,
the least of all Christians, and the words that I have taken the liberty of saying so that if I
am not mistaken you carry them out as soon as ever they are spoken by us; and though, as
I remember, the importance of the words scarcely deserves the efforts you bestow on them,
yet you so conceal the merits of your virtue, as if no breath ever reached you of those things
which you are daily practising. But because this fact is worthy of the highest praise; viz., that
you declare that those institutes of the saints are still unknown to you as if you were still
beginners we will, as briefly as possible, summarize what you so eagerly ask of us. For we
must even beyond our powers and ability, obey the commands of such old friends as you.
And so on the value and appeasing power of penitence many have published a great deal,
not only in words but also in writing, showing how useful it is, how strong, and full of grace,
so that when God is offended by our past sins, and on the point of inflicting a most just
punishment for such offences, it somehow, if it is not wrong to say so, stops Him, and, if I
may so say, stays the right hand of the Avenger even against His will. But I have no doubt
that all this is well known to you, either from your natural wisdom, or from your unwearied
study of Holy Scripture, so that from this the first shoots, so to speak, of your conversion
sprang up. Finally, you are anxious not about the character of penitence but about its end,
and the marks of satisfaction, and so by a very shrewd question ask what has been left out
by others.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="1275"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Of the method of penitence and the proof of pardon.</head>
<p>Wherefore in order to satisfy as briefly and shortly as possible, your desire and question,
the full and perfect description of penitence is, never again to yield to those sins for which
we do penance, or for which our conscience is pricked. But the proof of satisfaction and
pardon is for us to have expelled the love of them from our hearts. For each one may be
sure that he is not yet free from his former sins as long as any image of those sins which he
has committed or of others like them dances before his eyes, and I will not say a delight
in—but the recollection of—them haunts his inmost soul while he is devoting himself to
satisfaction for them and to tears. And so one who is on the watch to make satisfaction may
then feel sure that he is free from his sins and that he has obtained pardon for past faults,
when he never feels that his heart is stirred by the allurements and imaginations of these
same sins. Wherefore the truest test of penitence and witness of pardon is found in our own
conscience, which even before the day of judgment and of knowledge, while we are still in
the flesh, discloses our acquittal from guilt, and reveals the end of satisfaction and the grace
of forgiveness. And that what has been said may be more significantly expressed, then only
should we believe that the stains of past sins are forgiven us, when the desires for present
delights as well as the passions have been expelled from our heart.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="1276"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>A question whether our sins ought to be remembered out of contrition of heart.</head>
<p>Germanus: And whence can there be aroused in us this holy and salutary contrition
from humiliation, which is described as follows in the person of the penitent: “I have ac-
knowledged my sin, and mine unrighteousness have I not hid. I said: I will acknowledge
against myself mine unrighteousness to the Lord,” so that we may be able effectually to say
also what follows: “And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart;”50 or how, when we kneel
in prayer shall we be able to stir ourselves up to tears of confession, by which we may be
able to obtain pardon for our offences, according to these words: “Every night will I wash
my bed: I will water my couch with tears;”51 if we expel from our hearts all recollection of
our faults, though on the contrary we are bidden carefully to preserve the remembrance of
them, as the Lord says: “And thine iniquities I will not remember: but do thou recollect
them?”52 Wherefore not only when I am at work, but also when I am at prayer I try of set
purpose to recall to my mind the recollection of my sins, that I may be more effectually inclined
to true humility and contrition of heart, and venture to say with the prophet: “Look
upon my humility and my labour: and forgive me all my sins.”53</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="1277"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>The answer showing how far we ought to preserve the recollection of previous actions.</head>
<p>Pinufius: Your question, as has been already said above, was not raised with regard to
the character of penitence, but with regard to its end, and the marks of satisfaction: to which,
as I think, a fair and pertinent reply has been given. But what you have said as to the remembrance
of sins is sufficiently useful and needful to men who are still doing penance, that
they may with constant smiting of the breast say: “For I acknowledge my wickedness: and
my sin is ever before me;” and this too: “And I will think for my sin.”54 While then we do
penance, and are still grieved by the recollection of faulty actions, the shower of tears which
is caused by the confession of our faults is sure to quench the fire of our conscience. But
when, while a man is still in this state of humility of heart and contrition of spirit and continuing
to labour and to weep, the remembrance of these things fades away, and the thorns
of conscience are by God’s grace extracted from his inmost heart, then it is clear that he has
attained to the end of satisfaction and the reward of pardon, and that he is purged from the
stain of the sins he has committed. To which state of forgetfulness we can only attain by the
obliteration of our former sins and likings, and by perfect and complete purity of heart. And
this most certainly will not be attained by any of those who from sloth or carelessness have
failed to purge out their faults, but only by one who by constantly continuing to groan and
sigh sorrowfully has removed every spot of his former stains, and by the goodness of his
heart and his labour has proclaimed to the Lord: “I have acknowledged my sin, and mine
unrighteousness have I not hid;” and: “My tears have been my meat day and night;” so that
in the end it may be vouchsafed to him to hear these words: “Let thy voice cease from
weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy labour, saith the Lord;”55
and these words also may be uttered of him by the voice of the Lord: “I have blotted out as
a cloud thine iniquities, and as a mist thy sins:” and again: “I even I am He that blotteth out
thine iniquities for mine own sake, and thine offences I will no longer remember;”56 and
so, when he is freed from the “cords of his sins,” by which “everyone is bound,”57 he will
with all thanksgiving sing to the Lord: “Thou hast broken my chains: I will offer to thee the
sacrifice of praise.”58</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>Of the various fruits of penitence.</head>
<p>For after that grace of baptism which is common to all, and that most precious gift of
martyrdom which is gained by being washed in blood, there are many fruits of penitence
by which we can succeed in expiating our sins. For eternal salvation is not only promised
to the bare fact of penitence, of which the blessed Apostle Peter says: “Repent and be converted
that your sins may be forgiven;” and John the Baptist and the Lord Himself: “Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:”59 but also by the affection of love is the weight
of our sins overwhelmed: for “charity covers a multitude of sins.”60 In the same way also
by the fruits of almsgiving a remedy is provided for our wounds, because “As water extinguishes
fire, so does almsgiving extinguish sin.”61 So also by the shedding of tears is gained
the washing away of offences, for “Every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch
with tears.” Finally to show that they are not shed in vain, he adds: “Depart from me all ye
that work iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping:”62 Moreover by means
of confession of sins, their absolution is granted: for “I said: I will confess against myself my
sin to the Lord: and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart;” and again: “Declare thine
iniquities first, that thou mayest be justified.”63 By afflicting the heart and body also is forgiveness
of sins committed in like manner obtained, for he says: “Look on my humility and
my labour, and forgive me all my sins;” and more especially by amendment of life: “Take
away,” he says, “the evil of your thoughts from mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well.
Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the orphan, defend the widow. And come,
reason with Me, saith the Lord: and though your sins were as scarlet, yet shall they be as
white as snow, though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.”64 Sometimes
too the pardon of our sins is obtained by the intercession of the saints, for “if a man knows
his brother to sin a sin not unto death, he asks, and He will give to him his life, for him that
sinneth not unto death;” and again: “Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of
the Church and they shall pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he be in
sins, they shall be forgiven him.”65 Sometimes too by the virtue of compassion and faith the

stains of sin are removed, according to this passage: “By compassion and faith sins are purged
away.”66 And often by the conversion and salvation of those who are saved by our warnings
and preaching: “For he who converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save his soul
from death, and cover a multitude of sins.”67 Moreover by pardon and forgiveness on our
part we obtain pardon of our sins: “For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you your sins.”68 You see then what great means of obtaining mercy
the compassion of our Saviour has laid open to us, so that no one when longing for salvation
need be crushed by despair, as he sees himself called to life by so many remedies. For if you
plead that owing to weakness of the flesh you cannot get rid of your sins by fasting, and you
cannot say: “My knees are weak from fasting, and my flesh is changed for oil; for I have
eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,”69 then atone for them by
profuse almsgiving. If you have nothing that you can give to the needy (although the claims
of want and poverty exclude none from this office, since the two mites of the widow are
ranked higher than the splendid gifts of the rich, and the Lord promises that He will give a
reward for a cup of cold water), at least you can purge them away by amendment of life. But
if you cannot secure perfection in goodness by the eradication of all your faults, you can
show a pious anxiety for the good and salvation of another. But if you complain that you
are not equal to this service, you can cover your sins by the affection of love. And if in this
also some sluggishness of mind makes you weak, at least you should submissively with a
feeling of humility entreat for remedies for your wounds by the prayers and intercession of
the saints. Finally who is there who cannot humbly say: “I have acknowledged my sin: and
mine unrighteousness have I not hid;” so that by this confession he may be able also to add
this: “And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart.”70 But if shame holds you back, and you
blush to reveal them before men, you should not cease to confess them with constant supplication
to Him from Whom they cannot be hid, and to say to Him: “I acknowledge mine
iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I sinned, and have done evil
before Thee;”71 as He is wont to heal them without any publication which brings shame,
and to forgive sins without any reproaching. And further besides that ready and sure aid
the Divine condescension has afforded us another also that is still easier, and has entrusted
the possession of the remedy to our own will, so that we can infer from our own feelings
the forgiveness of our offences, when we say to Him: “Forgive us our debts as we also forgive

our debtors.”72 Whoever then desires to obtain forgiveness of his sins, should study to fit
himself for it by these means. Let not the stubbornness of an obdurate heart turn away any
from the saving remedy and the fount of so much goodness, because even if we have done
all these things, they will not be able to expiate our offences, unless they are blotted out by
the goodness and mercy of the Lord, who when He sees the service of pious efforts offered
by us with a humble heart, supports our small and puny efforts with the utmost bounty,
and says: “I even I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities for Mine own sake, and I will
remember thy sins no more.”73 Whoever then is aiming at this condition, which we have
mentioned, will seek the grace of satisfaction by daily fasting and mortification of heart and
body, for, as it is written, “Without shedding of blood there is no remission;”74 and this not
without good reason. For “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”75 And
therefore one who would withhold “the sword of the spirit which is the word of God”76
from this shedding of blood certainly comes under the lash of that curse of Jeremiah’s; for
“Cursed,” says he “is he who withholds his sword from blood.”77 For this is the sword which
for our good sheds that bad blood whereby the material of our sins lives; and cuts off and
pares away everything carnal and earthly which it finds to have grown up in the members
of our soul; and makes men die to sin and live to God, and flourish with spiritual virtues.
And so he will begin to weep no more at the recollection of former sins, but at the hope of
what is to come, and, thinking less of past evils than of good things to come, will shed tears
not from sorrow at his sins, but from delight in that eternal joy, and “forgetting those things
which are behind,” i.e., carnal sins, will press on “to those before,”78 i.e., to spiritual gifts
and virtues.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>How valuable to the perfect is the forgetfulness of sin.</head>
<p>But with regard to this that you said a little way back; viz., that you of set purpose go
over the recollections of past sins, this ought certainly not to be done, nay, if it forcibly
surprises you, it must be at once expelled. For it greatly hinders the soul from the contemplation
of purity, and especially in the case of one who is living in solitude, as it entangles
him in the stains of this world and swamps him in foul sins. For while you are recalling
those things which you did through ignorance or wantonness in accordance with the prince
of this world, though I grant you that while you are engaged in these thoughts no delight
in them steals in, yet at least the mere taint of the ancient filthiness is sure to corrupt your
soul with its foul stink, and to shut out the spiritual fragrance of goodness, i.e., the odour
of a sweet savour. When then the recollection of past sins comes over your mind, you must
recoil from it just as an honest and upright man runs away if he is sought out in public by
an immodest and wanton woman either by words or by embraces. And certainly unless he
at once withdraws himself from contact with her, and if he allows himself to linger the very
least in impure talk, even if he refuses his consent to the shameful pleasures, yet he cannot
avoid the brand of infamy and scorn in the judgment of all the passers by. So then we also,
if by noxious recollections we are led to thoughts of this kind, ought at once to desist from
dwelling upon them and to fulfil what we are commanded by Solomon: “But go forth,” says
he, “do not linger in her place, nor fix thine eye on her;”79 lest if the angels see us taken up
with unclean and foul thoughts, they may not be able to say to us in passing by: “The blessing
of the Lord be upon you.”80 For it is impossible for the soul to continue in good thoughts,
when the main part of the heart is taken up with foul and earthly considerations. For this
saying of Solomon’s is true: “When thine eyes look on a strange woman, then shall thy
mouth speak wickedly, and thou shalt lie as it were in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot in
a great storm. But thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I felt no pain; and they mocked
me, but I felt not.”81 So then we should forsake not only all foul but even all earthly thoughts
and ever raise the desires of our soul to heavenly things, in accordance with this saying of
our Saviour: “For where I am,” He says, “there also shall My servant be.”82 For it often
happens that when anyone out of pity is in thought going over his own falls or those of
other faulty persons, he is affected by the delight and assent to this most subtle attack, and
that which was undertaken and started with a show of goodness ends with a filthy and

<head>How the recollection of our sins should be avoided.</head>
<p>Wherefore we must endeavour to rouse ourselves to this praiseworthy contrition, by
aiming at virtue and by the desire for the kingdom of heaven rather than by dangerous recollections
of sins, for a man is sure to be suffocated by the pestilential smells of the sewer
as long as he chooses to stand over it or to stir its filth.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Of the marks of satisfaction, and the removal of past sins.</head>
<p>But we know, as we have often said, that then only have we made satisfaction for past
sins, when the very motions and feelings, through which we were guilty of what we have to
sorrow for, have been eradicated from our hearts. But no one should fancy that he can secure
this, unless he has first with all the fervour of his spirit cut off the opportunities and occasions,
owing to which he fell into those sins; as for instance, if through dangerous familiarity with
a woman he has fallen into fornication or adultery, he must take the utmost pains to avoid
even looking on one; or if he has been overcome by too much wine and over-eating, he
should chastise with the utmost severity his craving for immoderate food. And again if he
has been led astray by the desire for and love of money, and has fallen into perjury or theft
or murder or blasphemy, he should cut off the occasion for avarice, which has allured and
deceived him. If he is driven by the passion of pride into the sin of anger, he should with all
the virtue of humility, remove the incentive to arrogance. And so, in order that each single
sin may be destroyed, the occasion and opportunity by which or for which it was committed
should be first got rid of. For by this curative treatment we can certainly attain to forgetfulness
of the sins we have committed.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="1285"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Wherein we must do penance for a time only; and wherein it can have no end.</head>
<p>But that description of the forgetfulness spoken of only has to do with capital offences,
which are also condemned by the mosaic law, the inclination to which is destroyed and put
an end to by a good life, and so also the penance for them has an end. But for those small
offences in which, as it is written, “the righteous falls seven times and will rise again”84
penitence will never cease. For either through ignorance, or forgetfulness, or thought, or
word, or surprise, or necessity, or weakness of the flesh, or defilement in a dream, we often
fall every day either against our will or voluntarily; offences for which David also prays the
Lord, and asks for purification and pardon, and says: “Who can understand sins? from my
secret ones cleanse me; and from those of others spare Thy servant;”85 and the Apostle: “For
the good which I would I do not, and the evil which I would not, that I do.” For which also
the same man exclaims with a sigh “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
the body of this death?”86 For we slip into these so easily as it were by a law of nature, that
however carefully and guardedly we are on the lookout against them, we cannot altogether
avoid them. Since it was of these that one of the disciples, whom Jesus loved, declared and
laid down absolutely saying: “If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and His
word is not in us.”87 Further for a man who is anxious to reach the heights of perfection it
will not greatly help him to have arrived at the end of penitence, i.e., to restrain himself from
unlawful acts, unless he has always urged himself forward in unwearied course to those
virtues whereby we come to the signs of satisfaction. For it will not be enough for a man to
have kept himself clear from those foul stains of sins which the Lord hates, unless he has
also secured by purity of heart and perfect Apostolical love that sweet fragrance of virtue in
which the Lord delights. Thus far Abbot Pinufius discoursed on the marks of satisfaction
and the end of penitence. And although he pressed us with anxious love to decide to stay
in his Coenobium, yet when he could not retain us, as we were incited by the fame of the
desert of Scete, he sent us on our way.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How Theonas came to Abbot John.</head>
<p>Before we begin to set forth the words of this Conference held with that excellent man
Abbot Theonas,89 I think it well to describe in a brief discourse the origin of his conversion
because from this the reader will be able to see more clearly both the excellence and the
grace of the man. He then while still very young was by the desire and command of his
parents joined in the tie of marriage, for as with pious anxiety they were careful about his
chastity, and were afraid of a critical fall at a dangerous age, they thought that the passions
of youth might be anticipated by the remedy of a lawful marriage. When then he had lived
for five years with a wife, he came to Abbot John, who was then for his marvellous sanctity
chosen to preside over the administration of the alms.90 For it is not anyone who likes who
is of his own wish or ambition promoted to this office, but only he whom the congregation
of all the Elders considers from the advantage of his age and the witness of his faith and
virtues to be more excellent than, and superior to, all others. To this blessed John then the
aforesaid young man had come in the eagerness of his pious devotion, bringing gifts of piety
among other owners who were eager to offer tithes and first-fruits of their substance to the
old man I mentioned,91 and when the old man saw them pouring in upon him with many
gifts, and was anxious to make some recompense in return for their offerings, he began, as
the Apostle says, to sow spiritual things to them whose carnal gifts he was reaping.92 And
finally thus began his word of exhortation.</p>

<head>The exhortation of Abbot John to Theonas and the others who had come together with him.</head>
<p>I am indeed delighted, my children, with the duteous liberality of your gifts; and your
devout offering, the disposal of which is entrusted to me, I gratefully accept, because you
are offering your firstfruits and tithes for the good and use of the needy, as a sacrifice to the
Lord, of a sweet smelling savour, in the belief that by the offering of them, the abundance
of your fruits and all your substance, from which you have taken away these for the Lord,
will be richly blessed, and that you yourselves will according to the faith of His command
be endowed even in this world with manifold richness in all good things: “Honour the Lord
from thy righteous labours, and offer to Him of the fruits of thy righteousness; that thy
garners may be full of abundance of wheat, and thy vats may overflow with wine.”93 And
as you are faithfully carrying out this service, you may know that you have fulfilled the
righteousness of the old law, under which those who then lived if they transgressed it inevitably
incurred guilt, while if they fulfilled it they could not attain to a pitch of perfection.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of the offering of tithes and firstfruits.</head>
<p>For indeed by the Lord’s command tithes were consecrated to the service of the Levites,
but oblations and firstfruits for the priests.94 But this was the law of the firstfruits; viz., that
the fiftieth part of fruits or animals should be given for the service of the temple and the
priests: and this proportion some who were faithlessly indifferent diminished, while those
who were very religious increased it, so that the one gave only the sixtieth part, and the
other gave the fortieth part of their fruits. For the righteous, for whom the law is not enacted,
are thus shown to be not under the law, as they try not only to fulfil but even to exceed the
righteousness of the law, and their devotion is greater than the legal requirement, as it goes
beyond the observance of precepts and adds to what is due of its own free will.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How Abraham, David, and other saints went beyond the requirement of the law.</head>
<p>For so we read that Abraham went beyond the requirement of the law which was afterwards
to be given, when after his victory over the four kings, he would not touch any of the
spoils of Sodom, which were fairly due to him as the conqueror, and which indeed the king
himself, whose spoils he had rescued, offered him; and with an oath by the Divine name he
exclaimed: “I lift up my hand to the Lord Most High, who made heaven and earth, that I
will not take from a thread to a shoe’s latchet of all that is thine.”95 So we know that David
went beyond the requirement of the law, as, though Moses commanded that vengeance
should be taken on enemies,96 he not only did not do this, but actually embraced his persecutors
with love, and piously entreated the Lord for them, and wept bitterly and avenged
them when they were slain. So we are sure that Elijah and Jeremiah were not under the law,
as though they might without blame have taken advantage of lawful matrimony, yet they
preferred to remain virgins. So we read that Elisha and others of the same mode of life went
beyond the commands of Moses, as of them the Apostle speaks as follows: “They went about
in sheepskins and in goatskins, they were oppressed, afflicted, in want, of whom the world
was not worthy, they wandered about in deserts and in mountains, and in caves and in dens
of the earth.”97 What shall I say of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab, of whom we are
told that, when at the Lord’s bidding the prophet Jeremiah offered them wine, they replied:
“We drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: Ye
shall drink no wine, ye and your sons forever: and ye shall build no house, nor sow any seed,
nor plant vineyards nor possess them: but ye shall dwell in tents all your days”? Wherefore
also they were permitted to hear from the same prophet these words: “Thus saith the Lord
God of hosts, the God of Israel: there shall not fail a man from the stock of Jonadab the son
of Rechab to stand in My sight all the days;”98 as all of them were not satisfied with merely
offering tithes of their possessions, but actually refused property, and offered the rather to
God themselves and their souls, for which no redemption can be made by man, as the Lord
testifies in the gospel: “For what shall a man give in exchange for his own soul?”99</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How those who live under the grace of the Gospel ought to go beyond the requirement of the
law.</head>
<p>Wherefore we ought to know that we from whom the requirements of the law are no
longer exacted, but in whose ears the word of the gospel daily sounds: “If thou wilt be perfect,
go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,
and come follow Me,”100 when we offer to God tithes of our substance, are still in a way
ground down beneath the burden of the law, and not able to rise to those heights of the
gospel, those who conform to which are recompensed not only by blessings in this present
life, but also by future rewards. For the law promises to those who obey it no rewards of the
kingdom of heaven, but only solaces in this life, saying: “The man that doeth these things
shall live in them.”101 But the Lord says to His disciples: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven;” and: “Everyone that leaveth house or brothers or sisters
or father or mother or wife or children or field for My name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold,
and shall inherit eternal life.”102 And this with good reason. For it is not so praiseworthy
for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these last out of reverence
for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even
those who, faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient to the more ancient precepts
of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly how far short
of it those fall who do not even do this. For how can those men be partakers of the grace of
the gospel who disregard the fulfilment even of the lighter commands of the law, to the easy
character of which the weighty words of the giver of the law bear testimony, as a curse is
actually invoked on those who do not fulfil them; for it says: “Cursed is everyone that does
not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.”103 But here
on account of the superiority and excellence of the commandments it is said: “He that can
receive it, let him receive it.”104 There the forcible compulsion of the lawgiver shows the
easy character of the precepts; for he says: “I call heaven and earth to record against you this
day, that if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord your God ye shall perish from
off the face of the earth.”105 Here the grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very
fact that He does not order, but exhorts, saying: “if thou wilt be perfect go” and do this or

that. There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are unwilling: here
Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and eager for perfection. For that was not
to be enjoined as a general charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from
all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty nature; but by
counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that those who are great may deservedly be
crowned by the perfection of their virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come
up to “the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,”106 although they seem to be lost
to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet be free from the
darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present evils or visited
with eternal punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion
of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the power of free
will, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a
command, there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those things
to which they are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment with
which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a recompense.</p>

<head>How the grace of the gospel supports the weak so that they can obtain pardon, as it secures to
the perfect the kingdom of God.</head>
<p>And as the word of the gospel raises those that are strong to sublime and lofty heights,
so it suffers not the weak to be dragged down to the depths, for it secures to the perfect the
fulness of blessing, and brings to those who are overcome through weakness pardon. For
the law placed those who fulfilled its commands in a sort of middle state between what they
deserved in either case, severing them from the condemnation due to transgressors, as it
also kept them away from the glory of the perfect. But how wretched and miserable this is,
you can see from comparing the state of this present life, in which it is considered a very
poor thing for a man to sweat and labour only to avoid being regarded as guilty among good
men, not also to be esteemed rich and honourable and renowned.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How it lies in our own power to choose whether to remain under the grace of the gospel or
under the terror of the law.</head>
<p>Wherefore it lies today in our own power whether we choose to live under the grace of
the gospel or under the terrors of the law: for each man must incline to one side or the other
in accordance with the character of his actions, for either the grace of Christ welcomes those
who go beyond the law, or else the law keeps its hold over the weaker ones as those who are
its debtors and within its clutches. For one who is guilty as regards the precepts of the law
will never be able to attain to the perfection of the gospel, even though he idly boasts that
he is a Christian and freed by the Lord’s grace: for we must not only regard as still under
the law the man who refuses to fulfil what the law enjoins, but the man as well who is satisfied
with the mere observance of what the law commands, and who never brings forth fruits
worthy of his vocation and the grace of Christ, where it is not said: “Thou shalt offer to the
Lord thy God thy tithes and firstfruits;” but: “Go and sell all that thou hast and give to the
poor, and come follow Me;”107 where, owing to the grandeur of perfection, to the request
of the disciple there is not granted even the very short space of an hour in which to bury his
father,108 as the offices of human charity are outweighed by the virtue of Divine love.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How Theonas exhorted his wife that she too should make her renunciation.</head>
<p>And when he had heard this the blessed Theonas was fired with an uncontrollable desire
for the perfection of the gospel, and, committed, as it were, the seed of the word, which he
had received in a fruitful heart, to the deep and broken furrows of his bosom, as he was
greatly humiliated and conscience-stricken because the old man had said not only that he
had failed to attain to the perfection of the gospel, but also that he had scarcely fulfilled the
commands of the law; since though he was accustomed every year to pay the tithes of his
fruits as alms, yet he mourned that he had never even heard of the law of the firstfruits; and
even if he had in the same way fulfilled this, he humbly confessed that still he would in the
old man’s view have been very far from the perfection of the gospel. And so he returned
home sad and filled with that sorrow which worketh repentance unto salvation,109 and of
his own will and determination turns all his wife’s care and anxiety of mind towards salvation;
and began to stir her up to the same eager desire with which he himself had been inflamed,
with the same sort of exhortations, and with tears day and night to urge her that together
they might serve God in sanctity and chastity, telling her that their conversion to a better
life ought not to be deferred because a vain hope in their youth would be no argument
against the inevitableness of a sudden death, which carries off boys and youths and young
persons equally with old men.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>How he fled to a monastery when his wife would not consent.</head>
<p>And when his wife was hard and would not consent to him as he constantly persisted
with entreaties of this kind, but said that as she was in the flower of her age she could not
altogether do without the solace of her husband, and further that supposing she was deserted
by him and fell into sin, the guilt would rather be his who had broken the bonds of wedlock:
to this he, when he had for a long while urged the condition of human nature (which being
so weak and uncertain, it would be dangerous for it to be any longer mixed up with carnal
desires and works), added the assertion that it was not right for anyone to cut himself off
from that virtue to which he had learnt that he ought by all means to cleave, and that it was
more dangerous to disregard goodness when discovered, than to fail to love it before it was
discovered; further that he was already involved in the guilt of a fall if when he had discovered
such grand and heavenly blessings he had preferred earthly and mean ones. Further that
the grandeur of perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the members
of the Church were urged to scale the heights of heavenly goodness when the Apostle said:
“So run that ye may obtain;”110 nor should those who were ready and eager for it hang back
because of the delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to be urged
on by those running before than for those who are doing their best to be hampered by the
slothful. Further that he had determined and made up his mind to renounce the world and
to die to the world that he might live to God, and that if he could not attain this happiness;
viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be saved even with the
loss of one member, and enter into the kingdom of heaven as one maimed rather than be
condemned with his body whole. But he also added and spoke as follows: If Moses suffered
wives to be divorced for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow this for
the desire of chastity, especially when the same Lord among those other affections; viz., for
fathers and mothers and children (all due regard to which not only the law but He Himself
also charged to be shown, yet for His name’s sake and for the desire of perfection He decreed
that they should not simply be disregarded but actually hated)—to these, I say, He joined
also the mention of wives, saying: “And everyone that hath left house, or brethren or sisters
or father or mother or wife or children for My name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold
and shall inherit eternal life.”111 So far then is He from allowing anything to be set against
that perfection which He is proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and
mother should be broken and disregarded out of love for Him, though according to the
Apostle it is the first commandment with promise; viz., “Honour thy father and thy mother,
<note type="footnote">110 1 Cor. ix. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">111 S. Matt. xix. 29.</note>

<pb n="1297"/>
which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee and that thy
days may be long upon earth.”112 And as the word of the gospel condemns those who break
the chains of matrimony where there has been no sin of adultery, so it clearly promises a
reward of an hundredfold to those who have cast off a carnal yoke out of love for Christ and
the desire for chastity. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen to reason
and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice; viz., that we should together
serve the Lord and escape the pains of hell, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I
will embrace it with a still greater love. For I acknowledge and honour my helpmeet assigned
to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be joined to her in an unbroken tie of
love in Christ, nor do I separate from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original
condition,113 if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant you to be. But if you
will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me
but to the adversary, and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this
reason that you may deprive yourself of this salvation which is offered to you, and also hold
me back from following the Saviour as a disciple, then I will resolutely lay hold on the words
which were uttered by the lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal
affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He says: “He that hateth
not father and mother and children and brothers and sisters and wife and lands, yea and
his own soul also, cannot be My disciple.”114 When then by these and such like words the
woman’s purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness, If, said
the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death, neither shall you separate me from
Christ: but it is safer for me to be divorced from a human person than from God. And so
by the aid of God’s grace he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered not
the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at once he stripped himself of
all his worldly goods, and fled to a monastery, where in a very short time he was so famous
for the splendour of his sanctity and humility that when John of blessed memory departed
this life to the Lord, and the holy Elias, a man who was no less great than his predecessor,
had likewise died, Theonas was chosen by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them
in the administration of the almsgiving.</p>

<head>An explanation that we may not appear to recommend separation from wives.</head>
<p>But let no one imagine that we have invented this for the sake of encouraging divorce,
as we not only in no way condemn marriage, but also, following the words of the Apostle,
say: “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled,”115 but it was in order faithfully
to show the reader the origin of the conversion by which this great man was dedicated to
God. And I ask the reader kindly, to allow that, whether he likes this or no, in either case I
am free from blame, and to give the praise or blame for this act to its real author. But as for
me, as I have not put forward an opinion of my own on this matter, but have given a simple
narration of the history of the facts, it is fair that as I claim no praise from those who approve
of what was done, so I should not be attacked by the hatred of those who disapprove of it.
Let every man therefore, as we said, have his own opinion on the matter. But I advise him
to restrain his censure in considering it, lest he come to fancy that he is more just and holy
than the Divine judgment, whereby the signs even of Apostolic virtue were conferred upon
him (viz., Theonas), not to mention the opinion of such great fathers by whom it is clear
that his action was not only not blamed, but even so far praised that in the election to the
office of almoner they preferred him to splendid and most excellent men. And I fancy that
the judgment of so many spiritual men, uttered with God as its author, was not wrong, as
it was, as was said above, confirmed by such wonderful signs.</p>

<head>An inquiry why in Egypt they do not fast during all the fifty days (of Easter) nor bend their

<p>But it is now time to follow out the plan of the promised discourse. So then when Abbot
Theonas had come to visit us in our cell during Eastertide116 after Evensong was over we
sat for a little while on the ground and began diligently to consider why they were so very
careful that no one should during the whole fifty days either bend his knees in prayer117 or
venture to fast till the ninth hour, and we made our inquiry the more earnestly because we
had never seen this custom so carefully observed in the monasteries of Syria.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>The answer on the nature of things good, bad, and indifferent.</head>
<p>To this Abbot Theonas thus began his reply. It is indeed right for us, even when we can
not see the reason, to yield to the authority of the fathers and to a custom of our predecessors
that has been continued through so many years down to our own time, and to observe it,
as handed down from antiquity, with constant care and reverence. But since you want to
know the reasons and grounds for this, receive in few words what we have heard as handed
down by our Elders on this subject. But before we bring forward the authority of Holy
Scripture, we will, if you please, say a little about the nature and character of the fast, that
afterwards the authority of Holy Scripture may support our words. The Divine Wisdom
has pointed out in Ecclesiastes that for everything, i.e., for all things happy or those which
are considered unfortunate and unhappy, there is a right time: saying: “For all things there
is a time, and a time for everything under the heaven. A time to bring forth and a time to
die; a time to plant and a time to pull down what is planted; a time to kill and a time to heal;
a time to destroy and a time to build; a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn
and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace
and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a
time to send away; a time to scatter and a time to collect; a time to be silent and a time to
speak; a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace;” and below:
“For there is a time,” it says, “for everything and for every deed.”118 None therefore of these
things does it lay down as always good, but only when any of them are fittingly done and
at the right time, so that these very things which at one time, when done at the right moment,
turn out well, if they are ventured on at a wrong or unsuitable time, are found to be useless
or harmful; only excepting those things which are in their own nature good or bad, and
which cannot ever be made the opposite, as, e.g., justice, prudence, fortitude, temperance
and the rest of the virtues, or on the other hand, those faults, the description of which cannot
possibly be altered or fall under the other head. But those things which can sometimes turn
out with either result, so that, in accordance with the character of those who use them, they
are found to be either good or bad, these we consider to be not absolutely in their own
natures useful or injurious, but only so in accordance with the mind of the doer, and the
suitableness of the time.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>What kind of good fasting is.</head>
<p>Wherefore we must now inquire what we ought to hold about the state of fasting,
whether we meant that it was good in the same sort of way as justice, prudence, fortitude
and temperance, which cannot possibly be made anything else, or whether it is something
indifferent which sometimes is useful when done, and may be sometimes omitted without
condemnation; and which sometimes it is wrong to do, and sometimes laudable to omit.
For if we hold fasting to be included in that list of virtues, so that abstinence from food is
placed among those things which are good in themselves, then certainly the partaking of
food will be bad and wrong. For whatever is the opposite of that which is in its own nature
good, must certainly be held to be in its own nature bad. But this the authority of Holy
Scripture does not allow to us to lay down. For if we fast with such thoughts and intentions,
so as to think that we fall into sin by taking food, we shall not only gain no advantage by
our abstinence but shall actually contract grievous guilt and fall into the sin of impiety, as
the Apostle says: “Abstaining from meats which God has created to be received with
thanksgiving by the faithful and those who know the truth. For every creature of God is
good, and nothing to be refused if it is partaken of with thanksgiving.” For “if a man thinks
that a thing is common, to him it is common.”119 And therefore we never read that anyone
is condemned simply for taking food, but only when something was joined with it or followed
afterwards, for which he deserved condemnation.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<pb n="1302"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How fasting is not good in its own nature.</head>
<p>And so that it is a thing indifferent is very clearly shown from this also; viz., because as
it brings justification when observed, so it does not bring condemnation when it is broken
in upon; unless perhaps the transgression of a command rather than the partaking of food
brings punishment. But in the case of a thing that is good in its own nature, no time should
be without it, in such a way as that a man may do without it, for if it ceases, the man who is
careless about it is sure to fall into mischief. Nor again is any time given for what is bad in
its own nature, because what is hurtful cannot help hurting, if it is indulged in, nor can it
ever be made of a praiseworthy character. And further it is clear that these things, for which
we see conditions and times appointed, and which sanctify, when observed without corrupting
us when they are neglected, are things indifferent, as, e.g., marriage, agriculture, riches,
retirement into the desert, vigils, reading and meditation on Holy Scripture and fasting itself,
from which our discussion took its rise. All of which things the Divine precepts and the
authority of Holy Scripture decreed should not be so incessantly aimed at, or so constantly
observed, as for it to be wrong for them to be for a time intermitted. For anything that is
absolutely commanded brings death if it be not fulfilled: but whatever things we are urged
to rather than commanded, when done are useful, when left undone bring no punishment.
And therefore in the case of all or some of these things our predecessors commanded us
either to do them with consideration, or to observe them carefully with regard to the reason,
place, manner, and time, because if any of them are done suitably, it is fit and convenient,
but if incongruously, then it becomes foolish and hurtful. And if at the coming of a brother
in whose person he ought to refresh Christ with courtesy and to embrace him with a most
kindly welcome, a man should choose to observe a strict fast, would he not rather be guilty
of incivility than gain the praise or reward of devoutness? or if when the failure or weakness
of the flesh requires the strength to be restored by the partaking of food, a man will not
consent to relax the rigour of his abstinence, is he not to be regarded as a cruel murderer of
his own body rather than as one who is careful for his salvation? So too when a festival season
permits a suitable indulgence in food and a necessarily liberal repast, if a man will resolutely
cling to the strict observance of a fast he must be considered as not religious so much as
boorish and unreasonable. But to those men also will these things be found bad, who are
on the lookout for the praises of men by their fasts, and by a foolish show of paleness gain
credit for sanctity, of whom the word of the Gospel tells us that they have received their reward
in this life, and whose fast the Lord execrates by the prophet. In whose person he first
objected to himself and said: “Wherefore have we fasted and Thou hast not regarded:
wherefore have we humbled our souls, and Thou hast not known it?” and then at once he
answered and explained the reasons why they did not deserve to be heard: “Behold,” he says,

<pb n="1303"/>
“in the days of your fast your own will is found and you exact of all your debtors. Behold
you fast for debates and strife, and strike with the fist wickedly. Do not fast as ye have done
unto this day, to make your cry to be heard on high. Is this such a fast as I have chosen, for
a man to afflict his soul for a day? Is it this, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread
sackcloth and ashes? Will ye call this a fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?” Then he
proceeds to teach how the abstinence of one who fasts may become acceptable, and clearly
lays down that fasting cannot be good of itself alone, but only when it has the following
reasons which are added: “Is not this,” he says, “the fast that I have chosen? Loose the bands
of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go free, and break
asunder every burden. Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the harbourless
into thine house: and when thou shalt see one naked cover him, and despise not thine own
flesh. Then shalt thy light break forth as the morning and thy health shall speedily arise, and
thy righteousness shall go before thy face and the glory of the Lord shall gather thee up.
Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall hear: thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.”120
You see then that fasting is certainly not considered by the Lord as a thing that is good in
its own nature, because it becomes good and well-pleasing to God not by itself but by other
works, and again from the surrounding circumstances it may be regarded as not merely
vain but actually hateful, as the Lord says: “When they fast I will not hear their prayers.”121</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>How a thing that is good in its own nature ought not to be done for the sake of some lesser
good.</head>
<p>For we ought not to practise pity, patience and love, and the precepts of the virtues
mentioned above, wherein there is what is good in its own nature, for the sake of fasting,
but rather fasting for the sake of them. For our endeavour must be that those virtues which
are really good may be gained by fasting, not that the practice of those virtues may lead to
fasting as its end. For this then the affliction of the flesh is useful, for this the remedy of abstinence
must be employed; viz., that by it we may succeed in attaining to love, wherein
there is what is good without change, and continually with no exception of time. For
medicines, and the goldsmith’s art, and the systems of other arts which there are in this
world are not employed for the sake of the instruments which belong to the particular work;
but rather the implements are prepared for the practice of the art. And as they are useful
for those who understand them, so they are useless to those who are ignorant of the system
of the art in question; and as they are a great help to those who rely on their aid for doing
their work, so they cannot be of the smallest use to those who do not know for what purpose
they were made, and are contented simply with the possession of them; because they make
all their value consist in the mere having of them, and not in the performance of work. That
then is in its own nature the best thing, for the sake of which things indifferent are done,
but the very chiefest good is done not for the sake of anything else but because of its own
intrinsic goodness.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1305"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>How what is good in its own nature can be distinguished from other things that are good.</head>
<p>And this may be distinguished from those other things which we have termed indifferent,
in these ways: if a thing is good in itself and not by reason of something else: if it is useful
for its own sake, and not for the sake of something else: if it is unchangeably and at all times
good, and always keeps its character and can never become anything different: if its removal
or cessation cannot fail to produce the greatest harm: if that which is its opposite is in the
same way evil in its own nature, and can never be turned into anything good. And these
descriptions by which the nature of things that are good in themselves can be distinguished,
cannot possibly be applied to fasting, for it is not good of itself, nor useful for its own sake
because it is wisely used for the acquisition of purity of heart and body, that the pricks of
the flesh being dulled the soul may be pacified and reconciled to its Creator, nor is it unchangeably
and at all times good, because often we are not injured by its intermission, and
indeed sometimes if it is unreasonably practised it becomes injurious. Nor is that which
seems its opposite evil in its own nature, i.e., the partaking of food, which is naturally
agreeable, which cannot be regarded as evil, unless intemperance and luxury or some other
faults are the result; “For not that which entereth into the mouth, defileth a man, but that
which cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man.”122 And so a man disparages what is
good in its own nature, and does not treat it properly or without sin, if he does it not for its
own sake but for the sake of something else, for everything else should be done for the sake
of it, but it should be sought for its own sake alone.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>Of the reason for fasting and its value.</head>
<p>So then let us constantly remember this description of the character of fasting, and always
aim at it with all the powers of the soul, in such a way as to recognize that then only is it
suitable for us if in it we preserve regard for time, its character and degree, and this not so
as to set the end of our hope upon it, but so that by it we may succeed in attaining to purity
of heart and Apostolical love. Therefore from this it is clear that fasting, for which not only
are there special seasons appointed at which it should be practised or relaxed, but conditions
and rules also laid down, is not good in its own nature, but something indifferent. But those
things which are either enjoined as good by the authority of a precept, or are forbidden as
bad, are never subject to any exceptions of time in such a way that sometimes we should do
what is forbidden or omit what is commanded. For there is no limit set to justice, patience,
soberness, modesty, love, nor on the other hand is a licence ever granted for injustice, impatience,
wrath, immodesty, envy, and pride.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>How fasting is not always suitable.</head>
<p>Wherefore as we have premised this on the conditions of fasting, it seems well to subjoin
the authority of Holy Scripture, by which it will be more clearly proved that fasting neither
can nor should be always observed. In the Gospel when the Pharisees were fasting together
with the disciples of John the Baptist, as the Apostles, as friends and companions of the
heavenly Bridegroom, were not yet keeping the observance of a fast, the disciples of John
(who thought that they acquired perfect righteousness by their fasts, as they were followers
of that grand preacher of repentance who afforded a pattern to all the people by his own
example, as he not only refused the different kinds of food which are supplied for man’s
use, but actually altogether did without eating the bread which is common to all) complained
to the Lord and said: “Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not?” to
whom the Lord in His reply plainly showed that fasting is not suitable or necessary at all
times, when any festival season or opportunity for love intervenes and permits an indulgence
in food, saying: “Can the children of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with
them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and
then shall they fast;”123 words which although they were spoken before the resurrection of
His Body, yet specially point to the season of Eastertide, in which after His resurrection for
forty days He ate with His disciples, and their joy in His daily Presence did not allow them
to fast.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<pb n="1309"/>
<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<head>The answer.</head>
<p>Your pertinent question deserves to be told the perfect true reason. After the Ascension
of our Saviour which took place on the fortieth day after His Resurrection, the apostles returned
from the Mount of Olives, on which He had suffered them to see Him when He was
returning to the Father, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles also testifies, and entered
Jerusalem and are said to have waited ten days for the coming of the Holy Ghost, and when
these were fulfilled on the fiftieth day they received Him with joy. And thus in this way the
number of this festival was clearly made up, which as we read was figuratively foreshadowed
also in the Old Testament, where when seven weeks were fulfilled the bread of the firstfruits
was ordered to be offered by the priests to the Lord:124 and this was indeed shown to be
offered to the Lord by the preaching of the Apostles which they are said on that day to have
addressed to the people; the true bread of the firstfruits, which when produced from the
instruction of a new doctrine, consecrated the firstfruits of the Jews as a Christian people
to the Lord, five thousand men being filled with the gifts of the food. And therefore these
ten days are to be kept with equal solemnity and joy as the previous forty. And the tradition
about this festival, transmitted to us by Apostolic men, should be kept with the same uniformity.
For therefore on those days they do not bow their knees in prayer, because the
bending of the knees is a sign of penitence and mourning. Wherefore also during these days

taught that men ought not to fast nor to bow the knee, out of reverence for the Lord’s Resurrection.</p>

<head>A question whether the relaxation of the fast is not prejudicial to the chastity of the body.</head>
<p>Germanus: Can the flesh, attracted by the unwonted luxuries of so long a festival fail to
produce something thorny from the incentives to sin although they have been cut down?
or can the soul weighed down by the consumption of unaccustomed feasts fail to mitigate
the rigour of its rule over its servant the body, especially when in our case our mature age
can excite our subject members to a speedy revolt, if we venture to take our usual food in
larger quantities, or unaccustomed food more freely than usual?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<head>The answer on the way to keep control over abstinence.</head>
<p>Theonas: If we weigh everything that we do, by a reasonable judgment of the mind, and
on the purity of our heart always consult not the opinions of other people but our own
conscience, that interval for refreshment is sure not to interfere with our proper strictness,
if only, as was said, our pure mind impartially considers the right limits of indulgence and
abstinence, and fairly checks excess in either, and with real discrimination discerns whether
the weight of the delicacies is a burden upon our spirits, or whether too much austerity in
abstaining weighs down the other side, i.e., that of the body, and either depresses or raises
that side which it sees to be raised or weighed down. For our Lord would have nothing done
to His honour and glory without being tempered by judgment, for “the honour of a king
loveth judgment,”125 and therefore Solomon, the wisest of men, urges us not to let our
judgment incline to either side, saying: “Honour God with thy righteous labours and offer
to Him of the fruits of thy righteousness.”126 For we have residing in our conscience an
uncorrupt and true judge who sometimes, when all are wrong, is the only person not deceived
as to the state of our purity. And so with all care and pains we should preserve a constant
purpose in our circumspect heart for fear lest if the judgment of our discretion goes wrong,
we may be fired with the desire for an ill-considered abstinence, or allured by the wish for
an excessive relaxation, and so weigh the substance of our strength in the tongue of an unfair
balance; but we should place in one of the scales our purity of soul, and in the other our
bodily strength, and weigh them both in the true judgment of conscience, so that we may
not perversely incline the scale of fairness to either side, either to undue strictness or to excessive
relaxation, from the preponderating desire for one or the other, and so have this
said to us by reason of excessive strictness or relaxation: “If thou offerest rightly, but dost
not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned?”127 For those offerings of fasts, which we
thoughtlessly extort by violently tearing our bowels, and fancy that we rightly offer to the
Lord, these He execrates who “loves mercy and judgment” saying: “I the Lord love judgment,
but I hate robbery in a burnt offering.”128 Those also who take the main part of their offerings,
i.e., their offices and actions, to benefit the flesh for their own use, but leave the remains of
them and a tiny portion for the Lord, these the Divine Word thus condemns as fraudulent
workmen: “Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord fraudulently.”129 It is not then

<pb n="1312"/>
without reason that the Lord reproves him who thus deceives himself by unfair considerations,
saying: “But vain are the children of men: the children of men are liars upon the balances
that they may deceive.”130 And therefore the blessed Apostle warns us to keep hold
of the reins of discretion and not to be attracted by excess and swerve to either side, saying:
“Your reasonable service.”131 And the giver of the law similarly forbids the same thing,
saying: “Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just and the sextarius
equal,”132 and Solomon also gives a like opinion on this matter: “Great and small weights
and double measures are both unclean before the Lord, and one who uses them shall be
hindered in his contrivances.”133 Further not only in the way in which we have said, but
also in this must we strive not to have unfair weights in our hearts, nor double measures in
the storehouse of our conscience, i.e., not to overwhelm those, to whom we are to preach
the word of the Lord, with precepts that are too strict and heavier than we ourselves can
bear, while we take for granted that for ourselves those things which have to do with the
rule of strictness are to be softened by a freer allowance of relaxation. For when we do this,
what is it but to weigh and measure the goods and fruits of the Lord’s commands in a double
weight and measure? For if we dispense them in one way to ourselves and in another to our
brethren, we are rightly blamed by the Lord because we have unfair balances and double
measures, in accordance with the saying of Solomon which tells us that “A double weight
is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful balance is not good in His sight.”134 In this
way also we plainly incur the guilt of using a deceitful weight and a double measure, if out
of the desire for the praise of men, we make a show before the brethren of greater strictness
than what we practice in private in our own cells, trying to appear more abstinent and holier
in the sight of men than in the sight of God, an evil which we should not only avoid but
actually loathe. But meanwhile as we have wandered some way from the question before
us, let us return to the point from which we started.</p>

<head>Of the time and measure of refreshment.</head>
<p>So then we should keep the observance of the days mentioned in such a way that the
relaxation allowed may be useful rather than harmful to the good of body and soul, because
the joy of any festival cannot blunt the pricks of the flesh, nor can that fierce enemy of ours
be pacified by regard for days. In order then that the observance of the customs appointed
for festival seasons may be kept and that the most salutary rule of abstinence be not at all
exceeded it is enough for us to allow the permitted relaxation to go so far, as for us out of
regard for the festival season to take the food, which ought to be taken at the ninth hour, a
little earlier; viz., at the sixth hour, but with this condition, that the regular allowance and
character of the food be not altered, for fear lest the purity of body and uprightness of soul
which has been gained by the abstinence of Lent be lost by the relaxation of Eastertide, and
it profit us nothing to have acquired by our fast what a careless satiety causes us presently
to lose, especially as the well-known cunning of our enemy assaults the stronghold of our
purity then chiefly when he sees that our guard over it is somewhat relaxed at the celebration
of some festival. Wherefore we must most vigilantly look out that the vigour of our soul be
never enervated by seductive flatteries, and we lose not the purity of our chastity, gained,
as was said, by the continuous efforts of Lent, by the repose and carelessness of Eastertide.
And therefore no addition at all should be made to the quality or the quantity of the food,
but even on the highest festivals we should similarly abstain from those foods, by abstinence
from which we preserve our uprightness on common days, that the joy of the festival may
not excite in us a most deadly conflict of carnal desires, and so be turned to grief, and put
an end to that most excellent festival of the heart, which exults in the joy of purity; and after
a brief show of carnal joy we begin to mourn our lost purity of heart with a lasting sorrow
of repentance. Moreover we should strive that this warning of the prophetic exhortation
may not be uttered against us to no purpose: “Celebrate, O Judah, thy festivals, and pay thy
vows.”135 For if the occurrence of festival days does not interfere with the continuity of our
abstinence, we shall continually enjoy spiritual festivals and so, when we cease from servile
work, “there shall be month after month and Sabbath after Sabbath.”136</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<head>A question on the different ways of keeping Lent.</head>
<p>Germanus: What is the reason why Lent is kept for six weeks, while in some countries
a possibly more earnest care for religion seems to have added a seventh week as well, though
neither number when you subtract Sunday and Saturday, gives the total of forty days? For
only six and thirty days are included in these weeks.137</p>
<note type="footnote">137 On the different uses in regard to the Lenten fast Socrates (H. E. V. xxii.) writes as follows: “Those at
Rome fast three successive weeks before Easter, excepting Saturdays and Sundays. The Illyrians, Achaians, and
Alexandrians observe a fast of six weeks, which they call the forty days’ fast. Others commencing their fast from
the seventh week before Easter, and fasting for fifteen days by intervals, yet call that time the forty days’ fast.”
There are difficulties in the way of accepting the statement about the custom at Rome (see below), but the great
variety of customs is fully confirmed by Sozomen (H. E. VII. xix.): “In some churches the time before Easter,
which is called Quadragesima, and is devoted by the people to fasting, is made to consist of six weeks: and this
is the case in Illyria, and the western regions, in Libya, throughout Egypt, and in Palestine: whereas it is made
to comprise seven weeks at Constantinople, and in the neighbouring provinces as far as Phoenicia. In some
churches the people fast three alternate weeks during the space of six or seven weeks; whereas in others they
fast continuously during the three weeks immediately preceding the festival.” The statement here made with
regard to the West is true except as regards Milan, where Saturday was kept (as in the East) as a festival: while
for the Constantinopolitan practice Chrysostom (Hom. xi. in Gen. § 2) confirms what Sozomen says: while
Cassian’s language in the text bears witness to the fact that both Egypt and Palestine agreed with the Roman
practice. In either case, whether the fast began seven or six weeks before Easter, the number of days observed
in the fast was the same; Saturdays (with the exception of Easter Eve which was always regarded as a fast) being
excluded in the former case, while they were all included in the latter. Cf. below, c. xxvi.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>The answer to the effect that the fast of Lent has reference to the tithe of the year.</head>
<p>Theonas: Although the pious simplicity of some folks would put aside a question on
this subject, yet because you are more scrupulous in your examination of those things which
another would consider unworthy to be asked about, and want to know the whole truth of
this observance of ours and the secret of it, you shall have a very clear reason for this also,
that you may still more plainly be convinced that our predecessors taught nothing unreasonable.
By the law of Moses the command propounded to all the people generally was this:
“Thou shalt offer to the Lord thy God thy tithes and firstfruits.”138 And so, while we are
commanded to offer tithes of our substance and all our fruits, it is much more needful for
us to offer tithes of our life and ordinary employments and actions, which certainly is clearly
arranged for in the calculation of Lent. For the tithe of the number of all the days included
in the revolving circle of the year is thirty-six days and a half. But in seven weeks, if Sundays
and Saturdays are subtracted, there remain thirty-five days assigned for fasting. But by the
addition of Easter Eve when the Saturday’s fast is prolonged to the cock-crowing at the dawn
of Easter Day, not only is the number of thirty-six days made up, but in regard to the tithe
of the five days which seemed to be over, if the bit of the night which was added be taken
into account nothing will be wanting to the whole sum.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>How we ought also to offer our firstfruits to the Lord.</head>
<p>But what shall I say of the firstfruits which surely are given daily by all who serve Christ
faithfully? For when men waking from sleep and arising with renewed activity after their
rest, before they take in any impulse or thought in their heart, or admit any recollection or
consideration of business consecrate their first and earliest thoughts as divine offerings,
what are they doing indeed but rendering the firstfruits of their produce through the High
Priest Jesus Christ for the enjoyment of this life and a figure of the daily resurrection? And
also when roused from sleep in the same way they offer to God a sacrifice of joy and invoke
Him with the first motion of their tongue and celebrate His name and praise, and throwing
open, the first thing, the door of their lips to sing hymns to Him they offer to God the offices
of their mouth; and to Him also in the same way their bring the earliest offerings of their
hands and steps, when they rise from bed and stand in prayer and before they use the services
of their limbs for their own purposes, take to themselves nothing of their services, but for
His glory advance their steps, and set them in His praise and so render the first fruits of all
their movements by stretching forth the hands, bending the knees, and prostrating the whole
body. For in no other way can we fulfil that of which we sing in the Psalm: “I prevented the
dawning of the day and cried;” and: “Mine eyes to Thee have prevented the morning that I
might meditate on Thy words;” and: “In the morning shall my prayer prevent Thee;”139
unless after our rest in sleep when, as we said above, we are restored as from darkness and
death to this light, we have the courage not to begin by taking any of all the services both
of mind and body for our own uses. For there is no other morning which the prophet
“prevented,” or which in the same way we ought to prevent, except either ourselves, i.e., our
occupations and feelings and earthly cares, without which we cannot exist—or the most
subtle suggestions of the adversary, which he tries to suggest to us, while still resting and
overcome with sleep, by the phantoms of vain dreams, with which, when we presently awake,
he will fill our minds and occupy us, that he may be the first to seize and carry off the spoils
of our firstfruits. Wherefore we must take the utmost care (if we want to fulfil in act the
meaning of the above quoted verse) that an anxious watchfulness takes regard of our first
and earliest morning thoughts, that they may not be defiled beforehand being hastily taken
possession of by our jealous adversary, and thus he may make our firstfruits to be rejected
by the Lord as worthless and common. And if he is not prevented by us with watchful circumspection
of mind, he will not lay aside his habit of miserably anticipating us nor cease
day after day to prevent us by his wiles. And therefore if we want to offer firstfruits that are
acceptable and well pleasing to God of the fruits of our mind, we ought to spend no ordinary
<note type="footnote">139 Ps. cxviii. (cxix.) 147, 148; lxxxvii. (lxxxviii.) 14.</note>

<pb n="1317"/>
care to keep all the senses of our body, especially during the hours of the morning, as a
sacred holocaust to the Lord pure and undefiled in all things. And this kind of devotion
many even of those who live in the world observe with the utmost care, as they rise before
it is light or very early, and do not at all mix in the ordinary and necessary business of this
world before hastening to church and striving to consecrate in the sight of God the firstfruits
of all their actions and doings.</p>

<head>Why Lent is kept by very many with a different number of days.</head>
<p>Further, as for what you say; viz., that in some countries Lent is kept in different ways,
i.e., for six or seven weeks, it is but one system and the same manner of the fast that is preserved
by the different observance of the weeks. For those who think one ought to fast also
on the Saturday, have determined on the observance of six weeks. They therefore fast for
six days out of the seven, and this being six times repeated makes up the six and thirty days.
It is therefore, as we said, but one system and the same manner of the fast, although there
seems to be a difference in the number of the weeks.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<head>Why it is called Quadragesima, when the fast is only kept for thirty-six days.</head>
<p>But further, as man’s carelessness dropped out of sight the reason of this, this season
when, as was said, the tithes of the year are offered by fasts for thirty-six days and a half,
was called Quadragesima,140 a name which perhaps they thought ought to be given to it for
this reason; viz., that it is said that Moses and Elijah and our Lord Jesus Christ Himself fasted
for forty days. To the mystery of which number are not unsuitably applied those forty years
in which Israel dwelt in the wilderness, and in like manner the forty stations which they are
said to have passed through with a mystic meaning. Or perhaps the tithe was properly given
the name of Quadragesima from the use of the custom-house. For so that state tax is commonly
called, from which the same proportion of the increment is assigned for the king’s
use, as the legal tribute of Quadragesima, which is required of us by the King of all the ages
for the use of our life. At any rate, although this has nothing to do with the question raised,
yet I think that I ought not to omit the fact that very often our elders used to testify that especially
on these days the whole body of monks was attacked according to the ancient custom
of the people opposed to them, and was more vehemently urged to forsake their homes, for
this reason, because in accordance with this figure, whereby the Egyptians formerly oppressed
the children of Israel with grievous afflictions, so now also the spiritual Egyptians try to bow
down the true Israel, i.e., the monastic folk, with hard and vile tasks, lest by means of that
peace which is dear to God, we should forsake the land of Egypt, and for our good cross to
the desert of virtues, so that Pharaoh rages against us and says: “They are idle and therefore
they cry saying: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord our God. Let them be oppressed with labours,
and be harassed in their works, and they shall not be harassed by vain words.”141 For
<note type="footnote">140 Cassian here gives three suggestions why the fast of thirty-six days’ duration was called Quadragesima.
(1) As roughly corresponding to the forty days fast of Moses, Elijah, and the Lord Himself, (2) because “forty”
is the number associated with a time of probation in Scripture, and (3) because of the analogy of a legal tribute
of “Quadragesima” paid to the Sovereign. It is certainly a curious and difficult question why the name Quadragesima
should have been so universally applied to the fast, when there is no evidence of its having been kept
for forty days till sometime after the date of Gregory the Great, when Ash Wednesday and the three following
days were prefixed to the six weeks expressly for the purpose of making the number forty. The name however,
had as we see from Socrates, Sozomen, Cassian himself, and many other writers, existed long before this; and
on the whole it appears probable that it originated in none of the reasons given above by Cassian but that in the
first instance it was connected “with the period during which our Lord yielded to the power of death, which was
estimated at forty hours; viz., from noon on Friday till 4 A.M. on Sunday.” See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,
Vol. ii. p. 973; and cf. Irenæus Ep. ad Victor. in Euseb. V. xxiv.; and Tertullian De Orat. c. 18; and De Jejuniis

certainly their folly imagines that the holy sacrifice of the Lord, which is only offered in the
desert of a pure heart, is the height of folly, for “religion is an abomination to a sinner.”142</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<head>How those who are perfect go beyond the fixed rule of Lent.</head>
<p>By this law of Lent then the man who is upright and perfect is not restrained nor is he
content with merely submitting to that paltry rule which the heads of the church have established
for those who all the year round are involved in pleasure or business, that they may
be bound by this legal requirement and forced at any rate during these days to find time for
the Lord, and dedicate to Him the tithe of the days of their life, all of which they would have
consumed as their profits. But the righteous, for whom the law is not appointed, and who
devote to spiritual duties not a small part; viz., the tenth, but the whole time of their life,
because they are free from the burden of tithes according to law, for this reason, if any
worthy and pious occasion happening to them constrains them, are ready to relax their
station fast143 without any hesitation. For in their case it is no paltry tithe that is diminished,
as they offer all that they have to the Lord equally with themselves. And this certainly a man
could not do without being guilty of a grievous wrong, who, offering nothing of his own
free will to God, is forced to pay his tithes by the stern compulsion of the law which takes
no excuse. Wherefore it is clearly established that the servant of the law cannot be perfect,
who only shuns those things which are forbidden and does those things which are commanded,
but that those are really perfect who do not take advantage even of those things
which the law allows. And in this way, though it is said of the Mosaic law that “the law
brought nothing to perfection,”144 we read that some of the saints in the Old Testament
were perfect because they went beyond the commands of the law and lived under the perfection
of the Gospel: “Knowing that the law is not appointed for the righteous but for the
unrighteous and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the wicked and defiled, etc.”145</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
<head>Of the origin and beginning of Lent.</head>
<p>Howbeit you should know that as long as the primitive church retained its perfection
unbroken, this observance of Lent did not exist. For they were not bound by the requirements
of this order, or by any legal enactments, nor confined in the very narrow limits of the fast,
as the fast embraced equally the whole year round. But when the multitude of believers
began day by day to decline from that apostolic fervour, and to look after their own wealth,
and not to portion it out for the good of all the faithful in accordance with the arrangement
of the apostles, but having an eye to their own private expenses, tried not only to keep it but
actually to increase it, not content with following the example of Ananias and Sapphira,
then it seemed good to all the priests that men who were hampered by worldly cares, and
almost ignorant, if I may say so, of abstinence and contrition, should be recalled to the pious
duty by a fast canonically enjoined, and be constrained by the necessity of paying the legal
tithes, as this certainly would be good for the weak brethren and could not do any harm to
the perfect who were living under the grace of the gospel and by their voluntary devotion
going beyond the law, so as to succeed in attaining to the blessedness which the Apostle
speaks of: “For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under
grace.”146 For of a truth sin cannot exercise dominion over one who lives faithfully under
the liberty of grace.</p>

<head>A question, how we ought to understand the Apostle’s words: “Sin shall not have dominion
over you.”</head>
<p>Germanus: Because this saying of the Apostle, which promises freedom from care not
only to monks but to all Christians in general, cannot lead us wrong, it seems to us somewhat
obscure. For whereas he maintains that all those who believe the gospel are at liberty and
free from the yoke and dominion of sin, how is it that the dominion of sin holds vigorous
sway over almost all the baptized, in accordance with the Lord’s words, where He says:
“Every one that doeth sin is the servant of sin”?147</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
<head>The answer on the difference between grace and the commands of the law.</head>
<p>Theonas: Your inquiry once more raises before us a question of no small extent. The
explanation of which though I know that it cannot be taught to or understood by the inexperienced,
yet as far as I can, I will try to set forth in words and briefly to explain, if only
your minds will follow up and act upon what we say. For whatever is known not by teaching
but by experience, just as it cannot be taught by one without experience, so neither can it
be grasped or taken in by the mind of one who has not laid the foundation by a similar study
and training. And therefore I think it necessary for us first to inquire somewhat carefully
what is the purpose or meaning of the law, and what is the system and perfection of grace,
that from this we may succeed in understanding the dominion of sin and how to drive it
out. And so the law chiefly commands men to seek the bonds of wedlock, saying: “Blessed
is he that hath seed in Sion and an household in Jerusalem;”148 and: “Cursed is the barren
that hath not borne.”149 On the other hand grace invites us to the purity of perpetual chastity,
and the undefiled state of blessed virginity, saying: “Blessed are the barren, and the breasts
which have not given suck;” and: “he that hateth not father and mother and wife cannot be
my disciple;” and this of the Apostle: “It remaineth that they that have wives be as though
they had them not.”150 The law says: “Thou shalt not delay to offer thy tithes and firstfruits;”
grace says: “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor:”151
The law forbids not retaliation for wrongs and vengeance for injuries, saying “An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth.” Grace would have our patience proved by the injuries and
blows offered to us being redoubled, and bids us be ready to endure twice as much damage;
saying: “If a man strike thee on one cheek, offer him the other also; and to him who will
contend with thee at the law and take away thy coat, give him thy cloak also.”152 The one
decrees that we should hate our enemies, the other that we should love them so that it holds
that even for them we ought always to pray to God.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
<head>Of the fact that the precepts of the gospel are milder than those of the law.</head>
<p>Whoever therefore climbs this height of evangelical perfection, is at once raised by the
merits of such virtue above every law, and disregarding as trivial all that is commanded by
Moses, recognizes that he is only subject to the grace of the Saviour, by whose aid he knows
that he attained to that most exalted condition. Therefore sin has no dominion over him,
“because the love of God, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
given to us,”153 shuts out all care for everything else, and can neither desire what is forbidden,
or disregard what is commanded, as its whole aim and all its desire is ever fixed on divine
love, and to such an extent is it not caught by the delights of worthless things, that it actually
does not take advantage of those things which are permitted. But under the law, where
lawful marriages are observed, although the rovings of wantonness are restrained, and bound
down to one woman alone, yet the pricks of carnal lust cannot help being vigorous; and it
is hard for the fire, for which fuel is expressly supplied, to be thus shut in within prearranged
limits, so as not to spread further and burn up anything it touches. As even if this objection
occurs to it that it is not allowed to be kindled beyond these limits, yet even while it is kept
in check, it is on fire because the will itself is in fault, and its habit of carnal intercourse
hurries it into too speedy excesses of adultery. But those whom the grace of the Saviour has
fired with the holy love of chastity, so consume all the thorns of carnal desires in the fire of
the Lord’s love, that no dying embers of sin interfere with the coldness of their purity. The
servants of the law then from the use of lawful things fall away to unlawful; the partakers of
grace while they disregard lawful things know nothing of unlawful ones. But as sin is alive
in one who loves marriage, so is it also in one who is satisfied with merely paying his tithes
and firstfruits. For, while he is dawdling or careless, he is sure to sin in regard to either their
quality or quantity, or the daily distribution of them. For as he is commanded unweariedly
to minister to those in want of what is his, although he may dispense it with the fullest faith
and devotion, yet it is hard for him not to fall often into the snares of sin. But over those
who have not set at naught the counsel of the Lord, but who, disposing of all their property
to the poor, take up their cross and follow the bestower of grace, sin can have no dominion.
For no faithless anxiety for getting food will annoy him who piously distributes and disperses
his wealth already consecrated to Christ and no longer regarded as his own; nor will any
grudging hesitation take away from the cheerfulness of his almsgiving, because without any
thought of his own needs or fear of his own food running short he is distributing what has
once for all been completely offered to God, and is no longer regarded as his own, as he is
sure that when he has succeeded in stripping himself as he desires, he will be fed by God

much more than the birds of the air. On the other hand he who retains his goods of this
world, or, bound by the rules of the old law, distributes the tithe of his produce, and his
firstfruits, or a portion of his income, although he may to a considerable degree quench the
fire of his sins by this dew of almsgiving, yet, however generously he gives away his wealth,
it is impossible for him altogether to rid himself of the dominion of sin, unless perhaps by
the grace of the Saviour, together with his substance he gets rid of all love of possessing. In
the same way he cannot fail to be subject to the bloody sway of sin, whoever chooses to pull
out, as the law commands, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, or to hate his enemy, for
while he desires by retaliation in exchange to avenge an injury done to himself, and while
he cherishes bitter hatred against an enemy, he is sure always to be inflamed with the passion
of anger and rage. But whoever lives under the light of the grace of the gospel, and overcomes
evil by not resisting it, but by bearing it, and does not hesitate of his own free will to give to
one who smites his right cheek, the other also, and to one who wants to raise a lawsuit against
him for his coat, gives his cloak also, and who loves his enemies, and prays for those who
slander him, this man has broken the yoke of sin and burst its chains. For he is not living
under the law, which does not destroy the seeds of sin (whence not without reason the
Apostle says of it: “There is a setting aside of the former commandment because of the
weakness and unprofitableness thereof: for the law brought nothing to perfection;” and the
Lord says by the prophet: “And I gave them commands that were not good, and ordinances,
whereby they could not live”154, but under grace which does not merely lop off the boughs
of wickedness, but actually tears up the very roots of an evil will.</p>

<head>How a man can be shown to be under grace.</head>
<p>Whoever then strives to reach the perfection of evangelical teaching, this man living
under grace is not oppressed by the dominion of sin, for to be under grace is to do those
things which grace commands. But whoever will not submit himself to the complete requirements
of evangelical perfection, must not remain ignorant that, although he seems to be
baptized and to be a monk, yet he is not under grace, but is still shackled by the chains of
the law, and weighed down by the burden of sin. For it is the aim of Him, who by the grace
of adoption accepts all those by whom He has been received, not to destroy but to build
upon, not to abolish but to fulfil the Mosaic requirements. But some knowing nothing about
this, and disregarding the splendid counsels and exhortations of Christ, are so emancipated
by the carelessness of a freedom too hastily assumed, that they not only fail to carry out the
commands of Christ as if they were too hard, but actually scorn as antiquated, the commands
given to them as beginners and children by the law of Moses, saying in this dangerous
freedom of theirs that which the Apostle execrates: “We have sinned, because we are not
under the law but under grace.”155 He then who is neither under grace, because he has
never climbed the heights of the Lord’s teaching, nor under the law, because he has not accepted
even those small commands of the law, this man, ground down beneath a twofold
rule of sin, fancies that he has received the grace of Christ, simply and solely for this, that
by this dangerous liberty of his he may make himself none of His, and falls into that state,
which the Apostle Peter warns us to avoid, saying: “Act as free, and not having your liberty
as a cloak of wickedness.” The blessed Apostle Paul also says: “For ye, brethren, were called
to liberty,” i.e., that ye might be free from the dominion of sin, “only use not your liberty
for an occasion of the flesh,”156 i.e., believe that the doing away with the commands of the
law is a licence to sin. But this liberty, the Apostle Paul teaches us is nowhere but where the
Lord is dwelling, for he says: “The Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is there
is liberty.”157 Wherefore I know not whether I could express and explain the meaning of
the blessed Apostle, as those know how, who have experience; one thing I do know, that it
is very clearly revealed even without anyone’s explanation to all those who have perfectly
acquired πρακτικὴ, i.e., practical training. For they will need no effort to understand in
discussion what they have already learnt by practice.</p>

<head>A question, why sometimes when we are fasting more strictly than usual, we are troubled by

<p>Germanus: You have very clearly explained a most difficult question, and one which,
as we think, is unknown to many. Wherefore we pray you to add this also for our good, and
carefully to expound why sometimes when we are fasting more strictly than usual, and are
exhausted and worn out, severer bodily struggles are excited. For often on waking from

we do not even venture faithfully to rise even for prayer.</p>

<head>The answer, telling that this question should be reserved for a future Conference.</head>
<p>Theonas: Your zeal indeed, whereby you desire to reach the way of perfection, not for
a moment only but fully and perfectly, urges us to continue this discussion unweariedly.
For you are anxiously inquiring not about external chastity or outward circumcision, but
about that which is secret, as you know that complete perfection does not consist in this
visible continence of the flesh which can be attained either by constraint, or by hypocrisy
even by unbelievers, but in that voluntary and invisible purity of heart, which the blessed
Apostle describes as follows: “For he is not a Jew which is so outwardly, nor is that circumcision
which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and the circumcision
is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of
God,”159 who alone searches the secrets of the heart. But because it is not possible for your
wish to be fully satisfied (as the short space of the night that is left is not enough for the investigation
of this most difficult question,) I think it well to postpone it for a while. For these
matters, as they should be propounded by us quietly and with an heart entirely free from
all bustling thoughts, so should they be received into your minds; for just as the inquiry
ought to be undertaken for the sake of our common purity, so they cannot be learnt or acquired
by one who is without the gift of uprightness. For we do not ask what arguments of
empty words, but what the inward faith of the conscience and the greater force of truth can
persuade. And therefore with regard to the knowledge and teaching of this purification
nothing can be brought forward except by one who has had experience of it, nor can anything
be committed except to one who is a most eager and very earnest lover of the truth itself,
who does not hope to attain it by asking questions with mere vain words, but by striving
with all his might and main, with no wish for useless chattering but with the desire to purify
himself internally.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>Discourse of Abbot Theonas on the Apostle’s words: “For I do not the good which I would.”</head>
<p>At the return of light therefore, as the old man was forced by our intense urgency to
investigate the depths of the Apostle’s subject, he spoke as follows: As for the passages by
which you try to prove that the Apostle Paul spoke not in his own person but in that of
sinners: “For I do not the good that I would, but the evil which I hate, that I do;” or this:
“But if I do that which I would not, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me;”
or what follows: “For I delight in the law of God after the inner man, but I see another law
in my members opposing the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of
sin which is in my members;”160 these passages on the contrary plainly show that they
cannot possibly fit the person of sinners, but that what is said can only apply to those that
are perfect, and that it only suits the chastity of those who follow the good example of the
Apostles. Else how could these words apply to the person of sinners: “For I do not the good
which I would, but the evil which I hate that I do”? or even this: “But if I do what I would
not it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me”? For what sinner defiles himself
unwillingly by adulteries and fornication? Who against his will prepares plots against his
neighbour? Who is driven by unavoidable necessity to oppress a man by false witness or
cheat him by theft, or covet the goods of another or shed his blood? Nay rather, as Scripture
says, “Mankind is diligently inclined to wickedness from his youth.”161 For to such an extent
are all inflamed by the love of sin and desire to carry out what they like, that they actually
look out with watchful care for an opportunity of committing wickedness and are afraid of
being too slow to enjoy their lusts, and glory in their shame and the mass of their crimes,
as the Apostle says in censure,162 and seek credit for themselves out of their own confusion,
of whom also the prophet Jeremiah maintains that they commit their flagitious crimes not
only not unwillingly nor with ease of heart and body, but with laborious efforts to such an
extent that they come to toil to carry them out, so that they are prevented even by the
hindrance of arduous difficulty from their deadly quest of sin; as he says: “They have laboured
to do wickedly.”163 Who also will say that this applies to sinners: “And so with the mind I
myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin,” as it is plain that they serve
God neither with the mind nor the flesh? Or how can those who sin with the body serve

God with the mind, when the flesh receives the incitement to sin from the heart, and the
Creator of either nature Himself declares that the fount and spring of sin flows from the
latter, saying: “From the heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
witness, etc.”164 Wherefore it is clearly shown that this cannot in any way be taken of the
person of sinners, who not only do not hate, but actually love what is evil and are so far
from serving God with either the mind or the flesh that they sin with the mind before they
do with the flesh, and before they carry out the pleasures of the body are overcome by sin
in their mind and thoughts.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>How the Apostle completed many good actions.</head>
<p>It remains therefore for us to measure its meaning and drift from the inmost feelings
of the speaker, and to discuss what the blessed Apostle called good, and what he pronounced
by comparison evil, not by the bare meaning of the words, but with the same insight which
he showed, and to investigate his meaning with due regard to the worth and goodness of
the speaker. For then we shall be able to understand the words, which were uttered by God’s
inspiration, in accordance with his purpose and wish, when we weigh the position and
character of those by whom they were spoken, and are ourselves clothed with the same
feelings (not in words but by experience), in accordance with the character of which most
certainly all the thoughts are conceived and opinions uttered. Wherefore let us carefully
consider what was in the main that good which the Apostle could not do when he would.
For we know that there are many good things which we cannot deny that the blessed Apostle
and all men as good as he either have by nature, or acquire by grace. For chastity is good,
continence is praiseworthy, prudence is to be admired, kindness is liberal, sobriety is careful,
temperance is modest, pity is kind, justice is holy: all of which we cannot doubt existed fully
and in perfection in the Apostle Paul and his companions, so that they taught religion by
the lesson of their virtues rather than their words. What if they were always consumed with
the constant care of all the churches and watchful anxiety? How great a good is this pity,
what perfection it is to burn for them that are offended, to be weak with the weak!165 If then
the Apostle abounded with such good things, we cannot recognize what that good was, in
the perfection of which the Apostle was lacking, unless we have advanced to that state of
mind in which he was speaking. And so all those virtues which we say that he possessed,
though they are like most splendid and precious gems, yet when they are compared with
that most beautiful and unique pearl which the merchant in the gospel sought and wanted
to acquire by selling all that he possessed, so does their value seem poor and trifling, so that
if they are without hesitation got rid of, the possession of one good thing alone will enrich
the man who sells countless good things.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>What is really the good which the Apostle testifies that he could not perform.</head>
<p>What then is that one thing which is so incomparably above those great and innumerable
good things, that, while they are all scorned and rejected, it alone should be acquired?
Doubtless it is that truly good part, the grand and lasting character of which is thus described
by the Lord, when Mary disregarded the duties of hospitality and courtesy and chose it:
“Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but there is but need of
but few things or even of one only. Mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken
away from her.”166 Contemplation then, i.e., meditation on God, is the one thing, the value
of which all the merits of our righteous acts, all our aims at virtue, come short of. And all
those things which we said existed in the Apostle Paul, were not only good and useful, but
even great and splendid. But as, for example, the metal of alloy which is considered of some
use and worth, becomes worthless when silver is taken into account, and again the value of
silver disappears in comparison with gold, and gold itself is disregarded when compared
with precious stones, and yet a quantity of precious stones however splendid are outdone
by the brightness of a single pearl, so all those merits of holiness, although they are not
merely good and useful for the present life, but also secure the gift of eternity, yet if they are
compared with the merit of Divine contemplation, will be considered trifling and so to
speak, fit to be sold. And to support this illustration by the authority of Scripture, does not
Scripture declare of all things in general which were created by God, and say: “And behold
everything that God had made was very good;” and again: “And things that God hath made
are all good in their season”?167 These things then which in the present time are termed not
simply and solely good, but emphatically “very good” (for they are really convenient for us
while living in this world, either for purposes of life, or for remedies for the body, or by
reason of some unknown usefulness, or else they are indeed “very good,” because they enable
us “to see the invisible things of God from the creatures of the world, being understood by
the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead,”168 from this great and orderly
arrangement of the fabric of the world; and to contemplate them from the existence
of everything in it), yet none of these things will keep the name of good if they are regarded
in the light of that world to come, where no variation of good things, and no loss of true
blessedness need be feared. The bliss of which world is thus described: “The light of the
moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light
of seven days.”169 These things then which are great and wondrous to be gazed on, and

marvellous, will at once appear as vanity if they are compared with the future promises from
faith; as David says: “They all shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou change
them, and they shall be changed. But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.”170
Because then there is nothing of itself enduring, nothing unchangeable, nothing good but
Deity alone, while every creature, to obtain the blessing of eternity and immutability, aims
at this not by its own nature but by participation of its Creator, and His grace, they cannot
maintain their character for goodness when compared with their Creator.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How man’s goodness and righteousness are not good if compared with the goodness and
righteousness of God.</head>
<p>But if we want also to establish the force of this opinion by still clearer proofs, is it not
the case that while we read of many things as called good in the gospel, as a good tree, and
good treasure, and a good man, and a good servant, for He says: “A good tree cannot bring
forth evil fruit;” and: “a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good
things;” and: “Well done, good and faithful servant;”171 and certainly there can be no doubt
that none of these are good in themselves, yet if we take into consideration the goodness of
God, none of them will be called good, as the Lord says: “None is good save God alone”?172
In whose sight even the apostles themselves, who in the excellence of their calling in many
ways went beyond the goodness of mankind, are said to be evil, as the Lord thus speaks to
them: “If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.”173 Finally as
our goodness turns to badness in the eyes of the Highest so also our righteousness when set
against the Divine righteousness is considered like a menstruous cloth, as Isaiah the
prophet says: “All your righteousness is like a menstruous cloth.”174 And to produce
something still plainer, even the vital precepts of the law itself, which are said to have been
“given by angels by the hand of a mediator,” and of which the same Apostle says: “So the
law indeed is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good,”175 when they are
compared with the perfection of the gospel are pronounced anything but good by the Divine
oracle: for He says: “And I gave them precepts that were not good, and ordinances whereby
they should not live in them.”176 The Apostle also affirms that the glory of the law is so
dimmed by the light of the New Testament that he declares that in comparison with the
splendour of the gospel it is not to be considered glorious, saying: “For even that which was
glorious was not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.”177 And Scripture keeps up
this comparison on the other side also, i.e., in weighing the merits of sinners, so that in
comparison with the wicked it justifies those who have sinned less, saying: “Sodom is justified
above thee;” and again: “For what hath thy sister Sodom sinned?” and: “The rebellious Israel

hath justified her soul in comparison of the treacherous Judah.”178 So then the merits of all
the virtues, which I enumerated above, though in themselves they are good and precious,
yet become dim in comparison of the brightness of contemplation. For they greatly hinder
and retard the saints who are taken up with earthly aims even at good works, from the
contemplation of that sublime good.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How no one can be continually intent upon that highest good.</head>
<p>For who, when “delivering the poor from the hand of them that are too strong for him,
and the needy and the poor from them that strip him,” who when “breaking the jaws of the
wicked and snatching their prey from between their teeth,”179 can with a calm mind regard
the glory of the Divine Majesty during the actual work of intervention? Who when ministering
support to the poor, or when receiving with benevolent kindness the crowds that
come to him, can at the very moment when he is with anxious mind perplexed for the wants
of his brethren, contemplate the vastness of the bliss on high, and while he is shaken by the
troubles and cares of the present life look forward to the state of the world to come with an
heart raised above the stains of earth? Whence the blessed David when laying down that
this alone is good for man, longs to cling constantly to God, and says: “It is good for me to
cling to God, and to put my hope in the Lord.”180 And Ecclesiastes also declares that this
cannot be done without fault by any of the saints, and says: “For there is not a righteous
man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.”181 For who, even if he be the chief of
all righteous and holy men, can we ever think could, while bound in the chains of this life,
so acquire this chief good, as never to cease from divine contemplation, or be thought to be
drawn away by earthly thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is good? Who
ever takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things, or when anxious about
receiving the brethren, or change of place, or building his cell, has never desired the aid of
man’s assistance, nor when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of reproof
from the Lord: “Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat, nor for your body what
ye shall put on”?182 Further we confidently assert that even the Apostle Paul himself who
surpassed in the number of his sufferings the toils of all the saints, could not possibly fulfil
this, as he himself testifies to the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles: “Ye yourselves know
that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me,”
or when in writing in the Thessalonians he testifies that he “worked in labour and weariness
night and day.”183 And although for this there were great rewards for his merits prepared,
yet his mind, however holy and sublime it might be, could not help being sometimes drawn
away from that heavenly contemplation by its attention to earthly labours. Further, when
he saw himself enriched with such practical fruits, and on the other hand considered in his

heart the good of meditation, and weighed as it were in one scale the profit of all these labours
and in the other the delights of divine contemplation, when for a long time he had corrected
the balance in his breast, while the vast rewards for his labours delighted him on one side,
and on the other the desire for unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ inclined
him to depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out and says: “What I shall
choose I know not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with
Christ, for it were much better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes.”184
Though then in many ways he preferred this excellent good to all the fruits of his preaching,
yet he submits himself in consideration of love, without which none can gain the Lord; and
for their sakes, whom hitherto he had soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts
of the gospel, does not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for himself though
useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the rather by that excessive goodness of his
whereby for the salvation of his brethren he is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last
evil of an Anathema. “For I could wish,” he says, “that I myself were Anathema from Christ
for my brethren’s sake, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites,”185
i.e., I could wish to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual punishment, if
only all men, were it possible, might enjoy the fellowship of Christ: for I am sure that the
salvation of all would be better for Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle
might perfectly gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of God and to be joined continually
to Christ, he was ready to be parted from this body, which as it is feeble and hindered
by the many requirements of its frailties cannot help separating from union with Christ: for
it is impossible for the mind, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and hampered by such
various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the Divine vision. For what aim of the saints
can be so persistent, what purpose can be so high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes
destroy it? Who has frequented the recesses of the desert and shunned intercourse with all
men in such a way that he never trips by unnecessary thoughts, and by looking on things
or being occupied in earthly actions falls away from that contemplation of God, which truly
alone is good? Who ever could preserve such fervour of spirit as not sometimes to pass by
roving thoughts from his attention to prayer, and fall away suddenly from heavenly to earthly
things? Which of us (to pass over other times of wandering) even at the very moment when
he raises his soul in prayer to God on high, does not fall into a sort of stupor, and even
against his will offend by that very thing from which he hoped for pardon of his sins? Who,
I ask, is so alert and vigilant as never, while he is singing a Psalm to God, to allow his mind
to wander from the meaning of Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely joined to
God, as to congratulate himself on having carried out for a single day that rule of the

Apostle’s, whereby he bids us pray without ceasing?186 And though all these things may
seem to some, who are involved in grosser sins, to be trivial and altogether foreign to sin,
yet to those who know the value of perfection a quantity even of very small matters becomes
most serious.</p>

<head>How those who think that they are without sin are like purblind people.</head>
<p>As if we were to suppose that two men, one of whom was clear sighted with perfect
vision, and the other, one whose eyesight was obscured by dimness of vision, had together
entered some great house that was filled with a quantity of bundles, instruments, and vessels,
would not he, whose dullness of vision prevented his seeing everything, assert that there
was nothing there but chests, beds, benches, tables, and whatever met the fingers of one
who felt them rather than the eyes of one who saw them, while on the other hand would
not the other, who searched out what was hidden with clear and bright eyes, declare that
there were there many most minute articles, and what could scarcely be counted; which if
they were ever gathered up into a single pile, would by their number equal or perhaps exceed
the size of those few things which the other had felt. So then even saints, and, if we may so
say, men who see, whose aim is the utmost perfection, cleverly detect in themselves even
those things which the gaze of our mind being as it were darkened cannot see, and condemn
them very severely, to such an extent that those who have not, as it seems to our carelessness,
dimmed the whiteness of their body, which is as it were like snow, with even the slightest
spot of sin, seem to themselves to be covered with many stains, if, I will not say any evil or
vain thoughts creep into the doors of their mind, but even the recollection of a Psalm which
has to be said takes off the attention of the kneeler at the time for prayer. For if, say they,
when we ask some great man, I will not say for our life and salvation, but for some advantage
and profit, we fasten all our attention of mind and body upon him, and hang with trembling
expectation on his nod, with no slight dread lest haply some foolish or unsuitable word may
turn aside the pity of our hearer, and then too, when we are standing in the forum or in the
courts of earthly judges, with our opponent standing over against us, if in the midst of the
prosecution and trial any coughing, or spitting, or laughing, or yawning, or sleep overtakes
us, with what malice will our ever watchful opponent stir up the severity of the judge to our
damage: how much more, when we entreat Him who knows all secrets, should we, by reason
of our imminent danger of everlasting death, plead with earnest and anxious prayer for the
kindness of the judge, especially as on the other side there stands one who is both our crafty
seducer and our accuser! And not without reason will he be bound by no light sin, but by
a grievous fault of wickedness, who, when he pours forth his prayer to God, departs at once
from His sight as if from the eyes of one who neither sees nor hears, and follows the vanity
of wicked thoughts. But they who cover the eyes of their heart with a thick veil of their sins,
and as the Saviour says, “Seeing see not and hearing hear not nor understand,”187 hardly
regard in the inmost recesses of their breast even those faults which are great and deadly,

and cannot with clear eyes look at any deceitful thoughts, nor even those vague and secret
desires which strike the mind with slight and subtle suggestions, nor the captivities of their
soul, but always wandering among impure thoughts they know not how to be sorry when
they are distracted from that meditation which is so special, nor can they grieve that they
have lost anything as while they lay open their mind to the entrance of any thought as they
please, they have nothing set before them to hold to as the main thing or to desire in every
way.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How those who maintain that a man can be without sin are charged with a twofold error.</head>
<p>The reason however which drives us into this error is that, as we are utterly ignorant of
the virtue of being without sin,188 we fancy that we cannot contract any guilt from those
idle and random vagaries of our thoughts, but being rendered stupid by dullness and as it
were smitten with blindness we can see nothing in ourselves but capital offences, and think
that we have only to keep clear of those things which are condemned also by the severity of
secular laws, and if we find that even for a short time we are free from these we at once
imagine that there is no sin at all in us. Accordingly we are distinguished from the number
of those who see, because we do not see the many small stains, which are crowded together
in us, and are not smitten with saving contrition, if the malady of vexation overtakes our
thoughts, nor are we sorry that we are struck by the suggestions of vainglory, nor do we
weep over our prayers offered up so tardily and coldly, nor consider it a fault if while we
are singing or praying, something else besides the actual prayer or Psalm fills our thoughts,
nor are we horrified because we do not blush to conceive many things which we are ashamed
to speak or do before men, in our heart, which, as we know, lies open to the Divine gaze;
nor do we purge away the pollution of filthy dreams with copious ablutions of our tears,
nor grieve that in the pious act of almsgiving when we are assisting the needs of the brethren,
or ministering support to the poor, the brightness of our cheerfulness is clouded over by a
stingy delay, nor do we think that we are affected by any loss when we forget God and think
about things that are temporal and corrupt, so that these words of Solomon fairly apply to
us: “They smite me but I have not grieved, and they have mocked me, but I knew it not.”189</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How it is given to but few to understand what sin is.</head>
<p>Those on the other hand who make the sum of all their joy and delight and bliss consist
in the contemplation of divine and spiritual things alone, if they are unwillingly withdrawn
from them even for a short time by thoughts that force themselves upon them, punish this
as if it were a kind of sacrilege in them, and avenge it by immediate chastisement, and in
their grief that they have preferred some worthless creature (to which their mental gaze was
turned aside) to their Creator, charge themselves with the guilt (I had almost said) of impiety,
and although they turn the eyes of their heart with the utmost speed to behold the brightness
of the Divine Glory, yet they cannot tolerate even for a very short time the darkness of carnal
thoughts, and execrate whatever keeps back their soul’s gaze from the true light. Finally
when the blessed Apostle John would instill this feeling into everybody he says: “Little children,
love not the world, neither the things which are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of God is not in him: for everything that is in the world is the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but of the world. And
the world perisheth and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.”190
The saints therefore scorn all those things on which the world exists, but it is impossible for
them never to be carried away to them by a brief aberration of thoughts, and even now no
man, except our Lord and Saviour, can keep his naturally wandering mind always fixed on
the contemplation of God so as never to be carried away from it through the love of something
in this world; as Scripture says: “Even the stars are not clean in His sight,” and again:
“If He puts no trust in His saints, and findeth iniquity in His angels,” or as the more correct
translation has it: “Behold among His saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not
pure in His sight.”191</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Of the care with which a monk should preserve the recollection of God.</head>
<p>I should say then that the saints who keep a firm hold of the recollection of God and
are borne along, as it were, with their steps suspended on a line stretched out on high, may
be rightly compared to rope dancers, commonly called funambuli, who risk all their safety
and life on the path of that very narrow rope, with no doubt that they will immediately meet
with a most dreadful death if their foot swerves or trips in the very slightest degree, or goes
over the line of the course in which alone is safety. And while with marvellous skill they ply
their airy steps through space, if they keep not their steps to that all too narrow path with
careful and anxious regulation, the earth which is the natural base and the most solid and
safest foundation for all, becomes to them an immediate and clear danger, not because its
nature is changed, but because they fall headlong upon it by the weight of their bodies. So
also that unwearied goodness of God and His unchanging nature192 hurts no one indeed,
but we ourselves by falling from on high and tending to the depths are the authors of our
own death, or rather the very fall becomes death to the faller. For it says: “Woe to them for
they have departed from Me: they shall be wasted because they have transgressed against
Me;” and again: “Woe to them when I shall depart from them.” For “thine own wickedness
shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is an evil
and a bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord thy God;” for “every man is bound by the
cords of his sins.”193 To whom this rebuke is aptly directed by the Lord: “Behold,” He says,
“all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk ye in the light of your fire and in
the flames which you have kindled;” and again: “He that kindleth iniquity, shall perish by
it.”194</p>

<head>How those who are on the way to perfection are truly humble, and feel that they always stand
in need of God’s grace.</head>
<p>When then holy men feel that they are oppressed by the weight of earthly thoughts and
fall away from their loftiness of mind, and that they are led away against their will or rather
without knowing it, into the law of sin and death, and (to pass over other matters) are kept
back by those actions which I described above, which are good and right though earthly,
from the vision of God; they have something to groan over constantly to the Lord; they have
something for which indeed to humble themselves, and in their contrition to profess
themselves not in words only but in heart, sinners; and for this, while they continually ask
of the Lord’s grace pardon for everything that day by day they commit when overcome by
the weakness of the flesh, they should shed without ceasing true tears of penitence; as they
see that being involved even to the very end of their life in the very same troubles, with
continual sorrow for which they are tried, they cannot even offer their prayers without
harassing thoughts. So then as they know by experience that through the hindrance of the
burden of the flesh they cannot by human strength reach the desired end, nor be united
according to their heart’s desire with that chief and highest good, but that they are led away
from the vision of it captive to worldly things, they betake themselves to the grace of God,
“Who justifieth the ungodly,”195 and cry out with the Apostle: O wretched man that I am!
Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.”196 For they feel that they cannot perform the good that they would, but are ever
falling into the evil which they would not, and which they hate, i.e., wandering thoughts
and care for carnal things.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>Explanation of the phrase: “For I delight in the law of God after the inner man,” etc.</head>
<p>And they “delight” indeed “in the law of God after the inner man,” which soars above
all visible things and ever strives to be united to God alone, but they “see another law in
their members,” i.e., implanted in their natural human condition, which “resisting the law
of their mind,”197 brings their thoughts into captivity to the forcible law of sin, compelling
them to forsake that chief good and submit to earthly notions, which though they may appear
necessary and useful when they are taken up in the interests of some religious want, yet
when they are set against that good which fascinates the gaze of all the saints, are seen by
them to be bad and such as should be avoided, because by them in some way or other and
for a short time they are drawn away from the joy of that perfect bliss. For the law of sin is
really what the fall of its first father brought on mankind by that fault of his, against which
there was uttered this sentence by the most just Judge: “Cursed is the ground in thy works;
thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
bread.”198 This, I say, is the law, implanted in the members of all mortals, which resists the
law of our mind and keeps it back from the vision of God, and which, as the earth is cursed
in our works after the knowledge of good and evil, begins to produce the thorns and thistles
of thoughts, by the sharp pricks of which the natural seeds of virtues are choked, so that
without the sweat of our brow we cannot eat our bread which “cometh down from heaven,”
and which “strengtheneth man’s heart.”199 The whole human race in general therefore is
without exception subject to this law. For there is no one, however saintly, who does not
take the bread mentioned above with the sweat of his brow and anxious efforts of his heart.
But many rich men, as we see, are fed on that common bread without any sweat of their
brow.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>Of this also: “But we know that the law is spiritual,” etc.</head>
<p>And this law the Apostle also calls spiritual saying: “But we know that the law is spiritual,
but I am carnal, sold under sin.”200 For this law is spiritual which bids us eat in the sweat
of our brow that “true bread which cometh down from heaven”201 but that sale under sin
makes us carnal. What, I ask, or whose is that sin? Doubtless Adam’s, by whose fall and, if
I may so say, ruinous transaction and fraudulent bargain we were sold. For when he was
led astray by the persuasion of the serpent he brought all his descendants under the yoke of
perpetual bondage, as they were alienated by taking the forbidden food. For this custom is
generally observed between the buyer and seller, that one who wants to make himself over
to the power of another, receives from his buyer a price for the loss of his liberty, and his
consignment to perpetual slavery. And we can very plainly see that this took place between
Adam and the serpent. For by eating of the forbidden tree he received from the serpent the
price of his liberty, and gave up his natural freedom and chose to give himself up to perpetual
slavery to him from whom he had obtained the deadly price of the forbidden fruit; and
thenceforth he was bound by this condition and not without reason subjected all the offspring
of his posterity to perpetual service to him whose slave he had become. For what can any
marriage in slavery produce but slaves? What then? Did that cunning and crafty buyer take
away the rights of ownership from the true and lawful lord? Not so. For neither did he
overcome all God’s property by the craft of a single act of deception so that the true lord
lost his rights of ownership, who though the buyer himself was a rebel and a renegade, yet
oppressed him with the yoke of slavery; but because the Creator had endowed all reasonable
creatures with free will, he would not restore to their natural liberty against their will those
who contrary to right had sold themselves by the sin of greedy lust. Since anything that is
contrary to goodness and fairness is abhorrent to Him who is the Author of justice and
piety. For it would have been wrong for Him to have recalled the blessing of freedom granted,
unfair for Him to have by His power oppressed man who was free, and by taking him captive,
not to have allowed him to exercise the prerogative of the freedom he had received, as He
was reserving his salvation for future ages, that in due season the fulness of the appointed
time might be fulfilled. For it was right that his offspring should remain under the ancient
conditions for so long a time, until by the price of His own blood the grace of the Lord redeemed
them from their original chains and set them free in the primeval state of liberty,
though He was able even then to save them, but would not, because equity forbade Him to
break the terms of His own decree. Would you know the reason for your being sold? Hear

thy Redeemer Himself proclaiming openly by Isaiah the prophet: “What is this bill of the
divorce of your mother with which I have put her away? Or who is My creditor to whom I
sold you? Behold you are sold for your iniquities and for your wicked deeds have I put your
mother away.” Would you also plainly see why when you were consigned to the yoke of
slavery He would not redeem you by the might of His own power? Hear what He added to
the former passage, and how He charges the same servants of sin with the reason for their
voluntary sale. “Is My hand shortened and become little that I cannot redeem, or is there
no strength in Me to deliver?”202 But what it is which is always standing in the way of His
most powerful pity the same prophet shows when he says: “Behold the hand of the Lord is
not shortened that it cannot save, neither is His ear heavy that it cannot hear: But your
iniquities have divided between you and your God and your sins have hid His face from
you that He should not hear.”203</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Of this also: “But I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.”</head>
<p>Because then the original curse of God has made us carnal and condemned us to thorns
and thistles, and our father has sold us by that unhappy bargain so that we cannot do the
good that we would, while we are torn away from the recollection of God Most High and
forced to think on what belongs to human weakness, while burning with the love of purity,
we are often even against our will troubled by natural desires, which we would rather know
nothing about; we know that in our flesh there dwelleth no good thing204 viz., the perpetual
and lasting peace of this meditation of which we have spoken; but there is brought about
in our case that miserable and wretched divorce, that when with the mind we want to serve
the law of God, since we never want to remove our gaze from the Divine brightness, yet
surrounded as we are by carnal darkness we are forced by a kind of law of sin to tear ourselves
away from the good which we know, as we fall away from that lofty height of mind to earthly
cares and thoughts, to which the law of sin, i.e., the sentence of God, which the first delinquent
received, has not without reason condemned us. And hence it is that the blessed
Apostle, though he openly admits that he and all saints are bound by the constraint of this
sin, yet boldly asserts that none of them will be condemned for this, saying: “There is
therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: for the law of the spirit of
life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and death,”205 i.e., the grace of Christ
day by day frees all his saints from this law of sin and death, under which they are constantly
reluctantly obliged to come, whenever they pray to the Lord for the forgiveness of their
trespasses. You see then that it was in the person not of sinners but of those who are really
saints and perfect, that the blessed Apostle gave utterance to this saying: “For I do not the
good that I would, but the evil which I hate, that I do;” and: “I see another law in my members
resisting the law of my mind and bringing me captive to the law of sin which is in my
members.”206</p>

<head>An objection, that the saying: “For I do not the good that I would,” etc., applies to the persons
neither of unbelievers nor of saints.</head>
<p>Germanus: We say that this does not apply to the persons either of those who are involved
in capital offences, or of an Apostle and those who have advanced to his measure, but we
think that it ought properly to be taken of those who after receiving the grace of God and
the knowledge of the truth, are anxious to keep themselves from carnal sins but, as ancient
custom like a natural law rules most forcibly in their members, they are carried away to the
ingrained lust of their passions. For the custom and frequency of sinning becomes like a
natural law, which, implanted in the man’s weak members, leads the feelings of the soul
that is not yet instructed in all the pursuits of virtue, but is still, if I may say so, of an uninstructed
and tender chastity, captive to sin and subjecting them by an ancient law to death,
brings them under the yoke of sin that rules over them, not suffering them to obtain the
good of purity which they love, but rather forcing them to do the evil which they hate.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<pb n="1353"/>
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>The answer to the objection raised.</head>
<p>Theonas: Your notion does not come to much; as you yourselves have actually now
begun to maintain that this cannot possibly stand in the person of those who are out and
out sinners, but that it properly applies to those who are trying to keep themselves clear
from carnal sins. And since you have already separated these from the number of sinners,
it follows that you must shortly admit them into the ranks of the faithful and holy. For what
kinds of sin do you say that those can commit, from which, if they are involved in them
after the grace of baptism, they can be freed by the daily grace of Christ? or of what body of
death are we to think that the Apostle said: “Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord”?207 Is it not clear, as truth compels
you yourselves also to admit, that it is spoken not of those members of capital crimes, by
which the wages of eternal death are gained; viz., murder, fornication, adultery, drunkenness,
thefts and robberies, but of that body before mentioned, which the daily grace of Christ assists?
For whoever after baptism and the knowledge of God falls into that death, must know
that he will either have to be cleansed, not by the daily grace of Christ, i.e., an easy forgiveness,
which our Lord when at any moment He is prayed to, is wont to grant to our errors, but by
a lifelong affliction of penitence and penal sorrow, or else will be hereafter consigned to the
punishment of eternal fire for them, as the same Apostle thus declares: “Be not deceived:
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor defilers of themselves
with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners
shall possess the kingdom of God.”208 Or what is that law warring in our members which
resists the law of our mind, and when it has led us resisting but captives to the law of sin
and death, and has made us serve it with the flesh, nevertheless suffers us to serve the law
of God with the mind? For I do not suppose that this law of sin denotes crimes or can be
taken of the offences mentioned above, of which if a man is guilty he does not serve the law
of God with the mind, from which law he must first have departed in heart before he is
guilty of any of them with the flesh. For what is it to serve the law of sin, but to do what is
commanded by sin? What sort of sin then is it to which so great holiness and perfection
feels that it is captive, and yet doubts not that it will be freed from it by the grace of Christ,
saying: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord”? What law, I ask, will you maintain to be
implanted in our members, which, withdrawing us from the law of God and bringing us
into captivity to the law of sin, could make us wretched rather than guilty so that we should
<note type="footnote">207 Rom. vii. 24, 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">208 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="1354"/>
not be consigned to eternal punishment, but still as it were sigh for the unbroken joys of
bliss, and, seeking for a helper who shall restore us to it, exclaim with the Apostle: “O
wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” For what is it
to be led captive to the law of sin but to continue to perform and commit sin? Or what
other chief good can be given which the saints cannot fulfil, except that in comparison with
which, as we said above, everything else is not good? Indeed we know that many things in
this world are good, and chiefly, modesty, continence, sobriety, humility, justice, mercy,
temperance, piety: but all of these things fail to come up to that chief good, and can be done
I say not by apostles, but even by ordinary folk; and, those by whom they are not done, are
either chastised with eternal punishment, or are set free by great exertions, as was said above,
of penitence, and not by the daily grace of Christ. It remains then for us to admit that this
saying of the Apostle is rightly applied only to the persons of saints, who day after day falling
under this law, which we described, of sin not of crimes, are secure of their salvation and
not precipitated into wicked deeds, but, as has often been said, are drawn away from the
contemplation of God to the misery of bodily thoughts, and are often deprived of the
blessing of that true bliss. For if they felt that by this law of their members they were bound
daily to crimes, they would complain of the loss not of happiness but of innocence, and the
Apostle Paul would not say: “O wretched man that I am,” but “Impure,” or “Wicked man
that I am,” and he would wish to be rid not of the body of this death, i.e., this mortal state,
but of the crimes and misdeeds of this flesh. But because by reason of his state of human
frailty he felt that he was captive, i.e., led away to carnal cares and anxieties which the law
of sin and death causes, he groans over this law of sin under which against his will he had
fallen, and at once has recourse to Christ and is saved by the present redemption of His
grace. Whatever of anxiety therefore that law of sin, which naturally produces the thorns
and thistles of mortal thoughts and cares, has caused to spring up in the ground of the
Apostle’s breast, that the law of grace at once plucks up. “For the law,” says he, “of the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and death.”209</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>What is the body of sin.</head>
<p>This then is that body of death from which we cannot escape, pent in which those who
are perfect, who have tasted “how gracious the Lord is,”210 daily feel with the prophet “how
bad for himself and bitter it is for a man to depart from the Lord his God.”211 This is the
body of death which restrains us from the heavenly vision and drags us back to earthly
things, which causes men while singing Psalms and kneeling in prayer to have their thoughts
filled with human figures, or conversations, or business, or unnecessary actions. This is the
body of death, owing to which those, who would emulate the sanctity of angels, and who
long to cling continually to God, yet are unable to arrive at the perfection of this good, because
the body of death stands in their way, but they do the evil that they would not, i.e., they are
dragged down in their minds even to the things which have nothing to do with their advance
and perfection in virtue. Finally that the blessed Apostle might clearly denote that he said
this of saintly and perfect men, and those like himself, he in a way points with his finger to
himself and at once proceeds: “And so I myself,” i.e., I who say this, lay bare the secrets of
my own not another’s conscience. This mode of speech at any rate the Apostle is familiarly
accustomed to use, whenever he wants to point specially to himself, as here: “I, Paul, myself
beseech you by the mildness and modesty of Christ;” and again: “except that I myself was
not burdensome to you;” and once more: “But be it so: I myself did not burden you;” and
elsewhere: “I, Paul, myself say unto you: if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing;”
and to the Romans: “For I could wish that I myself were Anathema from Christ for my
brethren.”212 But it cannot unreasonably be taken in this way, that “And so I myself” is expressly
said with emphasis, i.e., I whom you know to be an Apostle of Christ, whom you
venerate with the utmost respect, whom you believe to be of the highest character and perfect,
and one in whom Christ speaks, though with the mind I serve the law of God, yet with the
flesh I confess that I serve the law of sin, i.e., by the occupations of my human condition
am sometimes dragged down from heavenly to earthly things and the height of my mind is
brought down to the level of care for humble matters. And by this law of sin I find that at
every moment I am so taken captive that although I persist in my immovable longing around
the law of God, yet in no way can I escape the power of this captivity, unless I always fly to
the grace of the Saviour.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>How all the saints have confessed with truth that they were unclean and sinful.</head>
<p>And therefore with daily sighs all the saints grieve over this weakness of their nature
and while they search into their shifting thoughts and the secrets and inmost recesses of
their conscience, cry out in entreaty: “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy
sight shall no man living be justified;” and this: “Who will boast that he hath a chaste heart?
or who will have confidence that he is pure from sin?” and again: “There is not a righteous
man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not;” and this also: “Who knoweth his
faults?”213 And so they have recognized that man’s righteousness is weak and imperfect and
always needs God’s mercy, so that one of those whose iniquities and sins God purged away
with the live coal of His word sent from the altar, after that marvellous vision of God, after
his view of the Seraphim on high and the revelation of heavenly mysteries, said: “Woe is
me! for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.”214
And I fancy that perhaps even then he would not have felt the uncleanness of his lips, unless
it had been given him to recognize the true and complete purity of perfection by the vision
of God, at the sight of Whom he suddenly became aware of his own uncleanness, of which
he had previously been ignorant. For when he says: “Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean
lips,” he shows that his confession that follows refers to his own lips, and not to the uncleanness
of the people: “and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.” But even when in
his prayer he confesses the uncleanness of all sinners, he embraces in his general supplication
not only the mass of the wicked but also of the good, saying: “Behold Thou art angry, and
we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved. We are all become as
one unclean, and all our righteousnesses as filthy rags.”215 What, I ask, could be clearer than
this saying, in which the prophet includes not one only but all our righteousnesses and,
looking round on all things that are considered unclean and disgusting, because he could
find nothing in the life of men fouler or more unclean, chose to compare them to filthy rags.
In vain then is the sharpness of a nagging objection raised against this perfectly clear truth,
as a little while back you said: “If no one is without sin, then no one is holy; and if no one
is holy, then no one will be saved.”216 For the puzzle of this question can be solved by the
prophet’s testimony. “Behold,” he says, “Thou art angry and we have sinned,” i.e., when
Thou didst reject our pride of heart or our carelessness, and deprive us of Thine aid, at once
the abyss of our sins swallowed us up, as if one should say to the bright substance of the

sun: Behold thou hast set, and at once murky darkness covered us. And yet though he here
says that the saints have sinned, and have not only sinned but also have always remained
in their sins, he does not altogether despair of salvation but adds: “In them we have been
always, and we shall be saved.” This saying: “Behold Thou art angry and we have sinned,”
I will compare to that one of the Apostle’s: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver
me from the body of this death?” Again this that the prophet subjoins: “In them we have
been always, and we shall be saved,” corresponds to the following words of the Apostle:
“Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” In the same way also this passage of the
same prophet: “Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a
people of unclean lips,” seems to agree with the words quoted above: “O wretched man that
I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” And what follows in the prophet.
“And behold there flew to me one of the Seraphim, having in his hand a coal (or stone)
which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he touched my mouth and said:
Lo, with this I have touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
purged,”217 is just what seems to have fallen from the mouth of Paul, who says: “Thanks be
to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” You see then how all the saints with truth confess
not so much in the person of the people as in their own that they are sinners, and yet by no
means despair of their salvation, but look for full justification (which they do not hope that
they cannot obtain by virtue of the state of human frailty) from the grace and mercy of the
Lord.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<head>That even good and holy men are not without sin.</head>
<p>But that no one however holy is in this life free from trespasses and sin, we are told also
by the teaching of the Saviour, who gave His disciples the form of the perfect prayer and
among those other sublime and sacred commands, which as they were only given to the
saints and perfect cannot apply to the wicked and unbelievers, He bade this to be inserted:
“And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.”218 If then this is offered as a true
prayer and by saints, as we ought without the shadow of a doubt to believe, who can be
found so obstinate and impudent, so puffed up with the pride of the devil’s own rage, as to
maintain that he is without sin, and not only to think himself greater than apostles, but also
to charge the Saviour Himself with ignorance or folly, as if He either did not know that some
men could be free from debts, or was idly teaching those whom He knew to stand in no
need of the remedy of that prayer? But since all the saints who altogether keep the commands
of their King, say every day “Forgive us our debts,” if they speak the truth there is indeed
no one free from sin, but if they speak falsely, it is equally true that they are not free from
the sin of falsehood. Wherefore also that most wise Ecclesiastes reviewing in his mind all
the actions and purposes of men declares without any exception: “that there is not a righteous
man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not,”219 i.e., no one ever could or ever will
be found on this earth so holy, so diligent, so earnest as to be able continually to cling to
that true and unique good, and not day after day to feel that he is drawn aside from it and
fails. But still though he maintains that he cannot be free from wrong doing, yet none the
less we must not deny that he is righteous.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>How even in the hour of prayer it is almost impossible to avoid sin.</head>
<p>Whoever then ascribes sinlessness to human nature must fight against no idle words
but the witness and proof of his conscience which is on our side, and then only should
maintain that he is without sin, when he finds that he is not torn away from this highest
good: nay rather, whoever considering his own conscience, to say no more, finds that he
has celebrated even one single service without the distraction of a single word or deed or
thought, may say that he is without sin. Further because we admit that the discursive lightness
of the human mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently
confess with truth that we are not without sin. For with whatever care a man tries to keep
his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the nature of the flesh, keep it according
to the desire of his spirit. For however far the human mind may have advanced and progressed
towards a finer purity of contemplation, so much the more will it see itself to be
unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the soul raises itself for a loftier
vision and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to
despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a keener sight
notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and
amendment of life, and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no
one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man
may be purified in mind, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and find grounds
for humiliation rather than for pride, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights,
so much more does he see above him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen Apostle
“whom Jesus loved,”220 who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the heart of
the Lord: “If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.”221
And so if when we say that we have no sin, we have not the truth, that is Christ, in us, what
good do we do except to prove ourselves by this very profession, criminals and wicked
among sinners?</p>

<head>That although we acknowledge that we cannot be without sin, yet still we ought not to suspend
ourselves from the Lord’s Communion.</head>
<p>Yet we ought not to suspend ourselves from the Lord’s Communion because we confess
ourselves sinners, but should more and more eagerly hasten to it for the healing of our soul,
and purifying of our spirit, and seek the rather a remedy for our wounds with humility of
mind and faith, as considering ourselves unworthy to receive so great grace. Otherwise we
cannot worthily receive the Communion even once a year, as some do, who live in monasteries
and so regard the dignity and holiness and value of the heavenly sacraments, as to
think that none but saints and spotless persons should venture to receive them, and not
rather that they would make us saints and pure by taking them. And these thereby fall into
greater presumption and arrogance than what they seem to themselves to avoid, because at
the time when they do receive them, they consider that they are worthy to receive them. But
it is much better to receive them every Sunday for the healing of our infirmities, with that
humility of heart, whereby we believe and confess that we can never touch those holy mysteries
worthily, than to be puffed up by a foolish persuasion of heart, and believe that at the
year’s end we are worthy to receive them. Wherefore that we may be able to grasp this and
hold it fruitfully, let us the more earnestly implore the Lord’s mercy to help us to perform
this, which is learnt not like other human arts, by some previous verbal explanation, but
rather by experience and action leading the way; and which also unless it is often considered
and hammered out in the Conferences of spiritual persons, and anxiously sifted by daily
experience and trial of it, will either become obsolete through carelessness or perish by idle
forgetfulness.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="1363"/>
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>How we laid bare the secrets of our thoughts to Abbot Abraham.</head>
<p>This twenty-fourth Conference of Abbot Abraham223 is by the favour of Christ produced,
which concludes the traditions and decisions of all the Elders; and when by the aid of your
prayers it has been finished, as the number mystically corresponds to that of the four and
twenty Elders who are said in the holy Apocalypse224 to offer their crowns to the Lamb, we
think that we shall have paid the debt of all our promises. And henceforth if these four and
twenty Elders of ours have been crowned with any glory for the sake of their teaching, they
shall with bowed heads offer it to the Lamb who was slain for the salvation of the world: for
He it was Who vouchsafed for the honour of His name to grant to them such exalted feelings
and to us whatever words were needful to set forth such profound thoughts. And the merits
of His gift must be referred to the Author of all good, to whom the more is owed, as the
more is paid. Therefore with anxious confession we laid before this Abraham the impulse
of our thoughts, whereby we were urged by daily perplexities of our mind to return to our
country and revisit our kinsfolk. For from this the greatest reason for our desire sprang,
because we remembered that our kinsfolk were endowed with such piety and goodness that
we felt sure that they would never interfere with our purpose, and we constantly reflected,
that we should gain more good out of their earnestness, and should be hampered by no
cares about bodily matters, and no trouble in providing food, as they would gladly minister
abundantly to the supply of all our wants, and besides this we were feeding our souls on the
hope of empty joys, as we thought that we should gain the greatest good from the conversion225
of many, who were to be turned to the way of salvation by our example and instructions.
Then besides this the very spot, where was the ancestral possession of our forefathers,
and the delightful pleasantness of the neighbourhood was painted before our eyes, how
pleasantly and suitably it stretched away to the desert, so that the recesses of the woods
would not only delight the heart of a monk, but would also furnish him with a plentiful
supply of food.226 And when we explained all this to the aforesaid old man, in a straightforward
way, according to the faith of our conscience, and showed by our copious tears that
we could no longer resist the violence of the impulse, unless the grace of God came to our
rescue by the healing which he could give, he waited for a long time in silence and at last
sighed deeply and said:</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>How the old man exposed our errors.</head>
<p>The feebleness of your ideas shows that you have not yet renounced worldly desires nor
mortified your former lusts. For as the wandering character of your desires testifies to the
sloth of your heart, this pilgrimage and absence from your kinsfolk, which you ought rather
to endure with your heart, you do endure only with the flesh. For all these things would
have been buried and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the right
method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell. And so I
see that you are labouring under that infirmity of sluggishness, which is thus described in
Proverbs: “Every sluggard is always desiring something;” and again: “Desires kill the slothful.”
227 For in our case too these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described,
would not be wanting, if we believed that they were appropriate to our calling, or thought
that we could get out of those delights and pleasures as much profit as that which is gained
from this squalor of the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace
of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their substance should fail us,
were it not that this saying of the Saviour meets us and excludes everything that contributes
to the support of this flesh, as He says: “He who doth not leave (or hate) father and mother
and children and brethren cannot be My disciple.”228 But if we were altogether deprived of
the protection of our parents, the services of the princes of this world would not be wanting,
as they would most thankfully rejoice to minister to our necessities with prompt liberality.
And supported by their bounty, we should be free from the care of preparing food, were it
not that this curse of the prophet terribly frightened us. For “Cursed,” he says, “is the man
that putteth his hope in man;” and: “Put not your trust in princes.”229 We should also at
any rate place our cells on the banks of the river Nile and have water at our very doors, so
as not to be obliged to carry it on our necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle
rendered us indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by his words, saying:
“Every one shall receive his own reward according to his labour.”230 Nor are we ignorant
that there are even in our country some pleasant recesses, where plenty of fruits, and pleasant
gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the food we need with the slightest bodily efforts
on our part, were it not that we were afraid lest that reproach might apply to us, which is
directed against the rich man in the gospel: “Because thou hast received thy consolation in
this life.”231 But as we despise all these things and scorn them together with all the pleasures

of this world, we delight only in this squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast
desert, and cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these barren sands, as we pursue
no temporal gains of this body, but the eternal rewards of the spirit. For it is but little for a
monk to have once made his renunciation, i.e., in the early days of his conversion to have
disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end
of this life we must with the prophet say this: “And I have not desired the day of man, Thou
knowest.”232 Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: “If any man will come after Me,
let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.”233</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Of the character of the districts which anchorites ought to seek.</head>
<p>And therefore by him who is exercising anxious care over the purity of his inner man,
those districts should be sought, which do not by their fruitfulness and fertility invite his
mind to the trouble of cultivating them, nor drive him forth from his fixed and immovable
position in his cell, and force him to go forth to some work in the open air, and so, his
thoughts being as it were poured forth openly, scatter to the winds all his concentration of
mind and all the keenness of his vision of his aim. And this cannot be guarded against or
seen by anyone at all however careful and watchful, except one who continually keeps his
body and soul shut up and enclosed in walls, that, like a splendid fisherman, looking out
for food for himself by the apostolic art, he may eagerly and without moving catch the
swarms of thoughts swimming in the calm depths of his heart, and surveying with curious
eye the depths as from a high rock, may sagaciously and cunningly decide what he ought
to lure to himself by his saving hook, and what he can neglect and reject as bad and nasty
fishes.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>What sorts of work should be chosen by solitaries.</head>
<p>Everyone therefore who constantly perseveres in this watchfulness will effectually fulfil
what is very plainly expressed by the prophet Habakkuk: “I will stand upon my watch, and
ascend upon the rock, and will look out to see what He shall say to me, and what I may answer
to Him that reproveth me.”234 And how difficult and tiresome this is, is very clearly shown
by the experience of those who live in the desert of Calamus or Porphyrion.235 For though
they are separated from all the cities and dwellings of men by a longer stretch of desert than
the wilderness of Scete (since by penetrating seven or eight days’ journey into the recesses
of the vast wilderness, they scarcely arrive at their hiding places and cells) yet because there
they are devoted to agriculture and not in the least confined to the cloister, whenever they
come to these squalid districts in which we are living, or to Scete, they are annoyed by such
harassing thoughts and such anxiety of mind that, as if they were beginners and men who
had never given the slightest attention to the exercises of solitude, they cannot endure the
life of the cells and the peace and quietness of them, and are at once driven forth and obliged
to leave them, as if they were inexperienced and novices. For they have not learnt to still the
motions of the inner man, and to quell the tempests of their thoughts by anxious care and
persevering efforts, as, toiling day after day in work in the open air, they are moving about
all day long in empty space, not only in the flesh but also in heart; and pour forth their
thoughts openly as the body moves hither and thither. And therefore they do not notice the
folly of their mind in longing for many things, nor can they put a check upon its vague discursiveness;
and as they cannot bear sorrow of spirit they think that the fact of a continuance
of silence is unendurable, and those who are never tired by hard work in the country, are
beaten by silence and worn out by the length of their rest.</p>

<head>That anxiety of heart is made worse rather than better by restlessness of body.</head>
<p>Nor is it wonderful if one who lives in a cell, having his thoughts collected together as
it were in a narrow cloister, is oppressed by a multitude of anxieties, which break out with
the man himself from the confinement of the dwelling, and at once dash here and there like
wild horses. But while they are now roaming at large from their stalls, for the moment some
short and sad solace is enjoyed: but when, after the body has returned to its own cell, the
whole troop of thoughts retires again to its proper home, the habit of chronic licence gives
rise to worse pangs. Those then who are unable and ignorant how to struggle against the
promptings of their own fancies, when they are harassed in their cell, by accidie attacking
their bosom more violently than usual, if they relax their strict rule and allow themselves
the liberty of going out oftener, will arouse a worse plague against themselves by means of
this which they fancy is a remedy: just as men fancy that they can check the violence of an
inward fever by a draught of the coldest water, though it is a fact that by it its fire is inflamed
rather than quenched, as a far worse attack follows after the momentary alleviation.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>A comparison showing how a monk ought to keep guard over his thoughts.</head>
<p>Wherefore a monk’s whole attention should thus be fixed on one point, and the rise
and circle of all his thoughts be vigorously restricted to it; viz., to the recollection of God,
as when a man, who is anxious to raise on high a vault of a round arch, must constantly
draw a line round from its exact centre, and in accordance with the sure standard it gives
discover by the laws of building all the evenness and roundness required. But if anyone tries
to finish it without ascertaining its centre—though with the utmost confidence in his art
and ability, it is impossible for him to keep the circumference even, without any error, or
to find out simply by looking at it how much he has taken off by his mistake from the beauty
of real roundness, unless he always has recourse to that test of truth and by its decision
corrects the inner and outer edge of his work, and so finishes the large and lofty pile to the
exact point.236 So also our mind, unless by working round the love of the Lord alone as an
immovably fixed centre, through all the circumstances of our works and contrivances, it
either fits or rejects the character of all our thoughts by the excellent compasses, if I may so
say, of love, will never by excellent skill build up the structure of that spiritual edifice of
which Paul is the architect, nor possess that beautiful house, which the blessed David desired
in his heart to show to the Lord and said: “I have loved the beauty of Thine house and the
place of the dwelling of Thy glory;”237 but will without foresight raise in his heart a house
that is not beautiful, and that is unworthy of the Holy Ghost, one that will presently fall,
and so will receive no glory from the reception of the blessed Inhabitant, but will be miserably
destroyed by the fall of his building.</p>

<head>A question why the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk is considered to interfere with us, whereas
it does not interfere in the case of those living in Egypt.</head>
<p>Germanus: It is a very useful and needful rule that is given for the kind of works that
can be done within the cells. For we have often proved the value of this not only by the example
of your holiness, based on the imitation of the virtues of the apostles, but also by our
own experience. But it is not sufficiently clear why we ought so thoroughly to avoid the
neighbourhood of our kinsfolk, which you did not reject altogether. For if we see you,
blamelessly walking in all the way of perfection, and not only dwelling in your own country
but some of you having not even retired far from their own village, why should that which
does not hurt you be considered bad for us?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="1371"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>The answer that all things are not suitable for all men.</head>
<p>Abraham: Sometimes we see bad precedents taken from good things. For if a man ventures
to do the same thing as another, but not with the same mind and purpose, or not with
equal goodness, he will immediately fall into the snares of deception and death through the
very things from which others gain the fruit of eternal life: As that strong armed lad matched
with the warlike giant in the combat would certainly have found, if he had been clad in the
heavy armour of Saul fit only for men; and that by which one of stronger age would have
laid low countless hosts of foes, would only have brought certain danger to the stripling,
had he not with prudent discretion chosen the sort of weapons suitable to his youth, and
armed himself against his foul foe not with breastplate and shield, with which he saw that
others were equipped, but with those weapons with which he was able to fight. Wherefore
it is right for each one of us first to consider carefully the measure of his powers and in accordance
with its limits, to choose what system he pleases, because though all are good, yet
all things cannot be fit for all men. For we do not assert that because the anchorite’s life is
good, it is therefore suited for everybody: for by many it is felt to be not only useless, but
even injurious. Nor because we are right in taking up the system of the Coenobium and the
pious and praiseworthy care of the brethren, do we therefore consider that it ought to be
followed by everybody. So also the fruits of the care of strangers are very plentiful, but this
cannot be taken up by everybody without loss of patience. Further, the systems of your
country and of this must first be weighed against each other; and then the powers of men
gathered from the constant occurrence of their virtues or vices must be severally weighed
in the opposite scales. For it may happen that what is difficult or impossible for a man of
one nation in the case of others is somehow turned by ingrained habit into nature: just as
some nations, separated by a wide difference of region, can bear tremendous force of cold
or heat of the sun without any covering of the body, which certainly others who have no
experience of that inclement sky, could not possibly endure, however strong they may be.
So also do you who with the utmost efforts of mind and body are trying in this district to
get the better of the nature of your country in many respects, diligently consider whether
in those regions which, as report says, are frozen, and bound by the cold of excessive unbelief,
you could endure this nakedness, if I may so term it. For to us the fact that our holy life is
of long standing has almost naturally imparted this fortitude in our purpose, and if we see
that you are our equals in virtue and constancy, you in like manner need not shun the
neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brethren.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>That those need not fear the neighbourhood of their kinsfolk, who can emulate the mortification
of Abbot Apollos.</head>
<p>But that you may be able fairly to measure the amount of your strength by a certain test
of strictness I will point out to you what was done by a certain old man; viz., Abbot Apollos238
that if your secret scrutiny of your heart decides that you are not behind this man in purpose
and goodness, you may venture on remaining in your country and living near your kinsfolk
without detriment to your purpose or injury to your mode of life, and be sure that neither
the feeling of nearness nor your love for the district can interfere with the strictness of this
humble lot,239 which not only your own will but the needs also of your pilgrimage enforce
upon you in this country. When then his own brother had come to this old man, whom we
have mentioned, in the dead of night, begging him to come out for a little while from his
monastery, to help him to rescue an ox, which as he sadly complained had stuck in the mire
of a swamp a little way off, because he could not possibly rescue it alone, Abbot Apollos
stolidly replied to his entreaties: “Why did you not ask our younger brother who was nearer
to you as you passed by than I?” and when the other, thinking that he had forgotten the
death of his brother who had been long ago buried, and that he was almost weak in his mind
from excessive abstinence and continual solitude, replied: “How could I summon one who
died fifteen years ago?” Abbot Apollos said: “Don’t you know that I too have been dead to
this world for twenty years, and that I can’t from my tomb in this cell give you any assistance
in what belongs to the affairs of this present life? And Christ is so far from allowing me ever
so little to relax my purpose of mortification on which I have entered, for extricating your
ox, that He did not even permit the very shortest intermission of it for my father’s funeral,
which would have been undertaken much more readily properly and piously.” And so do
ye now search out the secrets of your breast and carefully consider whether you also can
continually preserve such strictness of mind with regard to your kinsfolk, and when you
find that you are like him in this mortification of soul, then at last you may know that in
the same way the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brothers will not hurt you, when, I
mean, you hold that though they are very close to you, you are dead to them, in such a way
that you suffer neither them to be benefited by your assistance, nor yourselves to be relaxed
by duties towards them.</p>

For we are sure that we cannot possibly keep up our present wretched garb, or our daily
going barefoot in their neighbourhood, and that there we should not even procure with the
same labour what is necessary for our sustenance, as here we are actually obliged to fetch
our water on our necks for three miles. For shame on our part as well as on theirs would
not in the least allow us to do this before them. However how will it hurt our plan of life if
we are altogether set free from anxiety on the score of preparing our food, by being supplied
by them with all things, and so give ourselves up simply to reading and prayer, that by the
removal of that labour with which we are now distracted we may devote ourselves more
earnestly to spiritual interests alone?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>The answer stating what Saint Antony laid down on this matter.</head>
<p>Abraham: I will not give you my own opinion against this, but that of the blessed Antony,
whereby he confounded the laziness of a certain brother (overcome by this luke-warmness
which you describe) in such a way as also to cut the knot of your subject. For when one
came as I said to the aforesaid old man, and said that the Anchorite system was not at all to
be admired, declaring that it required greater virtue for a man to practise what belongs to
perfection living among men rather than in the desert, the blessed Antony asked where he
lived himself, and when he said that he lived close to his relations, and boasted that by their
provision he was set free from all care and anxiety of daily work, and gave himself up
ceaselessly and solely to reading and prayer without any distraction of spirit, once more the
blessed Antony said: “Tell me, my good friend, whether you grieve with their griefs and
misfortunes, and in the same way rejoice in their good fortune?” He confessed that he shared
in them both. To whom the old man: “You should know,” said he, “that in the world to
come also you will be judged in the lot of those with whom in this life you have been affected
by sharing in their gain or loss, or joy or sorrow.” And not satisfied with this statement the
blessed Antony entered on a still wider field of discussion, saying: “This mode of life and
this most lukewarm condition not only strike you with that damage of which I spoke (though
you do not feel it now, when somehow you say in accordance with that saying in Proverbs:
‘They strike me but I am not grieved: and they mocked me but I knew it not;’ or this that is
said in the Prophet: ‘And strangers have devoured his strength, but he himself knew it
not’240), because day after day they ceaselessly drag down your mind to earthly things, and
change it in accordance with the variations of chance; but also because they defraud you of
the fruits of your hands and the due reward of your own exertions, as they do not suffer you
to be supported by what these supply, or to procure your daily food for yourself with your
own hands, according to the rule of the blessed Apostle, as he when giving his last charge
to the heads of the Church of Ephesus, asserts that though he was occupied with the sacred
duties of preaching the gospel yet he provided not only for himself, but also for those who
were prevented by necessary duties with regard to his ministry, saying: ‘Ye yourselves know
that these hands have ministered to my necessities and to the necessities of those who were
with me.’ But to show that he did this as a pattern to be useful to us he says elsewhere: ‘We
were not idle among you; neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing, but in labour and
in toil we worked night and day lest we should be chargeable to any of you. Not as if we had
not power; but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.”241</p>

<head>Of the value of work and the harm of idleness.</head>
<p>And so though we also might have the protection of our kinsfolk, yet we have preferred
his abstinence to all riches, and have chosen to procure our daily bodily sustenance by our
own exertions rather than rely on the sure provision made by our relations, having less inclination
for idle meditation on holy Scripture of which you have spoken, and that fruitless
attendance to reading than to this laborious poverty. And certainly we should most gladly
pursue the former, if the authority of the apostles had taught us by their examples that it
was better for us, or the rules of the Elders had laid it down for our good. But you must
know that you are affected by this no less than by that harm of which I spoke above, because
though your body may be sound and lusty, yet you are supported by another’s contributions,
a thing which properly belongs only to the feeble. For certainly the whole human race, except
only that class of monks, who live in accordance with the Apostle’s command by the daily
labours of their own hands, looks for the charity of another’s compassion. Wherefore it is
clear that not only those who boast that they themselves are supported either by the wealth
of their relations or the labours of their servants or the produce of their farms, but also the
kings of this world are supported by charity. This at any rate is embraced in the definition
of our predecessors, who have laid down that anything that is taken for the requirements
of daily food which has not been procured and prepared by the labour of our own hands,
ought to be referred to charity, as the Apostle teaches, who altogether forbids the help of
another’s bounty to the idle and says: “If a man does not work, neither let him eat.”242 These
words the blessed Antony used against some one, and instructed us also by the example of
his teaching, to shun the pernicious allurements of our relations and of all who provide the
needful charity for our food as well as the delights of a pleasant home, and to prefer to all
the wealth of this world sandy wastes horrid with the barrenness of nature, and districts
overwhelmed by living incrustations, and for that reason subject to no control or dominion
of man, so that we should not only avoid the society of men for the sake of a pathless waste,
but also that the character of a fruitful soil may never entice us to the distractions of cultivating
it, whereby the mind would be recalled from the chief service of the heart, and rendered
useless for spiritual aims.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>A story of a barber’s payments, introduced for the sake of recognizing the devil’s illusions.</head>
<p>For as you hope that you can save others also, and are eager to return to your country
with the hope of greater gain, hear also on this subject a story of Abbot Macarius, very neatly
and prettily invented, which he also gave to a man in a tumult of similar desires, to cure
him by a most appropriate story. “There was,” said he, “in a certain city a very clever barber,
who used to shave everybody for three pence and by getting this poor and wretched sum
for his work, out of this same amount used to procure what was required for his daily food,
and after having taken all care of his body, used every day to put a hundred pence into his
pocket. But while he was diligently amassing this gain, he heard that in a city a long way off
each man paid the barber a shilling as his pay. And when he found this out, ‘how long,’ said
he, ‘shall I be satisfied with this beggary, so as to get with my labour a pay of three pence,
when by going thither I might amass riches by a large gain of shillings?’ And so at once
taking with him the implements of his art, and using up in the expense all that he had got
together and saved during a long time, he made his way with great difficulty to that most
lucrative city. And there on the day of his arrival, he received from everyone the pay for his
labour in accordance with what he had heard, and at eventide seeing that he had gained a
large number of shillings he went in delight to the butcher’s to buy the food he wanted for
his supper. And when he began to purchase it for a large sum of shillings he spent on a tiny
bit of meat all the shillings that he had gained, and did not take home a surplus of even a
single penny. And when he saw that his gains were thus used up every day so that he not
only failed to put by anything but could scarcely get what he required for his daily food, he
thought over the matter with himself and said: ‘I will go back to my city, and once more,
seek those very moderate profits, from which, when all my bodily wants were satisfied, a
daily surplus gave a growing sum to support my old age; which, though it seemed small and
trifling, yet by being constantly increased was amounting to no slight sum. In fact that gain
of coppers was more profitable to me than is this nominal one of shillings from which not
only is there nothing over to be laid by, but the necessities of my daily food are scarcely
met.’” And therefore it is better for us with unbroken continuance to aim at this very slender
profit in the desert, from which no secular cares, no worldly distractions, no pride of vainglory
and vanity can detract, and which the pressure of no daily wants can lessen (for “a small
thing that the righteous hath is better than great riches of the ungodly”243) rather than to
pursue those larger profits which even if they are procured by the most valuable conversion
of many, are yet absorbed by the claims of secular life and the daily leakage of distractions.
For, as Solomon says, “Better is a single handful with rest than both hands full with labour
<note type="footnote">243 Ps. xxxvi. (xxxvii.) 16.</note>

<pb n="1377"/>
and vexation of mind.”244 And in these allusions and inconveniences all that are at all weak
are sure to be entangled, as while they are even doubtful of their own salvation, and themselves
stand in need of the teaching and instruction of others, they are incited by the devil’s
tricks to convert and guide others, and as, even if they succeed in gaining any advantage
from the conversion of some, they waste by their impatience and rude manners whatever
they have gained. For that will happen to them which is described by the prophet Haggai:
“And he that gathereth riches, putteth them into a bag with holes.”245 For indeed a man
puts his gains into a bag with holes, if he loses by want of self control and daily distractions
of mind whatever he appears to gain by the conversion of others. And so it results that while
they fancy that they can make larger profits by the instruction of others, they are actually
deprived of their own improvement. For “There are who make themselves out rich though
possessing nothing, and there are who humble themselves amid great riches;” and: “Better
is a man who serves himself in a humble station than one who gains honour for himself and
wanteth bread.”246</p>

<head>A question how such wrong notions can creep into us.</head>
<p>Germanus: Very aptly has your discussion shown the error of these illusions by this illustration:
but we should like in the same way to be taught its origin and how to cure it, and
we are equally anxious to learn how this deception has taken hold of us. For everybody must
see that no one at all can apply remedies to ill health except one who has already diagnosed
the actual origin of the disease.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>The answer on the threefold movement of the soul.</head>
<p>Abraham: Of all faults there is one source and origin, but different names are assigned
to the passions and corruptions in accordance with the character of that part, or member,
if I may so call it, which has been injuriously affected in the soul: As is sometimes also shown
by the case of bodily diseases, in which though the cause is one and the same, yet there is a
division into different kinds of maladies in accordance with the nature of the member affected.
For when the violence of a noxious moisture has seized on the body’s citadel, i.e.,
the head, it brings about a feeling of headache, but when it affects the ears or eyes, it passes
into the malady of earache or ophthalmia: when it spreads to the joints and the extremities
of the hands it is called the gout in the joints or hands; but when it descends to the extremities
of the feet, its name is changed and it is termed podagra: and the noxious moisture which
is originally one and the same is described by as many names as there are separate members
which it affects. In the same way to pass from visible to invisible things, we should hold that
the tendency to each fault exists in the parts and, if I may use the expression, members of
our soul. And, as some very wise men have laid down that its powers are threefold, either
what is λογικόν, i.e., reasonable, or θυμικόν, i.e., irascible, or ἐπι θυμητικόν, i.e., subject to
desire, is sure to be troubled by some assault. When then the force of noxious passion takes
possession of anyone by reason of these feelings, the name of the fault is given to it in accordance
with the part affected. For if the plague of sin has infested its rational parts, it will
produce the sins of vainglory, conceit, envy, pride, presumption, strife, heresy. If it has
wounded the irascible feelings, it will give birth to rage, impatience, sulkiness, accidie,
pusillanimity and cruelty. If it has affected that part which is subject to desire, it will be the
parent of gluttony, fornication, covetousness, avarice, and noxious and earthly desires.</p>

<pb n="1380"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<head>That the rational part of our soul is corrupt.</head>
<p>And therefore if you want to discover the source and origin of this fault, you must recognize
that the rational part of your mind and soul is corrupt, that part namely from which
the faults of presumption and vainglory for the most part spring. Further this first member,
so to speak, of your soul must be healed by the judgment of a right discretion and the virtue
of humility, as when it is injured, while you fancy that you can not only still scale the heights
of perfection but actually teach others, and hold that you are capable and sufficient to instruct
others, through the pride of vainglory you are carried away by these vain rovings, which
your confession discloses. And these you will then be able to get rid of without difficulty, if
you are established as I said in the humility of true discretion and learn with sorrow of heart
how hard and difficult a thing it is for each of us to save his soul, and admit with the inmost
feelings of your heart that you are not only far removed from that pride of teaching, but
that you are actually still in need of the help of a teacher.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<pb n="1381"/>
<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<head>How the weaker part of the soul is the first to yield to the devil’s temptations.</head>
<p>You should then apply to this member or part of the soul which we have described as
particularly wounded, the remedy of true humility: for as, so far as appears, it is weaker than
the other powers of the soul in you, it is sure to be the first to yield to the assaults of the
devil. As when some injuries come upon us, which are caused either by toil laid upon us or
by a bad atmosphere, it is generally the case in the bodies of men that those which are the
weaker are the first to give in and yield to those chances, and when the disease has more
particularly laid hold of them, it affects the sound parts of the body also with the same
mischief, so also, when the pestilent blast of sin breathes over us the soul of each one of us
is sure to be tempted above all by that passion, in the case of which its feebler and weaker
portion does not make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful attacks of the foe, and to
run the risk of being taken captive by those, in the case of which a careless watch opens an
easier way to betrayal. For so Balsam247 gathered that God’s people could be by a sure
method deceived, when he advised, that in that quarter, wherein he knew that the children
of Israel were weak, the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he had no doubt that
when a supply of women was offered to them, they would at once fall and be destroyed by
fornication, because he was aware that the parts of their souls which were subject to desire
were corrupted. So then the spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty malice each one of us,
by particularly laying insidious snares for those affections of the soul, in which they have
seen that it is weak, as for instance, if they see that the reasonable parts of our soul are affected,
they try to deceive us in the same way that the Scripture tells us that king Ahab was deceived
by those Syrians, who said: “We know that the kings of Israel are merciful: And so let us put
sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes round our heads, and go out to the king of Israel, and
say to him: Thy servant Benhadad saith: I pray thee, let my soul live.” And thereby he was
affected by no true goodness, but by the empty praise of his clemency, and said: “If he still
liveth, he is my brother;” and after this fashion they can deceive us also by the error of that
reasonable part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing to that from which we
were hoping that we might gain a reward and receive the recompense of goodness, and to
us too the same rebuke may be addressed: “Because thou hast let go from thy hand a man
who was worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people”248 Or
when the unclean spirit says: “I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets,”249 he certainly spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable feeling
<note type="footnote">247 Cf. Numb. xxiv.</note>

<note type="footnote">249 1 Kings xxii. 22.</note>

<pb n="1382"/>
which he knew to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also the same spirit expected in
the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him in these three affections of the soul, wherein
he knew that all mankind had been taken captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles.
For he approached that portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when he said:
“Command that these stones be made bread;” the part subject to wrath, when he tried to
incite Him to seek the power of the present life and the kingdoms of this world; the reasonable
part when he said: “If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down from hence.”250 And in
these his deception availed nothing for this reason because he found that there was nothing
damaged in Him, in accordance with the supposition which he had formed from a false
idea. Wherefore no part of His soul yielded when tempted by the wiles of the foe, “For lo,”
He saith, “the prince of this world cometh and shall find nothing in Me.”251</p>

<p>Germanus: Among other kinds of illusions and mistakes on our part, which by the vain
promise of spiritual advantages have fired us with a longing for our country (as your holiness
has discovered by the keen insight of your mind), this stands out as the principal reason,
that sometimes we are beset by our brethren and cannot possibly continue in unbroken
solitude and continual silence, as we should like. And by this the course and measure of our
daily abstinence, which we always want to maintain undisturbed for the chastening of our
body, is sure to be interfered with on the arrival of some of the brethren. And this we certainly
feel would never happen in our own country, where it is impossible to find anyone, or
scarcely anyone who adopts this manner of life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>The answer on the devil’s illusion, because he promises us the peace of a vaster solitude.</head>
<p>Abraham: Never to be resorted to by men at all is a sign of an unreasonable and illconsidered
strictness, or rather of the greatest coldness. For if a man walks in this way, on
which he has entered, with too slow steps, and lives according to the former man, it is right
that none—I say not of the saints—but of any men should visit him. But you, if you are inflamed
with true and perfect love of our Lord, and follow God, who indeed is love, with
entire fervour of spirit, are sure to be resorted to by men, to whatever inaccessible spot you
may flee, and, in proportion as the ardour of divine love brings you nearer to God, so will
a larger concourse of saintly brethren flock to you. For, as the Lord says, “A city set on an
hill cannot be hid,”252 because “them that love Me,” saith the Lord, “will I honour, and they
that despise Me shall be contemned.”253 But you ought to know that this is the subtlest
device of the devil, this is his best concealed pitfall, into which he precipitates some wretched
and heedless persons, so that, while he is promising them greater things, he takes away the
requisite advantages of their daily profit, by persuading them that more remote and raster
deserts should be sought, and by portraying them in their heart as if they were sown with
marvellous delights. And further some unknown and non-existent spots, he feigns to be
well-known and suitable and already given over to our power and able to be secured without
any difficulty. The men also of that country he feigns to be docile and followers of the way
of salvation, that, while he is promising richer fruits for the soul there, he may craftily destroy
our present profits. For when owing to this vain hope each one separates himself from living
together with the Elders and has been deprived of all those things that he idly imagined in
his heart, he rises as it were from a most profound slumber, and when awake will find
nothing of those things of which he had dreamed. And so as he is hampered by larger requirements
for this life and inextricable snares, the devil will not even allow him to aspire
to those things which he had once promised himself, and as he is liable no longer to those
rare and spiritual visits of the brethren which he had formerly avoided, but to daily interruptions
from worldly folk, he will never suffer him to return even to the moderate quiet and
system of the anchorite’s life.</p>

<head>How useful is relaxation on the arrival of brethren.</head>
<p>That most refreshing interlude also of relaxation and courtesy, which sometimes is wont
to intervene because of the arrival of brethren, although it may seem to us tiresome and
what we ought to avoid, yet how useful it is and good for our bodies as well as our souls you
must patiently hear in few words. It often happens I say not to novices and weak persons
but even to those of the greatest experience and perfection, that unless the strain and tension
of their mind is lessened by the relaxation of some changes, they fall either into coldness of
spirit; or at any rate into a most dangerous state of bodily health. And therefore when there
occur even frequent visits from the brethren they should not only be patiently put up with,
but even gratefully welcomed by those who are wise and perfect; first because they stimulate
us always to desire with greater eagerness the retirement of the desert (for somehow while
they are thought to impede our progress, they really maintain it unwearied and unbroken,
and if it was never hindered by any obstacles, it would not endure to the end with unswerving
perseverance), next because they give us the opportunity of refreshing the body, together
with the advantages of kindness, and at the same time with a most delightful relaxation of
the body confer on us greater advantage than those which we should have gained by the
weariness which results from abstinence. On which matter I will briefly give a most apt illustration
handed down in an old story.</p>

<head>How the Evangelist John is said to have shown the value of relaxation.</head>
<p>It is said that the blessed John, while he was gently stroking a partridge with his hands
suddenly saw a philosopher approaching him in the garb of a hunter, who was astonished
that a man of so great fame and reputation should demean himself to such paltry and trivial
amusements, and said: “Can you be that John, whose great and famous reputation attracted
me also with the greatest desire for your acquaintance? Why then do you occupy yourself
with such poor amusements?” To whom the blessed John: “What is it,” said he, “that you
are carrying in your hand?” The other replied: “a bow.” “And why,” said he, “do you not
always carry it everywhere bent?” To whom the other replied: “It would not do, for the force
of its stiffness would be relaxed by its being continually bent, and it would be lessened and
destroyed, and when the time came for it to send stouter arrows after some beast, its stiffness
would be lost by the excessive and continuous strain. and it would be impossible for the
more powerful bolts to be shot.” “And, my lad,” said the blessed John, “do not let this slight
and short relaxation of my mind disturb you, as unless it sometimes relieved and relaxed
the rigour of its purpose by some recreation, the spirit would lose its spring owing to the
unbroken strain, and would be unable when need required, implicitly to follow what was
right.”254</p>

who will live godly in Christ suffer persecutions.”256 But whatever is hard and fraught with
persecutions cannot be easy and light.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<head>The answer with the explanation of the saying.</head>
<p>Abraham: We can prove by the easy teaching of our own experience that our Lord and
Saviour’s saying is perfectly true, if we approach the way of perfection properly and in accordance
with Christ’s will, and mortifying all our desires, and cutting off injurious likings,
not only allow nothing to remain with us of this world’s goods (whereby our adversary
would find at his pleasure opportunities of destroying and damaging us) but actually recognize
that we are not our own masters, and truly make our own the Apostle’s words: “I live,
yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.”257 For what can be burdensome, or hard to one who has
embraced with his whole heart the yoke of Christ, who is established in true humility and
ever fixes his eye on the Lord’s sufferings and rejoices in all the wrongs that are offered to
him, saying: “For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities,
in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong”?258 By what
loss of any common thing, I ask, will he be injured, who boasts of perfect renunciation, and
voluntarily rejects for Christ’s sake all the pomp of this world, and considers all and every
of its desires as dung, so that he may gain Christ, and by continual meditation on this
command of the gospel, scorns and gets rid of agitation at every loss: “For what shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange
for his soul?”259 For the loss of what will he be vexed, who recognizes that everything that
can be taken away from others is not their own, and proclaims with unconquered valour:
“We brought nothing into this world: it is certain that we cannot carry anything out”?260
By the needs of what want will his courage be overcome, who knows how to do without
“scrip for the way, money for the purse,”261 and, like the Apostle, glories “in many fasts, in
hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness”?262 What effort, or what hard command of an
Elder can disturb the peace of his bosom, who has no will of his own, and not only patiently
but even gratefully accepts what is commanded him, and after the example of our Saviour,
seeks to do not his own will, but the Father’s, as He says Himself to His Father: “Nevertheless
not as I will, but as Thou wilt”?263 By what wrongs also, by what persecution will he be
frightened, nay, what punishment can fail to be delightful to him, who always rejoices to-

<head>Why the Lord’s yoke is felt grievous and His burden heavy.</head>
<p>But the fact that to us on the contrary the yoke of Christ seems neither light nor easy,
must be rightly ascribed to our perverseness, as we are cast down by unbelief and want of
faith, and fight with foolish obstinacy against His command, or rather advice, who says: “If
thou wilt be perfect, go sell (or get rid of) all that thou hast, and come follow Me,”264 for
we keep the substance of our worldly goods. And as the devil holds our soul fast in the toils
of these, what remains but that, when he wants to sever us from spiritual delights, he should
vex us by diminishing these and depriving us of them, contriving by his crafty wiles that
when the sweetness of His yoke and lightness of His burden have become grievous to us
through the evil of a corrupt desire, and when we are caught in the chains of that very
property and substance, which we kept for our comfort and solace, he may always torment
us with the scourges of worldly cares, extorting from us ourselves that wherewith we are
tortured? For “Each one is bound by the cords of his own sins,” and hears from the prophet:
“Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk in the light of your fire,
and in the flames which you have kindled.” Since, as Solomon is witness, “Each man shall
thereby be punished, whereby he has sinned.”265 For the very pleasures which we enjoy
become a torment to us, and the delights and enjoyments of this flesh, turn like executioners
upon their originator, because one who is supported by his former wealth and property is
sure not to admit perfect humility of heart, not entire mortification of dangerous pleasures.
But where all these implements of goodness give their aid, there all the trials of this present
life, and whatever losses the enemy can contrive, are endured not only with the utmost patience,
but with real pleasure, and again when they are wanting so dangerous a pride springs
up that we are actually wounded by the deadly strokes of impatience at the slightest reproach,
and it may be said to us by the prophet Jeremiah: “And now what hast thou to do in the way
of Egypt, to drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians,
to drink the water of the river? Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy
shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee to have left
the Lord thy God, and that My fear is not with thee, saith the Lord.”266 How then is it that
the wondrous sweetness of the Lord’s yoke is felt to be bitter, but because the bitterness of
our dislike injures it? How is it that the exceeding lightness of the Divine burden becomes
heavy, but because in our obstinate presumption we despise Him by whom it was borne,
especially as Scripture itself plainly testifies to this very thing saying: “For if they would walk

in right paths, they would certainly have found the paths of righteousness smooth”?267 It
is plain, I say, that it is we, who make rough with the nasty and hard stones of our desires
the right and smooth paths of the Lord; who most foolishly forsake the royal road made
stony with the flints of apostles and prophets, and trodden down by the footsteps of all the
saints and of the Lord Himself, and seek trackless and thorny places, and, blinded by the
allurements of present delights, tear our way with torn legs and our wedding garment rent,
through dark paths, overrun with the briars of sins, so as not only to be pierced by the sharp
thorns of the brambles but actually laid low by the bites of deadly serpents and scorpions
lurking there. For “there are thorns and thistles in wrong ways, but he that feareth the Lord
shall keep himself from them.”268 Of such also the Lord says elsewhere by the prophet: “My
people have forgotten, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to
walk in them in a way not trodden.”269 For according to Solomon’s saying: “The ways of
those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but the ways of the lusty are trodden
down.”270 And thus wandering from the king’s highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis,
whither our course should ever be directed without swerving. And this also Ecclesiastes
has pretty significantly expressed saying: “The labour of fools wearies those who know
not how to go to the city;” viz., that “heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all.”271
But whoever truly gives up this world and takes upon him Christ’s yoke and learns of Him,
and is trained in the daily practice of suffering wrong, for He is “meek and lowly of heart,”272
will ever remain undisturbed by all temptations, and “all things will work together for good
to him.”273 For as the prophet Obadiah says the words of God are “good to him that walketh
uprightly;” and again: “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them;
but the transgressors shall fall in them.”274</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<head>Of the good which an attack of temptation brings about.</head>
<p>And so by the struggle with temptation the kindly grace of the Saviour bestows on us
larger rewards of praise than if it had taken away from us all need of conflict. For it is a mark
of a loftier and grander virtue to remain ever unmoved when hemmed in by persecutions
and trials, and to stand faithfully and courageously at the ramparts of God, and in the attacks
of men, girt as it were with the arms of unconquered virtue, to triumph gloriously over impatience
and somehow to gain strength out of weakness, for “strength is made perfect in
weakness.” “For behold I have made thee.” saith the Lord, “a pillar of iron and a wall of
brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and the princes and the priests thereof, and
all the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee and shall not prevail: for I am
with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.”275 Therefore according to the plain teaching of
the Lord the king’s highway is easy and smooth, though it may be felt as hard and rough:
for those who piously and faithfully serve Him, when they have taken upon them the yoke
of the Lord, and have learnt of Him, that He is meek and lowly of heart, at once somehow
or other lay aside the burden of earthly passions, and find no labour but rest for their souls,
by the gift of the Lord, as He Himself testifies by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: “Stand ye
on the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk ye in it: and
you shall find refreshment for your souls.” For to them at once “the crooked shall become
straight and the rough ways plain;” and they shall “taste and see that the Lord is gracious,”276
and when they hear Christ proclaiming in the gospel: “Come unto Me all ye that labour and
are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,” they will lay aside the burden of their sins, and
realize what follows: “For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.”277 The way of the Lord
then has refreshment if it is kept to according to His law. But it is we who by troublesome
distractions bring sorrows and troubles upon ourselves, while we try even with the utmost
exertion and difficulty to follow the crooked and perverse ways of this world. But when in
this way we have made the Lord’s yoke heavy and hard to us, we at once complain in a
blasphemous spirit of the hardness and roughness of the yoke itself or of Christ who lays it
upon us, in accordance with this passage: “The folly of man corrupteth his ways, but he
blames God in his heart;”278 and as Haggai the prophet says, when we say that “the way of
the Lord is not right” the reply is aptly made to us by the Lord: “Is not My way right? Are
not your ways rather crooked?”279 And indeed if you will compare the sweet scented flower

of virginity, and tender purity of chastity to the foul and fetid sloughs of lust, the calm and
security of monks to the dangers and losses in which the men of this world are involved,
the peace of our poverty to the gnawing vexations and anxious cares of riches, in which they
are night and day consumed not without the utmost peril to life, then you will prove that
the yoke of Christ is most easy and His burden most light.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<head>How the promise of an hundredfold in this life is made to those whose renunciation is perfect.</head>
<p>Further also that recompense of reward, wherein the Lord promises an hundredfold in
this life to those whose renunciation is perfect, and says: “And everyone that hath left house
or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for My name’s sake,
shall receive an hundredfold in the present time and shall inherit eternal life,”280 is rightly
and truly taken in the same sense without any disturbance of faith. For many taking occasion
by this saying, insist with crass intelligence that these things will be given carnally in the
millennium, though they must certainly admit that age, which they say will be after the resurrection
cannot possibly be understood as present. It is then more credible and much
clearer that one, who at the persuasion of Christ has made light of any worldly affections
or goods, receives from the brethren and partners of his life, who are joined to him by a
spiritual tie, even in this life a love which is an hundred times better: since it is certain that
among parents and children and brothers, wives and relations, where either the tie is merely
formed by intercourse, or the bond of union by the claims of relationship, the love is tolerably
short lived and easily broken. Finally even good and duteous children when they have grown
up, are sometimes shut out by their parents from their homes and property, and sometimes
for a really good reason the tie of matrimony is severed, and a quarrelsome division destroys
the property of brothers. Monks alone maintain a lasting union in intimacy, and possess all
things in common, as they hold that everything that belongs to their brethren is their own,
and that everything which is their own is their brethren’s. If then the grace of our love is
compared to those affections where the bond of union is a carnal love, certainly it is an
hundred times sweeter and finer. There will indeed also be gained from conjugal continence
a pleasure that is an hundred times greater than that which arises from the union of the
sexes. And instead of that joy, which a man experiences from the possession of a single field
of house, he will enjoy a delight in riches a hundred times greater, if he passes over to the
adoption of sons of God, and possesses as his own all things which belong to the eternal
Father, and asserts in heart and soul after the fashion of that true Son: “All things that the
Father hath are mine;”281 and if no longer tried by that criminal anxiety in distractions and
cares, but free from care and glad at heart he succeeds everywhere to his own, hearing daily
the announcement made to him by the Apostle: “For all things are yours, whether the world,
or things present, or things to come;” and by Solomon: “The faithful man has a whole world
of riches.”282 You have then that recompense of an hundredfold brought out by the greatness

<note type="footnote">282 1 Cor. iii. 22; Prov. xvii. 6 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="1395"/>
of the value, and the difference of the character that cannot be estimated. For if for a fixed
weight of brass or iron or some still commoner metal, one had given in exchange the same
weight only in gold, he would appear to have given much more than an hundredfold. And
so when for the scorn of delights and earthly affections there is made a recompense of
spiritual joy and the gladness of a most precious love, even if the actual amount be the same,
yet it is an hundred times better and grander. And to make this plainer by frequent repetition:
I used formerly to have a wife in the lustful passion of desire: I now have one in honourable
sanctification and the true love of Christ. The woman is but one, but the value of the love
has increased an hundredfold. But if instead of distrusting anger and wrath you have regard
to constant gentleness and patience, instead of the stress of anxiety and trouble, peace and
freedom from care, instead of the fruitless and criminal vexation of this world the salutary
fruits of sorrow, instead of the vanity of temporal joy the richness of spiritual delights, you
will see in the change of these feelings a recompense of an hundredfold. And if we compare
with the short-lived and fleeting pleasure of each sin the benefits of the opposite virtues the
increased delights will prove that these are an hundred times better. For in counting on your
fingers you transfer the number of an hundred from the left hand to the right and though
you seem to keep the same arrangement of the fingers yet there is a great increase in the
amount of the quantity.283 For the result will be that we who seemed to bear the form of
the goats on the left hand, will be removed and gain the reward of the sheep on the right
hand. Now let us pass on to consider the nature of those things which Christ gives back to
us in this world for our scorn of worldly advantages, more particularly according to the
Gospel of Mark who says: “There is no man who hath left house or brethren or sisters or
mother or children or lands for My sake and the gospel’s sake, who shall not receive an
hundred times as much now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and
children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life eternal.”284 For he who
for the sake of Christ’s name disregards the love of a single father or mother or child, and
gives himself over to the purest love of all who serve Christ, will receive an hundred times
the amount of brethren and kinsfolk; since instead of but one he will begin to have so many
fathers and brethren bound to him by a still more fervent and admirable affection. He also
will be enriched with an increased possession of lands, who has given up a single house for
the love of Christ, and possesses countless homes in monasteries as his own, to whatever
part of the world he may retire, as to his own house. For how can he fail to receive an hun-
<note type="footnote">283 The practice alludes to the counting on the fingers, in which all the tens up to ninety were reckoned on
the fingers of the left hand, but with the number of a hundred the reckoning began with the same arrangement
of the fingers on the right hand. S. Jerome had a similar allusion to the practice in his work against Jovian I. i.

<pb n="1396"/>
dredfold, and, if it is not wrong to add somewhat to our Lord’s words, more than an hundredfold,
who gives up the faithless and compulsory service of ten or twenty slaves and relies
on the spontaneous attendance of so many noble and free born men? And that this is so
you could prove by your own experience, as since you have each left but one father and
mother and home, you have gained without any effort or care, in any part of the world to
which you have come, countless fathers and mothers and brethren, as well as houses and
lands and most faithful servants, who receive you as their masters, and welcome, and respect,
and take care of you with the utmost attention. But, I say that deservedly and confidently
will the saints enjoy this service, if they have first submitted themselves and everything they
have by a voluntary offering for the service of the brethren. For, as the Lord says, they will
freely receive back that which they themselves have bestowed on others. But if a man has
not first offered this with true humility to his companions, how can he calmly endure to
have it offered to him by others, when he knows that he is burdened rather than helped by
their services, because he prefers to receive attention from the brethren rather than to give
it to them?</p>
<p>But all these things he will receive not with careless slackness and a lazy delight, but, in
accordance with the Lord’s word, “with persecutions,” i.e., with the pressure of this world,
and terrible distress from his passions, because, as the wise man testifies: “He who is easy
going and without trouble shall come to want.”285 For not the slothful, or the careless, or
the delicate, or the tender take the kingdom of heaven by force, but the violent. Who then
are the violent? Surely they are those who show a splendid violence not to others, but to
their own soul, who by a laudable force deprive it of all delights in things present, and are
declared by the Lord’s mouth to be splendid plunderers, and by rapine of this kind, violently
seize upon the kingdom of heaven. For, as the Lord says, “The kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence and the violent take it by force.”286 Those are certainly worthy of praise as violent,
who do violence to their own destruction, for, “A man,” as it is written, “that is in sorrow
laboureth for himself and does violence to his own destruction.”287 For our destruction is
delight in this present life, and to speak more definitely, the performance of our own likes
and desires, as, if a man withdraws these from his soul and mortifies them, he straightway
does glorious and valuable violence to his own destruction, provided that he refuses to it
the pleasantest of its wishes which the Divine word often rebukes by the prophet, saying:
“For in the days of your fast your own will is found;” and again: “If thou turn away thy foot
from the Sabbath, to do thy will on My holy day, and glorify him, while thou dost not thy
own ways, and thy own will is not found, to speak a word.” And the great blessedness that

<note type="footnote">287 Prov. xiv. 26 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="1397"/>
is promised to him is at once added by the prophet. “Then,” he says, “shalt thou be delighted
in the Lord, and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with
the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”288 And
therefore our Lord and Saviour, to give us an example of giving up our own wills, says: “I
came not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me;” and again: “Not as I will,
but as Thou wilt.”289 And this good quality those men in particular show who live in the
Coenobia and are governed by the rule of the Elders, who do nothing of their own choice,
but their will depends upon the will of the Abbot. Finally to bring this discussion to a close,
I ask you, do not those who faithfully serve Christ, most clearly receive grace an hundredfold
in this, while for His name’s sake they are honoured by the greatest princes, and though
they do not look for the praise of men, yet become venerated in the trials of persecution
whose humble condition would perhaps have been looked down upon even by common
folk, either because of their obscure birth, or because of their condition as slaves, if they had
continued in their life in the world? But because of the service of Christ no one will venture
to raise a calumny against their state of nobility, or to fling in their teeth the obscurity of
their origin. Nay rather, through the very opprobrium of a humble condition by which
others are shamed and confounded, the servants of Christ are more splendidly ennobled,
as we can clearly show by the case of Abbot John who lives in the desert which borders on
the town of Lycus. For he sprang from obscure parents, but owing to the name of Christ
has become so well known to almost all mankind that the very lords of creation, who hold
the reins of this world and of empire, and are a terror to all powers and kings, venerate him
as their lord, and from distant countries seek his advice, and entrust to his prayers and
merits the crown of their empire, and the state of safety, and the fortunes of war.290</p>
<p>In such terms the blessed Abraham discoursed on the origin of and remedy for our illusion,
and exposed to our eyes the crafty thoughts which the devil had originated and suggested,
and kindled in us the desire of true mortification, wherewith we hope that many also
may be inflamed, even though all these things have been written in a somewhat simple style.
For though the dying embers of our words cover up the glowing thoughts of the greatest
fathers, yet we hope that in the case of very many who try to remove the embers of our words
and to fan into a flame the hidden thoughts, their coldness will be turned into heat. But, O
holy brethren, I have not indeed been so puffed up by the spirit of presumption as to give
forth to you this fire (which the Lord came to send upon the earth, and which He eagerly
longs to kindle291) in order that by the application of this warmth I might set on fire your

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>When I had now finished the books of Spiritual Conferences, the merit of which consists
in the thoughts expressed rather than in the language used (since my rude utterances were
unequal to the deep thoughts of the saints), I had contemplated and almost determined on
taking refuge in silence (as I was ashamed of having exposed my ignorance) that I might as
far as possible make up for my audacity in speaking by modestly holding my tongue for the
future. But you have overcome my determination and purpose by your commendable
earnestness and most urgent affection, my dear Leo, my esteemed and highly regarded
friend, ornament that you are of the Roman Church and sacred ministry,554 as you drag
me forth from the obscurity of the silence on which I had determined, into a public court
which I may well dread, and oblige me to undertake new labours while I am still blushing
for my past ones. And though I was unequal to lesser tasks, you compel me to match myself
with greater ones. For even in those trifling works, in which of our small ability we offered
some small offering to the Lord, I would never have attempted to do or apply myself to
anything unless I had been led to it by Episcopal command. And so through you there has
been an increase of importance both of our subject and of our language. For whereas before
we spoke, when bidden, of the business of the Lord, you now require us to speak of the actual
Incarnation and glory of the Lord Himself. And so we who were formerly brought as
it were into the holy place of the temple by priestly hands, now penetrate under your guidance
and protection, so to speak, into the holy of holies. Great is the honour but most perilous
the undertaking,555 because the prize of the holy sanctuary and the divine reward can only
be secured by a victory over our foe. And so you require and charge us to raise our feeble
hands against a fresh heresy and a new enemy of the faith,556 and that we should take our
stand, so to speak, against the awful open-mouthed gapings of the deadly serpent, that at
my summons the power of prophecy and the divine force of the gospel word may destroy
the dragon now rising up with sinuous course against the Churches of God. I obey your
intreaty: I yield to your command: for I had rather trust in my own matters to you than to
myself, especially as the love of Jesus Christ my Lord commands me this as well as you, for
He Himself gives me this charge in your person. For in this matter you are more concerned

Gennadius (De Vir. Illust. c. lxi.) tells us of Cassian, that “finally at the request of Leo, then archdeacon of Rome
and afterwards Bishop, he wrote seven books against Nestorius on the Incarnation of the Lord, and thus brought
to a close his literary labours at Marseilles, as well as his life, in the reign of Theodosius and Valentinian. The
date of the work must have been a.d. 430, shortly before the Council of Ephesus.</note>

than I am, as your judgment stands in peril rather than my duty. For in my case, whether I
prove equal to what you have commanded me or no, the very fact of my obedience and
humility will be in some degree an excuse for me; if indeed I might not urge that there is
more value in my obedience, if there is less that I can do. For we easily comply with any
one’s orders, out of our abundance: but his is a great and wonderful work, whose desires
exceed his powers. Yours then is this work and business, and yours it is to be ashamed of
it. Pray and intreat that your choice may not be discredited by my clumsiness; and that,
supposing we do not answer the expectations which you have formed of us, you may not
seem to have been wrong in commanding out of an ill-considered determination, while I
was right in yielding, owing to the claims of obedience.</p>

<head>The heresy compared to the hydra of the poets.557</head>
<p>The tales of poets tell us that of old the hydra when its heads were cut off gained by its
injuries, and sprang up more abundantly: so that owing to a miracle of a strange and unheardof
kind, its loss proved a kind of gain to the monster which was thus increased by death,
while that extraordinary fecundity doubled everything which the knife of the executioner
cut off, until the man who was eagerly seeking its destruction, toiling and sweating, and
finding his efforts so often baffled by useless labours, added to the courage of battle the arts
of craft, and by the application of fire, as they tell us, cut off with a fiery sword the manifold
offspring of that monstrous body; and so when the inward parts were thus burnt, by cauterizing
the rebellious throbbings of that ghastly fecundity, at length those prodigious births
were brought to an end. Thus also heresies in the churches bear some likeness to that hydra
which the poets’ imagination invented; for they too hiss against us with deadly tongues; and
they too cast forth their deadly poison, and spring up again when their heads are cut off.
But because the medicine should not be wanting when the disease revives, and because the
remedy should be the more speedy as the sickness is the more dangerous, our Lord God is
able to bring to pass that that may be a truth in the church’s warfare, which Gentile fictions
imagined of the death of the hydra, and that the fiery sword of the Holy Spirit may cauterize
the inward parts of that most dangerous birth, in the new heresy to be put down, so that at
last its monstrous fecundity may cease to answer to its dying throbs.</p>

<head>Description of the different heretical monsters which spring from one another.</head>
<p>For these shoots of an unnatural seed are no new thing in the churches. The harvest of
the Lord’s field has always had to put up with burrs and briars, and in it the shoots of
choking tares have constantly sprung up. For hence have arisen the Ebionites, Sabellians,
Arians, as well as Eunomians and Macedonians, and Photinians and Apollinarians, and all
the other tares of the churches, and thistles which destroy the fruits of good faith. And of
these the earliest was Ebion,558 who while over-anxious about asserting our Lord’s humanity559
robbed it of its union with Divinity. But after him the schism of Sabellius burst forth
out of reaction against the above mentioned heresy, and as he declared that there was no
distinction between the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, he impiously confounded, as far as
was possible, the Persons, and failed to distinguish the holy and ineffable Trinity. Next after
him whom we have mentioned there followed the blasphemy of Arian perversity, which, in
order to avoid the appearance of confounding the Sacred Persons, declared that there were
different and dissimilar substances in the Trinity. But after him in time though like him in
wickedness came Eunomius, who, though allowing that the Persons of the Holy Trinity
were divine and like560 each other, yet insisted that they were separate from each other; and
so while admitting their likeness denied their equality. Macedonius also blaspheming against
the Holy Ghost with unpardonable wickedness, while allowing that the Father and the Son
were of one substance, termed the Holy Ghost a creature, and so sinned against the entire
Divinity, because no injury can be offered to anything in the Trinity without affecting the
entire Trinity. But Photinus, though allowing that Jesus who was born of the Virgin was
God, yet erred in his notion that His Godhead began with the beginning of His manhood;561
while Apollinaris through inaccurately conceiving the union of God and man wrongly believed
that He was without a human soul. For it is as bad an error to add to our Lord Jesus

spoken of otherwise than as He is—even though it seems to add to His glory—yet it is an
offence. And so one after another out of reaction against heresies they give rise to heresies,
and all teach things different from each other, but equally opposed to the faith. And just
lately also, i.e., in our own days, we saw a most poisonous heresy spring up from the greatest
city of the Belgæ,562 and though there was no doubt about its error, yet there was a doubt
about its name, because it arose with a fresh head from the old stock of the Ebionites, and
so it is still a question whether it ought to be called old or new. For it was new as far as its
upholders were concerned; but old in the character of its errors. Indeed it blasphemously
taught that our Lord Jesus Christ was born as a mere man, and maintained that the fact that
He afterwards obtained the glory and power of the Godhead resulted from His human worth
and not from His Divine nature; and by this it taught that He had not always His Divinity
by the right of His very own Divine nature which belonged to Him, but that He obtained it
afterwards as a reward for His labours and sufferings. Whereas then it blasphemously taught
that our Lord and Saviour was not God at His birth, but was subsequently taken into the
Godhead, it was indeed bordering on this heresy which has now sprung up, and is as it were
its first cousin and akin to it, and, harmonizing both with Ebionism and these new ones,
came in point of time between them, and was linked with them both in point of wickedness.

<note type="footnote">562 Et maxima Belgarum urbe (Petschenig). Gazæus edits: Et maxime Beligarum urbe. The city must be Trêves
and the allusion is to the heresy of Leporius, which was an outcome of Pelagianism. Leporius was apparently a
native of Trêves who propagated Pelagian views in Gaul, ascribing his virtues to his own free will and his own
strength; and going to far greater lengths than his master in that he connected this doctrine of human sufficiency
with heretical views on the Incarnation; thus combining Pelagianism with what was practically Nestorianism,
teaching that Jesus was a mere man who had used His free will so well as to have lived without sin, and had only
been made Christ in virtue of His Baptism, whereby the Divine and Human were associated so as virtually to
make two Christs. He taught further that the only object of His coming into the world was to exhibit to mankind
an example of virtue; and that if they chose to profit by it they also might be without sin. For these errors he was
rebuked by Cassian and others in Gaul and on his refusal to abandon them was formally censured by Proculus
Bishop of Marseilles and Cylinnius (Bishop of Fréjus?). He then left Gaul and came to Africa, where he was
convinced by Augustine of the erroneous character of his teaching, and under his influence signed a recantation,
which was perhaps drawn up by Augustine himself, and from which Cassian quotes below (c. v.). This recantation
was read in the Church of Carthage, and subscribed by four bishops as witnesses (including Augustine). It was
then sent to the Gallican Bishops accompanied by a letter from the four attesting bishops (Epp. August. no.
ccxxix.) commending the treatment which Leporius had previously received, but recommending him once more
to their favour as having retracted his errors. See further Fleury H. E. Book XXIV. c. xlix. and Dictionary of
Christian Biography, Art. Leporius.</note>

<head>He describes the pestilent error of the Pelagian.</head>
<p>At any rate we think that this fact ought not to be omitted, which was special and peculiar
to that heresy mentioned above which sprang from the error of Pelagius; viz., that in
saying that Jesus Christ had lived as a mere man without any stain of sin, they actually went
so far as to declare that men could also be without sin if they liked. For they imagined that
it followed that if Jesus Christ being a mere man was without sin, all men also could without
the help of God be whatever He as a mere man without participating in the Godhead, could
be. And so they made out that there was no difference between any man and our Lord Jesus
Christ, as any man could by effort and striving obtain just the same as Christ had obtained
by His earnestness and efforts. Whence it resulted that they broke out into a more grievous
and unnatural madness, and said that our Lord Jesus Christ had come into this world not
to bring redemption to mankind but to give an example of good works, to wit, that men,
by following His teaching, and by walking along the same path of virtue, might arrive at the
same reward of virtue: thus destroying, as far as they could, all the good of His sacred advent
and all the grace of Divine redemption, as they declared that men could by their own lives
obtain just that which God had wrought by dying for man’s salvation. They added as well
that our Lord and Saviour became the Christ after His Baptism, and God after His Resurrection,
tracing the former to the mystery of His anointing, the latter to the merits of His Passion.
Whence this new author563 of a heresy that is not new, who declares that our Lord and Saviour
was born a mere man, observes that he says exactly the same thing which the Pelagians
said before him, and allows that it follows from his error that as he asserts that our Lord
Jesus Christ lived as a mere man entirely without sin, so he must maintain in his blasphemy
that all men can of themselves be without sin, nor would he admit that our Lord’s redemption
was a thing needful for His example, since men can (as they say) reach the heavenly kingdom
by their own exertions. Nor is there any doubt about this, as the thing itself shows us. For
hence it comes that he encourages the complaints of the Pelagians by his intervention, and
introduces their case into his writings, because he cleverly or (to speak more truly) cunningly
patronizes them and by his wicked liking for them recommends their mischievous teaching
which is akin to his own, for he is well aware that he is of the same opinion and of the same
spirit, and therefore is distressed that a heresy akin to his own has been cast out of the church,
as he knows that it is entirely allied to his own in wickedness.</p>

<head>Leporius together with some others recants his Pelagianism.</head>
<p>But still as those who were the outcome of this stock of pestilent thorns have already
by the Divine help and goodness been healed, we should also now pray to our Lord God
that as in some points that older heresy and this new one are akin to each other, He would
grant a like happy ending to those which had a like bad beginning. For Leporius, then a
monk, now a presbyter, who followed the teaching or rather the evil deeds of Pelagius, as
we said above, and was among the earliest and greatest champions of the aforesaid heresy
in Gaul, was admonished by us and corrected by God, and so nobly condemned his former
erroneous persuasion that his amendment was almost as much a matter for congratulation
as is the unimpaired faith of many. For it is the best thing never to fall into error: the second
best thing to make a good repudiation of it. He then coming to himself confessed his mistake
with grief but without shame not only in Africa, where he was then and is now,564 but also
gave to all the cities of Gaul penitent letters containing his confession and grief; in order
that his return to the faith might be made known where his deviation from it had been first
published, and that those who had formerly been witnesses of his error might also afterwards
be witnesses of his amendment.</p>
<note type="footnote">564 The after history of Leporius appears to have been this. Having come under Augustine’s influence, he
was persuaded by him to give up all his property, and renounce the temporal care of a monastery which he had
previously founded in a garden at Hippo; where also he had begun to build a xenodochium or house of refuge
for strangers, partly at his own expense, and partly out of the alms of the faithful. He also at Augustine’s suggestion,
built a church in memory of the “eight martyrs” (see Aug. Serm. 356). This complete renunciation of the world
must have taken place about 425; and in the following year we find that he was present at the election of Eraclius
to succeed Augustine (Aug. Ep. 213); but subsequent to this nothing is known of his history except that he was
still living when Cassian wrote. It is right to mention that doubts have been raised by Tillemont whether the
presbyter of Hippo is identical with the quondam heretic, but on scarcely sufficient grounds.</note>

<head>By the case of Leporius he establishes the fact that an open sin ought to be expiated by an open
confession; and also teaches from his words what is the right view to be held on the Incarnation.</head>
<p>And from his confession or rather lamentation we have thought it well to quote some
part, for two reasons: that their recantation might be a testimony to us, and an example to
those who are weak, and that they might not be ashamed to follow in their amendment, the
men whom they were not ashamed to follow in their error; and that they might be cured by
a like remedy as they suffered from a like disease. He then acknowledging the perverseness
of his views, and seeing the light of faith, wrote to the Gallican Bishops, and thus began:565
“I scarcely know, O my most venerable lords and blessed priests, what first to accuse myself
of, and what first to excuse myself for. Clumsiness and pride and foolish ignorance together
with wrong notions, zeal combined with indiscretion, and (to speak truly) a weak faith which
was gradually failing, all these were admitted by me and flourished to such an extent that I
am ashamed of having yielded to such and so many sins, while at the same time I am profoundly
thankful for having been able to cast them out of my soul.” And after a little he
adds: “If then, not understanding this power of God, and wise in our conceits and opinions,
from fear lest God should seem to act a part that was beneath Him, we suppose that a man
was born in conjunction with God, in such a way that we ascribe to God alone what belongs
to God separately, and attribute to man alone what belongs to man separately, we clearly
add a fourth Person to the Trinity and out of the one God the Son begin to make not one
but two Christs; from which may our Lord and God Jesus Christ Himself preserve us.
Therefore we confess that our Lord and God Jesus Christ the only Son of God, who for His
own sake566 was begotten of the Father before all worlds, when in time He was for our
sakes567 made man of the Holy Ghost and the ever-virgin Mary, was God at His birth; and
while we confess the two substances of the flesh and the Word,568 we always acknowledge
with pious belief and faith one and the same Person to be indivisibly God and man; and we
say that from the time when He took upon Him flesh all that belonged to God was given to
man, as all that belonged to man was joined to God.569 And in this sense ‘the Word was

made flesh:’570 not that He began by any conversion or change to be what He was not, but
that by the Divine ‘economy’ the Word of the Father never left the Father,571 and yet
vouchsafed to become truly man, and the Only Begotten was incarnate through that hidden
mystery which He alone understands (for it is ours to believe: His to understand). And thus
God ‘the Word’ Himself receiving everything that belongs to man, is made man, and the
manhood572 which is assumed, receiving everything that belongs to God cannot but be
God; but whereas He is said to be incarnate and unmixed, we must not hold that there is
any diminution of His substance: for God knows how to communicate Himself without
suffering any corruption, and yet truly to communicate Himself. He knows how to receive
into Himself without Himself being increased thereby, just as He knows how to impart
Himself in such a way as Himself to suffer no loss. We should not then in our feeble minds
make guesses, in accordance with visible proofs and experiments, from the case of creatures
which are equal, and which mutually enter into each other, nor think that God and man are
mixed together, and that out of such a fusion of flesh and the Word (i.e., the Godhead and
manhood) some sort of body is produced. God forbid that we should imagine that the two
natures being in a way moulded together should become one substance. For a mixture of
this sort is destructive of both parts. For God, who contains and is not Himself contained,
who enters into things and is not Himself entered into, who fills things and is not Himself
filled, who is everywhere at once in His completeness and is diffused everywhere, communicates
Himself graciously to human nature by the infusion of His power.” And after a little:
“Therefore the God-man, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is truly born for us of the Holy Ghost
and the ever-virgin Mary. And so in the two natures the Word and Flesh become one, so
that while each substance continues naturally perfect in itself, what is Divine imparteth
without suffering any loss, to the humanity, and what is human participates in the Divine;
nor is there one person God, and another person man, but the same person is God who is

also man: and again the man who is also God is called and indeed is Jesus Christ the only
Son of God; and so we must always take care and believe so as not to deny that our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Very God (whom we confess as existing ever with the Father
and equal to the Father before all worlds) became from the moment when He took flesh the
God-man. Nor may we imagine that gradually as time went on He became God, and that
He was in one condition before the resurrection and in another after it, but that He was always
of the same fulness and power.” And again a little later on: “But because the Word of
God573 vouchsafed to come down upon manhood by assuming manhood, and manhood
was taken up into the Word by being assumed by God, God the Word in His completeness
became complete man. For it was not God the Father who was made man, nor the Holy
Ghost, but the Only Begotten of the Father; and so we must hold that there is one Person
of the Flesh and the Word: so as faithfully and without any doubt to believe that one and
the same Son of God, who can never be divided, existing in two natures574 (who was also
spoken of as a “giant”575) in the days of His Flesh truly took upon Him all that belongs to
man, and ever truly had as His own what belongs to God: since even though576 He was
crucified in weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God.”</p>

<head>The united doctrine of the Catholics is to be received as the orthodox faith.</head>
<p>This confession of his therefore, which was the faith of all Catholics was approved of
by all the Bishops of Africa,577 whence he wrote, and by all those of Gaul, to whom he wrote.
Nor has there ever been anyone who quarrelled with this faith, without being guilty of unbelief:
for to deny what is right and proved is to confess what is wrong. The agreement of
all ought then to be in itself already sufficient to confute heresy: for the authority of all shows
undoubted truth, and a perfect reason results where no one disputes it: so that if a man endeavours
to hold opinions contrary to these, we should in the first instance rather condemn
his perverseness than listen to his assertions, for one who impugns the judgment of all announces
beforehand his own condemnation, and a man who disturbs what has been determined
by all, is not even given a hearing. For when the truth has once for all been established
by all men, whatever arises contrary to it is by this very fact to be recognized at once as
falsehood, because it differs from the truth. And thus it is agreed that this alone is sufficient
to condemn a man; viz., that he differs from the judgment of truth. But still as an explanation
of a system does no harm to the system, and truth always shines brighter when thoroughly
ventilated, and as it is better that those who are wrong should be set right by discussion
rather than condemned by severe censures, we should cure, as far as we can with the Divine
assistance, this old heresy appearing in the persons of new heretics, that when through God’s
mercy they have recovered their health, their cure may bear testimony to our holy faith instead
of their condemnation proving an instance of just severity. Only may the Truth indeed
be present at our discussion and discourse concerning it, and assist our human weakness
with that goodness with which God vouchsafed to come to men, as for this purpose above
all He willed to be born on earth and among men; viz., that there might be no more room
for falsehood.</p>

<head>How the errors of later heretics have been condemned and refuted in the persons of their authors
and originators.</head>
<p>As we began by setting down in the first book some things by which we showed that
our new heretic is but an offshoot from ancient stocks of heresy, the due condemnation of
the earlier heretics ought to be enough to secure a sentence of due condemnation for him.
For as he has the same roots and grows up out of the same fallow578 he has already been
amply condemned in the persons of his predecessors, especially as those who went wrong
immediately before these men very properly condemned the very thing which these men
are now asserting,579 so that the examples of their own party ought to be amply sufficient
for them in both directions; viz., that of those who were restored and that of those who were
condemned. For if they are capable of amendment they have their remedy set forth in the
correction of their own party. If they are incapable of it they receive their sentence in the
condemnation of their own folk. But that we may not be thought to have prejudged the case
against them instead of fairly judging it, we will produce their actual pestilent assertions, or
rather I should say their blasphemous folly: taking “above all the shield of faith, and the
sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God,”580 that when the head of the old serpent
rises once more, the same sword of the Divine Word which formerly severed it in the case
of those ancient dragons may even now cut it off in the persons of these new serpents. For
since the error of these is the same as that of those former ones, the decapitation of those
ought to be counted as the decapitation of these; and as the serpents revive and emit pestilent
blasts against the Lord’s church, and cause some to fail through their hissing, we must on
account of these new diseases add a fresh remedy to those older cures, so that even if what
has already been done prove insufficient to heal581 the malady, what we are now doing may
be adequate to restore those who are suffering from it.</p>

<head>Proof that the Virgin Mother of God was not only Christotocos but also Theotocos, and that
Christ is truly God.</head>
<p>And so you say, O heretic, whoever you may be, who deny that God was born of the
Virgin, that Mary the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ ought not to be called Theotocos,
i.e., Mother of God, but Christotocos, i.e., only the Mother of Christ, not of God.582 For no
one, you say, brings forth what is anterior in time. And of this utterly foolish argument
whereby you think that the birth of God can be understood by carnal minds, and fancy that
the mystery of His Majesty can be accounted for by human reasoning, we will, if God permits,
say something later on.583 In the meanwhile we will now prove by Divine testimonies that
Christ is God, and that Mary is the Mother of God. Hear then how the angel of God speaks
to the Shepherds of the birth of God. “There is born,” he says, “to you this day in the city of
David a Saviour who is Christ the Lord.”584 In order that you may not take Christ for a mere
man, he adds the name of Lord and Saviour, on purpose that you may have no doubt that
He whom you acknowledge as Saviour is God, and that (as the office of saving belongs only
to Divine power) you may not question that He is of Divine power, in whom you have learnt
that the power to save resides. But perhaps this is not enough to convince your unbelief, as
the angel of the Lord termed Him Lord and Saviour rather than God or the Son of God, as
you certainly most wickedly deny Him to be God, whom you acknowledge to be Saviour.
Hear then what the archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary. “The Holy Ghost,”
he says, “shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee:
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”585
Do you see how, when he is going to point out the nativity of God, he first speaks of a work
<note type="footnote">582 The Nestorian controversy was originated by a sermon of Anastasius, a follower of Theodore of
Mopsuestia, whom Nestorius brought with him to Constantinople as his chaplain on his appointment as
Archbishop, a.d. 428. This man, preaching in the presence of the archbishop, said: “Let no one call Mary
Theotocos; for Mary was but a woman, and it is impossible that God should be born of a woman.” In the controversy
which was immediately excited by these words Nestorius at once took the part of his chaplain and
preached a course of sermons in maintenance of his views; refusing to the Blessed Virgin the title of Theotocos,
while admitting that she might be termed Christotocos. See Socrates H. E. Book VII.. c. xxxii., Evagrius H. E.
Book I. c. ii., and Vincentius Lirinensis Book I. c. xvii. The sermons are still partially existing in the writings of

of Divinity. For “the Holy Ghost,” he says, “shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most
High shall overshadow thee.” Admirably did the angel speak, and explain the majesty of the
Divine work by the Divine character of his words. For the Holy Ghost sanctified the Virgin’s
womb, and breathed into it by the power of His Divinity, and thus imparted and communicated
Himself to human nature; and made His own what was before foreign to Him, taking
it to Himself by His own power and majesty.586 And lest the weakness of human nature
should not be able to bear the entrance of Divinity the power of the Most High strengthened
the ever to be honoured Virgin, so that it supported her bodily weakness by embracing it
with overshadowing protection, and human weakness was not insufficient for the consummation
of the ineffable mystery of the holy conception, since it was supported by the Divine
overshadowing. “Therefore,” he says, “the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Most High shall overshadow thee.” If only a mere man was to be born of a pure virgin
why should there be such careful mention of the Divine Advent? Why such intervention of
Divinity itself? Certainly if only a man was to be born from man, and flesh from flesh, a
command alone might have done it, or the Divine will. For if the will of God alone, and His
command sufficed to fashion the heavens, form the earth, create the sea, thrones, and seats,
and angels, and archangels, and principalities, and powers, and in a word to create all the
armies of heaven, and those countless thousands of thousands of the Divine hosts (“For He
spake and they were made, He commanded and they were created”587), why was it that that
was insufficient for the creation of (according to you) a single man, which was sufficient
for the production of all things divine, and that the power and majesty of God did not entrust
that with the birth of a single infant, which had availed to fashion all things earthly and
heavenly? But certainly the reason why all those works were performed by the command
of God, but the nativity was only accomplished by His coming was because God could not
be conceived by man unless He allowed it, nor be born unless He Himself entered in; and
therefore the archangel pointed out that the sacred majesty would come upon the Virgin,
I mean that as so great an event could not be brought about by human appointment, he
announced that there would be present at the conception the glory of Him who was to be
born.588 And so the Word, the Son, descended: the majesty of the Holy Ghost was present:
the power of the Father was overshadowing; that in the mystery of the holy conception the
whole Trinity might cooperate. “Therefore,” he says, “also that holy thing which shall be
born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” Admirably does he add “Therefore,” in order
to show that this would therefore follow because that had gone before; and that because God

had come upon her at the conception therefore God would be present at the birth. And when
the maiden understood not, he gave a reason for this great thing, saying: “Because the Holy
Spirit shall come upon thee, and because the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born shall be called the Son of God;” that is to
say: That thou mayest not be ignorant of the provision for so great a work, and the mystery
of this great secret, the majesty of God shall therefore come upon thee completely; because
the Son of God shall be born of thee. What further doubt can there be about this? or what
is there further to be said? He said that God would come upon her; that the Son of God
would be born. Ask now, if you like, how the Son of God can help being God, or how she
who brought forth God can fail to be Theotocos, i.e., the Mother of God? This alone ought
to be enough for you; aye this ought to be amply sufficient for you.</p>

<head>Follows up the same argument with passages from the Old Testament.</head>
<p>But as there is an abundant supply of witnesses to the holy nativity; viz., all that has
been on this account written, to hear witness to it, let us examine in some slight degree an
announcement about God even in the Old Testament, that you may know that the fact that
the birth of God was to be from a virgin was not only then announced when it actually came
to pass, but had been foretold from the very beginning of the world, that, as the event to be
brought about was ineffable, incredulity of the fact when actually present might be removed
by its having been previously announced while still future. And so the prophet Isaiah says:
“Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which is interpreted God with us.”589 What room is there here for doubt, you incredulous
person?590 The prophet said that a virgin should conceive: a virgin has conceived: that a
Son should be born: a Son has been born: that He should be called God: He is called God.
For He is called by that name as being of that nature. Therefore when the Spirit of God said
that He should be called God, He proved that He is without the Spirit of God who makes
himself a stranger to all fellowship with the Divine title. “Behold then,” he says, “a virgin
shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is interpreted
God with us.” But here is a point on which it is possible that your shuffling incredulity may
fasten; viz., by saying that this which the prophet declared He should be called referred not
to the glory of His Divinity, but to the name by which He should be addressed. But what
are we to do because Christ is never spoken of by this name in the gospels, though the
Spirit of God cannot be said to have spoken falsely through the prophet? How is it then?
Surely that we should understand that that prophecy then foretold the name of His Divine
nature and not of His humanity. For since in His manhood united to the Godhead591 He
received another name in the gospel, it is certainly clear that this name belonged to His humanity,
that to His Divinity. But let us proceed further and summon other true witnesses
to establish the truth: For where we are speaking about the Godhead, the Divinity cannot
be better established than by His own witnesses. So then the same prophet says elsewhere:
“For unto us a Son is born: unto us a child is given; and the government shall be upon His

showed how it was capable of being pressed into the service of heresy. Homo unitus Deo, in Cassian’s mouth
evidently means the manhood joined to the Godhead, but the words might easily be taken as implying that a
man was united to God, i.e., that there were in the Incarnation two persons, one assuming and the other assumed,
which was the essence of Nestorianism. Compare above, the note on Homo to Book I. c. v.</note>

shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the
Father of the world to come, the Prince of peace.”592 Just as above the prophet had expressly
said that He should be called Emmanuel, so here he says that He should be called “the angel
of great counsel, and God the mighty, and the Father of the world to come and the prince
of peace” (although we certainly never read that He was called by these names in the gospel):
of course that we may understand that these are not terms belonging to His human, but to
His Divine nature; and that the name used in the gospel belonged to the manhood which
He took upon Him,593 and this one to His innate power. And because God was to be born
in human form, these names were so distributed in the sacred economy, that to the manhood
a human name was given and to the Divinity a Divine one. Therefore he says: “He shall be
called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the prince
of peace.” Not, O heretic, whoever you may be, not that here the prophet, full as he was of
the Holy Spirit, followed your example and compared Him who was born to a molten image
and a figure fashioned without sense.594 For “a Son,” he says, “is born to us, a Child is given
to us; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel
of great counsel, God the mighty.” And that you may not imagine Him whom He announced
as God595 to be other than Him who was born in the flesh, he adds a term referring to His
birth, saying: “A child is born to us: a son is given to us.” Do you see how many titles the
prophet used to make clear the reality of His birth in the body? for he called Him both Son
and child on purpose that the manner of the child which was born might be more clearly
shown by a name referring to His infancy; and the Holy Spirit foreseeing without doubt this
perversity of blasphemous heretics, showed to the whole world that it was God who was
born, by the very terms and words used; that even if a heretic was determined to utter blasphemy,
he might not find any loophole for his blasphemy. Therefore he says: “A Son is born

to us; a child is given to us; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name
shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come,
the prince of peace.” He teaches that this child which was born is both prince of peace and
Father of the world to come and God the mighty. What room is there then for shuffling?
This child which is born cannot be severed from God who is born in Him, for he called
Him, whom he spoke of as born, Father of the world to come; Him whom he called a child,
he foretold as God the mighty. What is it, O heretic? Whither will you betake yourself? Every
place is hedged and shut in: there is no possibility of getting out of it. There is nothing for
it but that you should at length be obliged to confess the mistake which you would not understand.
But not content with these passages which are indeed enough let us inquire what
the Holy Ghost said through another prophet. “Shall a man,” says he, “pierce his God, for
you are piercing me?”596 In order that the subject of the prophecy might be still clearer the
prophet foretells what he proclaimed of the Lord’s passion as if from the mouth of Him of
whom he was speaking. “Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing me?” Does not
our Lord God, I ask, seem to have said this when He was led to the Cross? Why indeed do
you not acknowledge Me as your Redeemer? Why are ye ignorant of God clothed in flesh
for you? Are you preparing death for your Saviour? Are yon leading forth to death the Author
of life? I am your God whom ye are lifting up: your God whom ye are crucifying. What
mistake, I ask, is here or what madness is it? “Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing
me?” Do you see how exactly the words describe what was actually done? Could you ask for
anything more express or clearer? Do you see how sacred testimonies follow our Incarnate
Lord Jesus Christ from the very cradle to the Cross which He bore, as here you can see that
He whom elsewhere you read of as God when born in the flesh was God when pierced on
the cross? And so there, where His birth was treated of, He is spoken of by the prophet as
God: and here where His crucifixion is concerned, He is most clearly named God; that the
taking upon Him of manhood might not in any point prejudice dignity of His Divinity, nor
the humiliation of His body and the shame of the passion affect the glory of His majesty;
for His condescension to so lowly a birth and His generous goodness in enduring his passion
ought to increase our love and devotion to Him; since it is certainly a great and monstrous
sin if, the more He lavishes love upon us, the less He is honoured by us.</p>
<note type="footnote">596 Malachi iii. 8. Jerome’s rendering is almost identical “Si affiget homo Deum, quia vos configitis me,”
where the Douay version strangely departs from the literal sense of the word and renders vaguely “afflict.” It is
clear however that it was intended to be understood literally, as it is here taken by Cassian as a direct prophecy
of the Crucifixion. The LXX. has πτερνιεῖ. The Hebrew word, which is only found again in Prov. xxii. 23, appears
to mean “defraud.”</note>

<head>He produces testimonies to the same doctrine from the Apostle Paul.</head>
<p>But passing over these things which cannot possibly be unfolded because there would
be no limit to the telling of them, as the blessings which he gives are without stint, it is time
for us to consult the Apostle Paul, the stoutest and clearest witness to Him, for he can tell
us everything about God in the most trustworthy way because God always spoke from his
breast. He then, the chosen teacher of the nations, who was sent to destroy the errors of
Gentile superstition, bears his witness in the following way to the grace and coming of our
Lord God: “The grace,” he says, “of God and our Saviour appeared unto all men, instructing
us that denying ungodliness and worldly desires we should live soberly and justly and godly
in this world, looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ.”597 He says that “there appeared the grace of God our Saviour.”
Admirably does he use a word suited to show the arrival of a new grace and birth; for by
saying “there appeared,” he indicated the approach of a new grace and birth, for thenceforward
the gift of a new grace began to appear, from the moment when God appeared as born
in the world. Thus by using the right word, and one exactly suitable, he shows the light of
this new grace almost as if he pointed to it with his finger. For that is most properly said to
appear, which is shown by sudden light manifesting it. Just as we read in the gospel that the
star appeared to the wise men in the East:598 and in Exodus: “There appeared,” he says, “to
Moses an angel in a flame of fire in the bush:”599 for in all these and in the case of other
visions in the Holy Scripture, Scripture determined that this word in particular should be
used, that it might speak of that as “appearing,” which shone forth with unwonted light. So
then the Apostle also, well knowing the coming of the heavenly grace, which appeared at
the approach of the holy nativity, indicated it by using a term applied to a bright appearance;
expressly in order to say that it appeared, as it shone with the splendour of a new light.
“There appeared” then “the grace of God our Saviour.” Surely you cannot raise any quibble
about the ambiguity of the names in this place, so as to say that “Christ” is one and “God”
another, or to divide “the Saviour” from the glory of His name, and separate “the Lord”
from the Divinity? Lo, here the vessel600 of God speaks from God, and testifies by the clearest
statement that the grace of God appeared from Mary. And in order that you may not deny
that God appeared from Mary, he at once adds the name of Saviour, on purpose that you
may believe that He who is born of Mary is God, whom you cannot deny to have been born

a Saviour, in accordance with this passage: “For to you is born to-day a Saviour.”601 O excellent
teacher of the Gentiles truly given by God to them, for he knew that this wild
heretical folly would arise, which would turn to controversial uses the names of God, and
would not hesitate to slander God from His own titles; and so just in order that the heretic
might not separate the title of Saviour from the Divinity he put first the name of God, that
the name of God standing first might claim as His all the names which followed, and that
no one might imagine that in what followed Christ was spoken of as a mere man, as by the
very first word used he had taught that He was God. “Looking,” says the same Apostle, “for
the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”
Certainly that teacher of divine wisdom saw that plain and simple teaching would not in
itself be sufficient to meet the crafty wiles of the devil’s cunning, unless he fortified the holy
preaching of the faith with a protection of extreme care. And so although he had used the
name of God the Saviour up above, he here adds “Jesus Christ,” in case you might think
that the mere name of Saviour was not enough to indicate to you our Lord Jesus Christ, and
might fail to understand that the God, whom you acknowledge as God the Saviour, is the
same Jesus Christ. What then does he say? He says: “Looking for the blessed hope and
coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” Nothing is here wanting
as regards the titles of our Lord and you see here God, and the Saviour, and Jesus, and Christ.
But when you see all these, you see that they all belong to God. For you have heard of Him
as God, but as Saviour as well. You have heard of Him as God, but as Jesus as well. You have
heard of Him as God, but as Christ as well. That which the Divinity has joined and united
together cannot be separated by this diversity of titles; for whichever you may seek for of
them, all, you will find it there. The Saviour is God, Jesus is God, Christ is God. In all of this
which you hear, though the titles used are many, yet they belong to one Person in power.
For whereas the Saviour is God, and Jesus is God, and Christ is God, it is easy to see that all
these, though different appellations, are united as regards the Majesty. And when you hear
quite plainly that one and the same Person is called God in each case, you can surely clearly
see that in all these cases there is but one God spoken of. And so you cannot any longer seek
to make out a distinction of power from the different names given to the Lord, or to make
a difference of Person owing to variety of titles. You cannot say: Christ was born of Mary,
but God was not; for an Apostle declares that God was. You cannot say that Jesus was born
of Mary, but God was not; for an Apostle testifies that God was. You cannot say: the Saviour
was born, but God was not; for an Apostle supports the fact that God was. There is no way
of escape for you. Whichever of the titles of the Lord you may take, He is God, of whom
you speak. You have nothing to say: nothing to assert: nothing to invent in your wicked

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>From the gifts of Divine grace which we receive through Christ he infers that He is truly God.</head>
<p>Although we began to speak some time back on this Divine grace of our Lord and Saviour,
I want to say somewhat more on the same subject from the Holy Scriptures. We read
in the Acts of the Apostles that the Apostle James602 thus refuted those who thought that
when they received the gospel they ought still to bear the yoke of the old Law: “Why,” said
he, “do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples which neither our fathers
nor we have been able to bear. But by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be
saved in like manner as they also.”603 The Apostle certainly speaks of the gift of this grace
as given by Jesus Christ. Answer me now, if you please: do you think that this grace which
is given for the salvation of all men, is given by man or by God? If you say, By man, Paul,
God’s own vessel, will cry out against you, saying: “There appeared the grace of God our
Saviour.”604 He teaches that this grace is the result of a Divine gift, and not of human
weakness. And even if the sacred testimony was not sufficient, the truth of the matter itself
would bear its witness, because fragile earthly things cannot possibly furnish a thing of
lasting and immortal value; nor can anyone give to another that in which he himself is
lacking, nor supply a sufficiency of that, from the want of which he admits that he himself
is suffering. You cannot then help admitting that the grace comes from God. It is God then
who has given it. But it has been given by our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore the Lord Jesus
Christ is God. But if He be, as He certainly is, God: then she who bore God is Theotocos,
i.e., the mother of God. Unless perhaps you want to take refuge in so utterly absurd and
blasphemous a contradiction as to deny that she from whom God was born is the mother
of God, while you cannot deny that He who was born is God. But, however, let us see what
the gospel of God thinks about this same grace of our Lord: “Grace and truth,” it says, “came
by Jesus Christ.”605 If Christ is a mere man, how did these come by Christ? Whence was
there in Him Divine power if, as you say, there was in Him only the nature of man? Whence
comes heavenly largesse, if His is earthly poverty? For no one can give what he has not
already. As then Christ gave Divine grace, He already had that which He gave. Nor can
anyone endure a diversity of things that are so utterly different from each other, as at one
and the same time to suffer the wants of a poor man, and also to show the munificence of
a bounteous one. And so the Apostle Paul, knowing that all the treasures of heavenly riches

are found in Christ, rightly writes to the Churches: “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.”606 For though he had already often enough taught that God is the same as Christ,
and that all the glory of Deity resides in Him, and that all the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth
in Him bodily, yet here he is certainly right in praying for the grace of Christ alone, without
adding the word God: for while he had often taught that the grace of God is the same as the
grace of Christ, he now most perfectly prays only for the grace of Christ, for he knows that
in the grace of Christ is contained the whole grace of God. Therefore he says: “The grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.” If Jesus Christ was a mere man, then in his wish that
the grace of Christ might be given to the Churches he was wishing that the grace of a man
might be given; and by saying: “The grace of Christ be with you” he meant: the grace of a
man be with you, the grace of flesh be with you, the grace of bodily weakness, the grace of
human frailty! Or why did he ever even mention the word grace, if his wish was for the grace
of a man? For there was no reason for wishing, if that was not in existence which was wished
for; nor ought he to have prayed that there might be bestowed on them the grace of one
who, according to you, did not possess the reality of that grace for which he was wishing.
And so you see that it is utterly absurd and ridiculous—or rather not a thing to laugh at but
to cry over, for what is a matter for laughter to some frivolous persons becomes a matter
for crying to pious and faithful souls, for they shed tears of charity for the folly of your unbelief,
and weep pious tears at the folly of another’s impiety. Let us then recover ourselves
for a while and take our breath, for this idea is not only without wisdom but also without
the Spirit, as it is certainly wanting in spiritual wisdom and has nothing to do with the
Spirit of salvation.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>That the power of bestowing Divine grace did not come to Christ in the course of time, but
was innate in Him from His very birth.</head>
<p>But perhaps you will say that this grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, of which the Apostle
writes, was not born with Him, but was afterwards infused into Him by the descent of Divinity
upon Him, since you say that the man Jesus Christ our Lord (whom you call a mere
man) was not born with God, but afterwards was assumed by God:607 and that through this
grace was given to the man at the same time that Divinity was given to Him. Nor do we say
anything else than that Divine grace descended with the Divinity, for the Divine grace of
God is in a way a bestowal of actual Divinity and a gift of a liberal supply of graces. Perhaps
then it may be thought that the difference between us is one of time rather than of what is
essential, since the Divinity which we say was born with Jesus Christ you say was afterwards
infused into Him. But the fact is that if you deny that Divinity was born with the Lord you
cannot afterwards make a confession according to the faith; for it is an impossibility for one
and the same thing to be partly impious and also to turn out partly pious, and for the same
thing partly to belong to faith and partly to misbelief. To begin with then I ask you this: Do
you say that our Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of the Virgin Mary is only the Son of man,
or that He is the Son of God as well? For we, I mean all who hold the Catholic faith, all of
us, I say, believe and are sure and know and confess that He is both, i.e., that He is Son of
man because born of a woman and Son of God because conceived of Divinity. Do you then
admit that He is both, i.e., Son of God and Son of man, or do you say that He is Son of man
only? If Son of man only then there cry out against you apostles and prophets, aye and the
Holy Ghost Himself, by whom the conception was brought about. That most shameless
mouth of yours is stopped by all the witnesses of the Divine decrees: it is stopped by sacred
writings and holy witnesses: aye and it is stopped by the very gospel of God as if by a Divine
hand. And that mighty Gabriel who in the case of Zacharias restrained the voice of unbelief
by the power of his word, much more strongly condemned in your case the voice of blasphemy
and sin, by his own lips, saying to the Virgin Mary, the mother of God: “The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee:
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”608
<note type="footnote">607 Nestorius maintained that “that which was formed in the womb of Mary was not God Himself…but because
God dwells in him whom He has assumed, therefore also He who is assumed is called God because of Him who
assumes Him. And it is not God who has suffered, but God was united with the crucified flesh.” (Fragm. in
Marius Mercator p. 789 sq. (ed. Migne).) Thus he made out that in Christ were two Persons, one assuming and
the other assumed.</note>
<note type="footnote">608 S. Luke i. 35.</note>

<pb n="1427"/>
Do you see how Jesus Christ is first proclaimed to be the Son of God that according to the
flesh He might become the Son of man? For when the Virgin Mary was to bring forth the
Lord she conceived owing to the descent of the Holy Spirit upon her and the cooperation
of the power of the Most High. And from this you can see that the origin of our Lord and
Saviour must come from thence, whence His conception came; and since He was born owing
to the descent of the fulness of Divinity in Its completeness upon the Virgin, He could not
be the Son of man unless He had first been the Son of God; and so the angel when sent to
announce His nativity and sacred birth, when he had already spoken of the mystery of His
conception added a word expressive of His birth, saying: “Therefore also that holy thing
which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God” [i.e., He shall be called the Son
of Him from whom He was begotten].609 Jesus Christ is therefore the Son of God, because
He was begotten of God and conceived of God. But if He is the Son of God, then most certainly
He is God: but if He is God, then He is not lacking in the grace of God. Nor indeed
was He ever lacking in that of which He is Himself the maker. For grace and truth were
made by Jesus Christ.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>How in Christ the Divinity, Majesty, Might and Power have existed in perfection from eternity,
and will continue.</head>
<p>Therefore all grace, power, might, Divinity, aye, and the fulness of actual Divinity and
glory have ever existed together with Him and in Him, whether in heaven or in earth or in
the womb or at His birth. Nothing that is proper to God was ever wanting to God. For the
Godhead was ever present with God, no where and at no time severed from Him. For
everywhere God is present in His completeness and in His perfection. He suffers no division
or change or diminution; for nothing can be either added to God or taken away from Him,
for He is subject to no diminution of Divinity, as to no increase of It. He was the same Person
then on earth who was also in heaven: the same Person in His low estate who was also in
the highest: the same Person in the littleness of manhood as in the glory of the Godhead.
And so the Apostle was right in speaking of the grace of Christ when He meant the grace
of God. For Christ was everything that God is. At the very time of His conception as man
there came all the power of God, all the fulness of the Godhead; for thence came all the
perfection of the Godhead, whence was His origin. Nor was that Human nature of His610
ever without the Deity as it received from Deity the very fact of its existence. And so, to begin
with, whether you like it or no, you cannot deny this; viz., that the Lord Jesus Christ is the
Son of God, especially as the archangel declares in the gospels: “That holy thing which shall
be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” But when this is established then remember
that whatever you read of Christ you read of the Son of God: whatever you read of the Lord
or Jesus belongs to the Son of God. And so when you recognize a title of Divinity in all these
terms which you hear uttered, as you see that in each case you ought to understand that the
Son of God is meant, prove to me, if you like, how you can separate the Godhead from the
Son of God.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>That Christ, who is God and man in the unity of Person, sprang from Israel and the Virgin
Mary according to the flesh.</head>
<p>That divine teacher of the Churches when in writing to the Romans he was reproving
or rather lamenting the unbelief of the Jews, i.e., of his own brethren, made use of these
words: “I wished myself,” said he, “to be accursed from Christ, for my brethren, who are
my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as
of children, and the glory, and the testaments, and the giving of the law, and the service of
God, and the promises: whose are the fathers, of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who
is over all things, God blessed for ever.”611 O, the love of that most faithful Apostle, and
most kindly kinsman! who in his infinite charity wished to die—as a kinsman for his relations,
and as a master for his disciples. And what then was the reason why he wished to die? Only
one; viz., that they might live. But in what did their life consist? Simply in this, as he himself
says, that they might recognize a Divine Christ born according to the flesh, of their own
flesh. And therefore the Apostle grieved the more, because those who ought to have loved
Him the more as sprung from their own stock, failed to understand that He was born of
Israel. “Of whom,” said he, “is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God
blessed for ever.” Clearly he lays down that from them according to the flesh, was born that
Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever. You certainly cannot deny that Christ was born
from them according to the flesh. But the same Person, who was born from them, is God.
How can you get round this? How can you shuffle out of it? The Apostle says that Christ
who was born of Israel according to the flesh, is God. Teach us, if you can, at what time He
did not exist. “Of whom,” he says, “is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God.”
You see that because the Apostle has united and joined together these, “God” cannot possibly
be separated from “Christ.” For just as the Apostle declares that Christ is of them, so he asserts
that God is in Christ. You must either deny both of these statements, or you must accept
both. Christ is said to be born of them according to the flesh: but the same Person is declared
by the Apostle to be “God in Christ.” Whence also he says elsewhere: “For God was in Christ,
reconciling the world to Himself.”612 It is absolutely impossible to separate one from the

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The title of God is given in one sense to Christ, and in another to men.</head>
<p>The name of God would for the faithful be amply sufficient to denote the glory of His
Divinity, but by adding “over all, God blessed,” he excludes a blasphemous and perverse
interpretation of it, for fear that some evil-disposed person to depreciate His absolute Divinity
might quote the fact that the word God is sometimes applied by grace in the Divine economy
temporarily to men, and thus apply it to God by unworthy comparisons, as where God says
to Moses: “I have given thee as a God to Pharaoh,”613 or in this passage: “I said ye are
Gods,”614 where it clearly has the force of a title given by condescension. For as it says “I
said,” it is not a name showing power, so much as a title given by the speaker. But that passage
also, where it says: “I have given thee as a God to Pharaoh,” shows the power of the giver
rather than the Divinity of him who receives the title. For when it says: “I have given,” it
thereby certainly indicates the power of God, who gave, and not the Divine nature, in the
person of the recipient. But when it is said of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, “who is over
all, God blessed for ever,” the fact is at once proved by the words, and the meaning of the
words shown by the name given: because in the case of the Son of God the name of God
does not denote an adoption by favour, but what is truly and really His nature.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>He explains the apostle’s saying: “If from henceforth we know no man according to the flesh,”
etc.</head>
<p>And so the same Apostle says: “From henceforth we know no man according to the
flesh, and if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no
longer.”615 Admirably consistent are all the writings of the sacred word with each other,
and in every portion of them: even where they do not correspond in the form of the words,
yet they agree in the drift and substance. As where he says: “And if we have known Christ
according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.” For the witness of the passage
before us confirms that quoted above, in which he said: “Of whom is Christ according to
the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever.” For there he writes: “Of whom is Christ according
to the flesh;” and here: “if we have known Christ according to the flesh.” There:
“who is over all, God blessed for ever;” and here: “yet now we no longer know Christ according
to the flesh.” The look of the words is different, but their force and drift is the same. For
it is the same Person whom he there declares to be God over all born according to the flesh,
whom he here asserts that he no longer knows according to the flesh. And plainly for this
reason; viz., because Him whom he had known as born in the flesh, he acknowledges as
God for ever; and therefore says that he knows him not after the flesh, because He is over
all, God blessed for ever; and the phrase there: “who is over all God,” answers to this: “we
no longer know Christ according to the flesh;” and this phrase: “we no longer know Christ
according to the flesh” implies this: “who is God blessed for ever.”616 The declaration of
Apostolic teaching then somehow rises, as it were to greater heights, and though it is selfconsistent
throughout, yet it supports the mystery of the perfect faith, with a still more express
statement, and says: “And though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we
know Him so no longer,” i.e., as formerly we knew Him as man as well as God, yet now only
as God. For when the frailty of flesh comes to an end, we no longer know anything in Him
except the power of Divinity, for all that is in Him is the power of Divine Majesty, where
the weakness of human infirmity has ceased to exist. In this passage then he has thoroughly
expounded the whole mystery of the Incarnation, and of His perfect Divinity. For where he
says: “And if we have known Christ according to the flesh,” he speaks of the mystery of God
born in flesh. But by adding “yet now we know Him so no longer,” he manifests His power

in sæcula. That of Gazæus has: Ac per hoc et illud ibi qui est super omnia Deus: et hoc dicit, non novimus

<pb n="1433"/>
when weakness is laid aside. And thus that knowledge of the flesh has to do with His humanity,
and that ignorance, with the glory of His Divinity. For to say “we have known Christ
according to the flesh:” means “as long as that which was known, existed. Now we no longer
know it, after it has ceased to exist. For the nature of flesh has been transformed into a
spiritual substance: and that which formerly belonged to the manhood, has all become
God’s. And therefore we no longer know Christ according to the flesh, because when bodily
infirmity has been absorbed by Divine Majesty,617 nothing remains in that Sacred Body,
from which weakness of the flesh can be known in it. And thus whatever had formerly belonged
to a twofold substance, has become attached to a single Power. Since there is no sort
of doubt that Christ, who was crucified through human weakness lives entirely through the
glory of His Divinity.</p>
<note type="footnote">617 The language used in the text by Cassian is scarcely defensible. The whole tenour of the treatise shows
clearly enough that his meaning is orthodox enough, and that he fully recognizes that the Human nature of
Christ is still existing (see especially c. vi.): but the language used comes perilously near to Eutychianism, and
might be taken to imply that the human nature had been absorbed in the Divine. Again in Book V. c. vii. he
speaks of the Son of man “united to the Son of God” (cf. also c. viii.), language which taken by itself might seem
to sanction Nestorianism, the very heresy against which Cassian himself is writing. These instances of inaccurate
language, which a later writer would have carefully avoided, serve to show one great service which heresies did
to the Church in making Churchmen write λογικώτερον. Cf. Dorner, Doctrine of the Person of Christ, Vol. i.

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>From the Epistle to the Galatians he brings forward a passage to show that the weakness of
the flesh in Christ was absorbed by His Divinity.</head>
<p>The Apostle indeed declares this in the whole body of his writings, and admirably says
in writing to the Galatians: “Paul an Apostle not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ
and God the Father.”618 You see how thoroughly consistent he is with himself in the former
and the present passage. For there he says: “Now we no longer know Christ according to
the flesh.” Here he says: “Not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ.” It is clear that
his doctrine is the same here as in the former passage. For where he says that he is not sent
by man, he implies: “We have not known Christ according to the flesh:” and so I am “not
sent by man” but “by Christ;”619 for if I am sent by Christ, I am not sent by man but by God.
For there is no longer room for the name of man, in Him whom Divinity claims entirely
for itself. And so when he had said that he was sent “not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ,” he rightly added: “And God the Father,” thus showing that he was sent by God the
Father and God the Son; in whom owing to the mystery of the sacred and ineffable generation
there are two Persons (He who begets, and He who is begotten), but there is but one single
Power of God who is the sender. And so in saying that he was sent by God the Father and
God the Son, he shows that the Persons are two in number, but he also teaches that their
Power is One in sending.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>As it is blasphemy to pare away the Divinity of Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that
He is true man.</head>
<p>But he says “by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.” That
renowned and admirable teacher, knowing that our Lord Jesus Christ must be preached as
true man, as well as true God, always declares the glory of the Divine in Him, in such a way
as not to lose hold of the confession of the Incarnation: plainly excluding the phantasm of
Marcion, by a real Incarnation, and the poverty of the Ebionite, by Divinity: lest through
one or other of these wicked blasphemies it might be believed that our Lord Jesus Christ
was either altogether man without God, or God without man. Excellently then did the
Apostle, when declaring that He was sent by God the Son as well as by God the Father, add
at once a confession of the Lord’s Incarnation, by saying: “Who raised Him from the dead:”
clearly teaching that it was a real body of the Incarnate God, which was raised from the
dead: in accordance with this: “And though we have known Christ according to the flesh,”
excellently adding: “Yet now we know Him so no longer.” For he says that he knows this in
Him according to the flesh; viz., that He was raised from the dead; but that he knows Him
no longer according to the flesh inasmuch as when the weakness of the flesh is at an end,
he knows that He exists in the Power of God only. Surely he is a faithful and satisfactory
witness of our Lord’s Divinity which had to be proclaimed, who at his first call was smitten
from heaven itself, and did not merely believe in his heart the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who was raised from the dead, but actually established its truth by the evidence of his bodily
eyes.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>He shows from the appearance of Christ vouchsafed to the Apostle when persecuting the
Church, the existence of both natures in Him.</head>
<p>Wherefore also, when arguing before King Agrippa and others of the world’s judges,
he speaks as follows: “When I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the
chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness
of the sun, shining round about me and all those that were with me. And when we were all
fallen down to the ground, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou Me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad. And I said, Who art
Thou, Lord? And the Lord said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.”620
You see how truly the Apostle said that he no longer knew according to the flesh one whom
he had seen in such splendour and majesty. For when as he lay prostrate he saw the
splendour of that divine light which he was unable to endure, there followed this voice:
“Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” And when he asked who it might be, the Lord answers
and clearly points out His Personality: “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.”
Now then, you heretic, I ask you, I summon you. Do you believe what the Apostle says of
himself, or do you not believe it? Or if you think that unimportant, do you believe what the
Lord says of Himself or do you not believe it? If you do believe it, there is an end of the
matter: for you cannot help believing what we believe. For we, like the Apostle, even if we
have known Christ according to the flesh, yet know Him so no longer. We do not heap insults
on Christ. We do not separate the flesh from the Divinity; and all that is in Christ we believe
is in God. If then you believe the same that we believe you must acknowledge the same
mysteries of the faith. But if you differ from us, if you refuse to believe the Churches, the
Apostle, aye and God’s own testimony about Himself, show us in this vision which the
Apostle saw, how much is flesh, and how much God. For I cannot here separate one from
the other. I see the ineffable light, I see the inexpressible splendour, I see the radiance that
human weakness cannot endure, and beyond what mortal eyes can bear, the glory of God
shining with inconceivable light.621 What room is there here for division and separation?
In the voice we hear Jesus, in the majesty we see God. How can we help believing that in
one and the same (Personal) substance God and Jesus exist. But I should like to have a few
more words with you on this subject. Tell me, I pray you, if there appeared to you in your
present persecution of the Catholic faith that same vision which then appeared to the Apostle
in his ignorance, if when you were not expecting it and were off your guard, that radiance

shone round about you, and the glory of that boundless light smote you in your terror and
confusion, and you lay prostrate in darkness of body and soul; which the unlimited and indescribable
terror of your heart increased,622—tell me, I intreat you; When the dread of
immediate death was pressing on you, and the terror of the glory that threatened you from
above, weighed you down, and you heard as well in your bewilderment of mind those words
which your sin so well deserves: “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” and to your inquiry
who it was the answer was given from heaven: “I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,”
what would you say? “I do not know, I do not yet fully believe. I want to think over
it with myself a little longer, who I think that Thou art, who speakest from heaven, who
overwhelmest me with the brightness of Thy Divinity: whose voice I hear and whose
splendour I cannot bear. I must consider of this matter, whether I ought to believe Thee or
not: whether Thou art Christ or God. If Thou art God alone whether it is in Christ. If Thou
art Christ alone, whether it is in God. I want this distinction to be carefully observed, and
thoroughly considered what we should believe that Thou art, and what we should judge
Thee to be. For I don’t want any of my offices to be wasted. As if I were to regard Thee as a
man, and yet pay to Thee some Divine honours.” If then you were lying on the ground, as
the Apostle Paul was then lying, and overwhelmed with the brightness of the Divine light,
were at your last gasp, perhaps you would say this, and prate with all this silly chattering.
But what shall we make of the fact that another course commended itself to the Apostle;
and when he had fallen down, trembling and half dead, he did not think that he ought any
longer to conceal his belief, or to deliberate; it was enough for him that he was taught by
inexpressible arguments to know that He whom he had ignorantly fancied to be a man, was
God. He did not conceal his belief, he made no delay. He did not any longer protract his
erroneous ideas by deliberating and disbelieving, but as soon as he heard from heaven the
name of Jesus his Lord, he replied in a voice, subdued like that of a servant, tremulous like
that of one scourged, and full of fervour like that of one converted, “What shall I do, Lord?”
And so at once for his ready and earnest faith, it was granted to him that he should never
be without His presence whom he had faithfully believed: and that He, to whom he had
passed in heart, should Himself pass into his heart: as the Apostle himself says of himself:
“Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me?”623</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>He shows once more by other passages of the Apostle that Christ is God.</head>
<p>I want you to tell me, you heretic, whether in this passage He who, as the Apostle tells
us, speaks in him, is man or God. If He is man, how can another’s body speak in his heart?
If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only
God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there
is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and
God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God. No division
or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, pious, and sound
confession to be made; viz., to adore, love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to
understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God
and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the
Apostle says to the Corinthians: “For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat
of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath
done, whether it be good or evil.”624 But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he
says: “We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith
the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”625 You see
then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without
any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether
inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because
the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of
Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that
some will be judged by Christ and others by God. But this is foolish and wild, and madder
than a madman’s utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe,
acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love your
salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged.
For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ,
and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you
think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before
the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the
judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God,
<note type="footnote">624 2 Cor. v. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">625 Rom. xiv. 10, 11.</note>

<pb n="1439"/>
there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the Father. “For the Father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the
Son as they honour the Father.”626 For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also.
“Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath
the Father also.”627 And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable,
and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without
the Father, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of
God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible for a man to have
the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says:
“But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But
if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.”628 And again: “Who shall lay
anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?
It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.”629 You see then now, even against
your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of
Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ. Choose then which
you will—for one of the two must happen—either acknowledge in faith that Christ is God,
or admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>When confessing the Divinity of Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of
the cross.</head>
<p>But let us see what else follows. In writing to the church of Corinth, he whom we spoke
of above, the instructor of all the churches viz. Paul, speaks thus: “The Jews,” says he, “seek
signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumblingblock,
to the Gentiles foolishness: but to them that are saved, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
the power of God and the wisdom of God.”630 O most powerful teacher of the faith, who
even in this passage, when teaching the Church thought it not enough to speak of Christ as
God without adding that He was crucified on purpose that for the sake of the open and
solid teaching of the faith he might proclaim Him, whom he called the crucified, to be the
wisdom of God. He then employed no subtilty or circumlocution, nor did he when he
preached the gospel of the Lord blush at the mention of the cross of Christ. And though it
was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles to hear of God as born,
God in bodily form, God suffering, God crucified, yet he did not weaken the force of his
pious utterance because of the wickedness of the offence of the Jews: nor did he lessen the
vigour of his faith because of the unbelief and the foolishness of others: but openly, persistently,
and boldly proclaimed that He, whom a mother631 had borne, whom men had slain,
the spear had pierced, the cross had stretched—was “the power and wisdom of God, to the
Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness.” But still that which was to some
a stumbling-block and foolishness, was to others the power and wisdom of God. For as the
persons differed, so was there a difference of their thoughts: and what a man who was void
of sound understanding, and incapable of true good, foolishly denied in unbelief, that a wise
faith could feel in its inmost soul to be holy and life giving.</p>

<head>How the Apostle’s preaching was rejected by Jews and Gentiles because it confessed that the
crucified Christ was God.</head>
<p>Tell me then, you heretic, you enemy of all men, but of yourself above all—to whom
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is an offence as with the Jews, and foolishness as with the
Gentiles, you who reject the mysteries of true salvation, with the stumbling of the former,
and are foolish with the stubbornness of the others, why was the preaching of the Apostle
Paul foolishness to the pagans, and a stumbling-block to the Jews? Surely it would never
have offended men, if he had taught that Christ was, as you maintain He is, a mere man?
For who would think that His birth, passion, cross, and death were incredible or a difficulty?
Or what would there have been novel or strange about the preaching of Paul, if he had said
that a merely human Christ suffered that which human nature daily endures among men
everywhere? But it was surely this that the foolishness of the Gentiles could not receive, and
the unbelief of the Jews rejected; viz., that the Apostle declared that Christ whom they, like
you, fancied to be a mere man, was God. This it certainly was which the thoughts of these
wicked men rejected, which the ears of the faithless could not endure; viz., that the birth of
God should be proclaimed in the man Jesus Christ, that the passion of God should be asserted,
and the cross of God proclaimed. This it was which was a difficulty: this was what was incredible;
for that was incredible to the hearing of men, which had never been heard of as
happening to the Divine nature. And so you are quite secure, with such an announcement
and teaching as yours, that your preaching will never be either foolishness to the Gentiles
or a stumbling-block to the Jews. You will never be crucified with Peter by Jews and Gentiles,
nor stoned with James, nor beheaded with Paul. For there is nothing in your preaching to
offend them. You maintain that a mere man was born, a mere man suffered. You need not
be afraid of their troubling you with persecution, for you are helping them by your preaching.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>How the apostle maintains that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</head>
<p>But let us see something more on the subject. Christ then, according to the Apostle, is
the power of God and the wisdom of God. What have you to say to this? How can you get
out of it? There is no place for you to escape and fly to. Christ is the wisdom of God and the
power of God. He, I say, whom the Jews attacked, the Gentiles mocked, whom you yourself
together with them are persecuting,—He, I say, who is foolishness to the heathen, and a
stumbling-block to the Jews, and both to you, He, I say, is the power of God and the wisdom
of God. What is there that you can do? Shut your ears, forsooth, so as not to hear? This the
Jews did also when the Apostle was preaching. Do what you will, Christ is in heaven, and
in God, and with Him, and in Him in the heavens above in whom also He was here below:
you can no longer persecute Him with the Jews. But you do the one thing that you can. You
persecute Him in the faith, you persecute Him in the church, you persecute Him with the
arms of a wicked belief, you persecute Him with the sword of false doctrine. Perhaps you
do rather more than the Jews of old did. You now persecute Christ, after ever those who
did persecute Him, have believed. But perhaps you think that the sin is less because you can
no longer lay hands on Him. No less grievous, I tell you, no less grievous to Him is that
persecution, in which sinful men persecute Him in the persons of His followers. But the
mention of the Lord’s cross offends you. It always offended the Jews as well. You shudder
at hearing that God suffered: the Gentiles in their error mocked at this also. I ask you then,
in what point do you differ from them, since you both agree in this frowardness? But for
my part I not only do not water down this preaching of the holy cross, this preaching of the
Lord’s passion, but as far as my wishes and powers go I emphasise it. For I will declare that
He who was crucified is not only the power and wisdom of God, than which there is nothing
greater, but actually Lord of absolute Divinity and glory. And this the rather, because this
assertion of mine is the doctrine of God, as the Apostle says: “We speak wisdom among
them that are perfect: but the wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world who
are brought to nought: but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God
ordained before the world, unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world knew:
for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is
written: that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man,
what God hath prepared for them that love Him.”632 You see what great matters the Apostle’s
discourse comprises in how small a compass. He says that he speaks wisdom, but a wisdom
which only those that are perfect can know, and which the prudent of this world cannot
know. For he says that this is the wisdom of God, which is hidden in a Divine mystery, and
<note type="footnote">632 1 Cor. i. 6–9.</note>

<pb n="1443"/>
predestined before all worlds for the glory of the saints: and that therefore it is only known
to those who savour of God; while the princes of this world are utterly ignorant of it. But
he adds the reason, to establish both points that he had mentioned, saying: “For if they had
known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. But it is written, that eye hath
not seen, nor ear hath heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what God hath
prepared for them that love Him.” You see then how the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery,
and predestined before all worlds, was unknown to those who crucified the Lord of glory,
and known by those who received it. And well does he say that the wisdom of God was
hidden in a mystery, for never yet could the eye of any man see, or the ear hear, or the heart
imagine this; viz., that the Lord of glory should be born of a virgin and come in the flesh,
and suffer all kinds of punishment, and shameful passion. But with regard to these gifts of
God, as there is no one who—since they were hidden in a mystery—could ever of himself
understand them, so blessed is he who has grasped them when they are revealed. Thus all
who have failed to grasp them must be reckoned among the princes of this world, and those
who have grasped them among God’s wise ones. He then does not grasp it who denies God
born in the flesh; therefore you also do not grasp it, as you deny this. But do what you will,
deny as impiously as you like, we the rather believe the Apostle. But why should I say the
Apostle? the rather do we believe God. For through the Apostle we believe Him, whom we
know to have spoken by the Apostle. The Divine word says that the Lord of glory was crucified
by the princes of the world. You deny it. They also who crucified Him denied that it
was God whom they were crucifying. They then who confess Him have their portion with
the Apostle who confessed Him. You are sure to have your lot with His persecutors. What
is there then that can be replied to this? The Apostle says that the Lord of glory was crucified.
Alter this if you can. Separate now, if you please, Jesus from God. At least you cannot deny
that Christ was crucified by the Jews. But it was the Lord of glory who was crucified.
Therefore you must either deny that Christ was nailed to the cross, or you must admit that
God was nailed to it.</p>

<head>He supports the same doctrine by proofs from the gospel.</head>
<p>But perhaps it is a difficulty to you that all this time I am chiefly using the witness of
the Apostle Paul alone. He is good enough for me, whom God chose, nor do I blush to call
as the witness to my faith, the man whom God willed to be the teacher of the whole world.
But to yield to your wishes, as perhaps you fancy that I have no other proofs to use, hear
the perfect mystery of man’s salvation and eternal bliss, which Martha proclaims in the
gospel. For what does she say? “Of a truth, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.”633 Learn the true faith from a
woman. Learn the confession of eternal hope. Yet you have a splendid consolation: you
need not blush to be taught the mystery of salvation by her, whose testimony God did not
refuse to accept.</p>

<head>He proves from the renowned confession of the blessed Peter that Christ is God.</head>
<p>But if you prefer the authority of a greater person (although you ought not to slight the
authority of any one of either sex, on whom the confession of the mystery confers weight—for
whatever may be a person’s condition, or however humble his position, yet the value of his
faith is not thereby diminished) let us interrogate no beginner or untaught schoolboy, nor
a woman whose faith might perhaps appear to be but rudimentary; but that greatest of disciples
among disciples, and of teachers among teachers, who presided and ruled over the
Roman Church, and held the chief place634 in the priesthood as he did in the faith. Tell us
then, tell us, we pray, O Peter, thou chief of Apostles, tell us how the Churches ought to
believe in God. For it is right that you should teach us, as you were taught by the Lord, and
that you should open to us the gate, of which you received the key. Shut out all those who
try to overthrow the heavenly house: and those who are endeavouring to enter by secret
holes and unlawful approaches: as it is clear that none can enter the gate of the kingdom
save one to whom the key bestowed on the Churches is revealed by you. Tell us then how
we ought to believe in Jesus Christ and to confess our common Lord. You will surely reply
without hesitation: “Why do you consult me as to the way in which the Lord should be
confessed, when you have before you my own confession of Him? Read the gospel, and you
will not want me myself, when you have got my confession. Nay, you have got me myself
when you have my confession; for though I have no weight apart from my confession, yet
the actual confession adds weight to my person.” Tell us then, O Evangelist, tell us the confession:
tell us the faith of the chief Apostle: did he confess that Jesus was only a man, or
God? did he say that there was nothing but flesh in Him, or did he proclaim Him the Son
of God? When then the Lord Jesus Christ asked whom the disciples believed and confessed
Him to be, Peter, the first of the Apostles, replied—one in the name of all—for the answer
of one was to the same effect as the faith of them all. But it was fitting that he should first
give the answer, that the order of the answer might correspond to the degree of honour:
and that he might outstrip them in confession, as he outstripped them in age. What then
does he say? “Thou art,” he says, “the Christ the Son of the living God.”635 I am obliged,
you heretic, to make use of a plain and simple question to confute you. Tell me, I pray, who
was He, to whom Peter gave that answer? You cannot deny that it was the Christ. I ask then,
what do you call Christ? man or God? Man certainly without any doubt: for hence springs
the whole of your heresy, because you deny that Christ is the Son of God. And so too you
say that Mary is Christotocos, but not Theotocos, because she was the mother of Christ, not
<note type="footnote">634 Principatus.</note>
<note type="footnote">635 S. Matt. xvi. 16.</note>

<pb n="1446"/>
of God. Therefore you maintain, that Christ is only a man, and not God, and so that He is
the Son of man not of God. What then does Peter reply to this? “Thou art,” he says, “the
Christ, the Son of the living God.” That Christ whom you declare to be only the Son of man,
he testifies to be the Son of God. Whom would you like us to believe? you or Peter? I imagine
that you are not so shameless as to venture to prefer your own opinion to that of the first
of the Apostles. And yet what is there that you would not venture on? or how can you help
scorning the Apostle, if you can deny God? “Thou art then,” he says, “the Christ, the Son
of the living God.” Is there anything puzzling or obscure in this? It is nothing but a plain
and open confession: he proclaims Christ to be the Son of God. Perhaps you will deny that
the words were spoken: but the Evangelist testifies that they were. Or do you say that the
Apostle told a lie? But it is an awful lie to accuse an Apostle of lying. Or perhaps you will
maintain that the words were spoken of some other Christ? But this is a novel kind of
monstrous fabrication. What then is left for you? One thing indeed; viz., that since what is
written is read, and what is read is true, you should finally be driven by force and compulsion
(as you cannot assert its falsehood) to desist from impugning its truth.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>The confession of the blessed Peter receives a testimony to its truth from Christ Himself.</head>
<p>But still, as I have made use of the testimony of the chief Apostle, in which he openly
confessed the Lord Jesus Christ as God, let us see how He whom he confessed approved of
his confession; for of far more value than the Apostle’s words is the fact that God Himself
commended his utterance. When then the Apostle said: “Thou art the Christ the Son of the
living God,” what was the answer of our Lord and Saviour? “Blessed art thou,” said He,
“Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but the Spirit of My
Father which is in heaven.” If you do not like to use the testimony of the Apostle use that
of God. For by commending what was said God added His own authority to the Apostle’s
utterance, so that although the utterance came from the lips of the Apostle, yet God who
approved of it made it His own. “Blessed art thou,” said He, “Simon Barjonah, for flesh and
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven.” Thus
in the words of the Apostle you have the testimony of the Holy Spirit and of the Son who
was present and of God the Father. What more can you want, or what comes up to this?
The Son commended: the Father was present: the Holy Ghost revealed. The utterance of
the Apostle thus gives the testimony of the entire Godhead: for this utterance must necessarily
have the authority of Him from whose prompting it proceeds. “Blessed then art thou,”
said He, “Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but the Spirit
of My Father which is in heaven.” If then flesh and blood did not reveal this to Peter or inspire
him, you must at last see who inspires you. If the Spirit of God taught him who confessed
that Christ was God, you see how you are taught by the spirit of the devil if you can deny
it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>How the confession of the blessed Peter is the faith of the whole Church.</head>
<p>But what are the other words which follow that saying of the Lord’s, with which He
commends Peter? “And I,” said He, “say unto thee, that thou art Peter and upon this rock
I will build My Church.” Do you see how the saying of Peter is the faith of the Church? He
then must of course be outside the Church, who does not hold the faith of the Church. “And
to thee,” saith the Lord, “I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” This faith deserved
heaven: this faith received the keys of the heavenly kingdom. See what awaits you. You
cannot enter the gate to which this key belongs, if you have denied the faith of this key. “And
the gate,” He adds, “of hell shall not prevail against thee.” The gates of hell are the belief or
rather the misbelief of heretics. For widely as hell is separated from heaven, so widely is he
who denies from him who confessed that Christ is God. “Whatsoever,” He proceeds, “thou
shalt bind on earth, shalt be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth,
shalt be loosed also in heaven.” The perfect faith of the Apostle somehow is given the power
of Deity, that what it should bind or loose on earth, might be bound or loosed in heaven.
For you then, who come against the Apostle’s faith, as you see that already you are bound
on earth, it only remains that you should know that you are bound also in heaven. But it
would take too long to go into details which are so numerous as to make a long and wearisome
story, even if they are related with brevity and conciseness.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<head>St. Thomas also confessed the same faith as Peter after the Lord’s resurrection.</head>
<p>But I want still to add one more testimony from an Apostle for you: that you may see
how what followed after the passion corresponded with what went before it. When then the
Lord appeared in the midst of His disciples when the doors were shut, and wished to make
clear to the Apostles the reality of His body, when the Apostle Thomas felt His flesh and
handled His side and examined His wounds—what was it that he declared, when he was
convinced of the reality of the body shown to him? “My Lord,” he said, “and my God.”636
Did he say what you say, that it was a man and not God? Christ and not Divinity? He surely
touched the body of his Lord and answered that He was God. Did he make any separation
between man and God? or did he call that flesh Theotocos, to use your expression, i.e., that
which received Divinity? or did he, after the fashion of your blasphemy, declare that He
whom he touched was to be honoured not for His own sake, but for the sake of Him whom
He had received into Himself? But perhaps God’s Apostle knew nothing of that subtle separation
of yours, and had no experience of the fine distinctions of your judgment, as he was
a rude countryman, ignorant of the dialectic art, and of the method of philosophic disputation;
for whom the Lord’s teaching was amply sufficient, and as he was one who knew
nothing whatever except what he learnt from the instruction of the Lord! And so his words
contain heavenly doctrine; his faith is a Divine lesson. He had never learnt to separate, as
you do, the Lord from His body: and had no idea how to rend God asunder from Himself.
He was holy, straightforward, upright: filled with practical innocence, unalloyed faith, and
pure knowledge: having a simple understanding joined with prudence, a wisdom entirely
free from all evil, together with perfect simplicity: ignorant of any corruption, and free from
all heretical perversity, and as one who had experienced in himself the force of the Divine
lesson, he held fast everything which he had learnt. And so he—countryman and ignorant
fellow as you fancy him—shuts you up with a brief answer, and destroys your position with
a few words of his. What then did the Apostle Thomas touch when he drew near to handle
his God? Certainly it was Christ without any doubt. But what did he exclaim? “My Lord,”
he said, “and my God.” Now, if you can, separate Christ from God, and change this saying,
if you are able to. Make use of all dialectic art—all the prudence of this world, and that
foolish wisdom which consists in wordy subtlety. Turn yourself about in every direction,
and draw in your horns. Do whatever you can with ingenuity and art. Say what you like,
and do what you like; you cannot possibly get out of this without confessing that what the
Apostle touched was God. And indeed, if the thing can possibly be done, perhaps you will
want to alter the statement of the gospel story, so that we may not read that the Apostle
<note type="footnote">636 S. John xx. 28.</note>

<pb n="1450"/>
Thomas touched the body of the Lord, or that he called Christ Lord and God. But it is absolutely
impossible to alter what is written in the gospel of God. For “heaven and earth shall
pass away, but the words” of God “shall not pass away.”637 For lo, even now he who then
bore his witness, the Apostle Thomas, proclaims to you: “Jesus whom I touched is God. It
is God whose limbs I handled. I did not feel what was incorporeal, not handle what was intangible:
I touched not a Spirit with my hand, so that it might be believed that I said of it
alone ‘It is God.’ For ‘a spirit,’ as my Lord Himself said, ‘hath not flesh and bones.’638 I
touched the body of my Lord. I handled flesh and bones. I put my fingers into the prints of
the wounds: and I declared of Christ my Lord, whom I had handled: ‘My Lord and my God.’
For I know not how to make a separation between Christ and God, and I cannot insert
blasphemous distinctions between Jesus and God, or rend my Lord asunder from Himself.
Away from me, whoever is of a different opinion, and whoever says anything different. I
know not that Christ is other than God. This faith I held together with my fellow apostles:
this I delivered to the Churches: this I preached to the Gentiles: this I proclaim to thee also,
Christ is God, Christ is God. A sound mind imagines nothing else: a sound faith says nothing
else. The Deity cannot be parted from Itself. And since whatever is Christ is God, there can
be found in God none other but God.”</p>

<head>He brings forward the witness of God the Father to the Divinity of the Son.</head>
<p>What do you say now, you heretic? Are these evidences of the faith, aye and of all your
unbelief, enough for you: or would you like some more to be added to them? but what can
be added after Prophets and Apostles? unless perhaps—as the Jews once demanded—you
too might ask for a sign to be given you from heaven? But if you ask this, we must give you
the same answer which was formerly given to them: “An evil and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign. And no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah.”639
And indeed this sign would be enough for you as for the Jews who crucified Him, that you
might be taught to believe in the Lord God by this alone, through which even those who
had persecuted Him, came to believe. But as we have mentioned a sign from heaven, I will
show you a sign from heaven: and one of such a character that even the devils have never
gainsaid it: while, constrained by the demands of truth, though they saw Jesus in bodily
form, they yet cried out that He was God, as indeed He was. What then does the Evangelist
say of the Lord Jesus Christ? “When He was baptized,” he says, “straightway He went up
out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit descending
like a dove, and coming upon Him. And behold, a voice from heaven, saying: This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”640 What do you say to this, you heretic? Do you
dislike the words spoken, or the Person of the Speaker? The meaning of the utterance at any
rate needs no explanation: nor does the worth of the Speaker need the commendation of
words. It is God the Father who spoke. What He said is clear enough. Surely you cannot
make so shameless and blasphemous an assertion as to say that God the Father is not to be
believed concerning the only begotten Son of God? “This,” He then says, “is My beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased.” But perhaps you will try to maintain that this is madness,
and that this was said of the Word and not of Christ. Tell me then who was it who was
baptized? The Word or Christ? Flesh or Spirit? You cannot possibly deny that it was Christ.
That man then, born of man and of God, conceived by the descent of the Holy Spirit upon
the Virgin, and by the overshadowing of the Power of the Most High, and thus the Son of
man and of God, He it was, as you cannot deny, who was baptized. If then it was He who
was baptized, it was He also who was named, for certainly the Person who was baptized was
the one named. “This,” said He, “is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Could
anything be said with greater significance or clearness? Christ was baptized. Christ went up
out of the water. When Christ was baptized the heavens were opened. For Christ’s sake the
dove descended upon Christ, the Holy Spirit was present in a bodily form. The Father ad-
<note type="footnote">639 S. Matt. xvi. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">640 S. Matt. iii. 16, 17.</note>

<pb n="1452"/>
dressed Christ. If you venture to deny that this was spoken of Christ, the only thing is for
you to maintain that Christ was not baptized, that the Spirit did not descend, and that the
Father did not speak. But the truth itself is urgent and weighs you down so that even if you
will not confess it, yet you cannot deny it. For what says the Evangelist? “When He was
baptized, straightway He went up out of the water.” Who was baptized? Most certainly
Christ. “And behold,” he says, “the heavens were opened to Him.” To where, forsooth, save
to Him who was baptized? Most certainly to Christ. “And He saw the Spirit of God descending
like a dove and coming upon Him.” Who saw? Christ indeed. Upon whom did It descend?
Most certainly upon Christ. “And a voice came from heaven. saying”—of whom? Of Christ
indeed: for what follows? “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” In order
that it might be made clear on whose account all this happened, there followed the voice,
saying: “This is My beloved Son,” as if to say: This is He on whose account all this took place.
For this is My Son: on His account the heavens were opened: on His account My Spirit
came: on His account My voice was heard. For this is My Son. In saying then “This is My
Son” whom did He so designate? Certainly Him whom the dove touched. And whom did
the dove touch? Christ indeed. Therefore Christ is the Son of God. My promise is fulfilled,
I fancy. Do you see then now, O heretic, a sign given you from heaven; and not one only,
but many and special ones? For there is one in the opening of heaven, another in the descent
of the Spirit, a third in the voice of the Father. All of which most clearly show that Christ is
God, for the laying open of the heavens indicates that He is God, and the descent of the
Holy Spirit upon Him supports His Divinity, and the address of the Father confirms it. For
heaven would not have been opened except in honour of its Lord: nor would the Holy Ghost
have descended in a bodily form except upon the Son of God: nor would the Father have
declared Him to be the Son, had he not been truly such; especially with such tokens of a
Divine birth, as not merely to confirm the truth of the right faith, but also to exclude the
wickedness of guilty and erroneous belief. For when the Father had expressly and pointedly
said with the inexpressible majesty of a Divine utterance, “This is My Son,” He added also
what follows—I mean, “My beloved, in whom I am well pleased.” As He had already declared
Him by the prophet to be God the Mighty and God the Great, so when He says here, “My
beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,” He adds further to the name of His own Son the
title also of His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased: that the addition of the titles might
denote the special properties of the Divine nature; and that that might specially redound to
the glory of the Son of God, which had never happened to any man. And so just as in the
case of our Lord Jesus Christ these special and unique things happened; viz., that the heavens
were opened, that in the sight of all God the Father touched Him in a sort of way, through
the coming and presence of the dove, and pointed almost with His finger to Him saying,
“This is My Son;” so this too is special and unique in His case; viz., that He is specially beloved,
and is specially named as well-pleasing to the Father, in order that these special ac-

<pb n="1453"/>
companiments might mark the special import of His nature, and that the special character
of His names might support the special position of the only begotten Son, which the honour
of the signs previously given had already confirmed. But here comes the end of this book.
For this saying of God the Father can neither be added to, nor equalled by any words of
men. For us God the Father Himself is a sufficiently satisfactory witness concerning our
Lord Jesus Christ, when He says “This is My Son.” If you think that it is possible for these
utterances of God the Father to be gainsaid, then you are forced to contradict Him, who by
the clearest possible announcement caused Him to be acknowledged as His Son by the whole
world.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>That Christ was before the Incarnation God from everlasting.</head>
<p>As we have finished three books with the most certain and the most valuable witnesses,
whose truth is substantiated not only by human but also by Divine evidences, they would
abundantly suffice to prove our case by Divine authority, especially as the Divine authority
of the case itself would be enough for this. But still as the whole mass of the sacred Scriptures
is full of these evidences, and where there are so many witnesses, there are so many opinions
to be urged—nay where Holy Scripture itself gives its witness so to speak with one Divine
mouth—we have thought it well to add some others still, not from any need of confirmation,
but because of the supply of material at our disposal; so that anything which might be unnecessary
for purposes of defence, might be useful by way of ornamentation. Therefore since
in the earlier books we proved the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ while He was in the
flesh by the evidence not only of prophets and apostles, but of evangelists and angels as well,
let us now show that He who was born in the flesh was God even before His Incarnation;
that you may understand by the harmony and concord of the evidences from the sacred
Scriptures, that you ought to believe that at His birth in the body He was both God and
man, who before His birth was only God, and that He who after He had been brought forth
by the Virgin in the body was God, was before His birth from the Virgin, God the Word.
Learn then first of all from the Apostle the teacher of the whole world, that He who is without
beginning, God, the Son of God, became the Son of man at the end of the world, i.e., in the
fulness of the times. For he says: “But when the fulness of the times was come, God sent His
Son, made of a woman, made under the law.”641 Tell me then, before the Lord Jesus Christ
was born of His mother Mary, had God a Son or had He not? You cannot deny that He had,
for never yet was there either a son without a father, or a father without a son: because as a
son is so called with reference to a father, so is a father so named with reference to a son.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>He infers from what he has said that the Virgin Mary gave birth to a Son who had pre-existed
and was greater than she herself was.</head>
<p>You see then that when the Apostle says that God sent His Son, it was His own Son to
use the actual words of the Apostle, “His own Son” that God sent. For, since He sent His
own Son, it was not some one else’s Son that He sent, nor could He send Him at all if He
who was sent had no existence. He sent then, he says, “His own Son, made of a woman.”
Therefore because He sent Him, He sent one who existed: and because He sent His own, it
certainly was not another’s but His own whom He sent. What then becomes of that argument
of yours drawn from this world’s subtleties? No one ever yet gave birth to one who had
already existed before. For had not the Lord a pre-existence before Mary? Was not the Son
of God existent before the daughter of man? In a word did not God Himself exist before
man—since certainly there is no man who is not from God. You see then that I do not merely
say that Mary gave birth to one who had existed before her, not only, I say, one who had
existed before her, but one who was the author of her being, and that in giving birth to her
Creator, she became the mother of Him who gave her being: because it was as simple for
God to bring about birth for Himself as for man and as easy for Him to arrange that He
Himself should be born of mankind, as that a man should be born. For the power of God
is not limited in regard to His own Person, as if what was allowable to Him in the case of
all others, was not allowable in His own case, and as if He who in the Divine nature could
do all things as God, was yet unable in His own Person to become God in man. Setting aside
then and rejecting your foolish and feeble and dull arguments from earthly things, we ought
merely to put credence in straightforward evidence and the naked truth, and to adapt our
faith to those witnesses of God alone, whom God sent, and in whose person He Himself, so
to speak, preached. For it is right to believe Him in a matter concerning knowledge of
Himself, as everything that we know of Him comes from Him Himself, for God could not
possibly be known of men, unless He Himself gave us the knowledge of Himself. And so it
is right that we should believe everything of Him that we know, from whom comes everything
that we know, for if we do not believe Him from whom our knowledge comes, the result
will be that we shall know nothing at all, since we refuse to believe Him, through whom our
knowledge comes.</p>

<head>He proves from the Epistle to the Romans the eternal Divinity of Christ.</head>
<p>And so as it is clear from the above testimony that God sent His own Son, and that He
who was ever the Son of God became the Son of man, let us see whether the same Apostle
gives any other testimony of the same sort elsewhere, that the truth which is already clear
enough in itself, may be rendered still more clear by the light of a twofold testimony. So
then the same Apostle says: “God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.”642 You
see that the Apostle certainly did not use these words by chance or at random, as he repeated
what he had already said once—for indeed there could not be found in him chance or want
of consideration as the fulness of Divine counsel and speech had taken up its abode in him.
What then does he say? “God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.” He says the
same thing again and repeats it, saying, “God sent His own Son.” Oh renowned and excellent
teacher! for knowing that in this is contained the whole mystery643 of the Catholic faith, in
order that it might be believed that the Lord was born in the flesh and that the Son of God
was sent into this world, again and again he makes the same proclamation saying, “God
sent His own Son.” Nor need we wonder that he who was specially sent to preach the coming
of God, made this announcement, since even before the law, the giver of the law himself
proclaimed it, saying: “I beseech Thee, O Lord, provide another whom Thou mayest send,”
or as it stands still more clearly in the Hebrew text: “I beseech Thee, O Lord, send whom
Thou wilt send.”644 It is clear that the holy prophet, feeling in himself a yearning for the
whole human race, prayed as it were with the voices of all mankind to God the Father that
He would send as speedily as possible Him who was to be sent by the Father for the redemption
and salvation of all men, when he said, “I beseech Thee, O Lord, send whom Thou wilt
send.” “God,” he therefore says, “sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.” Full well,
when he says that He was sent in the flesh, does he exclude for Him sin of the flesh: for he
says “God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin,” in order that we may know
that though the flesh was truly taken, yet there was no true sin, and that, as far as the body
is concerned, we should understand that there was reality; as far as sin is concerned, only
the likeness of sin. For though all flesh is sinful, yet He had flesh without sin, and had in
Himself the likeness of sinful flesh, while He was in the flesh but He was free from what was

<head>He brings forward other testimonies to the same view.</head>
<p>If you would know how admirably the Apostle preached this, hear how this utterance
was put into his mouth; as if from the mouth of God Himself, as the Lord says: “For God
sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through
Him.”645 For lo, as you see, the Lord Himself affirms that He was sent by God the Father
to save mankind. But if you think that it ought to be shown still more clearly, what Son God
sent to save men,—though God’s own and only begotten can only be one, and when God
is said to have sent His Son, He is certainly shown to have sent His only begotten Son,—yet
hear the prophet David pointing out with the utmost clearness Him who was sent for the
salvation of Men. “He sent,” said he, “His Word and healed them.”646 Can you twist this so
as to refer it to the flesh as if you could say that a mere man was sent by God to heal mankind?
You certainly cannot, for the prophet David and all the holy Scriptures would cry out against
you, saying, “He sent His Word and healed them.” You see then, that the Word was sent to
heal men, for though healing was given through Christ, yet the Word of God was in Christ,
and healed all things through Christ: and so since Christ and the Word were united in the
mystery of the Incarnation, Christ and the Word of God became one Son of God in either
substance. And when the Apostle John was anxious to state this clearly, he said “God sent
His Son to be the Saviour of the world.”647 Do you see how he joined together God and
man in an union that cannot be severed? For Christ who was born of Mary is without the
slightest doubt called Saviour, as it is said, “For to you is born this day a Saviour, which is
Christ the Lord.”648 But here he calls the very Word of God, which was sent, a Saviour,
saying: “God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>How in virtue of the hypostatic union of the two natures in Christ the Word is rightly termed
the Saviour, or incarnate man, and the Son of God.</head>
<p>And so it is clear that through the mystery of the Word of God joined to man, the Word,
which was sent to save men, can be termed Saviour, and the Saviour, who was born in the
flesh, can through union with the Word be called the Son of God; and so through the indifferent
use of either title, since God is joined to man, whatever is God and man, can be termed
altogether God.649 And so the same Apostle well adds the words: “Whoever believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and the love of God is perfected in him.”650
He tells us that he believes, and declares that he is filled with divine love, who believes that
Jesus is the Son of God. But he testifies that the Word of God is the Son of God, and thus
means us fully to understand that the only begotten Word of God, and Jesus Christ the Son
of God are one and the same Person. But do you want to be told more fully that,—though
Christ according to the flesh was truly born as man of man,—yet in virtue of the ineffable
unity of the mystery, by which man was joined to God, there is no separation between Christ
and the Word? Hear the gospel of the Lord, or rather hear the Lord Himself saying of
Himself:651 “This,” says He, “is life eternal, that they may know Thee, the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”652 You heard above that the Word of God was sent
to heal mankind: here you are told that He who was sent is Jesus Christ. Separate this, if you
can,—though you see that so great is the unity of Christ and the Word, that it was not merely
that Christ was united with the Word, but that in virtue of the actual unity [of Person] Christ
may even be said to be the Word.</p>
<note type="footnote">649 Cf. Hooker Eccl: Polity., Book V. c. liii. § 4. “A kind of mutual commutation there is whereby those concrete
names, God and man, when we speak of Christ, do take interchangeably one another’s room, so that for truth
of speech it skilleth not whether we say that the Son of God hath created the world, and the Son of man by His
death hath saved it, or else that the Son of man did create, and the Son of God die to save the world. Howbeit
as oft as we attribute to God what the manhood of Christ claimeth, or to man what His Deity hath right unto,
we understand by the name of God and the name of man neither the one nor the other nature, but the whole
person of Christ, in whom both natures are.” The technical phrase by which this interchange of names is described
is the Communicatio idiomatum, and in Greek ἀντίδοσις. Cf. Pearson on the Creed, Art. IV. c. i.</note>

<head>That there is in Christ but one Hypostasis (i.e., Personal self).</head>
<p>But perhaps you think it a trifle to make this clear: not because it fails in clearness, but
because the obscurity of unbelief always causes obscurity even in what is clear. Hear then
how the Apostle sums up in a few words this whole mystery of the Lord’s unity [of Person].
“Our one Lord Jesus Christ,” he says, “by whom are all things.”653 O good Jesus, what weight
there is in Thy words! For Thine they are, when spoken of Thee by Thine own. See how
much is embraced in the few words of this saying of the Apostle’s. “One Lord,” says he,
“Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.” Did he make use of any circumlocution in order to
proclaim the truth of this great mystery?654 or did he make a long story of that which he
wanted us to grasp? “Our one Lord,” he says, “Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.” In a
plain and short phrase he taught the secret of this great mystery, through this confidence
by which he realized that in what refers to God his statements had no need of lengthened
arguments, and that the Divinity added faith to his utterances. For the demonstration of
facts is enough to confirm what is said, whenever the proof rests on the authority of the
speaker. There is then, he says, “one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.” Notice how
you read the same thing of the Word of the Father, which you read of Christ. For the gospel
tells us that “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.”655
The Apostle says, “By Christ are all things:” the gospel says, “By the Word are all things.”
Do these sacred utterances contradict each other? Most certainly not. But by Christ, by
whom the Apostle said that all things were created, and by the Word, by whom the Evangelist
relates that all things were made, we are meant to understand one and the same Person.
Hear, I tell you, what the Word of God, Himself God, has said of Himself. “No man,” he
saith, “hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of
man, who is in heaven.”656 And again He says: “If ye shall see the Son of man ascending
where He was before.”657 He said that the Son of man was in heaven: He asserted that the
Son of man had come down from heaven. What does it mean? Why are you muttering?
Deny it, if you can. But do you ask the reason of what is said? However I do not give it you.
God has said this. God has spoken this to me: His Word is the best reason. I get rid of arguments
and discussions. The Person of the Speaker alone is enough to make me believe. I
may not debate about the trustworthiness of what is said, nor discuss it. Why should I

question whether what God has said is true, since I ought not to doubt that what God says
is true. “No man,” He says, “hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from
heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.” Certainly the Word of the Father was ever
in heaven: and how did He assert that the Son of man was ever in heaven? You are then to
understand that He showed that He who was ever the Son of God was also the Son of man:
when He asserted that He, who had but recently appeared as the Son of man, was ever in
heaven. To this points still more that other passage in which He testifies that the same Son
of man; viz., the Word of God who, as He said, came down from heaven, even at the time
when He was speaking on earth, was in heaven. For “no man,” He said, “hath ascended into
heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.” Who,
I pray you, is this who is speaking? Assuredly it is Christ. But where was He at the moment
when He spoke? Assuredly on earth. And how can He assert that He came down from
heaven when He was born, and that He was in heaven when He was speaking, or say that
He is the same Son of man, when certainly no one but God can come down from heaven,
and when He speaks on earth, and certainly cannot be in heaven except through the Infinite
nature of God? Consider then this at last, and note that the Son of man is the same Person
as the Word of God: for He is the Son of man since He is truly born of man, and the Word
of God, since He who speaks on earth abideth ever in heaven. And so when He truly terms
Himself the Son of man, it refers to His human birth, while the fact that He never departs
from heaven, refers to the Infinite character of His Divine nature. And so the Apostle’s
teaching is admirably in accordance with those sacred words: (“for He that descended,” says
He, “is the same that ascended also above all heavens, that He might fill all things,”658) when
He says that He that descended is the same that ascended. But none can descend from
heaven except the Word of God: who certainly “being in the form of God, emptied Himself,
taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion
as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
Cross.”659 Thus the Word of God descended from heaven: but the Son of man ascended.
But He says that the same Person ascended and descended. Thus you see that the Son of
man is the same Person as the Word of God.</p>

<head>He returns to the former subject, in order to show against the Nestorians that those things are
said of the man, which belong to the Divine nature as it were of a Person of Divine nature,
and conversely that those things are said of God, which belong to the human nature as it
were of a Person of human nature, because there is in Christ but one and a single Personal
self.</head>
<p>And so following the guidance of the sacred word we may now say fearlessly and unhesitatingly
that the Son of man came down from heaven, and that the Lord of Glory was crucified:
because in virtue of the mystery of the Incarnation, the Son of God became Son of
man, and the Lord of Glory was crucified in (the nature of) the Son of man.660 What more
is there need of? It would take too long to go into details: for time would fail me, were I to
try to examine and explain everything which could be brought to bear on this subject. For
one who wished to do this would have to study and read the whole Bible. For what is there
which does not bear on this, when all Scripture was written with reference to this? We must
then say—as far as can be said—some things briefly and cursorily, and enumerate rather
than explain them, and sacrifice some to save the rest, as for this reason it would certainly
be well hurriedly to run through some points, lest one should be obliged661 to pass over almost
everything in silence. The Saviour then in the gospel says that “the Son of man is come
to save what was lost.”662 And the Apostle says: “This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
acceptation; that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.”663
But the Evangelist John also says: “He came unto his own, and His own received Him not.”664
You see then that Scripture says in one place that the Son of man, in another Jesus Christ,
in another the Word of God came into the world. And so we must hold that the difference
<note type="footnote">660 See Hooker as above (V. liii. 4) “When the Apostle saith of the Jews that they crucified the Lord of Glory,
and when the Son of man being on earth affirmeth that the Son of man was in heaven at the same instant, there
is in these two speeches that mutual circulation before mentioned. In the one, there is attributed to God or the
Lord of Glory death, whereof Divine nature is not capable; in the other ubiquity unto man which human nature
admitteth not. Therefore by the Lord of Glory we must needs understand the whole person of Christ, who being
Lord of Glory, was indeed crucified, but not in that nature for which he is termed the Lord of Glory. In like
manner by the Son of man the whole person of Christ must necessarily be meant, who being man upon earth,
filled heaven with his glorious presence, but not according to that nature for which the title of man is given
Him.”</note>

is one of title not of fact, and that under the appearance of different names there is but one
Power [or Person]. For though at one time we are told that the Son of man, and at another
that the Son of God came into the world, but one Person is meant under both names.</p>

<head>How this interchange of titles does not interfere with His Divine power.</head>
<p>For certainly when the evangelist says that He came into the world by whom the world
itself was made, and that He was made the Son of man, who is as God the creator of the
world, it makes no difference what particular title is used, as God in all cases is meant. For
His condescension and will do not interfere with His Divinity, since they the rather prove
His Divinity, because whatever He willed came to pass. Therefore also because He willed it,
He came into the world; and because He willed it, He was born a man; and because He
willed it, He was termed the Son of man. For just as there are so many words, so are they
powers belonging to God. The variety of names in Him does not take anything away from
the efficacy of His power. Whatever may be the names given Him, in all cases it is one and
the same Person. Though there may be some variety in the appearance of His titles, yet there
is but a single Divine Person (Majestas) meant by all the names.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>He corroborates this statement by the authority of the old prophets.</head>
<p>But since up to this point we have made use more particularly of the witness, comparatively
new, of evangelists and apostles, now let us bring forward the testimony of the old
prophets, intermingling at times new things with old, that everybody may see that the holy
Scriptures proclaim as it were with one mouth that Christ was to come in the flesh, with a
body of His own complete. And so that far-famed and renowned prophet as richly endowed
with God’s gifts as with his testimony, to whom alone it was given to be sanctified before
His birth,665 Jeremiah, says, “This is our Lord, and there shall no other be accounted of in
comparison with Him. He found out all the way of knowledge and gave it to Jacob His servant
and Israel His beloved. Afterwards He was seen upon earth and conversed with men.”666
“This is,” then, he says, “our God.” You see how the prophet points to God as it were with
his hand, and indicates Him as it were with his finger. “This is,” he says, “our God.” Tell me
then, who was it that the prophet showed by these signs and tokens to be God? Surely it was
not the Father? For what need was there that He should be pointed out, whom all believed
that they knew? For even then the Jews were not ignorant of God, for they were living under
God’s law. But he was clearly aiming at this, that they might come to know the Son of God
as God. And so excellently did the Prophet say that He who had found out all knowledge,
i.e., had given the law, was to be seen upon earth, i.e., was to come in the flesh, in order that,
as the Jews did not doubt that He who had given the law was God, they might recognize
that He who was to come in the flesh was God, especially since they heard that He, in whom
they believed as God the giver of the law, was to be seen among men by taking upon Him
manhood, as He Himself promises His own advent by the prophet: “For I myself that spoke,
behold I am here.”667 “There shall then,” says the Scriptures, “be no other accounted of in
comparison of Him.” Beautifully does the prophet here foresee false teaching, and so exclude
the interpretations of heretical perverseness. “There shall no other be accounted of in comparison
of Him.” For He is alone begotten to be God of God: at whose bidding the completion
of the universe followed: whose will is the beginning of things: whose empire is the fabric
<note type="footnote">665 Cf. Jer. i. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">666 The passage comes not from Jeremiah, but from Baruch (iii. 36–38). It is also quoted as from Jeremiah
by Augustine (c. Faustin. xii. c. 43): and in the LXX. version the book of Baruch is placed among the works of
Jeremiah, e.g., In both the Vatican and Alexandrine mss. they stand in the following order: (1) Jeremiah, (2)
Baruch, (3) Lamentations, (4) the Epistle of Jeremy (Baruch c. vi. in A.V.). The passage which Cassian here
quotes is constantly appealed to by both Greek and Latin Fathers, as a prophecy of the Incarnation. See e.g. S.
Augustine (l.c.) S. Chrysost. “Ecloga” Hom. xxxiv. Rufinus in. Symb. § 5.</note>

of the world: who spake all things, and they came to pass: commanded all things, and they
were created. He then alone it is who spake to the patriarchs, dwelt in the prophets, was
conceived by the Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, appeared in the world, lived among men,
fastened to the wood of the cross the handwriting of our offences, triumphed in Himself,668
slew by His death the powers that were at enmity and hostile to us; and gave to all men belief
in the resurrection, and by the glory of His body put an end to the corruption of man’s flesh.
You see then that all these belong to the Lord Jesus Christ alone: and therefore no other
shall be accounted of in comparison with Him, for He alone is God begotten of God in this
glory and unique blessedness. This then is what the prophet’s teaching was aiming at; viz.,
that He might be known by all men to be the only begotten Son of God the Father, and that
when they heard that no other was accounted of as God in comparison with the Son, they
might confess that there was but one God in the Persons of the Father and the Son. “After
this,” he said, “He was seen upon earth and conversed with men.” You see how plainly this
points to the advent and nativity of the Lord. For surely the Father—of whom we read that
He can only be seen in the Son—was not seen upon earth, nor born in the flesh, nor conversed
with men? Most certainly not. You see then that all this is spoken of the Son of God. For
since the prophet said that God should be seen upon earth, and no other but the Son was
seen upon earth, it is clear that the prophet said this only of Him, of whom facts afterwards
proved that it was spoken. For when He said that God should be seen, He could not say this
truly, except of Him who was indeed afterwards seen. But enough of this. Now let us turn
to another point. “The labour of Egypt,” says the prophet Isaiah, “and the merchandise of
Ethiopia and of the Sabæans, men of stature, shall come over to thee and shall be thy servants.
They shall walk after thee, bound with manacles, and they shall worship thee, and they shall
make supplication to thee: for in thee is God, and there is no God beside thee. For thou art
our God and we knew thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.”669 How wonderfully consistent
the Holy Scriptures always are! For the first mentioned prophet said, “This is our God,” and
this one says, “Thou art our God.” In the one there is the teaching of Divinity, in the other
the confession of men. The one exhibits the character of the Master teaching, the other that
of the people confessing. For consider now the prophet Jeremiah daily teaching, as he does,
in the church, and saying of the Lord Jesus Christ, “This is our God,” what else could the
whole Church reply, as it does, than what the other prophet said to the Lord Jesus, “Thou
art our God.” So that full well could the mention of their past ignorance be joined to their
present acknowledgment, in the words of the people: “Thou art our God, and we knew thee
not.” For well can these who, in times past being taken up with the superstitions of devils

<head>He proves Christ’s Divinity from the blasphemy of Judaizing Jews as well as from the confession
of converts to the faith of Christ.</head>
<p>But if you would like to have this proved to you rather from representatives of the Jews,
consider the Jewish people when after their unhappy ignorance and wicked persecution
they were converted, and acknowledged God here and there, and see whether they could
not rightly say, “Thou art our God, and we knew Thee not.” But I will add something else,
to prove it to you not only from those Jews who confess Him, but also from those who deny
Him. For ask those Jews who still continue in their state of unbelief whether they know or
believe in God. They will certainly confess that they both know and believe in Him. But on
the other hand ask them whether they believe in the Son of God. They will at once deny and
begin to blaspheme against Him. You see then that the Prophet said this of Him of whom
the Jews have always been ignorant, and whom now they know not; and not of Him whom
they imagine that they believe in and confess. And so full well can those, who after having
been in ignorance come out of Judaism to the faith, say, “Thou art our God, and we knew
Thee not.” For rightly do those, who after having been ignorant come to believe, say that
they knew not Him in whom up to this time they have not believed, and whom they strive
not to know. For it is clear that those who after their previous ignorance come to confess
Him, say that formerly they knew Him not, whom up to this time they have ignorantly
denied.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>He returns to the prophecy of Isaiah.</head>
<p>“The labour,” says he, “of Egypt, and the merchandize of Ethiopia, and the Sabæans,
men of stature shall come over to thee.” No one can doubt that in these names of different
nations is signified the coming of the nations who were to believe. But you cannot deny that
the nations have come over to Christ, for since the name of Christianity has arisen, they
have come over to the Lord Jesus Christ not only in faith but actually in name. For since
they are called what they really are, that which was the work of faith becomes the token by
which they are named. “They shall,” he says, “come over to thee and shall be thine: they
shall walk after thee bound with manacles.” As there are chains of coercion, so too there are
chains of love, as the Lord says: “I drew them with chains of love.”670 For indeed great are
these chains, and chains of ineffable love, for those who are bound with them rejoice in their
fetters. Do you want to know whether this is true? Hear how the Apostle Paul exults and
rejoices in his chains, when he says: “I therefore a prisoner in the Lord beseech you.”671
And again: “I beseech thee, whereas thou art such an one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner
also of Jesus Christ.”672 You see how he rejoiced in the dignity of his chains, by the
example of which he actually stirred up others. But there can be no doubt that where there
is single-minded love of the Lord, there is also single-minded delight in chains worn for the
Lord’s sake: as it is written: “But the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one
soul.”673 “And they shall worship thee,” he says, “and shall make supplication to thee: for
in thee is God, and there is no God beside thee.” The Apostle clearly explains the prophet’s
words, when he says that “God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.”674 “In Thee
then,” he says, “is God and there is no God beside thee.” When the prophet says “In Thee
is God,” most admirably does he point not merely to Him who was visible, but to Him who
was in what was visible, distinguishing the indweller from Him in whom He dwelt, by
pointing out the two natures, not by denying the unity (of Person).</p>

<head>How the title of Saviour is given to Christ in one sense, and to men in another.</head>
<p>“Thou,” he says, “art our God, and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.”
Although holy Scripture has already shown by many and clear tokens, who is here spoken
of, yet it has most plainly pointed to the name of Christ by using the name of Saviour: for
surely the Saviour is the same as Christ, as the angel says: “For to you is born this day a Saviour
who is Christ the Lord.”675 For everybody knows that in Hebrew “Jesus” means “Saviour,”
as the angel announced to the holy Virgin Mary, saying: “And thou shalt call His
name Jesus, for He it is that shall save His people from their sins.”676 And that you may not
say that He is termed Saviour in the same sense as the title is given to others (“And the Lord
raised up to them a Saviour, Othniel the Son of Kenaz,”677 and again, “the Lord raised up
to them a Saviour, Ehud the son of Gera”678), he added: “for He it is that shall save His
people from their sins.” But it does not lie in the power of a man to redeem his people from
the captivity of sin,—a thing which is only possible for Him of whom it is said, “Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”679 For the others saved a people not
their own but God’s, and not from their sins, but from their enemies.</p>

<head>He explains who are those in whose person the Prophet Isaiah says: “Thou art our God, and
we knew Thee not.”</head>
<p>“Thou art then,” he says, “our God, and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.”
Who do you imagine chiefly say this; and in whose mouths are such words specially suitable,
Jews or Gentiles? If you say Jews: certainly the Jews did not know Christ, as it is said, “But
Israel hath not known Me, My people have not considered;”680 and, “The world was made
by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him
not.”681 But if you say Gentiles, it is clear that the Gentile world was given over to idols, and
knew not Christ, though it knew not the Father any more; but still if it has now come to
know Him, it is only through Christ. You see then that whether the believing people belong
to the Jews or the Gentiles, in either case they can truly say for themselves: “Thou art our
God; and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.” For the Gentiles who formerly
worshipped idols knew not God; and the Jews who denied the Lord, knew not the Son of
God. And thus both truly say of Christ: “Thou art our God and we knew Thee not.” For
those who did not believe in God were as ignorant of Him as those who denied the Son of
God. If therefore Christ is to be believed in, as the truth declares, as the Deity asserts, as indeed
Christ Himself declares, who is both, why are you miserably trying in your madness
to interpose between God and Christ? Why do you seek to divide His body from the Son
of God, and try to separate God from Himself? You are severing what is one, and dividing
what is joined together. Believe the Word of God concerning God: for you cannot possibly
make a better confession of God’s Divinity than by confessing with your voice that which
God teaches about Himself. For you must know that, as the Prophet says, “the Lord Himself
is God, who found out all the way of knowledge; who was seen upon earth and conversed
with men.”682 He brought the light of faith into the world. He showed the light of salvation.
“For God is the Lord, and hath given us light.”683 Then believe Him, and love Him, and
confess Him. For since, as it is written, “Every knee shall bow to Him, of things in heaven,
and things on earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father,”684 whether you will or no, you cannot deny
that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father. For this is the crowning virtue of a

<head>He vehemently inveighs against the error of the Pelagians, who declared that Christ was a
mere man.</head>
<p>We said in the first book that that heresy which copies and follows the lead of Pelagianism,
strives and contends in every way to make it believed that the Lord Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, when born of the Virgin was only a mere man; and that having afterwards taken
the path of virtue He merited by His holy and pious life to be counted worthy for this holiness
of His life that the Divine Majesty should unite Itself to Him: and thus by cutting off altogether
from Him the honour of His sacred origin, it only left to Him the selection on account
of His merits.685 And their aim and endeavour was this; viz., that, by bringing Him down
to the level of common men, and making Him one of the common herd, they might assert
that all men could by their good life and deeds secure whatever He had secured by His good
life.686 A most dangerous and deadly assertion indeed, which takes away what truly belongs
to God, and holds out false promises to men; and which should be condemned for abominable
lies on both sides, since it attacks God with wicked blasphemy, and gives to men the hope
of a false assurance. A most perverse and wicked assertion as it gives to men what does not
belong to them, and takes away from God what is His. And so of this dangerous and deadly
evil this new heresy which has recently sprung up,687 is in a way stirring and reviving the
embers, and raising a fresh flame from its ancient ashes by asserting that our Lord Jesus
Christ was born a mere man. And so why is there any need for us to ask whether its consequences
are dangerous, as in its fountain head it is utterly wrong. It is unnecessary to examine
what it is like in its issues, as in its commencement it leaves us no reason for examination.
For what object is there in inquiring whether like the earlier heresy, it holds out the
same promises to man, if (which is the most awful sin) it takes away the same things from
God? So that it would be almost wrong, when we see what it begins like, to ask what there
is to follow; as if some possible way might appear in the sequel, in which a man who denies

Mopsuestia and Modern Thought” in the Church Quarterly Review, vol. i. See esp. p 135; where, speaking of
Pelagianism, the writer says: “As the hypostatic union was denied lest it should derogate from the ethical completeness
of Christ, so the efficacious working of grace must be explained away lest it should derogate from the
moral dignity of Christians. The divine and human elements must be kept as jealously apart in the moral life of
the members as in the person of the Head of the Church. In the ultimate analysis it must be proved that the
initial movement in every good action came from the human will itself, though when this was allowed, the grace
of God might receive, by an exact process of assessment, its due share of credit for the result.”</note>

God, could prove that he was not irreligious. The new heresy then, as we have already many
times declared, says that the Lord Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, only a mere
man: and so that Mary should be called Christotocos not Theotocos, because she was the
mother of Christ, not of God. And further to this blasphemous statement it adds arguments
that are as wicked as they are foolish, saying, “No one ever gave birth to one who was before
her.” As if the birth of the only begotten of God, predicted by prophets, announced since
the beginning of the world, could be dealt with or measured by human reasons. Or did the
Virgin Mary, O you heretic, whoever you are, who slander her for her childbearing—bring
about and consummate that which came to pass, by her own strength, so that in a matter
and event of so great importance, human weakness can be brought as an objection? And so
if there was anything in this great event which was the work of man, look for human arguments.
But if everything, which was done, was due to the power of God, why should you
consider what is impossible with men, when you see that it is the work of Divine power?
But of this more anon. Now let us follow up the subject we began to treat of some little way
back; that everybody may know that you are trying to fan the flame in the ashes of Pelagianism,
and to revive the embers by breathing out fresh blasphemy.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>That the doctrine of Nestorius is closely connected with the error of the Pelagians.</head>
<p>You say then that Christ was born a mere man. But certainly this was asserted by that
wicked heresy of Pelagius, as we clearly showed in the first book; viz., that Christ was born
a mere man. You add besides, that Jesus Christ the Lord of all should be termed a form that
received God (Θεοδόχος), i.e., not God, but the receiver of God, so that your view is that
He is to be honoured not for His own sake because He is God, but because He receives God
into Himself. But clearly this also was asserted by that heresy of which I spoke before; viz.,
that Christ was not to be worshipped for His own sake because He was God, but because
owing to His good and pious actions He won this; viz., to have God dwelling in Him. You
see then that you are belching out the poison of Pelagianism, and hissing with the very
spirit of Pelagianism. Whence it comes that you seem rather to have been already judged,
than to have now to undergo judgment, for since your error is one and the same, you must
be believed to fall under the same condemnation: not to mention for the present that you
compare the Lord to a statue of the Emperor, and break out into such wicked and blasphemous
impieties that you seem in this madness of yours to surpass even Pelagius himself, who
surpassed almost every one else in impiety.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>How this participation in Divinity which the Pelagians and Nestorians attribute to Christ, is
common to all holy men.</head>
<p>You say then that Christ should be termed a form which received God (Θεοδόχος), i.e.,
that He should be revered not for His own sake because He is God, but because He received
God within Him. And so in this way you make out that there is no difference between Him
and all other holy men: for all holy men have certainly had God within them. For we know
well that God was in the patriarchs, and that He spoke in the prophets. In a word we believe
that, I do not say apostles and martyrs, but, all the saints and servants of God have within
them the Spirit of God, according to this: “Ye are the temple of the living God: as God said,
For I will dwell in them.”688 And again: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and
the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”689 And thus we are all receivers of God (Θεοδόχοι); and
in this way you say that all the saints are only like Christ, and equal to God. But away with
such a wicked and abominable heresy as that the Creator should be compared to His
creatures, the Lord to His servants, the God of things earthly and heavenly, to earthly frailty:
and out of His very kindnesses this wrong be done to Him; viz., that He who honours man
by dwelling in him should therefore be said to be only the same as man.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>What the difference is between Christ and the saints.</head>
<p>Moreover there is between Him and all the saints the same difference that there is
between a dwelling and one who dwells in it, for certainly it is the doing of the dweller not
the dwelling, if it is inhabited, for on him it depends both to build the house and to occupy
it. I mean, that he can choose, if he will, to make it a dwelling, and when he has made it, to
live in it. “Or do you seek a proof,” says the Apostle, “of Christ speaking in me?”690 And
elsewhere, “Know ye not that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobate?”691 And again:
“in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.”692 Do you not see what a
difference there is between the Apostle’s doctrine and your blasphemies? You say that God
dwells in Christ as in a man. He testifies that Christ Himself dwells in men: which certainly,
as you admit, flesh and blood cannot do; so that He is shown to be God, from the very fact
from which you deny Him to be God. For since you cannot deny that He who dwells in man
is God, it follows that we must believe that He, whom we know to dwell in men, is most
decidedly God. All, then, whether patriarchs, or prophets, or apostles, or martyrs, or saints,
had every one of them God within him, and were all made sons of God and were all receivers
of God (Θεοδόχοι), but in a very different and distinct way. For all who believe in God are
sons of God by adoption: but the only begotten alone is Son by nature: who was begotten
of His Father, not of any material substance, for all things, and the substance of all things
exist through the only begotten Son of God—and not out of nothing, because He is from
the Father: not like a birth, for there is nothing in God that is void or mutable, but in an
ineffable and incomprehensible manner God the Father, wherein He Himself was regenerate,
begat his only begotten Son; and so from the Most High, Ingenerate, and Eternal Father
proceeds the Most High, Only Begotten, and Eternal Son. Who must be considered the same
Person in the flesh as He is in the Spirit: and must be held to be the same Person in the body
as He is in glory, for when He was about to be born in the flesh,693 He made no division or
separation within Himself, as if some portion of Him was born while another portion was
not born: or as if some portion of Divinity afterwards came upon Him, which had not been
in Him at His birth from the Virgin. For according to the Apostle, “all the fulness of the
Godhead dwelleth in Christ bodily.”694 Not that It dwells in Him at times, and at times

dwells not; nor that It was there at a later date, and not an earlier one: otherwise we are entangled
in that impious heresy of Pelagius, so as to say that from a fixed moment God dwelt
in Christ, and that He then came upon Him; when He had won by His life and conversation
this; viz., that the power of the Godhead should dwell in Him. These things then belong to
men, to men, I say, not to God,—that as far as human weakness can, they should humble
themselves to God, be subject to God, make themselves dwellings for God, and by their faith
and piety win this, to have God as their guest and indweller. For in proportion as anyone
is fit for God’s gift, so does the Divine grace reward him: in proportion as a man seems
worthy of him: in proportion as a man seems worthy of God, so does he enjoy God’s presence,
according to the Lord’s promise: “if any man love Me, he will keep My word; and I and My
Father will come to him and make Our abode with him.”695 But very different is the case
as regards Christ; in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily: for He has within
Him the fulness of the Godhead so that He gives to all of His fulness, and He—as the fulness
of the Godhead dwells in Him—Himself dwells in each of the saints in proportion as He
deems them worthy of His Presence, and gives of His fulness to all, yet in such a way that
He Himself continues in all that fulness,—who even when He was on earth in the flesh, yet
was present in the hearts of all the saints, and filled the heaven, the earth, the sea, aye and
the whole universe with His infinite power and majesty; and yet was so complete in Himself
that the whole world could not contain Him. For however great and inexpressible whatever
is made may be, yet there are no things so boundless and infinite as to be able to contain
the Creator Himself.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>That before His birth in time Christ was always called God by the prophets.</head>
<p>He it is then of whom the Prophet says: “For in Thee is God, and there is no God beside
Thee. For Thou art our God and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.”696 Who
“afterwards appeared on earth and conversed with men.”697 Of whom and in whose Person
the Prophet David also speaks: “From my mother’s womb Thou art my God:”698 showing
clearly that He who was Lord and man699 was never separate from God: in whom even in
the Virgin’s womb the fulness of the Godhead dwelt. As elsewhere the same Prophet says:
“Truth has sprung from the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven,”700
that we may know that when the Son of God looked down from heaven (i.e., came and
descended), righteousness was born of the flesh of the Virgin, no phantasm of a body, but
the Truth: for He is the Truth, according to His own witness of Truth: “I am the Truth and
the life.”701 And so as we have proved in the earlier books that this Truth; viz., the Lord Jesus
Christ, was God when born of the Virgin, let us now do as we determined to do in the book
before this, and show that He who was to be born of the Virgin, was always declared to be
God beforehand. And so the prophet Isaiah says, “Cease ye from the man whose breath is
in his nostrils, for it is He in whom he is reputed to be;” or as it is more exactly and clearly

<note type="footnote">699 Dominicus Homo, literally “the Lordly man.” The same title is used again by Cassian in Book VI. cc. xxi.,
xxii. and in the Conferences XI. xiii. It is however an instance of a title which the mature judgment of the Church
has rejected as savouring of an heretical interpretation. We learn from Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 51) that the
Greek equivalent of the title ὁ κυριακὸς ἄνθρωπος, was a favourite term with the Apollinarians, as it might be
taken to favour their view that the Divinity supplied the place of a human soul in Christ. It is however freely
used by Epiphanius in his Anchoratus, and is also found in the exposition of faith assigned to Athanasius (Migne.
Pat. Græc. xxv. p. 197). And Augustine himself actually uses the title Dominicus Homo in his treatise on the
Sermon on the Mount, Book II. c. vi., though he afterwards retracted the term, see “Retract,” Book I. c. xx. “Non
video utrum recte dicatur Homo Dominicus, qui est mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus Jesus, cum sit
utique Dominus: Dominicus antem homo quis in ejus sancta familia non potest dici? Et hoc quidem ut dicerem,

in the Hebrew: “for he is reputed high.”702 But by saying “cease ye,” a term which deprecates
violence, he admirably denotes the disturbance of persecution. “Cease ye,” he says, “from
the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.” Does he not in one and the
same sentence speak of the taking upon Him of the manhood, and the truth of His Godhead?
“Cease ye,” he says, “from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.”
Does he not, I ask you, seem plainly to address the Lord’s persecutors, and to say, “Cease
ye from the man” whom ye are persecuting, for this man is God: and though He appears in
the lowliness of human flesh, yet He still continues in the high estate of Divine glory? But
by saying “Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils,” he admirably showed His
manhood, by the clearest tokens of a human body, and this fearlessly and confidently, as
one who would as urgently assert the truth of His humanity as that of His Godhead, for this
is the true and Catholic faith, to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ possessed the substance
of a true body just as He possessed a true and perfect Divinity. Unless possibly you think
that anything can be made out of the fact that he uses the word “High” instead of “God”;
whereas it is the habit of holy Scripture to put “High” for “God,” as where the prophet says:
“the Most High uttered His voice and the earth was moved,”703 and “Thou alone art Most
High over all the earth.”704 Isaiah too, who says this: “The High and lofty one who inhabiteth
eternity”:705 where we are clearly to understand that as he there puts Most High without
adding the name of God, so here too he speaks of God by the name of Most High. So then,
since the Divine word spoken by the prophet clearly announced beforehand that the Lord
Jesus Christ would be both God and man, let us now see whether the New Testament corresponds
to and harmonizes with the testimony of the Old.</p>

<head>He illustrates the same doctrine by passages from the New Testament.</head>
<p>“That,” says the Apostle John, “which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
of the word of the life: for the life was manifested: and we have seen, and do bear witness,
and declare unto you the life eternal which was with the Father, and hath appeared unto
us.”706 You see how the old testimonies are confirmed by fresh ones, and the support of the
new preaching is given to the ancient prophecy. Isaiah said: “Cease ye from the man whose
breath is in his nostrils for he is reputed high.” But John says: “That which was from the
beginning, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands
have handled.” The former said that as man He would be persecuted by the Jews: the latter
declared that as man He was handled by men’s hands. The one predicted that He whom he
announced as man, would be God Most High: the other asserts that He whom he showed
to have been handled by men, was ever God in the beginning. It is then as clear as possible
that they both showed the Lord Jesus Christ to be both God and man; and that the same
Person was afterwards man who had always been God, and thus He was God and man, because
God Himself became man. That then, he says, “which was from the beginning, which
we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
hands have handled of the word of life; and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and
do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal which was with the Father, and hath
appeared unto us.” You see the number of proofs and ways, very different and numerous,
in which that Apostle so well beloved and so devoted to God, indicates the mystery of the
Divine Incarnation. In the first instance he testifies that He, who ever was in the beginning,
was seen in the flesh. Lest in case it might not seem sufficient for unbelievers that he had
spoken of Him as seen and heard, he supports it by saying that He was handled, i.e., touched
and felt by his own hands and by those of others. Admirably indeed by showing how He
took flesh, does he shut out the view of the Marcionites and the error of the Manichees, so
that no one may think that a phantom appeared to men, since an apostle has declared that
a true body was handled by him. Then he adds “the word of life: and the life was manifested;”
and that he saw it, announced it, and proclaimed it: thus at the same time carrying out the
duties of the faith and striking the unbelievers with terror, that while he declares that he
proclaims Him, he may bring home the danger in which he stands, to the man who will not
listen. “We declare to you,” he says, “the life eternal which was with the Father, and hath
appeared to us.” He teaches that that which was ever with the Father appeared to men: and
that which was ever in the beginning, was seen of men: and that which was the Word of life
<note type="footnote">706 1 John i. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="1484"/>
without beginning, was handled by men’s hands. You see the number and variety, the particularity
and the clearness of the ways in which he unfolds the mystery of the flesh joined
to God, in such a way that no one could speak at all of either without acknowledging both.
As the Apostle himself clearly says elsewhere: “For Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever.”707 This is what he said in the passage given above: “That which was
from the beginning, our hands have handled.” Not that a spirit can in its own nature be
handled: but that the Word made flesh was in a sense handled in the manhood with which
it was joined. And so Jesus is “the same yesterday and to-day”: i.e., the same Person before
the commencement of the world, as in the flesh; the same in the past as in the present, the
same also for ever, for He is the same through all the ages, as before all the ages. And all this
is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>He shows again from the union in Christ of two natures in one Person that what belongs to
the Divine nature may rightly be ascribed to man, and what belongs to the human nature
to God.</head>
<p>And how was it the same Person before the origin of the world, who was but recently
born? Because it was the same Person, who was recently born in human nature, who was
God before the rise of all things. And so the name of Christ includes everything that the
name of God does; for so close is the union between Christ and God that no one, when he
uses the name of Christ can help speaking of God under the name of Christ, nor, when he
speaks of God, can he help speaking of Christ under the name of God. And as through the
glory of His holy nativity the mystery of each substance is joined together in Him, whatever
was in existence—I mean both human and Divine—all is regarded as God. And hence the
Apostle Paul seeing with unveiled eyes of faith the whole mystery of the ineffable glory in
Christ, spoke as follows, in inviting the peoples who were ignorant of God’s goodness to
give thanksgiving to God: “Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us worthy to be
partakers of the lot of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness,
and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption
through His blood, the remission of sins; who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn
of every creature: for in Him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible
and invisible, whether thrones or dominations, or powers: all things were created by Him
and in Him. And He is before all, and by Him all things consist. And He is the head of the
body the Church, who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things He
may hold the primacy. Because it pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell;
and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, making peace through the blood of
His cross, both as to the things on earth, and the things that are in heaven.”708 Surely this
does not need the aid of any further explanation, as it is so fully and clearly expressed that
in itself it contains not merely the substance of the faith, but a clear exposition of it. For he
bids us give thanks to the Father: and adds a weighty reason for thus giving thanks; viz.,
because He hath made us worthy to be partakers with the saints, and hath delivered us from
the power of darkness, hath translated us unto the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom
we have redemption and remission of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn
of every creature; for in Him and through Him were all things created; of which He is
both the Creator and the ruler: and what follows after this? “He is” he says, “the head of the
body the Church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead.” Scripture speaks of
the resurrection as a birth: because as birth is the beginning of life, so resurrection gives
<note type="footnote">708 Col. i. 12–20.</note>

<pb n="1486"/>
birth unto life. Whence also the resurrection is actually spoken of as regeneration, according
to the words of the Lord: “Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”709 Therefore he calls Him the first-born
from the dead, whom he had previously declared to be the invisible Son and image of God.
But who is the image of the invisible God, except the only-begotten, the Word of God? And
how can we say that He rose from the dead, who is termed the image and word of the invisible
God? And what is it that follows afterwards? “That in all things He may hold the primacy:
for it pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell, and by Him to reconcile all
things to Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross, both as to things on earth
and the things that are in heaven.” Surely the Creator of all things has no need of the primacy
in all things? Nor He who made them, of the primacy of those things which were made by
Him? And how can we say of the Word, that it pleased God that all fulness should dwell in
Him who was the first-born from the dead, when He was Himself the only-begotten Son of
God and the Word of God, before the origin of all things, and had within Him the invisible
Father, and so first had within Him all fulness, that He might Himself be the fulness of all
things? And what next? “Bringing all things to peace through the blood of His cross, both
things on earth, and the things which are in heaven.” Certainly he has made it as clear as
possible of whom he was speaking, when he called Him the first-born from the dead. For
are all things reconciled and brought into peace through the blood of the Word or Spirit?
Most certainly not. For no sort of passion can happen to nature that is impassible, nor can
the blood of any but a man be shed, nor any but a man die: and yet the same Person who is
spoken of in the following verses as dead, was above called the image of the invisible God.
How then can this be? Because the apostles took every possible precaution that it might not
be thought that there was any division in Christ, or that the Son of God being joined to a
Son of man, might come by wild interpretations to be made into two Persons, and thus He
who is in Himself but one might by wrongful and wicked notions of ours, be made into a
double Person in one nature. And so most excellently and admirably does the apostle’s
preaching pass from the only begotten Son of God to the Son of man united to the Son of
God, that the exposition of the doctrine might follow the actual course of the things that
happened. And so he continues with an unbroken connexion, and makes as it were a sort
of bridge, that without any gap or separation you might find at the end of time Him whom
we read of as in the beginning of the world; and that you might not by admitting some division
and erroneous separation imagine that the Son of God was one person in the flesh and
another in the Spirit; when the teaching of the apostle had so linked together God and man
through the mystery of His birth in the body, so as to show that it was the same Person re-

conciling to Himself all things on the Cross, who had been proclaimed the image of the invisible

<head>He confirms the judgment of the Apostle by the authority of the Lord.</head>
<p>And though this is the saying of an Apostle, yet it is the very doctrine of the Lord. For
the same Person says this to Christians by His Apostle, who had Himself said something
very like it to Jews in the gospel, when He said: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man, who
have spoken the truth to you, which I heard of God: for I am not come of Myself, but He
sent me.”710 He clearly shows that He is both God and man: man, in that He says that He
is a man: God, in that He affirms that He was sent. For He must have been with Him from
whom He came: and He came from Him, from whom He said that He was sent. Whence it
comes that when the Jews said to Him, “Thou art not yet fifty years old and hast Thou seen
Abraham?” He replied in words that exactly suit His eternity and glory, saying, “Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.”711 I ask then, whose saying
do you think this is? Certainly it is Christ’s without any doubt. And how could He who had
been but recently born, say that He was before Abraham? Simply owing to the Word of
God, with which He was entirely united, so that all might understand the closeness of the
union of Christ and God: since whatever God said in Christ, that in its fulness the unity of
the Divinity claimed for Himself. But conscious of His own eternity, He rightly then when
in the body, replied to the Jews, with the very words which He had formerly spoken to Moses
in the Spirit. For here He says, “Before Abraham came into being, I am.” But to Moses He
says, “I am that I am.”712 He certainly announced the eternity of His Divine nature with
marvellous grandeur of language, for nothing can be spoken so worthily of God, as that He
should be said ever to be. For “to be” admits of no beginning in the past or end in the future.
And so this is very clearly spoken of the nature of the eternal God, as it exactly describes
His eternity. And this the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, when He was speaking of Abraham,
showed by the difference of terms used, saying, “Before Abraham came into being I am.”
Of Abraham he said, “Before he came into being:” Of Himself, “I am,” for it belongs to
things temporal to come into being: to be belongs to eternity. And so “to come into being”
He assigns to human transitoriness: but “to be” to His own nature. And all this was found
in Christ who, by virtue of the mystery of the manhood and Divinity joined together in Him
who ever “was,” could say that He already “was.”</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<head>Since those marvellous works which from the days of Moses were shown to the children of Israel
are attributed to Christ, it follows that He must have existed long before His birth in time.</head>
<p>And when the Apostle wanted to make this clear and patent to everybody he spoke as
follows, saying that, “Jesus having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed
them that believed not.”713 But elsewhere too we read: “Neither let us tempt Christ,
as some of them tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.”714 Peter also the chief of the
apostles says: “And now why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,
which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear. But we believe that we shall be
saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ even as they were.”715 We know most certainly
that the people of God were delivered from Egypt, and led dryshod through mighty tracts
of water, and preserved in the vast desert wastes, by none but God alone; as it is written:
“The Lord alone did lead them, and there was no strange God among them.”716 And how
can an Apostle declare in so many and such clear passages that the people of the Jews were
delivered from Egypt by Jesus, and that Christ was at that time tempted by the Jews in the
wilderness, saying, “Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and were destroyed
of the serpents?” And further the blessed Apostle Peter says of all the saints who lived under
the law of the Old Covenant that they were saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Get
out then, and wriggle out of this if you can—whoever you are—you who rage with vapid
mouth and a spirit of blasphemy, and think that there is no difference at all between Adam
and Christ; and you who deny that He was God before His birth of the Virgin, show clearly
how you can prove that He was not God before His body came into existence. For lo, an
Apostle says that the people were saved out of the land of Egypt by Jesus: and that Christ
was tempted by unbelievers in the wilderness: and that our fathers, i.e., the patriarchs and
prophets, were saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Deny it if you can. I shall not be
surprised if you manage to deny what we all read, as you have already denied what we all
believe. Know then that even then it was Christ in God who led the people out of Egypt,
and it was Christ in God who was tempted by the people who tempted, and it was Christ in
God who saved all the righteous men by His lavish grace: for through the oneness of the
mystery (of the Incarnation) the terms God and Christ so pass into each other, that whatever
God did, that we may say that Christ did; and whatever afterwards Christ bore, we may say
that God bore. And so when the prophet said, “There shall no new God be in thee, neither

shalt thou worship any other God,”717 he announced it with the same meaning and in the
same spirit as that with which the Apostle said that Christ was the leader of the people of
Israel out of Egypt; to show that He who was born of the Virgin as man, was even through
the unity of the mystery still in God. Otherwise, unless we believe this, we must either believe
with the heretics that Christ is not God, or against the teaching of the prophet hold that He
is a new God. But may it be far from the Catholic people of God, to seem either to differ
from the prophet or to agree with heretics: or perchance the people who should be blessed
may be involved in a curse, and be charged with putting their hope in man. For whoever
declares that the Lord Jesus Christ was at His birth a mere man, is doubly liable to the curse,
whether he believes in Him or not. For if he believes, “Cursed is he who puts his hope in
man.”718 But if he does not believe, nonetheless is he still cursed, because though not believing
in man, he still has altogether denied God.</p>

<head>He explains what it means to confess, and what it means to dissolve Jesus.</head>
<p>For this it is which John, the man so dear to God, foresaw from the Lord’s own revelation
to him and so spoke of Him, who was speaking in him. “Every spirit,” he says, “which confesseth
Jesus come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God:
and this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom you have heard already, and he is now already
in the world.”719 O the marvellous and singular goodness of God, who like a most careful
and skilful physician, foretold beforehand the diseases that should come upon His Church,
and when He showed the mischief beforehand, gave in showing it, a remedy for it: that all
men when they saw the evil approaching, might at once flee as far as possible from that
which they already knew to be imminent. And so Saint John says, “Every spirit that dissolveth
Jesus is not of God; and this is the spirit of Antichrist.” Do you recognize him, O you heretic?
Do you recognize that it is plainly and markedly spoken of you? For no one thus dissolves
Jesus but he who does not confess that He is God. For since in this consists all the faith and
all the worship of the Church; viz., to confess that Jesus is very God; who can more dissolve
His glory and worship than one who denies the existence in Him of all that we all worship?
Take then, I beseech you, take care lest any one may even term you Antichrist. Do you think
that I am reviling and cursing? What I am saying is not my own idea: for lo, the Evangelist
says, “Every one that dissolveth Jesus is not of God; and this is Antichrist.” If you do not
dissolve Jesus, and deny God, no one may call you Antichrist. But if you deny it why do you
accuse any one for calling you Antichrist? While you are denying it, I declare you have said
it of yourself. Would you like to know whether this is true? Tell me, when Jesus was born
of a Virgin, what do you make Him to be—man or God? If God only, you certainly dissolve
Jesus, as you deny that in Him manhood was joined to Divinity. But if you say He was man,
none the less do you dissolve Him, as you blasphemously say that a mere man (as you will
have it) was born. Unless perhaps you think that you do not dissolve Jesus, you who deny
Him to be God, you who would certainly dissolve Him even if you did not deny720 that man
was born together with God. But possibly you would like this to be made clearer by examples.
You shall have them in both directions. The Manichees are outside the Church, who declare
<note type="footnote">719 S. John iv. 2, 3. It will be noticed that Cassian quotes this passage with the reading “Qui solvit Jesum,”
where the Greek has ὁ μὴ ὁμολογεῖ τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν. Λύει is found in no Greek ms., uncial or cursive, and the only
Greek authority for it is that of Socrates who says it was the reading in “the old copies.” “Qui solvit” was probably
an early gloss, current in very early days in the West, being found in Tertullian (adv. Marc. v. 16; De Jejun. i.)

that Jesus was God alone: and the Ebionites, who say that he was a mere man. For both of
them deny and dissolve Jesus: the one by saying that He is only man, the other by saying
that He is only God. For though their opinions were the opposite of each other, yet the
blasphemy of these diverse opinions is much the same, except that if any distinction can be
drawn between the magnitude of the evils, your blasphemy which asserts that He is a mere
man is worse than that which says that He is only God: for though both are wrong, yet it is
more insulting to take away from the Lord what is Divine than what is human. This then
alone is the Catholic and the true faith; viz., to believe that as the Lord Jesus Christ is God
so also is He man; and that as He is man so also is He God. “Every one who dissolves Jesus
is not of God.” But to dissolve Him is to try to rend asunder what is united in Jesus; and to
sever what is but one and indivisible. But what is it in Jesus that is united and but one?
Certainly the manhood and the Godhead. He then dissolves Jesus who severs these and
rends them asunder. Otherwise, if he does not rend them asunder and sever them, he does
not dissolve Jesus: But if he rends them asunder he certainly dissolves Him.721</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<head>The mystery of the Lord’s Incarnation clearly implies the Divinity of Christ.</head>
<p>And so to every man who breaks out into this mad blasphemy, the Lord Jesus in the
gospel Himself repeats what He said to the Pharisees, and declares: “What God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.”722 For although where it was originally spoken by God
it seems to be in answer to another matter, yet the deep wisdom of God which was speaking
not more of carnal than of spiritual things, would have this to be taken of that subject indeed,
but even more of this: for when the Jews of that day believed with you that Jesus was only
a man without Divinity, and the Lord was asked a question about the union in marriage, in
His teaching He not only referred to it, but to this also: though consulted about matters of
less importance His answer applied to greater and deeper matters, when he said, “What
God hath joined together, let not man put asunder,” i.e., Do not sever what God hath joined
together in My Person. Let not human wickedness sever that which the Divine Glory hath
united in Me. But if you want to be told more fully that this is so, hear the Apostle talking
about these very subjects of which the Saviour was then teaching, for he, as a teacher sent
from God that his weak-minded hearers might be able to take in his teaching, expounded
those very subjects which God had proclaimed in a mystery. For when he was discussing
the subject of carnal union, on which the Saviour had been asked a question in the gospel,
he repeated those very passages from the old Law on which He had dwelt, on purpose that
they might see that as he was using the same authorities he was expounding the same subject:
besides which, that nothing may seem to be wanting to his case, he adds the mention of
carnal union, and puts in the names of husband and wife whom he exhorts to love one another:
“Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the Church.” And again: “So
also ought men to love their wives even as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
himself. For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as Christ
also doth the Church, for we are members of His body.”723 You see how by adding to the
mention of man and wife the mention of Christ and the Church, he leads all from taking it
carnally to understand it in a spiritual sense. For when he had said all this, he added those
passages which the Lord had applied in the Gospel, saying: “For this cause shall a man leave
his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.”
And after this with special emphasis he adds: “This is a great mystery.” He certainly altogether
cuts off and gets rid of any carnal interpretation, by saying that it is a Divine mystery. And
what did he add after this? “But I am speaking of Christ and the Church.” That is to say:
“But that is a great mystery. But I am speaking of Christ and the Church,” i.e., since perhaps

at the present time all cannot grasp that, they may at least grasp this, which is not at variance
with it, nor different from it, because both refer to Christ. But because they cannot grasp
those more profound truths let them at least take in these easier ones that by making a
commencement by grasping what lies on the surface, they may come to the deeper truths,
and that the acquisition of a somewhat simple matter may open the way in time to what is
more profound.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>He explains more fully what the mystery is which is signified under the name of the man and
wife.</head>
<p>What then is that great mystery which is signified under the name of the man and his
wife? Let us ask the Apostle himself, who elsewhere to teach the same thing uses words of
the same force, saying: “And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested
in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in
the world, received up in glory.”724 What then is that great mystery which was manifested
in the flesh? Clearly it was God born of the flesh, God seen in bodily form: who was openly
received up in glory just as He was openly manifested in the flesh. This then is the great
mystery, of which he says: “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.” Who then were the two in one flesh?
God and the soul, for in the one flesh of man which is joined to God are present God and
the soul, as the Lord Himself says: “No man can take My life (anima) away from Me. But I
lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”725
You see then in this, three; viz., God, the flesh, and the soul. He is God who speaks: the flesh
in which He speaks: the soul of which He speaks. Is He therefore that man of whom the
prophet says: “A brother cannot redeem, nor shall a man redeem”?726 Who, as it was said,
“ascended up where He was before,”727 and of whom we read: “No man hath ascended into
heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.”728
For this cause, I say, He has left his father and mother, i.e., God from whom He was begotten
and that “Jerusalem which is the mother of us all,”729 and has cleaved to human flesh, as to
his wife. And therefore he expressly says in the case of the father “a man shall leave his
father,” but in the case of the mother he does not say “his,” but simply says “mother:” because
she was not so much his mother, as the mother of all believers, i.e., of all of us. And He was
joined to his wife, for just as man and wife make but one body, so the glory of Divinity and
the flesh of man are united and the two, viz., God and the soul, become one flesh. For just
as that flesh had God as an indweller in it, so also had it the soul within it dwelling with
God. This then is that great mystery, to search out which our admiration for the Apostle

summons us, and God’s own exhortation bids us: and it is one not foreign to Christ and
His Church, as he says, “But I am speaking of Christ and the Church.” Because the flesh of
the Church is the flesh of Christ, and in the flesh of Christ there is present God and the soul:
and so the same person is present in Christ as in the Church, because the mystery which we
believe in the flesh of Christ, is contained also by faith in the Church.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>Of the longing with which the old patriarchs desired to see the revelation of that mystery.</head>
<p>This mystery then, which was manifested in the flesh and appeared in the world, and
was preached to the Gentiles, many of the saints of old longed to see in the flesh, as they
foresaw it in the spirit. For “Verily,” saith the Lord, “I say unto you that many prophets and
righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
hear the things which ye hear and have not heard them.”730 And so the prophet Isaiah says:
“O that Thou, Lord, would rend the heavens and come down,”731 and David too: “O Lord,
bow the heavens and come down.”732 Moses also says: “Show me Thyself that I may see
Thee plainly.”733 No one ever approached nearer to God speaking out of the clouds, and to
the very presence of His glory than Moses who received the law. And if no one ever saw
more closely into God than he did, why did he ask for a still clearer vision, saying, “Show
me Thyself that I may see Thee plainly”? Simply because he prayed that this might happen
which the apostle tells us in almost the same words actually did happen; viz., that the Lord
might be openly manifested in the flesh, might openly appear to the world, openly be received
up in glory; and that at last the saints might with their very bodily eyes see all those things
which with spiritual sight they had foreseen.</p>

<head>He refutes the wicked and blasphemous notion of the heretics who said that God dwelt and
spoke in Christ as in an instrument or a statue.</head>
<p>Otherwise, as the heretics say, God would be in the Lord Jesus Christ as in a statue or
in an instrument, i.e., He would dwell as it were in a man and speak as it were through a
man, and it would not be He who dwelt and spoke as God of Himself and in His own body:
and certainly He had already thus dwelt in the saints and spoken in the persons of the saints.
In those men too, of whom I spoke above, who had prayed for His advent, He had thus
dwelt and spoken. And what need was there for all these to ask for what they already possessed,
if they were seeking for what they had previously received? Or why should they long
to see with their eyes what they were keeping in their hearts, especially as it is better for a
man to have the same thing within himself than to see it outside? Or if God was to dwell in
Christ in the same way as in all the saints, why should all the saints long to see Christ rather
than themselves? And if they were only to see the same thing in Jesus Christ, which they
themselves possessed, why should they not much rather prefer to have this in themselves
than to see it in another? But you are wrong, you wretched madman, “not understanding,”
as the Apostle says, “what you say and whereof you affirm”:734 for all the prophets and all
the saints received from God some portion of the Divine Spirit as they were able to bear it.
But in Christ “all the fulness of the Godhead” dwelt and “dwells bodily.” And therefore they
all fall far short of His fulness, from whose fulness they receive something: for the fact that
they are filled is the gift of Christ: because they would all certainly be empty, were He not
the fulness of all.</p>

<head>What the prayers of the saints for the coming of Messiah contained; and what was the nature
of that longing of theirs.</head>
<p>This then all the saints wished for: for this they prayed. This they longed to see with
their eyes in proportion as they were wise in heart and mind. And so the prophet Isaiah
says: “O that Thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down.”735 But Habakkuk too declaring
the same thing which the other was wishing for, says: “When the years draw nigh, Thou
wilt show Thyself: at the coming of the times Thou wilt be manifested: God will come from
Teman,” or “God will come from the south.”736 David also: “God will clearly come:” and
again: “Thou that sittest above the Cherubim, show Thyself.”737 Some declared His advent
which He presented to the world: others prayed for it. Some in different forms but all with
equal longing: understanding up to a certain point how great a thing they were praying for,
that God dwelling in God, and continuing in the form and bosom of God, might “empty
Himself,”738 and take the form of a servant and submit Himself to endure all the bitterness
and insults of the passion, and undergo punishment for His goodness, and what is hardest,
and the most disgraceful thing of all, meet with death at the hands of those very persons for
whom He would die. All the saints then understanding this up to a certain point—up to a
certain point, I say, for how vast it is none can understand—with concordant voice and (so
to speak) by mutual consent all prayed for the advent of God: for indeed they knew that the
hope of all men lay therein, and that the salvation of all was bound up in this, because no
one could loose the prisoners except one who was Himself free from chains: no one could
release sinners, save one Himself without sin: for no one can in any case set free anyone,
unless he is himself free in that particular, in which another is freed by him. And so when
death had passed on all, all were wanting in life, that, dying in Adam, they might live in
Christ. For though there were many saints, many elect and even friends of God, yet none
could ever of themselves be saved, had they not been saved by the advent of the Lord and
His redemption.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>From the miracle of the feeding of the multitude from five barley loaves and two fishes he
shows the majesty of Divine Power.</head>
<p>We read in the gospel that when five loaves were at the Lord’s bidding brought to Him
an immense number of God’s people were fed with them. But how this was done it is impossible
to explain, or to understand or to imagine. So great and so incomprehensible is the
might of Divine Power, that though we are perfectly assured of the fact, yet we are unable
to understand the manner of the fact. For first one would have to comprehend how so small
a number of loaves could be sufficient, I will not say for them to eat and be filled, but even
to be divided and set before them, when there were many more thousands of men than there
were loaves; and almost more companies than there could be fragments of the whole number
of loaves. The plentiful supply then was the creation of the word of the Lord. The work grew
in the doing of it. And though what was visible was but little; yet what was given to them
became more than could be reckoned. There is then no room for conjecture, for human
speculation, or imagination. The only thing in such a case is that like faithful and wise men
we should acknowledge that, however great and incomprehensible are the things which are
done by God, even if they are altogether beyond our comprehension, we must recognize
that nothing is impossible with God. But of these unspeakable acts of Divine Power, we will,
as the subject demands it, speaks more fully later on, because it exactly corresponds to the
ineffable miracles of His Holy Nativity.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
<pb n="1502"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>The author adapts the mystery of the number seven (made up of the five loaves and two fishes)
to his own work.</head>
<p>Meanwhile as we have alluded to the five loaves, I think it will not be out of place to
make a comparison of the five books which we have already composed. For as they are equal
in number, so they are not dissimilar in character. For as the loaves were of barley, so these
books may (as far as my ability is concerned) be fairly termed “of barley,” although they are
enriched with passages from Holy Scripture, and contain life-giving treasures in contemptible
surroundings. And even in this point they are not unlike those loaves, for though they were
poor things to look at, yet they proved to be rich in blessing: and so these books, though, as
far as my powers are concerned, they are worthless, yet they are valuable from the sacred
matter which is mingled with them: and though they appear outwardly worthless like barley
owing to my words, yet within they have the savour of the bread of life owing to the testimonies
from the Lord Himself. It remains that, after His example, they may, by the gift of
Divine grace, furnish life-giving food from countless seeds. And as those loaves supplied
bodily strength to those who ate them, so may these give spiritual vigour to those who read
them. But as then the Lord, from whom this gift comes as did that, by means of that food
provided that they might be filled and so should not faint by the way, so now is He able to
bring it about that by means of this men may be filled and not err (from the faith). But still
because there, where a countless host of God’s people was fed with a mighty gift, though
there was very little for them to eat, we read that to those five loaves there were added two
fishes, it is fitting that we too, who are anxious to give to all God’s people who are following,
the nourishment of a spiritual repast, should add to those five books corresponding to the
five loaves, two more books corresponding to the two fishes: praying and beseeching Thee,
O Lord, that Thou wilt look on our efforts and prayers, and grant a prosperous issue to our
pious undertaking. And since we, out of our love and obedience, desire to make the number
of our books correspond to the number of loaves and fishes, do Thou grant the virtue of
Thy Benediction upon them; and, as Thou dost bless739 this little work of ours with a gospel
number, so mayest Thou fill up the number with the fruit of the gospel, and grant that this
may be for holy and saving food to all the people of Thy Church, of every age and sex. And
if there are some who are affected by the deadly breath of that poisonous serpent, and in an
unhealthy state of soul and spirit have caught a pestilential disease in their feeble dispositions,
give to them all the vigour of health, and entire soundness of faith, that by granting to them

all, by means of these writings of ours, the saving care of Thy gift—just as that food in the
gospel was completely sanctified by Thee, so that by eating it those hungry souls were
strengthened,—so mayest Thou bid languid souls to be healed by these.</p>

<head>He refutes his opponent by the testimony of the Council of Antioch.</head>
<p>Therefore since we have, as I fancy, already in all the former books with the weight of
sacred testimonies, given a complete answer to the heretic who denies God, now let us come
to the faith of the Creed of Antioch and its value. For as he740 was himself baptized and regenerated
in this, he ought to be confuted by his own profession, and (so to speak) to be
crushed beneath the weight of his own arms, for this is the method, that as he is already
convicted by the evidence of holy Scripture, so now he may be convicted by evidence out
of his own mouth. Nor will there be any need to bring anything else to bear against him
when he has clearly and plainly convicted himself. The text then and the faith of the Creed
of Antioch is this.741 “I believe in one and the only true God, the Father Almighty, Maker
of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, and

to the see of Constantinople.</note>
<note type="footnote">741 This creed is plainly given by Cassian as the baptismal formula of the Church of Antioch; and with almost
verbally a fragment of the Creed preserved in a Contestatio comparing Nestorius to Paul of Samosata (a.d. 429,
or 430) which is said by Leontius to have been the work of Eusebius afterward Bishop of Dorylæum. The form
is especially interesting as showing that the Creed of Antioch, in common with several other Eastern Creeds,
underwent revision, probably about the middle of the fourth century, from the desire to enrich the local creed
with Nicene phraseology. The insertions which are obviously due to the Creed of Nicæa are: non factum, Deum
verum ex Deo vero, homoousion patri, or as they would run in the original οὐ ποιηθέντα, Θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ
Θεοῦ ἀλιθινοῦ, ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρι, and it has been suggested that they were probably introduced at the Synod
held at Antioch under Meletius in 363. Similar forms of local creeds thus enlarged by the adoption of Nicene
phraseology are (1) that of Jerusalem as given by Cyril in his Catechetical Lectures, (2) the Creed of Cappadocia,
(3) that of Mesopotamia, and (4) the “Creed of Charisius” preserved in the Acts of the Council of Ephesus (Mansi
IV. 1348). On all of these see Dr. Hort’s “Two Dissertations,” p. 110 sq. Another interesting feature in the Creed
as given by Cassian is that it was in the singular “Credo,” I believe; whereas the Eastern Creeds are almost all in
the plural πιστεύομεν. That however which is found in the Apostolical Constitutions (VII. xli.) has the singular
πιστεύω καὶ βαπτίζομαι, and therefore it is possible that Cassian may have preserved the original form here. It
is however more probable that the singular Credo is due to a reminiscence of the form current in the Western
church, which has influenced the translation. See further Hahn’s Bibliothek des Symbole p. 64 sq.</note>

dead,” etc.742 In the Creed which gives the faith of all the Churches, I should like to know
which you would rather follow, the authority of men or of God? Though I would not press
hardly or unkindly upon you, but give the opportunity of choosing whichever alternative
you please, that accepting one, I may deny the other: for I will grant you and yield to you
either of them. And what do I grant, I ask? I will force you to one or other even against your
will. For you ought, if you like, to understand of your own free will that one or other of these
is in the Creed: if you don’t like it, you must be forced against your will to see it. For, as you
know, a Creed (Symbolum) gets its name from being a “collection.”743 For what is called
in Greek σύμβολος is termed in Latin “Collatio.” But it is therefore a collection (collatio)
because when the faith of the whole Catholic law was collected together by the apostles of
the Lord, all those matters which are spread over the whole body of the sacred writings with
immense fulness of detail, were collected together in sum in the matchless brevity of the
Creed, according to the Apostle’s words: “Completing His word, and cutting it short in
righteousness: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.”744 This then is
the “short word” which the Lord made, collecting together in few words the faith of both
of His Testaments, and including in a few brief clauses the drift of all the Scriptures, building
<note type="footnote">742 Cassian nowhere quotes the last section of the Creed of Antioch, as it did not concern the question at issue.
A few clauses of it may however be recovered from S. Chrysostom’s Homilies (In 1 Cor. Hom. xl. § 2); viz., καὶ
εἰς ἁμαρτιῶν ἂφεσιν καὶ εἰς νεκρῶν ἀνάστασιν καὶ εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον.</note>
<note type="footnote">743 Symbolus, or more commonly and correctly Symbolum (= σύμβολον) is the general name for the creed
in the ancient church, met with from the days of Cyprian (who uses it more than once, e.g., Ep. lxix.) onwards.
In the account which Cassian gives in the text of the origin of the name he is certainly copying Rufinus (whose
exposition of the Apostles’ Creed is directly quoted by him below in Book VII. c. xxvii.). The passage which
Cassian evidently has in his mind is the following: “Moreover for many and excellent reasons they determined
that it should be called Symbolum. For ‘Symbolum’ in Greek may mean both Indicium (a token) and collatio (a
collection), that is, that which several bring together into one; for the apostles effected this in these sentences
by bringing together into one what each thought good.…Therefore being about to depart to preach, the apostles
appointed that token of their unanimity and faith.” (Ruf. De Symb. § 2). Cf. also § 1. “In these words there is
truly discovered the prophecy which says: ‘Completing His work and cutting it short in righteousness, because
a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.’” This explanation, however, of the origin of the term labours
under the fatal mistake of confusing two distinct Greek words, συμβολή, a “collection,” and σύμβολον, a
“watchword:” and the true explanation of the word is probably that which Rufinus gives as an alternative, which
gives it the meaning of “watchword.” It was the watchword of the Christian soldier, carefully and jealously
guarded by him, as that by which he could himself be distinguished from heretics, and that for which he could
challenge others of whose orthodoxy he might be in doubt.</note>

<head>How the Creed has authority Divine as well as human.</head>
<p>You see then that the Creed has the authority of God: for “a short word will the Lord
make upon the earth.” But perhaps you want the authority of men: nor is that wanting, for
God made it by means of men. For as He fashioned the whole body of the sacred Scriptures
by means of the patriarchs and more particularly his own prophets, so He formed the Creed
by means of His apostles and priests. And whatever He enlarged on in these (in Scripture)
with copious and abundant material, He here embraced in a most complete and compendious
form by means of His own servants. There is nothing wanting then in the Creed; because
as it was formed from the Scriptures of God by the apostles of God, it has in it all the authority
it can possibly have, whether of men or of God: Although too that which was made by men,
must be accounted God’s work, for we should not look on it so much as their work, by whose
instrumentality it was made, but rather as His, who was the actual maker. “I believe,” then,
says the Creed, “in one true and only God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible
and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son and the first-born of
every creature; Begotten of Him before all worlds, and not made; Very God of Very God,
being of one substance with the Father; by whom both the worlds were framed and all things
were made; who for us came, and was born of the Virgin Mary; and was crucified under
Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures;
and ascended into heaven: and shall come again to judge the quick and the dead,” etc.</p>

<head>He proceeds against his opponent with the choicest arguments, and shows that we ought to
hold fast to the religion which we have received from our fathers.</head>
<p>If you were an assertor of the Arian or Sabellian heresy, and did not use your own creed,
I would still confute you by the authority of the holy Scriptures; I would confute you by the
words of the law itself; I would refute you by the truth of the Creed which has been approved
throughout the whole world. I would say that, even if you were void of sense and understanding,
yet still you ought at least to follow universal consent: and not to make more of the
perverse view of a few wicked men than of the faith of all the Churches: which as it was established
by Christ, and handed down by the apostles ought to be regarded as nothing but
the voice of the authority of God, which is certainly in possession of the voice and mind of
God. And what then if I were to deal with you in this way? What would you say? What
would you answer? Would it not, I adjure you, be this: viz., that you had not been trained
up and taught in this way: that something different had been delivered to you by your parents,
and masters, and teachers. That you did not hear this in the meeting place of your father’s
teaching, nor in the Church of your Baptism: finally that the text and words of the Creed
delivered and taught to you contained something different. That in it you were baptized
and regenerated. You would say that you would hold fast this which you had received, and
that you would live in that Creed in which you learnt that you were regenerated. When you
said this, would you not, I pray, fancy that you were using a very strong shield even against
the truth? And indeed it would be no unreasonable defence, even in a bad business, and one
which would give no bad excuse for error, if it did not unite obstinacy with error. For if you
held this, which you had received from your childhood, we should try to amend and correct
your present error, rather than be severe in punishing your past fault: Whereas now, as you
were born in a Catholic city, instructed in the Catholic faith, and regenerated with Catholic
Baptism, how can I deal with you as with an Arian or Sabellian? Would that you were one!
I should grieve less had you been brought up in what was wrong, instead of having fallen
away from what was right: had you never received the faith, instead of having lost it: had
you been an old heretic instead of a fresh apostate, for you would have brought less scandal
and harm on the whole Church; finally it would have been a less bitter sorrow, and less injurious
example had you been able to try the Church as a layman rather than a priest.
Therefore, as I said above, if you had been a follower and assertor of Sabellianism or
Arianism or any heresy you please, you might shelter yourself under the example of your
parents, the teaching of your instructors, the company of those about you, the faith of your

<pb n="1509"/>
creed. I ask, O you heretic, nothing unfair, and nothing hard. As you have been brought up
in the Catholic faith, do that which you would do for a wrong belief. Hold fast to the
teaching of your parents. Hold fast the faith of the Church: hold fast the truth of the Creed:
hold fast the salvation of baptism. What sort of a wonder—what sort of a monster are you?
You will not do for yourself what others have done for their errors. But we have launched
out far enough: and out of love for a city that is connected with us,745 have yielded to our
grief as to a strong wind, and while we were anxious to make way, have overshot the mark
of our proper course.</p>

<head>Once more he challenges him to the profession of the Creed of Antioch.</head>
<p>The Creed then, O you heretic, of which we gave the text above, though it is that of all
the churches (for the faith of all is but one) is yet specially that of the city and Church of
Antioch, i.e., of that Church in which you were brought up, instructed, and regenerated.
The faith of this Creed brought you to the fountain of life, to saving regeneration, to the
grace of the Eucharist, to the Communion of the Lord: And what more! Alas for the grievous
and mournful complaint! Even to the ministerial office, the height of the presbyterate, the
dignity of the priesthood. Do you, you wretched madman, think that this is a light or trivial
matter? Do you not see what you have done? Into what a depth you have plunged yourself?
In losing the faith of the Creed, you have lost everything that you were. For the mysteries
of the priesthood and of your salvation rested on the truth of the Creed. Can you possibly
deny that? I say that you have denied your very self. But perhaps you think that you cannot
deny yourself. Let us look at the text of the Creed; that if you say what you used to do, you
may not be refuted, but if you say things widely different and contrary, you may not look
to be confuted by me, as you have condemned yourself already. For if you now maintain
something else than what is in the Creed and what you formerly maintained yourself, how
can you help ascribing your punishment to nobody but yourself, when you see that the
opinion of everybody else about you is the same as your own? “I believe,” the Creed says,
“in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible; and in the Lord
Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, the first-born of every creature; Begotten of Him before
all worlds, and not made.” It is well that you should first reply to this: Do you confess this
of Jesus Christ the Son of God, or do you deny it? If you confess it, everything is right enough.
But if not, how do you now deny what you yourself formerly confessed? Choose then which
you will: Of two things one must follow; viz., that that same confession of yours, if it still
holds good, should alone set you free, or if you deny it, be the first to condemn you. For you
said in the Creed: “I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ His only begotten Son, and the firstborn
of every creature.” If the Lord Jesus Christ is the only begotten, and the first-born of
every creature, then by our own confession He is certainly God. For no other is the only
begotten and first-born of every creature but the only begotten Son of God: as He is the
first-born of the creatures, so He is also God the Creator of all. And how can you say that
He was a mere man at His birth from the Virgin, whom you confessed to be God before the
world. Next the Creed says: “Begotten of the Father before all worlds, and not made.” This
Creed was uttered by you. You said by your Creed, that Jesus Christ was begotten before
the worlds of God the Father, and not made. Does the Creed say anything about those
phantasms, of which you now rave? Did you yourself say anything about them? Where is
the statue? Where that instrument of yours, I pray? For God forbid that this should be an-

<pb n="1511"/>
other’s and not yours. Where is it that you assert that the Lord Jesus Christ is like a statue,
and so you think that He ought to be worshipped not because He is God, but because He is
the image of God; and out of the Lord of glory you make an instrument, and blasphemously
say that He ought to be adored not for His own sake, but for the sake of Him who (as it
were) breathes in Him and sounds through Him? You said in the Creed that the Lord Jesus
Christ was begotten of the Father before all worlds, and not made: and this certainly belongs
to none but the only begotten Son of God: that His birth should not be a creation, and that
He could be said simply to be begotten, not made: for it is contrary to the nature of things
and to His honour that the Creator of all should be believed to be a creature: and that He,
the author of all things that have a commencement, should Himself have a beginning, as all
things began from Him. And so we say that He was begotten not made: for His generation
was unique and no ordinary creation. And since He is God, begotten of God, the Godhead
of Him who is begotten must have everything complete which the majesty of Him who begat
has.</p>

<head>He continues the same line of argument drawn from the Creed of Antioch.</head>
<p>But there follows in the Creed: “Very God of Very God; Being of one substance with
the Father; by whom both the worlds were framed, and all things were made.” And when
you said all this, remember that you said it all of the Lord Jesus Christ. For you find stated
in the Creed: that you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and
the first-born of every creature: and after this and other clauses: “Very God of Very God,
Being of one substance with the Father; by whom also the worlds were framed.” How then
can the same Person be God and not God; God and a statue; God and an instrument? These
do not harmonize, you heretic, in any one Person, nor do they fit together, so that you can,
when you like, call Him God; and when you like, consider the same Person a creation. You
said in the Creed, “Very God.” Now you say: “a mere man.” How can these things fit together
and harmonize so that one and the same Person may be the greatest Power, and utter
weakness: the Highest glory, and mere mortality? These things do not meet together in one
and the same Lord. So that severing Him for worship and for degradation, on one side, you
may do Him honour as you like, and on the other, you may injure Him as you like. You
said in the Creed when you received the Sacrament of true Salvation: “the Lord Jesus Christ,
Very God of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father, Creator of the worlds, Maker
of all things.” Where are you alas! Where is your former self? Where is that faith of yours?
Where that confession? How have you fallen back and become a monstrosity and a prodigy?
What folly, what madness was your ruin? You turned the God of all power and might into
inanimate material and a lifeless creation: Your faith has certainly grown in time, in age,
and in the priesthood. You are worse as an old man than formerly as a child: worse now as
a veteran than as a tyro: worse as a Bishop than you were as a novice: nor were you ever a
learner after you had begun to be a teacher.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>How it can be said that Christ came and was born of a Virgin.</head>
<p>But let us look at the remainder which follows. As then the Creed says: “The Lord Jesus
Christ, Very God of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father; By whom both the
worlds were framed, and all things were made,” it immediately subjoins in closest connexion
the following, and says: “Who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary.” He then, who
is Very God, who is of one substance with the Father, who is the Maker of all things, He, I
repeat, came into the world and was born of the Virgin Mary; as the Apostle Paul says: “But
when the fulness of the times was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made
under the law.”746 You see how the mysteries of the Creed correspond with the Holy
Scriptures. The Apostle declares that the Son of God was “sent from the Father:” The Creed
affirms that He “came.” For it certainly follows that our faith should confess that He has
“come,” whom the Apostle had taught us to be sent. Then the Apostle says: “Made of a woman:”
The Creed, “born of Mary.” And so you see that there speaks through the Creed the
Scripture itself, from which the Creed acknowledges that it is itself derived. But when the
Apostle says, “made of a woman,” he rightly enough uses “made” for “born,” after the
manner of Holy Scripture in which “made” stands for “born:” as in this passage: “Instead
of thy fathers there are made to thee sons:”747 or this: “Before Abraham was made, I am;”748
where we certainly see clearly that He meant “Before he was born, I am:” alluding to the
fact of his birth under the term “was made,” because whatever does not need to be made
has the very reality of creation. “Who,” it then says, “for us came and was born of the Virgin
Mary.” If a mere man was born of Mary, how can it be said that He “came”? For no one
“comes” but He who has it in Him to be able to come. But in the case of one who had not
yet received His existence, how could He have it in Him to come. You see then how by the
word “coming” it is shown that He who came was already in existence: for He only had the
power to come, to whom there could be the opportunity of coming, from the fact that He
was already existing. But a mere man was certainly not in existence before he was conceived,
and so had not in himself the power to come. It is clear then that it was God who came: to
whom it belongs in each case both to be, and to come. For certainly He came because He
was, and He ever was, because He could ever come.</p>

<head>Again he convicts his opponent of deadly heresy by his own confession.</head>
<p>But why are we arguing about words, when the facts are clear enough? and seeking for
a determination of the matter from the terms of the Creed, when the Creed itself deals with
the question. Let us repeat the confession of the Creed, and of you yourself (for yours it is
as well as the Creed’s, for you made it yours by confessing it), that you may see that you
have departed not only from the Creed but from yourself. “I believe” then, says the Creed,
“In one only true God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible: And
in the Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, and the first-born of every creature: Begotten
of Him before all worlds and not made; Very God of Very God; Being of one substance with
the Father; By whom both the worlds were framed, and all things were made. Who for us
came, and was born of the Virgin Mary.” “For us” then the Creed says, our Lord Jesus Christ
“came and was born of the Virgin Mary, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate; and was
buried, and rose again according to the Scriptures.” The Churches are not ashamed to confess
this: the Apostles were not ashamed to preach it. You yourself, you, I say, whose every utterance
is now blasphemy, you who now deny everything, you did not deny all these truths:
that God was born; that God suffered, that God rose again. And what next? Whither have
you fallen? What have you become? To what are you reduced? What do you say? What are
you vomiting forth? What, as one says, even mad Orestes himself would swear to be the
words of a madman.749 For what is it that you say? “Who then is the Son of God who was
born of the Christotocos? As for instance if we were to say I believe in God the Word, the
only Son of God, begotten of His Father, Being of one substance with the Father, who came
down and was buried, would not our ears be shocked at the sound? God dead?” And again:
“Can it possibly be, you say, that He who was begotten before all worlds, should be born a
second time, and be God?” If all these things cannot possibly be, how is it that the Creed of
the Churches says that they did happen? How is it that you yourself said that they did? For
let us compare what you now say with what you formerly said. Once you said: “I believe in
God the Father Almighty; and in Jesus Christ His Son, Very God of Very God; Being of one
substance with the Father; who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary; and was crucified
under Pontius Pilate; and was buried.” But now what is it that you say? “If we should
say: I believe in God the Word, the only Son of God, Begotten of His Father; Being of one
substance with the Father, who came down and was buried, would not our ears be shocked
at the sound?” The bitterness indeed and blasphemy of your words might drive us to a
furious and ferocious attack in answer; but we must somewhat curb the reins of our pious
sorrow.</p>

<head>He inveighs against him because though he has forsaken the Catholic religion, he nevertheless
presumes to teach in the Church, to sacrifice, and to give decisions.</head>
<p>I appeal then to you, to you yourself, I say. Tell me, I pray, if any Jew or pagan denied
the Creed of the Catholic faith, should you think that we ought to listen to him? Most certainly
not. What if a heretic or an apostate does the same? Still less should we listen to him,
for it is worse for a man to forsake the truth which he has known, than to deny it without
ever having known it. We see then two men in you: a Catholic and an apostate: first a
Catholic, afterwards an apostate. Determine for yourself which you think we ought to follow:
for you cannot press the claims of the one in yourself without condemning the other. Do
you say then that it is your former self which is to be condemned: and that you condemn
the Catholic Creed, and the confession and faith of all men? And what then? O shameful
deed! O wretched grief! What are you doing in the Catholic Church, you preventer of
Catholics? Why is it that you, who have denied the faith of the people, are still polluting the
meetings of the people: And above all venture to stand at the altar, to mount the pulpit, and
show your impudent and treacherous face to God’s people—to occupy the Bishop’s throne,
to exercise the priesthood, to set yourself up as a teacher? To teach the Christians what? Not
to believe in Christ: to deny that He in whose Divine temple they are, is God.750 And after
all this, O folly! O madness! you fancy that you are a teacher and a Bishop, while (O wretched
blindness) you are denying His Divinity, His Divinity (I repeat it) whose priest you claim
to be. But we are carried away by our grief. What then says the Creed? or what did you
yourself say in the Creed? Surely “the Lord Jesus Christ, Very God of Very God; Being of
one substance with the Father; By whom the worlds were created and all things made:” and
that this same Person “for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary.” Since then you said
that God was born of Mary, how can you deny that Mary was the mother of God? Since you
said that God came, how can you deny that He is God who has come? You said in the Creed:
“I believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God: I believe in Very God of Very God, of one substance
with the Father: who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary; and was crucified under
Pontius Pilate; and was buried.” But now you say: “If we should say, I believe in God the
Word, the only Son of God, Begotten of the Father, of one substance with the Father; who
came and was buried, would not our ears be shocked at the sound?” Do you see then how
you are utterly destroying and stamping out the whole faith of the Catholic Creed and the
Catholic mystery? “O Sin, O monstrosity, to be driven away,” as one says,751 “to the utmost

solitude where you will not be able to find anyone to ruin. You think then that the faith of
our salvation, and the mystery of the Church’s hope is a shock to your ears and hearing.
And how was it that formerly when you were hastening to be baptized, you heard these
mysteries with unharmed ears? How was it that when the teachers of the church were instructing
you your ears were not damaged? You certainly at that time did your duty without
any double shock to your mouth and ears; when you repeated what you heard from others,
and as the speaker yourself heard yourself speaking. Where then were these injuries to your
ears? Where these shocks to your hearing? Why did you not contradict and cry out against
it? But indeed you are at your will and fancy, when you please, a disciple; and when you
please, the Church’s enemy: when you please a Catholic, and when you please an apostate.
A worthy leader indeed, to draw Churches after you, to whatever side you attach yourself;
to make your will the law of our life, and to change mankind as you yourself change, that,

<p>But perhaps you say that you were a baby when you were regenerated, and so were not
then able to think or to contradict. It is true: that your infancy did prevent you from contradicting,
when if you had been a man you would have died for contradicting. For what if
when in that most faithful and devout Church of Christ the priest delivered the Creed753
to the Catechumen and the attesting people, you had tried to hold your tongue at any point,
or to contradict? Perhaps you would have been heard, and not sent forth at once like some
new kind of monster or prodigy as a plague to be expelled. Not because that most earnest
and religious people of God has any wish to be stained with the blood of even the worst of
men: but because especially in great cities the people inflamed with the love of God cannot
restrain the ardour of their faith when they see anyone rise up against their God. But be it
so. As a baby, if it be so, you could not contradict and deny the Creed. Why did you hold
your tongue when you were older and stronger. At any rate you grew up, and became a
man, and were placed in the ministry of the Church. Through all these years, through all
the steps of office and dignity, did you never understand the faith which you taught so long
before? At any rate you knew that you were His deacon and priest. If the rule of salvation
was a difficulty to you, why did you undertake the honour of that, of which you disliked the
faith? But indeed you were a far sighted and simply devout man, who wished so to balance
yourself between the two, as to maintain both your wicked blasphemy, and the honour of
Catholicity!</p>
<note type="footnote">753 The reference is the ceremony known as the Traditio Symboli, which is thus described by Professor Lumby:
“The practice of the early church in the admission of converts to baptism seems to have been of this nature. For
some period previous to their baptism (the usual seasons for which were Easter and Pentecost) the candidates
for admission thereto were trained in the doctrines of the faith by the presbyters. A few days before they were
to be baptized (the number of days varying at different periods) the Creed was delivered to them accompanied
with a sermon. The ceremony was known as Traditio Symboli, the delivery of the Creed. At the time of Baptism
each candidate was interrogated upon the articles of the Creed which he had received, and was to return an answer
in the words which had been given to him. This was known as Redditio Symboli, the repetition of the Creed,
and Baptism was the only occasion on which the Creed was introduced into any public service of the Church.”

<head>Christ crucified is an offence and foolishness to those who declare that He was a mere man.</head>
<p>The shock then to your hearing and ears is that God was born, and God suffered. And
where is that saying of yours, O Apostle Paul: “But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews
indeed a stumbling block, but to the Gentiles foolishness: but to them that are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.”754 What is the Wisdom
and Power of God? Certainly it is God. But he preaches Christ who was crucified, as the
Power and Wisdom of God. If then Christ is without any doubt the Wisdom of God, He is
therefore without any doubt God. “We,” then, he says, “preach Christ crucified, to the Jews
indeed a stumbling block, but to the Gentiles foolishness.” And so the Lord’s cross, which
was foolishness to the Gentiles and a stumbling block to the Jews is both together to you.
Nor indeed is there any greater foolishness than not to believe, or any greater stumbling
block than to refuse to listen. Their ears were wounded then by the preaching and the passion
of God, just as yours are wounded now. They thought as you think that this shocked their
ears. And hence it was that when the Apostle was preaching Christ as God, at the name of
our God and Lord Jesus Christ, they stopped the ears in their head, as you stop the ears of
your understanding. The sin of both of you in this matter might seem to be equal, were it
not that your fault is the greater, because they denied Him, in whom the passion still showed
the manhood,755 while you deny Him, whom the resurrection has already proved to be God.
And so they were persecuting Him on the earth, whom you are persecuting even in heaven.
And not only so, but this is more cruel and wicked, because they denied Him in ignorance,
you deny Him after having received the faith: they not knowing the Lord, you when you
have confessed Him as God: they under cover of zeal for the law, you under the cloke of
your Bishopric: they denied Him to whom they thought that they were strangers, you deny
Him whose priest you are. O unworthy act, and one never heard of before! You persecute
and attack the very One, whose office you are still holding.</p>

<head>He replies to the objection in which they say that the child born756 ought to be of one substance
with the mother.</head>
<p>But indeed in your deceit and blasphemy you use a grand argument for denying and
attacking the Lord God, when you say that “the child born ought to be of one substance
with the mother.”757 I do not entirely admit it, and maintain that in the matter of the birth
of God it would not be observed; for the birth was not so much the work of her who bore
Him as of her Son, and He was born as He willed, whose doing it was that He was born.
Next, if you say that the child born ought to be of one substance with the parent, I affirm
that the Lord Jesus Christ was of one substance with His Father, and also with His mother.
For in accordance with the difference of the Persons He showed a likeness to each parent.
For according to His Divinity He was of one substance with the Father: but according to
the flesh He was of one substance with His mother. Not that it was one Person who was of
one substance with the Father, and another who was of one substance with His mother, but
because the same Lord Jesus Christ, both born as man, and also being God, had in Him the
properties of each parent, and in that He was man He showed a likeness to His human
mother, and in that He was God He possessed the very nature of God the Father.</p>

<head>He compares this erroneous view with the teaching of the Pelagians.</head>
<p>Otherwise if Christ who was born of Mary is not the same Person as He who is of God,
you certainly make two Christs; after the manner of that abominable error of Pelagius, which
in asserting that a mere man was born of the Virgin, said that He was the teacher rather
than the redeemer of mankind; for He did not bring to men redemption of life but only an
example of how to live, i.e., that by following Him men should do the same sort of things
and so come to a similar state. Your blasphemy then has but one source, and the root of the
errors is one and the same. They maintain that a mere man was born of Mary: you maintain
the same. They sever the Son of man from the Son of God: you do the same. They say that
the Saviour was made the Christ by His baptism: you say that in baptism He became the
Temple of God. They do not deny that He became God after His Passion: you deny Him
even after His ascension. In one point only therefore your perverseness goes beyond theirs,
for they seem to blaspheme the Lord on earth, and you even in heaven. We do not deny that
you have beaten and outstripped those whom you are copying. They at last cease to deny
God; you never do. Although theirs must not altogether be deemed a true confession, as
they only allow the glory of Divinity to the Saviour after His Passion, and while they deny
that He was God before this, only confess it afterwards: for, as it seems to me, one who
denies some part in regard to God, denies Him altogether: and one who does not confess
that He ever existed, denies Him forever. Just as you also, even if you were to admit that
now in the heavens the Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of the Virgin Mary, is God, would
not truly confess Him unless you admitted that He was always God. But indeed you do not
want in any point to change or vary your opinion. For you assert that He whom you speak
of as born a mere man, is still at the present time not God. O novel and marvellous blasphemy,
though with the heretics you assert Him to be man, you do not with the heretics
confess Him to be God!</p>

<head>He shows that those who patronize this false teaching acknowledge two Christs.</head>
<p>But still, I had begun to say, that as you certainly make out two Christs this very matter
must be illustrated and made clear. Tell me, I pray you, you who sever Christ from the Son
of God, how can you confess in the Creed that Christ was begotten of God? For you say: “I
believe in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His Son.” Here then you have Jesus Christ
the Son of God: but you say that it was not the same Son of God who was born of Mary.
Therefore there is one Christ of God, and another of Mary. In your view then there are two
Christs. For, though in the Creed you do not deny Christ, you say that the Christ of Mary
is another than the one whom you confess in the Creed. But perhaps you say that Christ
was not begotten of God: how then do you say in the Creed: “I believe in Jesus Christ the
Son of God?” You must then either deny the Creed or confess that Christ is the Son of God.
But if you confess in the Creed that Christ is the Son of God, you must also confess that the
same Christ, the Son of God, is of Mary. Or if you make out another Christ of Mary, you
certainly make the blasphemous assertion that there are two Christs.</p>

<head>He shows further that this teaching is destructive of the confession of the Trinity.</head>
<p>But still even if your obstinacy and dishonesty are not restrained by this faith of the
Creed, are you not, I ask you, overwhelmed by an appeal to reason and the light of truth?
Tell me, I ask, whoever you are, O you heretic—At least there is a Trinity, in which we believe,
and which we confess: Father and Son and Holy Ghost. Of the Glory of the Father and the
Spirit there is no question. You are slandering the Son, because you say that it was not the
same Person who was born of Mary, as He who was begotten of God the Father. Tell me
then: if you do not deny that the only Son of God was begotten of God, whom do you make
out that He is who was born of Mary? You say “a mere man,” according to that which He
Himself said: “That which is born of the flesh, is flesh.”758 But He cannot be called a mere
man who was begotten not after the law of human creation alone. “For that which is conceived
in her,” said the angel, “is of the Holy Ghost.”759 And this even you dare not deny,
though you deny almost all the mysteries of salvation. Since then He was born of the Holy
Ghost, and cannot be termed a mere man, as He was conceived by the inspiration of God,
if it is not He who, as the Apostle says, “emptied Himself by taking the form of a servant,”
and “the word was made flesh,” and “humbled Himself by becoming obedient unto death,”
and “who for our sakes, though He was rich, became poor,”760 tell me, then, who He is, who
was born of the Holy Ghost, and was conceived by the overshadowing of God? You say that
He is certainly a different Person. Then there are two Persons; viz., the one, who was begotten
of God the Father in heaven; and the other who was conceived of Mary, by the inspiration
of God. And thus there is a fourth Person whom you introduce, and whom (though in words
you term Him a mere man) you assert actually not to have been a mere man, since you allow
(not however as you ought) that He is to be honoured, worshipped, and adored. Since then
the Son of God who was begotten of the Father is certainly to be worshipped, and He who
was conceived of Mary by the Holy Ghost is to be worshipped, you make two Persons to be
honoured and venerated, whom you so far sever from each other, as to venerate each with
an honour special and peculiar to Him. And thus you see that by denying and by severing
from Himself the Son of God, you destroy, as far as you can, the whole mystery of the divinity.
For while you are endeavouring to introduce a fourth Person into the Trinity,761 you see
that you have utterly denied the whole Trinity.</p>

<head>Those who are under an error in one point of the Catholic religion, lose the whole faith, and
all the value of the faith.</head>
<p>And since this is so, in denying that Jesus Christ the Son of God is one, you have denied
everything. For the scheme of the mysteries of the Church and the Catholic faith is such
that one who denies one portion of the Sacred Mystery cannot confess the other. For all
parts of it are so bound up and united together that one cannot stand without the other and
if a man denies one point out of the whole number, it is of no use for him to believe all the
others. And so if you deny that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, the result is that in denying
the Son of God you deny the Father also. For as St. John says: “He who hath not the Son
hath not the Father; but he who hath the Son hath the Father also.”762 By denying then Him
who was begotten you deny also Him who begat. By denying also that the Son of God was
born in the flesh, you are led also to deny that He was born in the Spirit, for it is the same
Person who was born in the flesh who was first born in the Spirit. If you do not believe that
He was born in the flesh, the result is that you do not believe that He suffered. If you do not
believe in His Passion what remains for you but to deny His resurrection? For faith in one
raised springs out of faith in one dead. Nor can the reference to the resurrection keep its
place, unless belief in His death has first preceded it. By denying then his Passion and Death,
you deny also his resurrection from hell.763 It follows certainly that you deny His ascension
also, for there cannot be the ascension without the resurrection. And if we do not believe
that He rose again, we cannot either believe that He ascended: as the Apostle says, “For He
that descended is the same also that ascended.”764 Thus, so far as you are concerned, the
Lord Jesus Christ did not rise from hell, nor ascend into heaven, nor sit at the right hand of
God the Father, nor will He come at that day of judgment which we look for, nor will He
judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>And so, you wretched, insane, obstinate creature, you see that you have utterly upset
the whole faith of the Creed, and all that is valuable in our hope and the mysteries. And yet
you still dare to remain in the Church: and imagine that you are a priest, though you have
denied everything by which you came to be a priest. Return then to the right way, and recover
your former mind, return to your senses if you ever had any. Come to your self, if there ever
was in you a self to which you can come back. Acknowledge the sacraments of your salvation,
by which you were initiated and regenerated. They are of no less use to you now than they
were then; for they can now regenerate you by penance, as they then gave you birth through
the Font. Hold fast the full scheme of the Creed. Hold the entire truth of the faith. Believe
in God the Father: believe in God the Son: in one who begat and one who was begotten, the
Lord of all, Jesus Christ; Being of one substance with the Father; Begotten in His divinity;
born in the flesh: of twofold birth, yet of but one glory; who Himself creator of all things,
was begotten of the Father, and was afterwards born of the Virgin.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<head>That the birth of Christ in time diminished nothing of the glory and power of His Deity.</head>
<p>For the fact that He came of the flesh and in the flesh, has reference to His birth, and
involves no diminution in Him: and He was simply born, not changed for the worse.765 For
though, still remaining in the form of God, He took upon Him the form of a servant, yet
the weakness of His human constitution had no effect on His nature as God: but while the
power of His Deity remained whole and unimpaired, all that took place in His human flesh
was an advancement of His manhood and no diminution of His glory. For when God was
born in human flesh, He was not born in human flesh in such a way as not to remain Divine
in Himself, but so that, while the Godhead remained as before, God might become man.
And so Martha while she saw with her bodily eyes the man, confessed Him by spiritual sight
to be God, saying, “Yea, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ the Son of the living
God, who art come into the world.”766 So Peter, owing to the Holy Spirit’s revelation, while
externally he beheld the Son of man, yet proclaimed Him to be the Son of God, saying,
“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”767 So Thomas when he touched the flesh,
believed that he had touched God saying, “My Lord and my God.”768 For they all confessed
but one Christ, so as not to make Him two. Do you therefore believe Him; and so believe
that Jesus Christ the Lord of all, both only Begotten and first-born, is both Creator of all
things and Preserver of men and that the same Person is first the framer of the whole world,
and afterwards redeemer of mankind? Who still remaining with the Father and in the
Father, Being of one substance with the Father, did (as the Apostle says), “Take the form of
a servant, and humble Himself even unto death, the death of the Cross:”769 and (as the
Creed says) “was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, and was buried.
And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven; and
shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead.” This is our faith; this is our salvation:
to believe that our God and Lord Jesus Christ is one and the same before all things and after
all things. For, as it is written, “Jesus Christ is yesterday and today and the same for ever.”770
For “yesterday” signifies all time past, wherein, before the beginning, He was begotten of
the Father. “Today” covers the time of this world, in which He was again born of the Virgin,

<head>He shows from what has been said that we do not mean that God was mortal or of flesh before
the worlds, although Christ, who is God from eternity and was made man in time, is but
one Person.</head>
<p>But perhaps you will say: If I admit that the same Person was in the end of time born
of a Virgin, who was begotten before all things of God the Father, I shall imply that before
the beginning of the world God was in the flesh, as I say that He was afterwards man, who
was always God: and so I shall say that that man who was afterwards born, had always existed.
I do not want you to be confused by this blind ignorance, and these obscure misconceptions,
so as to fancy that I am maintaining that the manhood771 which was born of Mary had existed
before the beginning of things, or asserting that God was always in a bodily form before
the commencement of the world. I do not say, I repeat it, I do not say that the manhood
was in God before it was born: but that God was afterwards born in the manhood. For that
flesh which was born of the flesh of the Virgin had not always existed: but God who always
was, came in the flesh of man of the flesh of the Virgin. For “the Word was made flesh,” and
did not manifest flesh together with Himself: but in the glory of Divinity joined Himself to
human flesh. For tell me when or where the Word was made flesh, or where He emptied
Himself by taking the form of a servant: or where He became poor, though He was rich?
Where but in the holy womb of the Virgin, where at His Incarnation, the Word of God is
said to have been made flesh, at His birth He truly took the form of a servant; and when He
is in human nature nailed to the Cross, He became poor, and was made poor in His sufferings
in the flesh, though He was rich in His Divine glory? Otherwise if, as you say, at some later
period the Deity entered into Him as into one of the Prophets and saints, then “the Word
was made flesh” in those men also in whom He vouchsafed to dwell: then in each one of
them He emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant. And thus there is
nothing new or unique in Christ. Neither His conception, nor His birth nor His death had
anything special or miraculous about it.</p>

even before His birth of a Virgin, and how is He proclaimed by prophets and apostles
as God even before the worlds? As Paul says: “One Lord Jesus, through whom are all
things.”772 And elsewhere he says: “For in Christ were created all things in heaven and on
earth, both visible and invisible.”773 The Creed too, which is framed both by human and
Divine authority, says: “I believe in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son.”
And after other clauses: “Very God of Very God; by whom both the worlds were framed
and all things were made.” And further: “Who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary,
and was crucified, and was buried.”</p>

<head>The hypostatic union enables us to ascribe to God what belongs to the flesh in Christ.</head>
<p>How then is Christ (whom you term a mere man) proclaimed in Holy Scripture to be
God without beginning, if by our own confession the Lord’s manhood774 did not exist before
His birth and conception of a Virgin? And how can we read of so close a union of man and
God, as to make it appear that man was ever co-eternal with God, and that afterwards God
suffered with man: whereas we cannot believe that man can be without beginning or that
God can suffer? It is this which we established in our previous writings; viz., that God being
joined to manhood,775 i.e., to His own body, does not allow any separation to be made in
men’s thoughts between man and God. Nor will He permit anyone to hold that there is one
Person of the Son of man, and another Person of the Son of God. But in all the holy Scriptures
He joins together and as it were incorporates in the Godhead, the Lord’s manhood,776 so
that no one can sever man from God in time, nor God from man at His Passion. For if you
regard Him in time, you will find that the Son of man is ever with the Son of God. If you
take note of His Passion, you will find that the Son of God is ever with the Son of man, and
that Christ the Son of man and the Son of God is so one and indivisible, that, in the language
of holy Scripture, the man cannot be severed in time from God, nor God from man at His
Passion. Hence comes this: “No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down
from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.”777 Where the Son of God while He
was speaking on earth testified that the Son of man was in heaven: and testified that the
same Son of man, who, He said, would ascend into heaven, had previously come down from
heaven. And this: “What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before,”
778 where He gives the name of Him who was born of man, but affirms that He ever
was up on high. And the Apostle also, when considering what happened in time, says that
all things were made by Christ. For he says, “There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
all things.”779 But when speaking of His Passion, he shows that the Lord of glory was crucified.
“For if,” he says, “they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.”780
And so too the Creed speaking of the only and first-begotten Lord Jesus Christ, “Very God
of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father, and the Maker of all things,” affirms

that He was born of the Virgin and crucified and afterwards buried. Thus joining in one
body (as it were) the Son of God and of man, and uniting God and man, so that there can
be no severance either in time or at the Passion, since the Lord Jesus Christ is shown to be
one and the same Person, both as God through all eternity, and as man through the endurance
of His Passion; and though we cannot say that man is without beginning or that God is
passible, yet in the one Person of the Lord Jesus Christ we can speak of man as eternal, and
of God as dead. You see then that Christ means the whole Person, and that the name represents
both natures, for both man and God are born, and so it takes in the whole Person so
that when this name is used we see that no part is left out. There was not then before the
birth of a Virgin the same eternity belonging in the past to the manhood as to the Divinity,
but because Divinity was united to manhood in the womb of the Virgin, it follows that when
we use the name of Christ one cannot be spoken of without the other.</p>

<head>That the figure Synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, is very familiar to the Holy
Scripture.</head>
<p>Whatever then you say of the Lord Jesus Christ, you say of the whole person, and in
mentioning the Son of God you mention the Son of man, and in mentioning the Son of
man you mention the Son of God: by the grammatical trope synecdoche in which you understand
the whole from the parts, and a part is put for the whole: and the holy Scriptures
certainly show this, as in them the Lord often uses this trope, and teaches in this way about
others and would have us understand about Himself in the same way. For sometimes days,
and things, and men, and times are denoted in holy Scripture in no other fashion. As in this
case where God declares that Israel shall serve the Egyptians for four hundred years, and
says to Abraham: “Know thou that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they
shall bring them under bondage and afflict them four hundred years.”781 Whereas if you
take into account the whole time after that God spoke, they are more than four hundred:
but if you only reckon the time in which they were in slavery, they are less. And in giving
this period indeed, unless you understand it in this way, we must think that the Word of
God lied (and away with such a thought from Christian minds!). But since from the time
of the Divine utterance, the whole period of their lives amounted to more than four hundred
years, and their bondage endured for not nearly four hundred, you must understand that
the part is to be taken for the whole, or the whole for the part. There is also a similar way of
representing days and nights, where, when in the case of either division of time one day is
meant, either period is shown by a portion of a single period. And indeed in this way the
difficulty about the time of our Lord’s Passion is cleared up: for whereas the Lord prophesied
that after the model of the prophet Jonah, the Son of man would be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth,782 and whereas after the sixth day of the week on which He
was crucified, He was only in hell783 for one day and two nights, how can we show the truth
of the Divine words? Surely by the trope of Synecdoche, i.e., because to the day on which
He was crucified the previous night belongs, and to the night on which He rose again, the
coming day; and so when there is added the night which preceded the day belonging to it,
and the day which followed the night belonging to it, we see that there is nothing lacking
to the whole period of time, which is made up of its portions. The holy Scriptures abound
in such instances of ways of speaking: but it would take too long to relate them all. For so
when the Psalm says, “What is a man that Thou art mindful of Him,”784 from the part we

understand the whole, as while only one man is mentioned the whole human race is meant.
So also where Ahab sinned we are told that the people sinned. Where—though all are
mentioned, a part is to be understood from the whole. John also the Lord’s forerunner says:
“After me cometh a man who is preferred before me for He was before me.”785 How then
does He mean that He would come after Him, whom He shows to be before Him? For if
this is understood of a man who was afterwards born, how was he before him? But if it is
taken of the Word how is it, “a man cometh after me?” Except that in the one Lord Jesus
Christ is shown both the posteriority of the manhood and the precedence of the Godhead.
And so the result is that one and the same Lord was before him and came after him: for according
to the flesh He was posterior in time to John; and according to His Deity was before
all men. And so he, when he named that man, denoted both the manhood and the Word,
for as the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God was complete in both manhood and Divinity786
in mentioning one of these natures in Him he denoted the whole person. And what need is
there of anything further? I think that the day would fail me if I were to try to collect or to
tell everything that could be said on this subject. And what we have already said is enough,
at any rate on this part of the subject, both for the exposition of the Creed, and for the requirements
of our case, and for the limits of our book.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to
teach a prayer to be used by those who undertake to dispute with heretics.</head>
<p>As it happens to those who having escaped the perils of the sea, are in terror of the sands
that stretch before the harbour, or the rocks that line the shore, so it is in my case that,—as
I have kept to the last some of the slanders of the heretics,—although I have reached the
limit of the work which I set myself, yet I am beginning to dread the close, which I had
longed to reach. But, as the Prophet says, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man
can do to me,”787 so we will not fear the pitfalls which crafty heretics have dug in front of
us, nor the paths thickly strewn with horrid thorns. For as they make our road difficult but
do not close it, there is before us the trouble of clearing them away, rather than the fear of
not being able to do so. For when, as we are walking feebly along the right road, they come
in our way, and frighten the walkers rather than hurt them, our work and business has more
to do in clearing them away, than to fear from the difficulty of this: And so, laying our hands
upon that monstrous head of the deadly serpent, and longing to lay hold of all the limbs
that are entangled in the huge folds and coils of his body, again and again do we pray to
Thee, O Lord Jesus, to whom we have ever prayed, that Thou wouldst give us words by
opening our mouth “to the pulling down of strongholds, destroying counsels, and every
height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
understanding unto Thine obedience:”788 for he is indeed free, who has begun to be led
captive by Thee. Do Thou then be present to this work of thine, and to those of Thine who
are striving for Thee above the measure of their strength. Grant us to bruise the gaping
mouths of this new serpent, and its neck that swells with deadly poison, O Thou who makest
the feet of believers to tread unharmed on serpents and scorpions, and to go upon the adder
and basilisk, to tread under foot the lion and the dragon.789 And grant that through the
fearless boldness of steadfast innocence, the sucking child may play on the hole of the asp,
and the weaned child thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk.790 Grant then to us also
that we may thrust our hands unharmed into the den of this monstrous and most wicked
basilisk; and if it has in any holes, i.e., in the human heart, a lurking or resting place, or has
laid its eggs there, or left a trace of its slimy course, do Thou remove from them all the foul
and deadly pollution of this most noxious serpent. Take away the uncleanness their blasphemy
has brought on them, and purify with the fan of Thy sacred cleansing791 the souls

that are plunged in stinking mud, so that the “dens of thieves” may become “houses of
prayer:”792 and that in those which are now, as is written, the dwellings where hedgehogs
and monsters,793 and satyrs, and all kinds of strange creatures dwell, there the gifts of Thy
Holy Spirit, namely the beauty of faith and holiness may shine forth. And as once Thou
didst destroy idolatry and cast out images, and make shrines of virtue out of the temples of
devils, and let into the dens of serpents and scorpions the rays of shining light, and make
out of the dens of error and shame the homes of beauty and splendour, so do Thou pour
upon all whose eyes the darkness of heretical obstinacy has blinded, the light of Thy compassion
and truth, that they may at length with clear and unveiled sight behold the great
and life-giving mystery of Thine Incarnation, and so come to know Thee to have been born
as Very man of that sacred womb of a pure Virgin, and yet to acknowledge that Thou wast
always Very God.</p>

<head>He meets the objection taken from these words: No one gave birth to one who had existed before
her.</head>
<p>And before I begin to speak of those things of which I have given no foretaste in the
earlier books, I think it right to try to carry out what I have already promised, that when I
have thoroughly redeemed my pledge, I may begin to speak more freely of what has not
been touched upon, after having satisfied my promise. So then that new serpent, in order
to destroy the faith of the holy nativity, hisses out against the Church of God and says: “No
one ever gives birth to one older than herself.” To begin with then I think that you know
neither what you say nor where you get it from. For if you knew or understood where you
got it from, you would never regard the nativity of the only begotten of God in the light of
human fancies, nor would you try to settle by merely human propositions, about Him who
was born without His conception originating from man: nor would you bring human impossibilities
as objections against Divine Omnipotence if you knew that with God nothing
was impossible. No one then, you say, gives birth to one older than herself. Tell me then, I
pray, of what cases are you speaking, for the nature of what creatures do you think that you
can lay down rules? Do you suppose that you can fix laws for men or beasts or birds or
cattle? Those (and others of the same kind) are the things of which such assertions can be
made. For none of them is able to produce one older than itself; for what has already been
produced cannot return to it again so as to be born again by a new creation. And so no one
can bear one older than herself, as no one can beget one older than himself: for the opportunity
of bearing only results where there is the possibility of begetting. Do you then imagine
that in reference to the nativity of Almighty God regard must be had to the same considerations
as in the birth of earthly creatures? And do you bring the nature of man’s conditions
as a difficulty in the case of Him who is Himself the author of nature? You see then that, as
I said above, you know not whence or of whom you are talking, as you are comparing
creatures to the Creator; and in order to calculate the power of God are drawing an instance
from those things which would never have existed at all, but that the very fact of their existence
comes from God. God then came as He would, when He would, and of her whom He
would. Neither time nor person, nor the manner of men, nor the custom of creatures was
any difficulty with Him; for the law of the creatures could not stand in the way of Him who
is Himself the Creator of them all. And whatever He would have possible was ready to His
hand, for the power of willing it was His. Do you want to know how far the omnipotence
of God extends, and how great it is? I believe that the Lord could do that even in the case of
His creatures which you do not believe that He could do in His own case. For all living
creatures which now bear things younger than themselves could, if only God gave the word,
bear things much older than themselves. For even food and drink, if it were God’s will, could

<pb n="1537"/>
be turned into the foetus and offspring: and even water, which has been flowing from the
beginning of things, and which all living creatures use, could, if God gave the word, be made
a body in the womb, and have birth given to it. For who can set a limit to divine works, or
circumscribe Divine Providence? or who (to use the words of Scripture) can say to Him
“What doest thou?”794 If you deny that God can do all things, then deny, that, when God
was born, one older than Mary could be born of her. But if there is nothing impossible with
God, why do you bring as an objection against His coming an impossibility, when you know
that for Him nothing is impossible in anything?</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who
bears.</head>
<p>The second blasphemous slander or slanderous blasphemy of your heresy is when you
say that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears. It is not very
different from the previous one, for it differs from it in terms rather than in fact and reality.
For when we are treating of the birth of God, you maintain that one of greater power could
not be born of Mary just as above you maintain than one older could not be begotten. And
so you may take it that the same answer may be given to this as to what you said before: or
you may conceive that the answer given to this assertion, which you are now making, applies
to that also. You say then that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one
who bears. If this refers to earthly creatures, it is most certainly the case. But if it refers to
the birth of God, why in the case of His birth do you regard precedents from nature? for
appointments are subject to Him who appointed them, and not the appointer to His appointments.
But would you like to know more fully how these slanders of yours are not only
wicked but foolish, and the idle talk of one who does not in the least see the omnipotence
of God? Tell me, I pray, you who think that like things can only be produced from like
things, whence was the origin of that unaccountable host of quails in the wilderness of old
time to feed the children of Israel, for nowhere do we read that they had been previously
born of mother birds, but that they were brought up and came suddenly. Again whence
came that heavenly food which for forty years fell on the camp of the Hebrews? Did manna
produce manna? But these refer to ancient miracles. And what of more recent ones? With
a few loaves and small fishes the Lord Jesus Christ fed countless hosts of the people that
followed Him, and not once only. The reason that they were satisfied lay not in the food:
for a secret and unseen cause satisfied the hungry folk, especially as there was much more
left when they were filled than there had been set before them when they were hungry. And
how was all this brought about that when those who ate were satisfied, the food itself was
multiplied by an extraordinary increase? We read that in Galilee wine was produced from
water. Tell me how what was of one nature produced something of an altogether different
substance from its own quality? Especially when (which exactly applies to the birth of the
Lord) it was the production of a nobler substance from what was inferior to it? Tell me then
how from mere water there could be produced rich and splendid wine? How was it that one
thing was drawn out, another poured in? Was the cistern a well of such a nature as to change
the water drawn from it into the best wine? Or did the character of the vessels or the diligence
of the servants effect this? Most certainly neither of these. And how is it that the manner of
the fact is not understood by the thoughts of the heart, though the truth of the fact is firmly
held by the conscience? In the gospel clay was placed on the eyes of a blind man and when

<pb n="1539"/>
it was washed off795 eyes were produced. Had water the power of giving birth to eyes, or
clay of creating light? Certainly not, especially as water could be of no use to a blind man,
and clay would actually hinder the sight of those who could see. And how was it that a thing
that itself in its own nature was injurious, became the means of restoring health; and that
what was ordinarily hurtful to sound people, was then made the instrument of healing? You
say that the power of God brought it about, and the remedy of God caused it, and that all
these things of which we have been speaking were simply brought about by Divine Omnipotence;
which is able to fashion new things from unwonted material, and to make serviceable
things out of their opposites, and to change what belongs to the realm of things impossible
and impracticable into possibilities and actual performances.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as well as in everything else.</head>
<p>Confess then the same truth in respect of the actual nativity of the Lord, as in respect
of everything else. Believe that God was born when He would, for you do not deny that He
could do what He would; unless possibly you think that that power which belonged to Him
for all other things was deficient as regards Himself, and that His Omnipotence though
proceeding from Him and penetrating all things, was insufficient to bring about His own
nativity. In the case of the Lord’s nativity you bring this as an objection against me: No one
gives birth to one who is anterior in time: and in regard of the birth which Almighty God
underwent you say that the one who is born ought to be of one substance with the one who
bears; as if you had to do with human laws as in the case of any ordinary man, to whom you
might bring the impossibility as an objection, as you include him in the weakness of earthly
things. You say that for all men there are common conditions of birth, and but one law of
generation; and that a thing could not possibly happen to one man only out of the whole
of humanity, which God has forbidden to happen to all. You do not understand of whom
you are speaking; nor do you see of whom you are talking; for He is the Author of all conditions,
and the very Law of all natures, through whom exists whatever man can do, and
whatever man cannot do: for He certainly has laid down the limits of both; viz., how far his
powers should extend, and the bounds beyond which his weakness should not advance.
How wildly then do you bring human impossibilities as an objection in the case of Him,
who possesses all powers and possibilities. If you estimate the Person of the Lord by earthly
weaknesses, and measure God’s Omnipotence by human rules, you will most certainly fail
to find anything which seems appropriate to God as concerns the sufferings of His Body.
For if it can seem to you unreasonable that Mary could give birth to God who was anterior
to her, how will it seem reasonable that God was crucified by men? And yet the same God
who was crucified Himself predicted: “Shall a man afflict God, for you afflict Me?”796 If
then we cannot think that the Lord was born of a Virgin because He who was born was anterior
to her who bore Him, how can we believe that God had blood? And yet it was said to
the Ephesian elders: “Feed the Church of God which He has purchased with His own
Blood.”797 Finally how can we think that the Author of life was Himself deprived of life:
And yet Peter says: “Ye have killed the Author of life.”798 No one who is set on earth can
be in heaven: and how does the Lord Himself say: “The Son of man who is in heaven”?799

<pb n="1541"/>
If then you think that God was not born of a Virgin because the one who is born must be
of one substance with the one who bears, how will you believe that different things can be
produced from different natures? Thus according to you the wind did not suddenly bring
the quails, nor did the manna fall, nor was water turned into wine nor were many thousands
of men fed with a few loaves, nor did the blind man receive his sight after the clay had been
put on him. But if all these things seem incredible and contrary to nature, unless we believe
that they were wrought by God, why should you deny in the matter of His nativity, what
you admit in the matter of His works? Or was He unable to contribute to His own nativity
and advent what He did not refuse for the succour and profit of men?</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz.,
that the one born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, fails to hold good
in many cases.</head>
<p>It would be tedious and almost childish to speak further on this subject. But still in order
to refute that folly and madness of yours, in which you maintain that the one born ought
to be of one substance with the one who bears, i.e., that nothing can produce something of
a different nature to itself, I will bring forward some instances of earthly things, to convince
you that many creatures are produced from things of a different nature. Not that it is possible
or right to make any comparison in such a case as this: but that you may not doubt the
possibility of that happening in the case of the holy Nativity, which as you see takes place
in these frail earthly things. Bees, tiniest of creatures though they are, are yet so clever and
cunning that we read that they can be produced and spring from things of an entirely different
nature. For as they are creatures of marvellous intelligence, and well endowed not merely
with sense but with foresight, they are produced from the gathered flowers of plants. What
greater instance do you think can be produced and quoted? Living creatures are produced
from inanimate: sensate from insensate.800 What artificer, what architect was there? Who
formed their bodies? Who breathed in their souls? Who gave them articulate sounds by
which to converse with each other? Who fashioned and arranged these harmonies of their
feet, the cunning of their mouths, the neatness of their wings? Their powers, wrath, foresight,
movements, calmness, harmony, differences, wars, peace, arrangements, contrivances,
business, government, all those things indeed which they have in common with men—from
whose teaching, or whose gift did they receive them? from whose implanting or instruction?
Did they gain this through generation? or learn it in their mother’s womb or from her flesh?
They never were in the womb, and had no experience of generation. It was only that flowers
which they culled were brought into the hive and from this by a marvellous contrivance
bees issued forth.801 Then the womb of the mother imparted nothing to the offspring: nor
are bees produced from bees. They are but their artificers, not their authors. From the
blossoms of plants living creatures proceed. What is there akin in plants and animals? I
fancy then that you see who is the contriver of those things. Go now and inquire whether
the Lord could bring about that in the case of His own nativity, which you see that He procured
in the case of these tiniest of creatures. Perhaps it is needless after this to add anything
<note type="footnote">800 Ex inanimis ex insensibilibus sensibilia nascuntur (Petschenig). The text of Gazæus has ex atomis animalia
nascuntur.</note>
<note type="footnote">801 Cf. Virgil’s Georgics IV. Rufinus, on the Apostle’s Creed (c. xi.) gives the same illustration of the Incarnation,

further. But still let us add in support of the argument what may not be necessary to prove
the point. We see how the air is suddenly darkened, and the earth filled with locusts. Show
me their seed—their birth—their mothers. For, as you see, they proceed thence, whence
they have their birth. Assert in all these cases that the one who is born must be of one substance
with the one who bears. And in these assertions you will be shown to be as silly, as
you are wild in your denial of the Nativity of the Lord. And what next? Do even you think
that we must go on any further? But still we will add something else. There is no doubt that
basilisks are produced from the eggs of the birds which in Egypt they call the Ibis. What is
there of kindred or relationship between a bird and a serpent? Why is the thing born not of
one substance with that which bears it? And yet those who bear are not the authors of all
these things, nor do those who are born understand them: but they result from secret causes,
and from some inexplicable and manifold law of nature which produces them. And you are
bringing as objections to His Nativity your petty assertions from earthly notions, while you
cannot explain the origin of those things, which are produced by His bidding and command,
whose will does everything, whose sway causes everything: whom nothing can oppose or
resist; and whose will is sufficient for everything which can possibly be done.</p>

<head>He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried to make out that Christ was like
Adam in every point.</head>
<p>But since we cannot (as we should much prefer) ignore them, it is now time to expose
the rest of your more subtle and insidious blasphemies that at least they may not deceive
ignorant folk. In one of your pestilent treatises you have maintained and said that “Since
man is the image of the Divine nature, and the devil dragged this down and shattered it,
God grieved over His image, as an Emperor over his statue, and repairs the shattered image:
and formed without generation a nature from the Virgin, like that of Adam who was born
without generation; and raises up man’s nature by means of man: for as by man came death,
so also by man came the resurrection of the dead.” They tell us that some poisoners have a
custom of mixing honey with the poison in the cups which they prepare; that the injurious
ingredient may be concealed by the sweet: and while a man is charmed with the sweetness
of the honey, he may be destroyed by the deadly poison. So then, when you say that man is
the image of the Divine nature, and that the devil dragged this down and shattered it, and
that God grieved over His image as an Emperor over his statue, you smear (so to speak) the
lips of the cup with something sweet like honey, that men may drain the cup offered to
them, and not perceive its deadliness, while they taste what is alluring. You put forward
God’s name, in order to speak falsehoods in the name of religion. You set holy things in the
front, in order to persuade men of what is untrue: and by means of your confession of God
you contrive to deny Him whom you are confessing. For who is there who does not see
whither you are going? What you are contriving? You say indeed that God grieved over His
image as an Emperor over his statue, and repaired the shattered image, and formed without
generation a nature from the Virgin, like that of Adam who was born without generation,
and raises up man’s nature by man, for as by man came death, so also by man came the resurrection
of the dead. So then with all your earnestness, with all your professions, you crafty
plotter, you have managed by your smooth assertions, by naming God in the forefront, to
come down to a (mere) man in the conclusion: and in the end you degrade Him to the
condition of a mere man, from whom under colour of humility you have already taken away
the glory of God. You say then that the Divine goodness has restored the image of God
which the devil shattered and destroyed, for you say that He restores the shattered image.
Now with what craft you say that He restores the shattered image in order to persuade us
that there was nothing more in Him, in whom the image is restored, than there was in the
actual image, of which the restoration was brought about. And thus you make out that the
Lord is only the same as Adam was: that the restorer of the image is nothing more than the
actual destructible image. Finally in what follows you show what you are aiming and driving
at, when you say that He formed without generation a nature from the Virgin like that of

<pb n="1545"/>
Adam, who was born without generation, and raises up man’s nature by man. You maintain
that the Lord Jesus Christ was in all respects like Adam: that the one was without generation,
and the other without generation: the one a mere man, and the other a mere man. And thus
you see that you have carefully guarded and provided against our thinking of the Lord Jesus
Christ as in any way greater or better than Adam: since you have compared them together
by the same standard, so that you would think that you detracted something from Adam’s
perfection, if you added anything more to Christ.</p>

<head>Heretics usually cover their doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.</head>
<p>“For as,” you say, “by man came death, so by man came also the resurrection of the
dead.” Do you actually try to prove your wrong and impious notion by the witness of the
Apostle? And do you bring the “chosen vessel” into disgrace by mixing him up with your
wicked ideas? I mean, that, as you cannot understand the author of your Salvation, therefore
the Apostle must be made out to have denied God. And yet, if you wanted to make use of
Apostolic witnesses, why did you rest contented with one, and pass over all the others in
silence? and why did you not at once add this: “Paul, an Apostle not of men neither by man,
but by Jesus Christ:”802 or this: “We speak wisdom among the perfect:” and presently:
“Whom none,” says he, “of the princes of this world knew; for had they known, they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory.”803 Or this: “For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily.”804 And: “One Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things.”805 Or do
you partly agree, and partly disagree with the Apostle, and only receive him so far as in
consequence of the Incarnation806 he names Christ man, and repudiate him where he speaks
of Him as God? For Paul does not deny that Jesus is man, but still he confesses that man is
God: and declares that to mankind the resurrection came by man in such a way that he
shows that in that man God arose. For see whether he declares that He who rose was God,
as he bears his witness that He who was crucified was the Lord of glory.</p>

<head>The heretics attribute to Christ only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be
worshipped together with God but not as God.</head>
<p>But still in order to avoid thinking of the Lord Jesus as one of the whole mass of people,
you have given to Him some glory, by attributing to Him honour as a saint, but not Deity
as true man and true God. For what do you say? “God brought about the Lord’s Incarnation.
Let us honour the form of the Theodochos807 together with God, as one form of Godhead,
as a figure that cannot be severed from the Divine link, as an image of the unseen God.”
Above you said that Adam was the image of God, here you call Christ the image: the one
you speak of as a statue, and the other also as a statue. But I suppose we ought for God’s
honour to be grateful to you, because you grant that the form of the Theodochos should be
worshipped together with God: in which you wrong Him rather than honour Him. For in
this you do not attribute to the Lord Jesus Christ the glory of Deity, but you deny it. By a
subtle and wicked art you say that He is to be worshipped together with God in order that
you may not have to confess that He is God, and by the very statement in which you seem
deceitfully to join Him with God, you really sever Him from God. For when you blasphemously
say that He is certainly not to be adored as God, but to be worshipped together with
God, you thus grant to Him an union of nearness to Divinity, in order to get rid of the truth
of His Divinity. Oh, you most wicked and crafty enemy of God, you want to perpetrate the
crime of denying God under pretext of confessing Him. You say: Let us worship Him as a
figure that cannot be severed from the Divine will, as an image of the unseen God. It is I
suppose, then, owing to His kind acts that our Lord Jesus Christ has obtained among us
honour as Creator and Redeemer. If then we were redeemed by Him from eternal destruction,
in calling our Redeemer a figure we are endeavouring indeed to respond to His kindness
and goodness, by a worthy service and a worthy allegiance, if we try to get rid of that glory
which He did not refuse to bring low for our sakes.</p>

<head>How those are wrong who say that the birth of Christ was a secret, since it was clearly shown
even to the patriarch Jacob.</head>
<p>But I suppose you excuse the degradation offered to the Lord by means of a subordinate
honour, by the words “as the image of the secret God.” By the fact that you term Him an
image you compare Him to man’s estate. In speaking of Him as the image of the secret God,
you detract from the honour plainly due to Him. For “God,” says David, “shall plainly come;
our God, and shall not keep silence.”808 And He surely came and did not keep silence, who
before that He in His own person uttered anything after His birth, made known His advent
by both earthly and heavenly witnesses alike, while the star points Him out, the magi adore
Him, and angels declare Him. What more do you want? His voice was yet silent on earth,
and His glory was already crying aloud in heaven. Do you say then that God was and is
secret in Him? But this was not the announcement of the Prophets, of the Patriarchs, aye
and of the whole Law. For they did not say that He would be secret, whose coming they all
foretold. You err in your wretched blindness, seeking grounds for blasphemy and not finding
them. You say that He was secret even after His advent. I maintain that He was not secret
even before His advent. For did the mystery of God to be born of a Virgin escape the
knowledge of that celebrated Patriarch on whom the vision of God present with him conferred
a title, whereby from the name of Supplanter he rose to the name of Israel? Who,
when from the struggle with the man who wrestled with him he understood the mystery of
the Incarnation yet to come, said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”809
What, I pray you, had he seen, for him to believe that he had seen God? Did God manifest
Himself to him in the midst of thunder and lightning? or when the heavens were opened,
did the dazzling face of the Deity show itself to him? Most certainly not: but rather on the
contrary he saw a man and acknowledged a God. O truly worthy of the name he received,
as with the eyes of the soul rather than of the body he earned the honour of a title given by
God! He saw a human form wrestling with him, and declared that he saw God. He certainly
knew that human form was indeed God: for in that form in which God then appeared, in
the selfsame form He was in very truth afterwards to come. Although why should we be

surprised that so great a patriarch unhesitatingly believed what God Himself so plainly
showed in His own Person to him, when he said, “I have seen God face to face and my life
is preserved.” How did God show to him so much of the presence of Deity, that he could
say that the face of God was shown to him? For it seems that only a man had appeared to
him, whom he had actually beaten in the struggle. But God was certainly bringing this about
by precursory signs, that there might not be any one to disbelieve that God was born of
man, when already long before the Patriarch had seen God in human form.</p>

<p>But why am I lingering so long over one instance, as if many were wanting? For even
then how could the fact that God was to come in the flesh escape the knowledge of men,
when the Prophet said openly as if to all mankind of Him: “Behold your God;” and elsewhere:
“Behold our God.” And this: “God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince
of Peace;” and: “of His kingdom there shall be no end.”810 But also when He had already
come, could the fact of His having come escape the knowledge of those who openly confessed
that He had come? Was Peter ignorant of the coming of God, when he said, “Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God?”811 Did not Martha know what she was saying or whom
she believed in, when she said, “Yea, Lord, I have believed that Thou art the Christ, the Son
of the living God, who art come into this world?”812 And all those men, who sought from
Him the cure of their sicknesses, or the restoration of their limbs, or the life of their dead,
did they ask these things from man’s weakness, or from God’s omnipotence?</p>

<head>How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that Christ was God.</head>
<p>Finally as for the devil himself, when he was tempting Him with every show of allurements,
and every art of his wickedness, what was it that in his ignorance he suspected, or
wanted to find out by tempting Him? Or what so greatly moved him, that he sought God
under the humble form of man? Had he learned that by previous proofs? Or had he known
of anyone who came as God in man’s body? Most certainly not. But it was by the mighty
evidence of signs, by mighty results of actions, by the words of the Truth Himself that he
was driven to suspect and examine into this matter: inasmuch as he had already once heard
from John: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who taketh away the sin of the world.”813
And again from the same person: “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to
me?”814 The dove also which came down from heaven and stopped over the Lord’s head
had made itself a clear and open proof of a God who declared Himself. The voice too which
was sent from God not in riddles or figures had moved him, when it said: “Thou art My
beloved Son, in Thee I am well pleased.”815 And though he saw a man outwardly in Jesus,
yet he was searching for the Son of God, when he said: “If Thou art the Son of God, command
that these stones be made bread.”816 Did the contemplation of the man drive away the
devil’s suspicions of His Divinity, so that owing to the fact that he saw a man, he did not
believe that He could be God? Most certainly not. But what does he say? “If Thou art the
Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” Certainly he had no doubt about
the possibility of that, the existence of which he was examining into. His anxiety was about
its truth. There was no security as to its impossibility.</p>

man. And why did this seem to him not enough for him to be secure in? Why did he believe
that He could not be God, whom he knew to be very man? Learn then, you wretched madman,
learn, you lunatic, you cruel sinner, learn, I pray, even from the devil, to lessen your
blasphemy. He said: “If Thou art the Son of God.” You say: “Thou art not the Son of God.”

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head>How the devil always retained this notion of Christ’s Divinity (because of His secret working
which he experienced) even up to His Cross and Death.</head>
<p>But perhaps he afterwards ceased and rested, and when his temptations were vanquished
laid aside his suspicion because he found no result? Nay, it rather remained always in him,
and even up to the very cross of the Lord the suspicion lasted in him and was increased by
peculiar terrors. What need is there of anything further? Not even then did he cease to think
of Him as the Son of God, after that he knew that such licence was granted to His persecutors
against Him. But the crafty foe saw even in the midst of His bodily sufferings the signs of
Divinity, and though he would have much preferred Him to be a (mere) man, was yet forced
to suspect that He was God: for though he would have preferred to believe what he wanted,
yet he was driven by surest proofs to that which he feared. And no wonder: for although he
beheld Him spitted on, and scourged, and disgraced, and led to the Cross, yet he saw Divine
powers abounding even in the midst of the indignities and wrongs; when the veil of the
temple is rent, when the sun hides itself, the day is darkened, and all things feel the effects
of the Passion: all things even, which know not God, acknowledge the work of Deity. And
therefore the devil seeing this, and trembling, tried in every way to arrive at the knowledge
of His Godhead, even at the very death of the manhood, saying in the person of those who
crucified Him: “If He be the Son of God, let Him come down now from the Cross, and we
will believe Him.”817 He certainty perceived that by His bodily Passion our Lord God was
working out the redemption of man’s salvation, and also that by it he was being destroyed
and subdued, while we were being redeemed and saved. And so the enemy of mankind
wanted by every means and every wile to defeat that which he knew was being done for the
redemption of all men. “If,” he says, “He be the Son of God, let Him come down now from
the Cross and we will believe Him:” on purpose that the Lord might be moved by the reproach
of the words, and destroy the mystery, while He avenged the wrong. You see then that the
Lord even when hanging on the Cross was termed the Son of God. You see that they suspect
the fact to which they refer. And so do you learn, as I said above, even from His persecutors,
even from the devil, to believe on the Son of God. Who ever came up to the unbelief of the
devil? Who went beyond it? He suspected that He was the Son of God even when He endured
death. You deny it even when He has risen. He suspected that He was God, from whom He
hid Himself. You, to whom He has proved it, deny it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<head>He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying to the argument drawn from the
Apostle’s words, “Without father, without mother,” etc.: Heb. vii.</head>
<p>You then make use of the holy Scriptures against God, and try to bring His own witnesses
against Him. But how? Truly so as to become a false accuser not only of God, but of the
evidences themselves. Nor indeed is it wonderful that, as you cannot do what you want, you
only do what you can: as you cannot turn the sacred witnesses against God, you do what
you can, and pervert them. For you say: Then Paul tells a lie, when he says of Christ: “Without
mother, without genealogy.”818 I ask you, of whom do you think that Paul said this? Of the
Son and Word of God, or of the Christ, whom you separate from the Son of God, and blasphemously
assert to be a mere man? If of the Christ, whom you maintain to be a mere man,
how could a man be born without a mother and without a genealogy on the mother’s side?
But if of the Word of God and Son of God—what can we make of it, when the same Apostle,
your own witness, as you impiously imagine, testifies in the same place and by the same
witness, that He whom you assert to be without mother, was also without father; saying,
“Without father, without mother, without genealogy”? It follows then that if you use the
Apostle’s witness, since you assert that the Son of God was “without mother,” you must also
be guilty of the blasphemy that He was “without father.” You see then in what a downfall
of impiety you have landed yourself, in your eagerness for your perversity and wickedness,
so that, while you say that the Son of God had not a mother, you must also deny Him a
Father—a thing which no one yet since the world began, except perhaps a madman, ever
did. And this, whether with greater wickedness or folly, I hardly know; for what is more
foolish and silly than to give the name of Son and to try to keep back the name of Father?
But you say I don’t keep it back, I don’t deny it. And what madness then drove you to quote
that passage, where, while you say that He had no mother, you must seem also to deny to
Him a Father? For as in the same passage He is said to be without mother and also without
father, it follows that if it can be understood that there He is without mother, in the same
way in which we understand that He is without mother, we must also believe that He is
without father. But that hasty craze for denying God did not see this; and when it quoted
mutilated, what was written entire, it failed to see that the shameless and palpable lie could
be refuted by laying open the contents of the sacred volume. O foolish blasphemy, and
madness! which, while it failed to see what it ought to follow, had not the wit to see even
what could be read: as if, because it could get rid of its own intelligence, it could get rid of
the power of reading from everybody else, or as if everybody would lose their eyes in their
heads for reading, because it had lost the eyes of the mind. Hear then, you heretic, the passage
<note type="footnote">818 Heb. vii. 3.</note>

<pb n="1555"/>
you have garbled: hear in full and completely, what you quoted mutilated and hacked about.
The Apostle wants to make clear to every one the twofold birth of God—and in order to
show how the Lord was born in the Godhead and in flesh, he says, “Without father, without
mother:” for the one belongs to the birth of Divinity, the other to that of the flesh. For as
He was begotten in His Divine nature “without mother,” so He is in the body “without
father:” and so though He is neither without father nor without mother, we must believe in
Him “without father and without mother.” For if you regard Him as He is begotten of the
Father, He is without mother: if, as born of His mother, He is without father. And so in each
of these births He has one: in both together He is without each: for the birth of Divinity had
no need of mother, and for the birth of His body, He was Himself sufficient, without a
father. Therefore says the Apostle “Without mother, without genealogy.”</p>

<head>How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without genealogy.</head>
<p>How does he say that the Lord was “without genealogy,” when the Gospel of the Evangelist
Matthew begins with the Saviour’s genealogy, saying: “The book of the generations
of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham”?819 Therefore according to the
Evangelist He has a genealogy, and according to the Apostle, He has not: for according to
the Evangelist, He has it on the mother’s side, according to the Apostle He has not, as He
springs from the Father. And so the Apostle well says: “Without father, without mother,
without genealogy:” and where he lays down that He was begotten without mother, there
also he records that He was without genealogy. And thus as regards both the nativities of
the Lord, the writings of the Evangelist and of the Apostle agree together. For according to
the Evangelist He has a genealogy “without father,” when born in the flesh: and according
to the Apostle, the Lord has not, when begotten in His Divine nature “without mother;” as
Isaiah says: “But who shall declare His generation?”820</p>

<head>He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.</head>
<p>Why then, you heretic, did you not in this way quote the whole and entire passage which
you had read? So you see that the Apostle laid down that the Lord was “without mother” in
the same way in which he laid down that He was born “without father:” that we might know
that He is “without mother” in the same way in which we understand Him to be “without
father.” And as it is impossible to believe Him to be altogether “without father,” so we cannot
understand that He is altogether “without mother.” Why then, you heretic, did you not in
this way quote what you had read in the Apostle, entire and unmutilated? But you insert
part, and omit part; and garble the words of truth in order that you may be able to build up
your false notions by your wicked act. I see who was your master. We must believe that you
had his instruction, whose example you are following. For so the devil in the gospel when
tempting the Lord said: “If Thou art the Son of God, cast Thyself down. For it is written
that He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee to keep Thee in all Thy ways.”821 And
when he had said this, he left out the context and what belongs to it; viz., “Thou shalt walk
upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon.”822
Surely he cunningly quoted the previous verse and left out the latter: for he quoted the one
to deceive Him: he held his tongue about the latter to avoid condemning himself. For he
knew that he himself was signified by the asp and basilisk, the lion and dragon in the
Prophet’s words. So then you also bring forward a part and omit a part; and quote the one
to deceive; and omit the other for fear lest if you were to quote the whole, you might condemn
your own deception. But it is now time to pass on to further matters, for by dwelling too
long on particular points, as we are led to do by the desire of giving a full answer, we exceed
the limits even of a longish book.</p>

<head>That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as
to deny that it proceeds from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him,
was another’s and proceeded from another source.</head>
<p>You say then in another discussion, nay rather in another blasphemy of yours, “and He
separated823 the Spirit from the Divine nature Who created His humanity. For Scripture
says that that which was born of Mary is of the Holy Ghost.824 Who also filled with righteousness
(justitia) that which was created: for it says ‘He appeared in the flesh, was justified
in the Spirit.’825 Again: Who made Him also to be feared by the devils: ‘For I,’ He says, ‘by
the Spirit of God cast out devils.’826 Who also made His flesh a temple. ‘For I saw His spirit
descending like a dove and abiding upon Him.’827 Again: Who granted to Him His ascension
into Heaven. For it says, “Giving a commandment to the apostles whom He had chosen, by
the Holy Ghost He was taken up.”828 Finally that it was He who granted such glory to
Christ.” The whole of your blasphemy then consists in this: that Christ had nothing of
Himself: nor did He, a mere man, as you say, receive anything from the Word, i.e., the Son
of God; but everything in Him was the gift of the Spirit. If then we can show that all that
which you refer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom
you therefore would have taken to be a man, because as you say everything which He has
is another’s, is therefore God, because everything which He has is His own? And indeed we
will prove this not only by discussion and argument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for
nothing testifies of God better than things divine. And because nothing knows itself better
than the very glory of God, we believe nothing on the subject of God with greater right than
those writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First then, as to this that you say
that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it simply, if we could acknowledge
that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do we deny that
the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was
conceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we can say that His
Humanity829 was created for Himself by the Son of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in
holy Scripture, testifying that “Wisdom hath builded for Itself a house.”830 You see then

<pb n="1559"/>
that that which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by the Son of God:
not that the work of the Son of God is one thing, and the work of the Holy Ghost another:
but that through the unity of the Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the
building of the Son of God; and the building of the Son of God is the co-operation of the
Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, but also
that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin; that since Wisdom Itself is the
fulness of the Godhead, no one might doubt that when Wisdom built Itself a house all the
fulness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your blasphemy, while
it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is entirely severing the nature
of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you believe that the house is therefore built for
Him by the Holy Ghost because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of building for
Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He, whom we believe to
have created the whole universe of things heavenly and earthly by His will, was unable to
build for Himself a body: especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the
Divinity and Glory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of
anything at all in One Person of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fulness of the
Godhead. Therefore when this is laid down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of
holy Scripture, when the Holy Ghost came upon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most
High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house; the rest of the slanders of your
blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made all things by Himself
and in Himself, in whose name and faith, the faith even of believers can do anything. For
neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have trusted in
His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the Spirit, and that the
Spirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy
Ghost, and that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous and
wild: not because we are to believe that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity
and cooperation of the Spirit was wanting—since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself,
and the power of the Trinity was ever present in the Saviour’s works—but because you will
have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to the Lord Jesus Christ as if He had been feeble
and powerless; and that He granted those things to Him, which He was unable to procure
for Himself. Learn then from sacred witnesses to believe God, and not to mingle falsehood
with truth: for the subject does not admit it, and common sense abhors the idea of mingling
the notions of the spirit of the devil with the witnesses that are Divine.</p>

<head>How we are to understand the Apostle’s words: “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the
Spirit,” etc.</head>
<p>For to begin with this assertion of yours that the Spirit filled with righteousness (justitia)
what was created, and your attempts to prove this by the evidence of the Apostle, where he
says that “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,” you make each statement in
an unsound sense and wild spirit. For you make this assertion; viz., that you will have it that
He was filled with righteousness by the Spirit, in order to show how He was void of righteousness,
as you assert that the being filled with it was given to Him. And as for your use
of the evidence of the Apostle on this matter, you garble the arrangement and meaning of
the sacred passage. For the Apostle’s statement is not as you have quoted it, mutilated and
spoilt. For what says the Apostle? “And evidently great is the mystery of Godliness, which
was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit.”831 You see then that the Apostle
declared that the mystery or sacrament of Godliness was justified. For he was not so forgetful
of his own words and teaching as to say that He was void of righteousness, whom he had
always proclaimed as righteousness, saying: “Who was made unto us righteousness and
sanctification and redemption.”832 Elsewhere also he says: “But ye were washed, but ye were
justified, but ye were sanctified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”833 How far then from
Him was it to need being filled with righteousness, as He Himself filled all things with
righteousness, and for His glory to be without righteousness, whose very name justifies all
things. You see then how foolish and wild are your blasphemies, since you are trying to take
away from our Lord what is ever shed forth by Him upon all believers in such a way that
still in its continuous supply it is never diminished.</p>

<head>That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.</head>
<p>You say too that the Spirit made Him to be feared by the devils. To reject and refute
which, even though the horrible character of the utterance is enough, we will still add some
instances. Tell me, I pray, you who say that the fact that the devils feared Him was not His
own doing but another’s, and who will have it that this was not His own power but a gift,
how was it that even His name had that power, of which He Himself was, according to you,
void? How was it that in His name devils were cast out, sick persons were cured, dead men
were raised? For the Apostle Peter says to that lame man who was sitting at the beautiful
gate of the Temple: “In the name of Jesus Christ arise and walk.”834 And again in the city
of Joppa to the man who had been lying on his bed paralysed for eight years he says, “Æneas,
may the Lord Jesus Christ heal thee: arise and make thy bed for thyself.”835 Paul too says to
the pythonical spirit: “I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her,” and the
devil came out of her.836 But understand from this how utterly alien this weakness was from
our Lord: for I do not call even those weak, whom He by His name made strong, since we
never heard of any devil or infirmity able to resist any of the apostles since the Lord’s resurrection.
How then did the Spirit make Him to be feared, who made others to be feared? Or
was He in Himself weak, whose faith even through the instrumentality of others reigned
over all things? Finally those men who received power from God, never used that power as
if it were their own: but referred the power to Him from whom they received it: for the
power itself could never have any force except through the name of Him who gave it. And
so both the apostles and all the servants of God never did any thing in their own name, but
in the name and invocation of Christ: for the power itself derived its force from the same
source as its origin, and could not be given through the instrumentality of the ministers,
unless it had come from the Author. You then—who say that the Lord was the same as one
of His servants (for as the apostles had nothing but what they received from their Lord, so
you make out that the Lord Himself had nothing but what He received from the Spirit; and
thus you make out that everything that He had, He had not as Lord, but had received it as
a servant), do you tell me then, how it was that He used this power as His own and not as
something which He had received? For what do we read of Him? He says to the paralytic:
“Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thine house.”837 And again to a father who pleads on behalf
of his child, He says: “Go thy way: thy son liveth.”838 And where an only son of his mother

was being carried forth for burial, “Young man,” He says, “I say unto thee Arise.”839 Did
He then like those who received power from God, ask that power might be given to Him
for performing these things by the invocation of the Divine Name? Why did He not Himself
work by the name of the Spirit, just as the apostles wrought by His Name? Finally, what
does the gospel itself state about Him? It says: “He was teaching them as one that had authority,
and not like the Scribes and Pharisees.”840 Or do you make out that He was so proud
and haughty as to put to the credit of His own might the power which (according to you)
He had received from God? But what do we make of the fact that the power never submitted
to His servants, except through the name of its author, and could have no efficacy if the
actor claimed any of it as his own?</p>

raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils.”841 And again: “In My name,” He says,
“ye shall cast out devils.”842 Had He any need of Another’s name for the exercise of His
power, who made His own name to be a power? But what is still added? “Behold,” He says,
“I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of
the enemy.”843 He Himself says that He was gentle, as indeed He was, and humble in heart.
And how was it that as regards the greatest possible power, He commanded others to work
in His own name, if He Himself worked in Another’s name? Or did He give to others, as if
it were His own, what He Himself, according to you, did not possess, unless He received it
from Another? But tell me, which of the saints receiving power from God, so worked? Or
would not Peter have been thought a lunatic, or John a madman, or Paul out of his mind,
if they had said to any sick folk: “In our name arise;” or to the lame: “In our name walk;” or
to the dead: “In our name live;” or this to some: “We give you power to tread upon serpents
and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy”? You see then from this your madness:
for just as these words are mad if they spring from man’s assurance, so are you utterly mad
if you do not see that they come from Divine power. For you must admit one of two alternatives;
either that man could possess and give Divine power, or at any rate if no man can
do this, that He who could do it, was God. For no one can grant of His liberality Divine
power, except Him who possesses it by nature.</p>

<head>That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy Ghost that His flesh and Humanity
became the temple of God.</head>
<p>But there follows in your blasphemy that His flesh was made a temple of the Holy Ghost,
for this reason, that John has said: “For I saw the Spirit descending from heaven and abiding
upon Him.”844 For you try to support even this wild statement of yours by Scriptural authority:
wherefore let us see whether this sacred authority has said that which you say. “For I
saw,” it says, “the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding upon Him.” Discern here, if
you can, which is the more powerful, which greater, which more to be honoured? He who
descended, or He to whom the descent was made? He who brought down the honour, or
He to whom the honour was brought? Where do you find in this passage that the Spirit
made His flesh a temple? or wherein does it lessen the honour of God, if God Himself descended
to show God to mankind? For certainly we ought not to think that He is less whose
high estate was pointed out, than He who pointed out His high estate. But away with the
thought of believing or making any separation in the Godhead: for one and the same Godhead
and equal power shut out altogether the wicked notion of inequality. And so in this matter,
where there is the Person of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and where it
is the Son of God to whom the descent is made, the Spirit who descends, the Father who
gives His witness, no one had more honour, and no one received any slight, but it all redounds
equally to the fulness of the Godhead, for each Person of the Trinity contains within Himself
the glory of the whole Trinity. And so nothing further needs to be said, except only to show
the rise and origin of your blasphemy. For thorns and thistles springing up from the roots
produce shoots of their own nature, and from their character show their origin. So then you
also, a thorny offshoot of the Pelagian heresy, show in germ just the same that your father
is said to have had in the root. For he845 (as Leporius his follower said) declared that our
Lord was made the Christ by His baptism: you say that at His baptism He was made the
temple of God by the Spirit. The words are not altogether identical: but the wrong-headedness
is altogether the same.</p>

<head>That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.</head>
<p>But you add this also to those impieties of yours mentioned above; viz., that the Spirit
granted to the Lord His ascension into heaven: showing by this blasphemous notion of yours
that you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was so weak and powerless that had not the
Spirit raised Him up to heaven, you fancy that He would still at this day have been on earth.
But to prove this assertion you bring forward a passage of Scripture: for you say “Giving
commands to the apostles whom He had chosen, by the Holy Ghost He was raised up.”846
What am I to call you? What am I to think of you who by corrupting the sacred writings
contrive that their evidences should not have the force of evidences? A new kind of audacity,
which strives by its impious arguments to manage that truth may seem to confirm falsehood.
For the Acts of the Apostles does not say what you make out. For what says the Scripture?
“What Jesus began to do and to teach until the day in which giving charge to the apostles
whom He had chosen by the Holy Ghost, He was taken up.” Which is an instance of Hyperbaton,
and must be understood in this way: what Jesus began to do and to teach until the
day in which he was taken up, giving charge to the apostles whom He had chosen by the
Holy Ghost; so that we ought not perhaps to have to give you any further answer in this
matter than that of the passage itself, for the entire passage ought to be sufficient for the full
truth, if the mutilation of it was available for your falsehood. But still, you, who think that
our Lord Jesus Christ could not have ascended into heaven, unless He had been raised up
by the Spirit; tell me how is it that He Himself says “No one hath ascended into heaven but
He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven”?847 Confess then
how foolish and absurd your notion is that He could not ascend into heaven, who is said,
although He had descended into earth, never to have been absent from heaven: and say
whether to leave the regions below and ascend into heaven was possible for Him to whom
it was easy when still on earth, ever to continue in heaven. But what is that which He Himself
says: “I ascend unto my Father.”848 Did He imply that in this ascension there would be the
intervention of Another’s help, who by the very fact that He said He would ascend, shows
the efficacy of His own power? David also says of the Ascension of the Lord: “God ascended
with a merry noise, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet:”849 He clearly explained the
glory of Him who ascends by the power of the ascension.</p>

<head>He continues the same argument to show that Christ had no need of another’s glory as He
had a glory of His own.</head>
<p>But to end let us see the addition with which you sum up your preceding blasphemies.
Your words are, “Who gave such850 glory to Christ?” You name glory in order to degrade
Him. For by the assertion that the Lord was endowed with glory, in saying that He received
it you blasphemously imply that He stood in need of it. For your perverse notion suggests
that the generosity of the giver shows the need of the receiver. O miserable impiety of yours!
and where is that which Divinity itself once foretold of the Lord Jesus Christ ascending into
heaven? Saying: “Lift up your heads, and the King of glory shall come in.”851 And when He
(after the fashion of Divine utterances) had made answer to Himself as if in the character
of an inquirer: “Who is the King of glory?” at once He adds: “The Lord strong and mighty,
the Lord mighty in battle:” showing under the figure of a battle fought, the victory of the
Lord in His triumph. Then when, to complete the exposition of it, He had repeated the
words of the utterance quoted above, He showed by the following conclusion the majesty
of the Lord as He entered heaven, saying “The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.” On
purpose that the fact of His taking a body might not interfere with the glory of His mighty
Divinity, He taught that the same Person was Lord of hosts and King of heavenly glory,
whom He had previously proclaimed Victor in the battle below. Go now852 and say that
the glory was given to the Lord, when both prophecy has said that He was the King of glory,
and He Himself also has testified of Himself as follows: “When the Son of man shall come
in His glory.”853 Refute it, if you can, and contradict this; viz., that whereas He testifies that
He has glory of His own, you say that He has received Another’s. Although we maintain
that He has His own glory, in such a way that we do not deny that His very property of glory
is common to Him with the Father and the Holy Ghost. For whatever God possesses belongs
to the Godhead: and the kingdom of glory belongs to the Son of God in such a way that it
is not kept back from belonging to the entire Godhead.</p>

<head>He supports this doctrine by the authority of the blessed Hilary.</head>
<p>But it is quite time to finish the book, aye and the whole work, if I may however add
the sayings of a few saintly men and illustrious priests, to support by the faith of the present
day what we have already proved by the authority of holy Scripture. Hilary, a man endowed
with all virtues and graces, and famous for his life as well as for his eloquence, who also, as
a teacher of the churches and a priest, advanced not only by his own merits but also by the
progress of others, and remained so steadfast during the storms of persecution that through
the fortitude of his unconquered faith he attained the dignity of being a Confessor,854—he
testifies in the First book on the faith that the Lord Jesus Christ, Very God of Very God, was
both begotten before the world, and afterwards born as man. Again in the Second book:
“One only Begotten God grew in the womb of the holy Virgin into the form of a human
body; He who contains all things, and in whose power all things are, is brought forth according
to the law of human birth.” Again in the same book: “An angel is witness that He who
is born is God with us.” Again in the Tenth book: “We have taught the mystery of God born
as man by the birth from the Virgin.” Again in the same book: “For when God was born as
man, He was not born on purpose not to remain God.”855 Again in the same writer’s preface
to his exposition of the gospel according to Matthew:856 “For to begin with it was needful
for us that for our sakes the only Begotten God should be known to be born as man.” Again
in what follows: “that besides being God, He should be born as man, which He was not yet.”
Again in the same place: “Then this third matter was fitting: that as God was born as man
in the world” etc.: Here are a few passages out of any number. But still you see even from
these which we have quoted, how clearly and plainly he asserts that God was born of Mary.
And where then is this saying of yours: “The creature could not bring forth the Creator: and
that which is born of the flesh, is flesh.” It would take too long to quote passages bearing on
this point from each separate writer. I must try to enumerate them rather than to explain
them: for they will sufficiently explain themselves.</p>

<head>He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary.</head>
<p>Ambrose, that illustrious priest of God, who never leaving the Lord’s hand, ever shone
like a jewel upon the finger of God, thus speaks in his book to the Virgins: “My brother is
white and ruddy.857 White because He is the glory of the Father: ruddy because He was
born of the Virgin. But remember that in Him the tokens of Divinity are of longer standing
than the mysteries of the body. For He did not begin to exist from the Virgin, but He who
was already in existence, came into the Virgin.”858 Again on Christmas Day: “See the miracle
of the mother of the Lord: A Virgin conceived, a Virgin brought forth. She was a Virgin
when she conceived, a Virgin when with child, a Virgin after the birth. As is said in Ezekiel:
“And the gate was shut and not opened, because the Lord passed through it.”859 A splendid
Virginity, and wondrous fruitfulness! The Lord of the world is born: and there are no cries
from her who brought Him forth. The womb is left empty, and a true child is born, and yet
the Virginity is not destroyed. It was right that when God was born the power of chastity
should become greater, and that her purity should not be violated by the going forth of Him
who had come to heal what was corrupt.”860 Again in his exposition of the gospel according
to Luke he says that “one was especially chosen, to bring forth God, who was espoused to
an husband.”861 He certainly declares that God was born of the Virgin. He calls Mary the
mother of God. And where is that awful and execrable utterance of yours asking how can
she be the mother of one of a different nature from her own. But if she is called mother by
them, it is the human nature which was born not the Godhead. So, that illustrious teacher
of the faith says both that she who bare Him was human, and that He who was born is God:
and yet that this is no reason for unbelief, but only a miracle of faith.</p>

<head>He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome.</head>
<p>Jerome, the Teacher of the Catholics, whose writings shine like divine lamps throughout
the whole world, says in his book to Eustochium: “The Son of God for our salvation was
made the Son of man. He waits ten months in the womb to be born: and He, in whose hand
the world is held, is contained in a narrow manger.”862 Again in his commentary on Isaiah:
“For the Lord of hosts, who is the King of glory, Himself descended into the Virgin’s womb,
and entered in and went forth from the East Gate which is ever shut.”863 Of whom Gabriel
says to the Virgin: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High
shall overshadow thee. Wherefore that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called
the Son of God.” And in Proverbs: “Wisdom hath builded herself an house.”864 Compare
this if you please with your doctrine or rather your blasphemy, in which you assert that God
is the Creator of the months, and was not an offspring of months. For lo, Jerome, a man of
the greatest knowledge and also of the most pure and approved doctrine testifies almost in
the very words in which you deny that the Son of God was an offspring of months, that He
was an offspring of months. For he says that He waits ten months in the womb to be born.
But perhaps the authority of this man seems a mere nothing to you. You may take it that
every one says the same and in the same words, for whoever does not deny that the Son of
God is the offspring of the Virgin, admits that He is the offspring of months.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<head>To the foregoing he adds Rufinus and the blessed Augustine.</head>
<p>Rufinus also, a Christian philosopher, with no mean place among Ecclesiastical Doctors
testifies as follows of the Lord’s Nativity in his Exposition of the Creed. “For the Son of
God,” he says, “is born of a Virgin, not chiefly allied to the flesh alone, but generated in the
soul which is the medium between the flesh and God.”865 Does he witness obscurely that
God was born of man? Augustine the priest866 of Hippo Regiensis says: “That men might
be born of God, God was first born of them: for Christ is God. And Christ when born of
men only required a mother on earth, because He always had a Father in heaven, being born
of God through whom we are made, and also born of a woman, through whom we might
be re-created.”867 Again, in this place: “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
Why then need you wonder that men are born of God? Notice how God Himself was born
of men.” Again in his Epistle to Volusianus: “But Moses himself and the rest of the prophets
most truly prophesied of Christ the Lord, and gave Him great glory: they declared that He
would come not as one like themselves, nor merely greater in the same sort of power of
working miracles, but clearly as the Lord God of all, and as made man for men. Who
therefore Himself also willed to do such things as they did to prevent the absurdity of His
not doing Himself those things which He did through them. But still it was right also for
Him to do something special; viz., to be born of a Virgin, to rise from the dead, to ascend
into heaven. And if anyone thinks that this is too little for God, I know not what more he
can look for.868</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<head>As he is going to produce the testimony of Greek or Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the
first place S. Gregory Nazianzen.</head>
<p>But perhaps because those whom we have enumerated came from different parts of the
world, their authority may seem to you less valuable. An absurd thing, indeed, because faith
is not interfered with by place, and we have to consider what a man is, not where: especially
since religion unites all together, and those who are in the one faith may be also known to
be in the one body. But still we will bring forward for you some, whom you cannot despise,
even from the East. Gregory, that most grand light of knowledge and doctrine, who though
he has been for some time dead, yet still lives in authority and faith, and though he has been
for some time removed in the body from the Churches, yet has not forsaken them in word
and authority. “When then,” he says, “God had come forth from the Virgin, in that human
nature which He had taken, as He existed in one out of two which are the opposite of each
other; viz., flesh and spirit, the one is taken into God, the other exalts into the grace of
Deity.869 O new and unheard of intermingling! O marvellous and exquisite union! He who
was, came to be, and the Creator is created: and He who is infinite is embraced by the soul
which is the medium between God and the flesh: and He who makes all rich, is made poor.”
Again he says of the Epiphany: “But what happens? What is done concerning us and for us?
There is brought about some new and unheard of change of natures and God is made man.”
Again in this passage:870 “The Son of God began to be also the Son of man, not being changed
from what He was, for He is unchangeable, but taking to Himself what He was not: for He
is pitiful so that He, who could not be embraced, can now be embraced.” You see how
grandly and nobly he asserts the majesty of His Godhead so that He may bring in the condescension
of the Incarnation: for that admirable teacher of the faith knew well that of all
the blessings which God granted to us at His coming into the world this was the chief,
without diminishing in any way His glory. For whatever God gave to man, ought to increase
the love of Him in us, and not to lessen the honour which we give to Him.</p>

<head>In the next place he puts the authority of S. Athanasius.</head>
<p>Athanasius also, priest of the city of Alexandria, a splendid instance of constancy and
virtue, whom the storm of heretical persecution tested without crushing him: whose life
was always like a clear glass, and who had almost obtained the reward of martyrdom before
attaining the dignity of confessorship: Let us see what was his view of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the mother of the Lord. “This then,” he says, “is the mind and stamp of Holy Scripture,
as we have often said; viz., that in one and the same Saviour two things have to be understood:
(1) that He was ever God, and is Son, Word, and Light, and Wisdom of the Father, and (2)
that afterwards for our sakes He took flesh of the Virgin Mary the Theotocos, and was made
man.”871 Again after some other matter: “Many then were saints and clean from sin:
Jeremiah also was sanctified from the womb, and John, while still in the womb leapt for joy
at the voice of Mary the Theotocos.”872 He certainly says that God, the Son of God, who (to
declare the faith of all in his words) is “the Word, and Light and Wisdom of the Father,”
took flesh for our sakes; and therefore he calls the Virgin Mary Theotocos, because she was
the Mother of God.</p>

<head>He adds also S. John Chrysostom.</head>
<p>As for John the glory of the Episcopate of Constantinople, whose holy life obtained the
reward of martyrdom without any show of Gentile persecution, hear what he thought and
taught on the Incarnation of the Son of God: “And Him,” he says, “whom if He had come
in unveiled Deity neither the heaven nor the earth nor the sea nor any other creature could
have contained, the pure womb of a Virgin bore.”873 This man’s faith and doctrine then,
even if you ignore that of others, you ought to follow and hold, as out of love and affection
for him the pious people chose you as their Bishop. For when it took you for its priest from
the Church of Antioch, from which it had formerly chosen him, it believed that it would
receive in you all that it had lost in him.874 Did not, I ask you, all these almost with prophetic
spirit say all these things in order to confound your blasphemies. For you declare that
our Lord and Saviour Christ is not God: they declare that Christ the Lord is Very God. You
blasphemously assert that Mary is Christotocos not Theotocos: they do not deny that she
is Christotocos, while they acknowledge her as Theotocos. Not merely the substance but
the words also are opposed to your blasphemies: that we may clearly see that an impregnable
bulwark was formerly prepared by God against your blasphemies, to break on the wall of
truth ready prepared, the force of the heretical attack which was at some time or other to
come. And you, O you most wicked and shameless contaminator of an illustrious city, you
disastrous and deadly plague of a Catholic and holy people, do you dare to stand and teach
in the Church of God, and with your wild and blasphemous words slander the priests of an
ever unbroken faith and Catholic confession, and say that the people of the city of Constantinople
are in error through the fault of their earlier teachers? Are you then the corrector
of former Bishops, the accuser of ancient priests, are you better than Gregory, more approved
than Nectarius, greater than John,875 and all the other Bishops of Eastern cities who, though
not of the same renown as those whom I have enumerated, were yet of the same faith? which,
<note type="footnote">873 The passage has not been identified with any now extant in the writings of S. Chrysostom.</note>
<note type="footnote">874 S. Chrysostom had been taken from Antioch for the Bishopric of Constantinople: and after the death of
Sisinnius in 426, as there was so much rivalry and party spirit displayed at Constantinople, the Emperor determined
that none of that Church should fill the vacant see, but sent for Nestorius from Antioch, where he had
already gained a great reputation for eloquence (cf. Socrates H. E. VII. xxix.). It is to the fact that both S.
Chrysostom and Nestorius came from the same city that Cassian alludes in the text.</note>
<note type="footnote">875 The reference is to Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople from 379 to 381 when he retired in the

<head>He bemoans the unhappy lot of Constantinople, owing to the misfortune which has overtaken
it from that heretic; and at the same time he urges the citizens to stand fast in the ancient
Catholic and ancestral faith.</head>
<p>Wherefore I also, humble and insignificant as I am in name as in desert, and although
I cannot claim a place as Teacher among those illustrious Bishops of Constantinople, yet
venture to claim the zeal and enthusiasm of a disciple. For I was admitted into the sacred
ministry by the Bishop John, of blessed memory, and offered to God, and even though I am
absent in body yet I am still there in heart: and though by actual presence I no longer mix
with that most dear and honourable people of God, yet I am still joined to them in spirit.
And hence it comes that condoling and sympathizing with them, I broke out just now into
the utterance of our common grief and sorrow, and in my weakness cried out (which was
all that I could do) by means of the dolorous lamentation of my works, as if for my own
limbs and members: for if as the Apostle says, when the smaller part of the body is grieved,
the greater part grieves and sympathizes with it,876 how much more should the smaller part
sympathize when the greater part is grieved? It is indeed utterly inhuman for the smaller
parts not to feel the sufferings of the greater in one and the same body, if the greater feel
those of the smaller. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, you who live within the circuit of
Constantinople, and who are my fellow-citizens through the love of my country, and my
brothers through the unity of the faith; separate yourselves from that ravening wolf who (as
it is written) devours the people of God, as if they were bread.877 Touch not, taste not anything
of his, for all those things lead to death. Come out from the midst of him and be ye
separate and touch not the unclean thing. Remember your ancient teachers, and your priests;
Gregory whose fame was spread through the world, Nectarius renowned for holiness, John
a marvel of faith and purity. John, I say; that John who like John the Evangelist was indeed
a disciple of Jesus and an Apostle; and so to speak ever reclined on the breast and heart of
the Lord. Remember him, I say. Follow him. Think of his purity, his faith, his doctrine, and
holiness. Remember him ever as your teacher and nurse, in whose bosom and embraces
you as it were grew up. Who was the teacher in common both of you and of me: whose
disciples and pupils we are. Read his writings. Hold fast his instruction. Embrace his faith
and merits. For though to attain this is a hard and magnificent thing: yet even to follow is
beautiful and sublime. For in the highest matters, not merely the attainment, but even the
attempt to copy is worthy of praise. For scarcely anyone entirely misses all parts in that to
which he is trying to climb and reach. He then should ever be in your minds and almost in

your sight: he should live in your hearts and in your thoughts. He would himself commend
to you this that I have written, for it was he who taught me what I have written: and so do
not think of this as mine, so much as his: for the stream comes from the spring, and whatever
you think belongs to the disciple, ought all to be referred to the honour of the master. But,
beyond and above all I pray with all my heart and voice, to Thee, O God the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that Thou wouldest fill with the gift of Thy love whatever we have written
by Thy bounteous grace. And because, as the Lord our God Thine Only Begotten Son
Himself taught us, Thou hast so loved this world as to send Thine Only Begotten Son to
save the world, grant to Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed that in the Incarnation of
Thine Only Begotten Son they may perceive both Thy gift and His love: and that all may
understand the truth that for us Thine Only Begotten, our Lord God, was born and suffered
and rose again, and may so love it that the condescension of His glory may increase our
love: and let not His Humility lead to a diminution of His honour in the hearts of all men,
but let it ever produce an increase of love: and may we all rightly and wisely comprehend
the blessings of His Sacred Compassion, so as to see that we owe the more to God, in proportion
as for our sakes God humbled Himself yet lower.</p>

<head>NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. This volume contains selected works
of St. Basil the Great. St. Basil is well-known for his care for the poor and his important
impact upon the communal practices of the monastic life. The Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating
texts from some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually
enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive
and fruitful even today!</p>

is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each

ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. Several works of St. Ambrose are
collected in this volume. Along with St. Gregory the Great, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine,
St. Ambrose is considered one of the original Doctors of the Church. He played an important
role in the conversion of St. Augustine. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers are comprehensive

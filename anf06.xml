<head>ANF06. Fathers of the Third Century: Gregory
Thaumaturgus, Dionysius the Great, Julius Africanus,
Anatolius, and Minor Writers, Methodius,
Arnobius</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. This
volume harmonizes various fragmentary material. It contains
the work of different authors: St. Gregory Thaumaturgus,
Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Sextus Julius Africanus, St.
Anatolius, Pope Peter of Alexandria, and others. These
writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for
good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging.
These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing
the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-
Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to
one's reading list.</p>

<p>The Oration and Panegyric Addressed to Origen. 51</p>
<p>For Eight Years Gregory Has Given Up the Practice of Oratory, Being Busied 
with the Study Chiefly of Roman Law and the Latin Language.51</p>
<p>He Essays to Speak of the Well-Nigh Divine Endowments of Origen in His 
Presence, into Whose Hands He Avows Himself to Have Been Led in a Way
Beyond All His Expectation.53</p>
<p>He is Stimulated to Speak of Him by the Longing of a Grateful Mind. To the 
Utmost of His Ability He Thinks He Ought to Thank Him. From God are the
Beginnings of All Blessings; And to Him Adequate Thanks Cannot Be
Returned.56</p>
<p>The Son Alone Knows How to Praise the Father Worthily. In Christ and by 
Christ Our Thanksgivings Ought to Be Rendered to the Father. Gregory Also
Gives Thanks to His Guardian Angel, Because He Was Conducted by Him
to Origen.58</p>
<p>Here Gregory Interweaves the Narrative of His Former Life. His Birth of 
Heathen Parents is Stated. In the Fourteenth Year of His Age He Loses His
Father. He is Dedicated to the Study of Eloquence and Law. By a Wonderful
Leading of Providence, He is Brought to Origen.60</p>
<p>The Arts by Which Origen Studies to Keep Gregory and His Brother 
Athenodorus with Him, Although It Was Almost Against Their Will; And
the Love by Which Both are Taken Captive. Of Philosophy, the Foundation
of Piety, with the View of Giving Himself Therefore Wholly to that Study,
Gregory is Willing to Give Up Fatherland, Parents, the Pursuit of Law, and
Every Other Discipline. Of the Soul as the Free Principle. The Nobler Part
Does Not Desire to Be United with the Inferior, But the Inferior with the
Nobler.64</p>

<pb n="iv"/>
<p>The Wonderful Skill with Which Origen Prepares Gregory and Athenodorus 
for Philosophy. The Intellect of Each is Exercised First in Logic, and the Mere
Attention to Words is Contemned.68</p>
<p>Then in Due Succession He Instructs Them in Physics, Geometry, and 
Astronomy.71</p>
<p>But He Imbues Their Minds, Above All, with Ethical Science; And He Does 
Not Confine Himself to Discoursing on the Virtues in Word, But He Rather
Confirms His Teaching by His Acts.72</p>
<p>Hence the Mere Word-Sages are Confuted, Who Say and Yet Act Not. 
Origen is the First and the Only One that Exhorts Gregory to Add to His 
Acquirements the Study of Philosophy, and Offers Him in a Certain Manner
an Example in Himself. Of Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude.75</p>
<p>The Maxim, Know Thyself.74</p>
<p>Gregory Disallows Any Attainment of the Virtues on His Part. Piety is Both 
the Beginning and the End, and Thus It is the Parent of All the Virtues.78</p>
<p>The Method Which Origen Used in His Theological and Metaphysical 
Instructions. He Commends the Study of All Writers, the Atheistic Alone
Excepted. The Marvellous Power of Persuasion in Speech. The Facility of the
Mind in Giving Its Assent.80</p>
<p>Whence the Contentions of Philosophers Have Sprung. Against Those Who 
Catch at Everything that Meets Them, and Give It Credence, and Cling to It.
Origen Was in the Habit of Carefully Reading and Explaining the Books of
the Heathen to His Disciples.82</p>
<p>The Case of Divine Matters. Only God and His Prophets are to Be Heard in 
These. The Prophets and Their Auditors are Acted on by the Same Afflatus.
Origen's Excellence in the Interpretation of Scripture.85</p>
<p>Gregory Laments His Departure Under a Threefold Comparison; Likening 
It to Adam's Departure Out of Paradise. To the Prodigal Son's Abandonment
of His Father's House, and to the Deportation of the Jews into Babylon.87</p>
<p>Gregory Consoles Himself. 90</p>
<p>Peroration, and Apology for the Oration. 91</p>
<p>Apostrophe to Origen, and Therewith the Leave-Taking, and the Urgent 
Utterance of Prayer.92</p>

<p>Of the Manichæans. 572</p>
<p>The Excellence of the Christian Philosophy; The Origin of Heresies Amongst 
Christians.572</p>
<p>The Age of Manichæus, or Manes; His First Disciples; The Two Principles; 
Manichæan Matter.573</p>
<p>The Fancies of Manichæus Concerning Matter. 574</p>
<p>The Moon's Increase and Wane; The Manichæan Trifling Respecting It; Their 
Dreams About Man and Christ; Their Foolish System of Abstinence.
The Worship of the Sun and Moon Under God; Support Sought for the 576
Manichæans in the Grecian Fables; The Authority of the Scriptures and Faith
Despised by the Manichæans.575</p>
<p>The Two Principles of the Manichæans; Themselves Controverted; The 
Pythagorean Opinion Respecting First Principles; Good and Evil Contrary; The
Victory on the Side of Good.577</p>
<p>Motion Vindicated from the Charge of Irregularity; Circular; Straight; Of 
Generation and Corruption; Of Alteration, and Quality Affecting Sense.578</p>
<p>Is Matter Wicked? Of God and Matter. 579</p>
<p>The Ridiculous Fancies of the Manichæans About the Motion of Matter Towards 
God; God the Author of the Rebellion of Matter in the Manichæan Sense; The580</p>

<pb n="xv"/>
<p>Longing of Matter for Light and Brightness Good; Divine Good None the Less
for Being Communicated.</p>
<p>The Mythology Respecting the Gods; The Dogmas of the Manichæans Resemble 
This: the Homeric Allegory of the Battle of the Gods; Envy and Emulation
Existing In God According to the Manichæan Opinion; These Vices are to Be
Found in No Good Man, and are to Be Accounted Disgraceful.581</p>
<p>The Transmitted Virtue of the Manichæans; The Virtues of Matter Mixed with 
Equal or Less Amount of Evil.582</p>
<p>The Destruction of Evil by the Immission of Virtue Rejected; Because from It 
Arises No Diminution of Evil; Zeno's Opinion Discarded, that the World Will
Be Burnt Up by Fire from the Sun.583</p>
<p>Evil by No Means Found in the Stars and Constellations; All the Evils of Life 
Vain in the Manichæan Opinion, Which Bring on the Extinction of Life; Their
Fancy Having Been Above Explained Concerning the Transportation of Souls
from the Moon to the Sun.584</p>
<p>Noxious Animals Worshipped by the Egyptians; Man by Arts an Evil-Doer; 
Lust and Injustice Corrected by Laws and Discipline; Contingent and Necessary
Things in Which There is No Stain.585</p>
<p>The Lust and Desire of Sentient Things; Demons; Animals Sentient; So Also 
the Sun and the Moon and Stars; The Platonic Doctrine, Not the Christian.586</p>
<p>Because Some are Wise, Nothing Prevents Others from Being So; Virtue is to 
Be Acquired by Diligence and Study; By a Sounder Philosophy Men are to Be
Carried Onwards to the Good; The Common Study of Virtue Has by Christ
Been Opened Up to All.587</p>
<p>The Manichæan Idea of Virtue in Matter Scouted; If One Virtue Has Been 
Created Immaterial, the Rest are Also Immaterial; Material Virtue an Exploded
Notion.588</p>
<p>Dissolution and Inherence According to the Manichæans; This is Well Put, Ad 
Hominem, with Respect to Manes, Who is Himself in Matter.589</p>
<p>The Second Virtue of the Manichæans Beset with the Former, and with New 
Absurdities; Virtue, Active and Passive, the Fashioner of Matter, and Concrete
with It; Bodies Divided by Manichæus into Three Parts.590</p>
<p>The Divine Virtue in the View of the Same Manichæus Corporeal and Divisible; 
The Divine Virtue Itself Matter Which Becomes Everything; This is Not Fitting.591</p>
<p>Some Portions of the Virtue Have Good in Them, Others More Good; In the 
Sun and the Moon It is Incorrupt, in Other Things Depraved; An Improbable
Opinion.592</p>

<pb n="xvi"/>
<p>The Light of the Moon from the Sun; The Inconvenience of the Opinion that 
Souls are Received in It; The Two Deluges of the Greeks.593</p>
<p>The Image of Matter in the Sun, After Which Man is Formed; Trifling Fancies; 
It is a Mere Fancy, Too, that Man Is Formed from Matter; Man is Either a
Composite Being, or a Soul, or Mind and Understanding.594</p>
<p>Christ is Mind, According to the Manichæans; What is He in the View of the 
Church? Incongruity in Their Idea of Christ; That He Suffered Only in
Appearance, a Dream of the Manichæans; Nothing is Attributed to the Word
by Way of Fiction.596</p>
<p>The Manichæan Abstinence from Living Things Ridiculous; Their Madness in 
Abhorring Marriage; The Mythology of the Giants; Too Allegorical an
Exposition.597</p>
<p>The Much-Talked-of Fire of the Manichæans; That Fire Matter Itself. 598</p>

<head>Introductory Notice.</head>
<p>In this volume a mass of fragmentary material1 has been reduced to method, and so
harmonized as to present an integral result. The student has before him, therefore, (1) a
view of the Christian Church emerging from the ten persecutions; (2) a survey of its condition
on the eve of that great event, the (nominal) conversion of the empire; (3) an introduction
to the era of Athanasius; and (4) a history of events that led to the calling of the first Catholic
council at Nicæa.</p>
<p>The moral grandeur and predominance of the See of Alexandria are also here conspicuously
illustrated. The mastery which its great school continued to exercise over Christian
thought, hegemony in the formation of Christian literature, its guardian influence in the
development of doctrinal technology, and not less the Divine Providence that created it and
built it up for the noble ends which it subserved in a Clement, an Origen, and an Athanasius,
will all present themselves forcibly to every reflecting reader of this book. One half of this
volume presents the Alexandrian school itself in its glorious succession of doctors and pupils,
and the other half in the reflected light of its universal influence. Thus Methodius has no
other distinction than that which he derives from his wholesome corrections of Origen, and
yet the influence of Origen upon his own mind is betrayed even in his antagonisms. He
objects to the excessive allegorizing of that great doctor, yet he himself allegorizes too much
in the same spirit. Finally we come to Arnobius, who carries on the line of Latin Christianity
in Northern Africa; but even here we find that Clement, and not Tertullian, is his model.
He gives us, in a Latin dress, not a little directly borrowed from the great Alexandrian.
This volume further demonstrates—what I have so often touched upon—the historic
fact that primitive Christianity was Greek in form and character, Greek from first to last,
Greek in all its forms of dogma, worship, and polity. One idea only did it borrow from the
West, and that not from the ecclesiastical, but the civil, Occident. It conformed itself to the
imperial plan of exarchates, metropoles, and dioceses. Into this civil scheme it shaped itself,
not by design, but by force of circumstances, just as the Anglo-American communion fell
in with the national polity, and took shape in dioceses each originally conterminous with a
State. Because it was the capital of the empire, therefore Rome was reckoned the first, but
not the chief, of Sees, as the Council of Nicæa declared; and because Byzantium had become
“New Rome,” therefore it is made second on the list, but equal in dignity. Rome was the sole
Apostolic See of the West, and, as such, reflected the honours of St. Paul, its founder, and
of St. Peter, who also glorified it by martyrdom; but not a word of this is recognised at Nicæa
as investing it even with a moral primacy. That was informally the endowment of Alexandria;
<note type="footnote">1 See the Edinburgh series.</note>

unasserted because unquestioned, and unchallenged because as yet unholy ambition had
not infected the Apostolic churches.</p>
<p>It is time, then, to disabuse the West of its narrow ideas concerning ecclesiastical history.
Dean Stanley rebuked this spirit in his Lectures on the Eastern Church.2 He complained that
“Eastern Christendom is comparatively an untrodden field;” he quoted the German proverb,3
“Behind the mountains there is yet a population;” he called on us to enlarge our petty Occidental
horizon; and he added words of reproach which invite us to reform the entire scheme
of our ecclesiastical history by presenting the Eastern Apostolic churches as the main stem
of Christendom, of which the church of Rome itself was for three hundred years a mere
colony, unfelt in theology except by contributions to the Greek literature of Christians, and
wholly unconscious of those pretensions with which, in a spirit akin to that of the romances
about Arthur and the Round Table, the fabulous Decretals afterwards invested a succession
of primitive bishops in Rome, wholly innocent of anything of the kind.</p>
<p>“The Greek Church,” says Dean Stanley, “reminds us of the time when the tongue, not
of Rome, but of Greece, was the sacred language of Christendom. It was a striking remark
of the Emperor Napoleon, that the introduction of Christianity itself was, in a certain sense,
the triumph of Greece over Rome; the last and most signal instance of the maxim of Horace,
Græcia capta ferum victorem cepit. The early Roman church was but a colony of Greek
Christians or Grecized Jews. The earliest Fathers of the Western Church wrote in Greek.
The early popes were not Italians, but Greeks. The name of pope is not Latin, but Greek, the
common and now despised name of every pastor in the Eastern Church.…She is the mother,
and Rome the daughter. It is her privilege to claim a direct continuity of speech with the
earliest times; to boast of reading the whole code of Scripture, Old as well as New, in the
language in which it was read and spoken by the Apostles. The humblest peasant who reads
his Septuagint or Greek Testament in his own mother-tongue on the hills of Boeotia may
proudly feel that he has access to the original oracles of divine truth which pope and cardinal
reach by a barbarous and imperfect translation; that he has a key of knowledge which in the
West is only to be found in the hands of the learned classes.”</p>
<p>Before entering on the study of this volume, the student will do well to read the interesting
work which I have quoted;4 but the following extract merits a place just here, and I
cannot deprive even the casual reader of the benefit of such a preface from the non-ecclesiastical
and purely literary pen of the Dean. He says:5 “The See of Alexandria was then the

most important in the world.6…The Alexandrian church was the only great seat of Christian
learning. Its episcopate was the Evangelical See, as founded by the chair of St. Mark.…Its
occupant, as we have seen, was the only potentate of the time who bore the name of pope.7
After the Council of Nicæa he became the judge of the world, from his decisions respecting
the celebration of Easter; and the obedience paid to his judgment in all matters of learning,
secular and sacred, almost equalled that paid in later days to the ecclesiastical authority of
the popes of the West. ‘The head of the Alexandrian church,’ says Gregory Nazianzen, ‘is
the head of the world.’”</p>
<p>In the light of these all-important historic truths, these volumes of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers have been elucidated by their American editor.8 He begs to remind his countrymen
that ecclesiastical history is yet to be written on these irrefragable positions, and the future
student of history will be delivered from the most puzzling entanglement when once these
idols of the market are removed from books designed for his instruction. Let American
scholarship give us, at last, a Church history not written from a merely Western point of
view, nor clogged with traditional phraseology perseveringly adhered to on the very pages
which supply its refutation. It is the scandal of literature that the frauds of the pseudo-Decretals
should be perpetuated by modern lists of “popes,” beginning with St. Peter, in the
very books which elaborately expose the empiricism of such a scheme, and quote the reluctant
words by which this gigantic imposition has been consigned to infamy in the confessions
of Jesuits and Ultramontanes themselves.</p>
<note type="footnote">6 He adds: “Alexandria, till the rise of Constantinople, was the most powerful city in the East. The prestige of
its founder still clung to it.”</note>

<head>Introductory Note
to
Gregory Thaumaturgus.</head>
<p>[a.d. 205–240–265.] Alexandria continues to be the head of Christian learning.9 It is
delightful to trace the hand of God from generation to generation, as from father to son,
interposing for the perpetuity of the faith. We have already observed the continuity of the
great Alexandrian school: how it arose, and how Pantænus begat Clement, and Clement
begat Origen. So Origen begat Gregory, and so the Lord has provided for the spiritual generation
of the Church’s teachers, age after age, from the beginning. Truly, the Lord gave to
Origen a holy seed, better than natural sons and daughters; as if, for his comfort, Isaiah had
written,10 forbidding him to say, “I am a dry tree.”</p>
<p>Our Gregory has given us not a little of his personal adventures in his panegyric upon
his master, and for his further history the reader need only be referred to what follows. But
I am anxious to supply the dates, which are too loosely left to conjecture. As he was ordained
a bishop “very young,” according to Eusebius, I suppose he must have been far enough under
fifty, the age prescribed by the “Apostolic Canons” (so called), though probably not younger
than thirty, the earliest canonical limit for the ordination of a presbyter. If we decide upon
five and thirty, as a mean reckoning, we may with some confidence set his birth at a.d. 205,
dating back from his episcopate, which began a.d. 240. He was a native of Neo-Cæsarea, the
chief city of Pontus,—a fact that should modify what we have learned about Pontus from
Tertullian.11 He was born of heathen parentage, and lived like other Gentile boys until his
fourteenth year (circa a.d. 218), with the disadvantage of being more than ordinarily imbued
by a mistaken father in the polytheism of Greece. At this period his father died; but his
mother, carrying out the wishes of her husband, seems to have been not less zealous in furthering
his education according to her pagan ideas. He was, evidently, the inheritor of
moderate wealth; and, with his brother Athenodorus, he was placed under an accomplished
teacher of grammar and rhetoric, from whom also he acquired a considerable knowledge
of the Latin tongue. He was persuaded by the same master to use this accomplishment in
acquiring some knowledge of the Roman laws. This is a very important point in his biography,

to it very soon. We find him next going to Alexandria to study the New Platonism. He speaks
of himself as already prepossessed with Christian ideas, which came to him even in his
boyhood, about the time when his father died. But it was not at Alexandria that he began
his acquaintance with Christian learning. Next he seems to have travelled into Greece, and
to have studied at Athens. But the great interest of his autobiography begins with the
providential incidents, devoutly narrated by himself, which engaged him in a journey to
Berytus just as Origen reached Cæsarea, a.d. 233, making it for a time his home and the seat
of his school. His own good angel, as Gregory supposes, led him away from Berytus, where
he purposed to prosecute his legal studies, and brought him to the feet of Origen, his
Gamaliel; and “from the very first day of his receiving us,” he says, “the true Sun began to
rise upon me.” This he accounts the beginning of his true life; and, if we are right as to our
dates, he was now about twenty-seven years of age.</p>
<p>If he tarried even a little while in Berytus, as seems probable, his knowledge of law was,
doubtless, somewhat advanced. It was the seat of that school in which Roman law began its
existence in the forms long afterward digested into the Pandects of Justinian. That emperor
speaks of Berytus as “the mother and nurse” of the civil law. Caius, whose Institutes were
discovered in 1820 by the sagacity of Niebuhr, seems to have been a Syrian. So were Papinian
and Ulpian: and, heathen as they were, they lived under the illumination reflected from
Antioch; and, not less than the Antonines, they were examples of a philosophic regeneration
which never could have existed until the Christian era had begun its triumphs. Of this sort
of pagan philosophy Julian became afterwards the grand embodiment; and in Julian’s
grudging confessions of what he had learned from Christianity we have a key to the secret
convictions of others, such as I have named; characters in whom, as in Plutarch and in many
retrograde unbelievers of our day, we detect the operation of influences they are unwilling
to acknowledge; of which, possibly, they are blindly unconscious themselves. Roman law,
I maintain, therefore, indirectly owes its origin, as it is directly indebted for its completion
in the Pandects, to the new powers and processes of thought which came from “the Light
of the World.” It was light from Galilee and Golgotha, answering Pilate’s question in the
inward convictions of many a heathen sage.</p>
<p>It is most interesting, therefore, to find in our Gregory one who had come into contact
with Berytus at this period. He describes it as already dignified by this school of law, and
therefore Latinized in some degree by its influence. Most suggestive is what he says of this
school: “I refer to those admirable laws of our sages, by which the affairs of all the subjects
of the Roman Empire are now directed, and which are neither digested nor learnt without
difficulty. They are wise and strict (if not pious) in themselves, they are manifold and admirable,
and, in a word, most thoroughly Grecian, although expressed and delivered to us in the
Roman tongue, which is a wonderful and magnificent sort of language, and one very aptly
conformable to imperial authority, but still difficult to me.” Nor is this the only noteworthy

<pb n="9"/>
tribute of our author to Roman law while yet that sublime system was in its cradle. The
rhetorician who introduced him to it and to the Latin tongue was its enthusiastic eulogist;
and Gregory says he learned the laws “in a thorough way, by his help.…And he said one
thing to me which has proved to me the truest of all his sayings; to wit, that my education
in the laws would be my greatest viaticum,—my ἐφόδιον (for thus he phrased it);” i.e., for
the journey of life. This man, one can hardly doubt, was a disciple of Caius (or Gaius); and
there is little question that the digested system which Gregory eulogizes was “the Institutes”
of that great father of the civil law, now recovered from a palimpsest, and made known to
our own age, with no less benefit to jurisprudence than the discovery of the Philosophumena
has conferred on theology.</p>
<p>Thus Gregory’s Panegyric throws light on the origin of Roman law. He claims it for “our
sages,” meaning men of the East, whose vernacular was the Greek tongue. Caius was probably,
like the Gaius of Scripture, an Oriental who had borrowed a Latin name, as did the Apostle
of the Gentiles and many others. If he was a native of Berytus, as seems probable, that accounts
for the rise of the school of laws at a place comparatively inconsiderable. Hadrian,
in his journey to Palestine, would naturally discover and patronize such a jurist; and that
accounts for the appearance of Caius at Rome in his day. Papinian and Ulpian, both Orientals,
were his pupils in all probability; and these were the “sages” with whose works the youthful
Gregory became acquainted, and by which his mind was prepared for the great influence
he exerted in the East, where his name is a power to this day.</p>
<p>His credit with our times is rather impaired than heightened by the epithet Thaumaturgus,
which clings to his name as a convenient specification, to distinguish him from the
other12 Gregories whose period was so nearly his own. But why make it his opprobrium?
He is not responsible for the romances that sprung up after his death; which he never heard
of nor imagined. Like the great Friar Bacon, who was considered a magician, or Faust, whose
invention nearly cost him his life, the reputation of Gregory made him the subject of legendary
lore long after he was gone. It is not impossible that God wrought marvels by his
hand, but a single instance would give rise to many fables; and this very surname is of itself
a monument of the fact that miracles were now of rare occurrence, and that one possessing
the gift was a wonder to his contemporaries.</p>
<p>To like popular love of the marvellous I attribute the stupid story of a mock consecration
by Phædimus. If a slight irregularity in Origen’s ordination gave him such lifelong troubles,
what would not have been the tumult such a sacrilege as this would have occasioned?
Nothing is more probable than that Phædimus related such things as having occurred in a
vision;13 and this might have weighed with a mind like Gregory’s to overcome his scruples,
and to justify his acceptance of such a position at an early age.</p>

<p>We are already acquainted with the eloquent letter of Origen that decided him to choose
the sacred calling after he left the school at Cæsarea. The Panegyric, which was his valedictory,
doubtless called forth that letter. Origen had seen in him the makings of a κῆρυξ, and coveted
such another Timothy for the Master’s work. But the Panegyric itself abounds with faults,
and greatly resembles similar college performances of our day. The custom of schools alone
can excuse the expression of such enthusiastic praise in the presence of its subject; but Origen
doubtless bore it as philosophically as others have done since, and its evident sincerity and
heartfelt gratitude redeem it from the charge of fulsome adulation.</p>
<p>For the residue of the story I may refer my readers to the statements of the translator,
as follows:—
Translator’s Notice.</p>
<p>We are in possession of a considerable body of testimonies from ancient literature
bearing on the life and work of Gregory. From these, though they are largely mixed up with
the marvellous, we gain a tolerably clear and satisfactory view of the main facts in his history,
and the most patent features of his character.14 From various witnesses we learn that he was
also known by the name Theodorus, which may have been his original designation; that he
was a native of Neo-Cæsareia, a considerable place of trade, and one of the most important
towns of Pontus; that he belonged to a family of some wealth and standing; that he was born
of heathen parents; that at the age of fourteen he lost his father; that he had a brother named
Athenodorus; and that along with him he travelled about from city to city in the prosecution
of studies that were to fit him for the profession of law, to which he had been destined.
Among the various seats of learning which he thus visited we find Alexandria, Athens,
Berytus, and the Palestinian Cæsareia mentioned. At this last place—to which, as he tells
us, he was led by a happy accident in the providence of God—he was brought into connection
with Origen. Under this great teacher he received lessons in logic, geometry, physics, ethics,
philosophy, and ancient literature, and in due time also in biblical science and the verities
of the Christian faith. Thus, having become Origen’s pupil, he became also by the hand of
God his convert. After a residence of some five years with the great Alexandrian, he returned
to his native city. Soon, however, a letter followed him to Neo-Cæsareia, in which Origen
urged him to dedicate himself to the ministry of the Church of Christ, and pressed strongly
<note type="footnote">14 Thus we have accounts of him, more or less complete, in Eusebius (Historia Eccles., vi. 30, vii. 14), Basil
(De Spiritu Sancto, xxix. 74; Epist. 28, Num. 1 and 2; 204, Num. 2; 207, Num. 4; 210, Num. 3, 5,—Works, vol.

upon him his obligation to consecrate his gifts to the service of God, and in especial to devote
his acquirements in heathen science and learning to the elucidation of the Scriptures. On
receipt of this letter, so full of wise and faithful counsel and strong exhortation, from the
teacher whom he venerated and loved above all others, he withdrew into the wilderness,
seeking opportunity for solemn thought and private prayer over its contents. At this time
the bishop of Amasea, a city which held apparently a first place in the province, was one
named Phædimus, who, discerning the promise of great things in the convert, sought to
make him bishop of Neo-Cæsareia. For a considerable period, however, Gregory, who
shrank from the responsibility of the episcopal office, kept himself beyond the bishop’s
reach, until Phædimus, unsuccessful in his search, had recourse to the stratagem of ordaining
him in his absence, and declaring him, with all the solemnities of the usual ceremonial,
bishop of his native city.15 On receiving the report of this extraordinary step, Gregory yielded,
and, coming forth from the place of his concealment, was consecrated to the bishopric with
all the customary formalities;16 and so well did he discharge the duties of his office, that
while there were said to be only seventeen Christians in the whole city when he first entered
it as bishop, there were said to be only seventeen pagans in it at the time of his death. The
date of his studies under Origen is fixed at about 234 a.d., and that of his ordination as
bishop at about 240. About the year 250 his church was involved in the sufferings of the
Decian persecution, on which occasion he fled into the wilderness, with the hope of preserving
his life for his people, whom he also counselled to follow in that matter his example.
His flock had much to endure, again, through the incursion of the northern barbarians
about 260. He took part in the council that met at Antioch in 265 for the purpose of trying
Paul of Samosata; and soon after that he died, perhaps about 270, if we can adopt the conjectural
reading which gives the name Aurelian instead of Julian in the account left us by
Suidas.</p>
<p>The surname Thaumaturgus, or Wonder-worker, at once admonishes us of the marvellous
that so largely connected itself with the historical in the ancient records of this man’s life.17
<note type="footnote">15 [See p. 5, supra. Cave pronounces it “without precedent,” but seems to credit the story.]</note>
<note type="footnote">16 [So Gregory Nyssen says. It would have been impossible, otherwise, for him to rule his flock.]</note>
<note type="footnote">17 He could move the largest stones by a word; he could heal the sick; the demons were subject to him, and
were exorcised by his fiat; he could give bounds to overflowing rivers; he could dry up mighty lakes; he could
cast his cloak over a man, and cause his death; once, spending a night in a heathen temple, he banished its divinities
by his simple presence, and by merely placing on the altar a piece of paper bearing the words, Gregory to
Satan—enter, he could bring the presiding demons back to their shrine. One strange story told of him by Gregory
of Nyssa is to the effect that, as Gregory was meditating on the great matter of the right way to worship the true
God, suddenly two glorious personages made themselves manifest in his room, in the one of whom he recognised
the Apostle John, in the other the Virgin. They had come, as the story goes, to solve the difficulties which were
making him hesitate in accepting the bishopric. At Mary’s request, the evangelist gave him then all the instruction</note>

<pb n="12"/>
He was believed to have been gifted with a power of working miracles, which he was constantly
exercising. But into these it is profitless to enter. When all the marvellous is dissociated
from the historical in the records of this bishop’s career, we have still the figure of a great,
good, and gifted man, deeply versed in the heathen lore and science of his time, yet more
deeply imbued with the genuine spirit of another wisdom, which, under God, he learned
from the illustrious thinker of Alexandria, honouring with all love, gratitude, and veneration
that teacher to whom he was indebted for his knowledge of the Gospel, and exercising an
earnest, enlightened, and faithful ministry of many years in an office which he had not
sought, but for which he had been sought. Such is, in brief, the picture that rises up before
us from a perusal of his own writings, as well as from the comparison of ancient accounts
of the man and his vocation. Of his well-accredited works we have the following: A Declaration
of Faith, being a creed on the doctrine of the Trinity; a Metaphrase of the Book of Ecclesiastes,
a Panegyric to Origen, being an oration delivered on leaving the school of Origen,
expressing eloquently, and with great tenderness of feeling, as well as polish of style, the
sense of his obligations to that master; and a Canonical Epistle, in which he gives a variety
of directions with respect to the penances and discipline to be exacted by the Church from
Christians who had fallen back into heathenism in times of suffering, and wished to be restored.
Other works have been attributed to him, which are doubtful or spurious. His writings
have been often edited,—by Gerard Voss in 1604, by the Paris editors in 1662, by Gallandi
in 1788, and others, who need not be enumerated here.</p>
<note type="footnote">in doctrine which he was seeking for; and the sum of these supernatural communications being written down
by him after the vision vanished, formed the creed which is still preserved among his writings. Such were the
wonders believed to signalize the life of Gregory.</note>

<p>The story of the “Revelation” is of little consequence, though, if this were Gregory’s
genuine work, it would be easy to account for it as originating in a beautiful dream. But it
is very doubtful whether it be a genuine work; and, to my mind, it is most fairly treated by
Lardner, to whose elaborate chapter concerning Gregory every scholar must refer.37 Dr.
Burton, in his edition of Bishop Bull’s works,38 almost overrules that learned prelate’s inclination
to think it genuine, in the following words: “Hanc formulam minime esse Gregorii
authenticam…multis haud spernendis argumentis demonstrat Lardner.” Lardner thinks it
a fabrication of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Cave’s learned judgment is more favourable; and he gives the text39 from Gregory of
Nyssa, which he translates as follows: “There is one God, the Father of the living Word and
of the subsisting Wisdom and Power, and of Him who is His Eternal Image, the perfect begetter
of Him that is perfect, the Father of the only-begotten Son. There is one Lord, the
only Son of the only Father, God of God, the character and image of the Godhead, the
powerful Word, the comprehensive Wisdom, by which all things were made, and the Power
that gave being to the whole creation, the true Son of the true Father, the Invisible of the
Invisible, the Incorruptible of the Incorruptible, the Immortal of the Immortal, and the
Eternal of Him that is Eternal. There is one Holy Ghost, having its subsistence of God, which
appeared through the Son to mankind, the perfect Image of the perfect Son, the Life-giving
Life, the holy Fountain, the Sanctity, and the Author of sanctification, by whom God the
Father is made manifest, who is over all, and in all; and God the Son, who is through all. A
perfect Trinity, which neither in glory, eternity, or dominion is divided, or departed from
itself.”</p>

<p>These words speaketh Solomon, the son of David the king and prophet, to the whole
Church of God, a prince most honoured, and a prophet most wise above all men. How vain
and fruitless are the affairs of men, and all pursuits that occupy man! For there is not one
who can tell of any profit attaching to those things which men who creep on earth strive by
body and soul to attain to, in servitude all the while to what is transient, and undesirous of
considering aught heavenly with the noble eye of the soul. And the life of men weareth away,
as day by day, and in the periods of hours and years, and the determinate courses of the sun,
some are ever coming, and others passing away. And the matter is like the transit of torrents
as they fall into the measureless deep of the sea with a mighty noise. And all things that have
been constituted by God for the sake of men abide the same: as, for instance, that man is
born of earth, and departs to earth again; that the earth itself continues stable; that the sun
accomplishes its circuit about it perfectly, and rolls round to the same mark again; and that
the winds42 in like manner, and the mighty rivers which flow into the sea, and the breezes
that beat upon it, all act without forcing it to pass beyond its limits, and without themselves
also violating their appointed laws. And these things, indeed, as bearing upon the good of
this life of ours, are established thus fittingly. But those things which are of men’s devising,
whether words or deeds, have no measure. And there is a plenteous multitude of words, but
there is no profit from random and foolish talking. But the race of men is naturally insatiate
in its thirst both for speaking and for hearing what is spoken; and it is man’s habit, too, to
desire to look with idle eyes on all that happens. What can occur afterwards, or what can
be wrought by men which has not been done already? What new thing is there worthy of
mention, of which there has never yet been experience? For I think there is nothing which
one may call new, or which, on considering it, one shall discover to be strange or unknown
to those of old. But as former things are buried in oblivion, so also things that are now
subsistent will in the course of time vanish utterly from the knowledge of those who shall
come after us. And I speak not these things unadvisedly, as acting now the preacher.43 But

all these things were carefully pondered by me when entrusted with the kingdom of the
Hebrews in Jerusalem. And I examined diligently, and considered discreetly, the nature of
all that is on earth, and I perceived it to be most various;44 and I saw that to man it is given
to labour upon earth, ever carried about by all different occasions of toil, and with no result
of his work. And all things here below are full of the spirit of strangeness and abomination,
so that it is not possible for one to retrieve them now; nay, rather it is not possible for one
at all to conceive what utter vanity45 has taken possession of all human affairs. For once on
a time I communed with myself, and thought that then I was wiser in this than all that were
before me, and I was expert in understanding parables and the natures of things. But I
learned that I gave myself to such pursuits to no purpose, and that if wisdom follows
knowledge, so troubles attend on wisdom.</p>

<p>Judging, therefore, that it stood thus with this matter, I decided to turn to another
manner of life, and to give myself to pleasure, and to take experience of various delights.
And now I learned that all such things are vain; and I put a check on laughter, when it ran
on carelessly; and restrained pleasure, according to the rule of moderation, and was bitterly
wroth against it. And when I perceived that the soul is able to arrest the body in its disposition
to intoxication and wine-bibbing, and that temperance makes lust its subject, I sought
earnestly to observe what object of true worth and of real excellence is set before men, which
they shall attain to in this present life. For I passed through all those other objects which
are deemed worthiest, such as the erecting of lofty houses and the planting of vines, and in
addition, the laying out of pleasure-grounds, and the acquisition and culture of all manner
of fruit-bearing trees; and among them also large reservoirs for the reception of water were
constructed, and distributed so as to secure the plentiful irrigation of the trees. And I surrounded
myself also with many domestics, both man-servants and maid-servants; and some
of them I procured from abroad, and others I possessed and employed as born in my own
house. And herds of four-footed creatures, as well of cattle as of sheep, more numerous than
any of those of old acquired, were made my property. And treasures of gold and silver flowed
in upon me; and I made the kings of all nations my dependants and tributaries. And very
many choirs of male and female singers were trained to yield me pleasure by the practice
of all-harmonious song. And I had banquetings; and for the service of this part of my
pleasure, I got me select cup-bearers of both sexes beyond my reckoning,—so far did I surpass
in these things those who reigned before me in Jerusalem. And thus it happened that the
interests of wisdom declined with me, while the claims of evil appetency increased. For
when I yielded myself to every allurement of the eyes, and to the violent passions of the
heart, that make their attack from all quarters, and surrendered myself to the hopes held
out by pleasures, I also made my will the bond-slave of all miserable delights. For thus my
judgment was brought to such a wretched pass, that I thought these things good, and that
it was proper for me to engage in them. At length, awaking and recovering my sight, I perceived
that the things I had in hand were altogether sinful and very evil, and the deeds of a
spirit not good. For now none of all the objects of men’s choice seems to me worthy of approval,
or greatly to be desired by a just mind. Wherefore, having pondered at once the advantages
of wisdom and the ills of folly, I should with reason admire that man greatly, who,
being borne on in a thoughtless course, and afterwards arresting himself, should return to
right and duty. For wisdom and folly are widely separated, and they are as different from
each other as day is from night. He, therefore, who makes choice of virtue, is like one who
sees all things plainly, and looks upward, and who holdeth his ways in the time of clearest
light. But he, on the other hand, who has involved himself in wickedness, is like a man who
wanders helplessly about in a moonless night, as one who is blind, and deprived of the sight

<pb n="19"/>
of things by his darkness.46 And when I considered the end of each of these modes of life,
I found there was no profit in the latter;47 and by setting myself to be the companion of the
foolish, I saw that I should receive the wages of folly. For what advantage is there in those
thoughts, or what profit is there in the multitude of words, where the streams of foolish
speaking are flowing, as it were, from the fountain of folly? Moreover, there is nothing
common to the wise man and to the fool, neither as regards the memory of men, nor as regards
the recompense of God. And as to all the affairs of men, when they are yet apparently
but beginning to be, the end at once surprises them. Yet the wise man is never partaker of
the same end with the foolish. Then also did I hate all my life, that had been consumed in
vanities, and which I had spent with a mind engrossed in earthly anxieties. For, to speak in
brief, all my affairs have been wrought by me with labour and pain, as the efforts of
thoughtless impulse; and some other person, it may be a wise man or a fool, will succeed to
them, I mean, the chill fruits of my toils. But when I cut myself off from these things, and
cast them away, then did that real good which is set before man show itself to me,—namely,
the knowledge of wisdom and the possession of manly virtue.48 And if a man neglects these
things, and is inflamed with the passion for other things, such a man makes choice of evil
instead of good, and goes after what is bad instead of what is excellent, and after trouble
instead of peace; for he is distracted by every manner of disturbance, and is burdened with
continual anxieties night and day, with oppressive labours of body as well as with ceaseless
cares of mind,—his heart moving in constant agitation, by reason of the strange and senseless
affairs that occupy him. For the perfect good does not consist in eating and drinking, although
it is true that it is from God that their sustenance cometh to men; for none of those things
which are given for our maintenance subsist without His providence. But the good man
who gets wisdom from God, gets also heavenly enjoyment; while, on the other hand, the
evil man, smitten with ills divinely inflicted, and afflicted with the disease of lust, toils to
amass much, and is quick to put him to shame who is honoured by God in presence of the
Lord of all, proffering useless gifts, and making things deceitful and vain the pursuits of his
own miserable soul.</p>

<p>For this present time is filled with all things that are most contrary49 to each other—births
and deaths, the growth of plants and their uprooting, cures and killings, the building up
and the pulling down of houses, weeping and laughing, mourning and dancing. At this
moment a man gathers of earth’s products, and at another casts them away; and at one time
he ardently desireth the beauty of woman, and at another he hateth it. Now he seeketh
something, and again he loseth it; and now he keepeth, and again he casteth away; at one
time he slayeth, and at another he is slain; he speaketh, and again he is silent; he loveth, and
again he hateth. For the affairs of men are at one time in a condition of war, and at another
in a condition of peace; while their fortunes are so inconstant, that from bearing the semblance
of good, they change quickly into acknowledged ills. Let us have done, therefore, with
vain labours. For all these things, as appears to me, are set to madden men, as it were, with
their poisoned stings. And the ungodly observer of the times and seasons is agape for this
world,50 exerting himself above measure to destroy the image51 of God, as one who has
chosen to contend against it52 from the beginning onward to the end.53 I am persuaded,
therefore, that the greatest good for man is cheerfulness and well-doing, and that this
shortlived enjoyment, which alone is possible to us, comes from God only, if righteousness
direct our doings. But as to those everlasting and incorruptible things which God hath firmly
established, it is not possible either to take aught from them or to add aught to them. And
to men in general, those things, in sooth, are fearful and wonderful;54 and those things indeed
which have been, abide so; and those which are to be, have already been, as regards His
foreknowledge. Moreover, the man who is injured has God as his helper. I saw in the lower
parts the pit of punishment which receives the impious, but a different place allotted for the
pious. And I thought with myself, that with God all things are judged and determined to be
equal; that the righteous and the unrighteous, and objects with reason and without reason,
are alike in His judgment. For that their time is measured out equally to all, and death impends
over them, and in this the races of beasts and men are alike in the judgment of God,
and differ from each other only in the matter of articulate speech; and all things else happen
alike to them, and death receives all equally, not more so in the case of the other kinds of

more; but all are, in one word, vain, deriving their present condition55 from the same earth,
and destined to perish, and return to the same earth again. For it is uncertain regarding the
souls of men, whether they shall fly upwards; and regarding the others which the unreasoning
creatures possess, whether they shall fall downward. And it seemed to me, that there is no
other good save pleasure, and the enjoyment of things present. For I did not think it possible
for a man, when once he has tasted death, to return again to the enjoyment of these things.56</p>

<p>And leaving all these reflections, I considered and turned in aversion from all the forms
of oppression57 which are done among men; whence some receiving injury weep and lament,
who are struck down by violence in utter default of those who protect them, or who should
by all means comfort them in their trouble.58 And the men who make might their right59
are exalted to an eminence, from which, however, they shall also fall. Yea, of the unrighteous
and audacious, those who are dead fare better than those who are still alive. And better than
both these is he who, being destined to be like them, has not yet come into being, since he
has not yet touched the wickedness which prevails among men. And it became clear to me
also how great is the envy which follows a man from his neighbours, like the sting of a wicked
spirit; and I saw that he who receives it, and takes it as it were into his breast, has nothing
else but to eat his own heart, and tear it, and consume both soul and body, finding inconsolable
vexation in the good fortune of others.60 And a wise man would choose to have one of
his hands full, if it were with ease and quietness, rather than both of them with travail and
with the villany of a treacherous spirit. Moreover, there is yet another thing which I know
to happen contrary to what is fitting, by reason of the evil will of man. He who is left entirely
alone, having neither brother nor son, but prospered with large possessions, lives on in the
spirit of insatiable avarice, and refuses to give himself in any way whatever to goodness.
Gladly, therefore, would I ask such an one for what reason he labours thus, fleeing with
headlong speed61 from the doing of anything good, and distracted by the many various
passions for making gain.62 Far better than such are those who have taken up an order of
life in common,63 from which they may reap the best blessings. For when two men devote
themselves in the right spirit to the same objects, though some mischance befalls the one,
he has still at least no slight alleviation in having his companion by him. And the greatest
of all calamities to a man in evil fortune is the want of a friend to help and cheer him.64 And

65 But he who leads a solitary life passes a species of existence full of terror to himself;
not perceiving that if one should fall upon men welded closely together, he adopts a rash
and perilous course, and that it is not easy to snap the threefold cord.66 Moreover, I put a
poor youth, if he be wise, before an aged prince devoid of wisdom, to whose thoughts it has
never occured that it is possible that a man may be raised from the prison to the throne,
and that the very man who has exercised his power unrighteously shall at a later period be
righteously cast out. For it may happen that those who are subject to a youth, who is at the
same time sensible, shall be free from trouble,—those, I mean, who are his elders.67 Moreover,
they who are born later cannot praise another, of whom they have had no experience,68 and
are led by an unreasoning judgment, and by the impulse of a contrary spirit. But in exercising
the preacher’s office, keep thou this before thine eyes, that thine own life be rightly directed,

<p>Moreover, it is a good thing to use the tongue sparingly, and to keep a calm and rightly
balanced69 heart in the exercise of speech.70 For it is not right to give utterance in words to
things that are foolish and absurd, or to all that occur to the mind; but we ought to know
and reflect, that though we are far separated from heaven, we speak in the hearing of God,
and that it is good for us to speak without offence. For as dreams and visions of many kinds
attend manifold cares of mind, so also silly talking is conjoined with folly. Moreover, see to
it, that a promise made with a vow be made good in fact. This, too, is proper to fools, that
they are unreliable. But be thou true to thy word, knowing that it is much better for thee
not to vow or promise to do anything, than to vow and then fail of performance. And thou
oughtest by all means to avoid the flood of base words, seeing that God will hear them. For
the man who makes such things his study gets no more benefit by them than to see his doings
brought to nought by God. For as the multitude of dreams is vain, so also the multitude of
words. But the fear of God is man’s salvation, though it is rarely found. Wherefore thou
oughtest not to wonder though thou seest the poor oppressed, and the judges misinterpreting
the law. But thou oughtest to avoid the appearance of surpassing those who are in power.
For even should this prove to be the case, yet, from the terrible ills that shall befall thee,
wickedness of itself will not deliver thee. But even as property acquired by violence is a most
hurtful as well as impious possession, so the man who lusteth after money never finds satisfaction
for his passion, nor good-will from his neighbours, even though he may have amassed
the greatest possible wealth. For this also is vanity. But goodness greatly rejoiceth those who
hold by it, and makes them strong,71 imparting to them the capacity of seeing through72
all things. And it is a great matter also not to be engrossed by such anxieties: for the poor
man, even should he be a slave, and unable to fill his belly plentifully, enjoys at least the kind
refreshment of sleep; but the lust of riches is attended by sleepless nights and anxieties of
mind. And what could there be then more absurd, than with much anxiety and trouble to
amass wealth, and keep it with jealous care, if all the while one is but maintaining the occasion
of countless evils to himself? And this wealth, besides, must needs perish some time or
other, and be lost, whether he who has acquired it has children or not;73 and the man himself,

however unwillingly, is doomed to die, and return to earth in the selfsame condition in
which it was his lot once to come into being.74 And the fact that he is destined thus to leave
earth with empty hands, will make the evil all the sorer to him, as he fails to consider that
an end is appointed for his life similar to its beginning, and that he toils to no profit, and
labours rather for the wind, as it were, than for the advancement of his own real interest,
wasting his whole life in most unholy lusts and irrational passions, and withal in troubles
and pains. And, to speak shortly, his days are darkness to such a man, and his life is sorrow.
Yet this is in itself good, and by no means to be despised. For it is the gift of God, that a man
should be able to reap with gladness of mind the fruits of his labours, receiving thus possessions
bestowed by God, and not acquired by force.75 For neither is such a man afflicted with
troubles, nor is he for the most part the slave of evil thoughts; but he measures out his life
by good deeds, being of good heart76 in all things, and rejoicing in the gift of God.</p>

<p>Moreover, I shall exhibit in discourse the ill-fortune that most of all prevails among
men. While God may supply a man with all that is according to his mind, and deprive him
of no object which may in any manner appeal to his desires, whether it be wealth, or honour,
or any other of those things for which men distract themselves; yet the man, while thus
prospered in all things, as though the only ill inflicted on him from heaven were just the
inability to enjoy them, may but husband them for his fellow, and fall without profit either
to himself or to his neighbours. This I reckon to be a strong proof and clear sign of surpassing
evil. The man who has borne without blame the name of father of very many children, and
spent a long life, and has not had his soul filled with good for so long time, and has had no
experience of death meanwhile,77—this man I should not envy either his numerous offspring
or his length of days; nay, I should say that the untimely birth that falls from a woman’s
womb is better than he. For as that came in with vanity, so it also departeth secretly in oblivion,
without having tasted the ills of life or looked on the sun. And this is a lighter evil than
for the wicked man not to know what is good, even though he measure his life by thousands
of years.78 And the end of both is death. The fool is proved above all things by his finding
no satisfaction in any lust. But the discreet man is not held captive by these passions. Yet,
for the most part, righteousness of life leads a man to poverty. And the sight of curious eyes
deranges79 many, inflaming their mind, and drawing them on to vain pursuits by the empty
desire of show.80 Moreover, the things which are now are known already; and it becomes
apparent that man is unable to contend with those that are above him. And, verily, inanities
have their course among men, which only increase the folly of those who occupy themselves
with them.</p>

<p>For though a man should be by no means greatly advantaged by knowing all in this life
that is destined to befall him according to his mind (let us suppose such a case), nevertheless
with the officious activity of men he devises means for prying into and gaining an apparent
acquaintance with the things that are to happen after a person’s death. Moreover, a good
name is more pleasant to the mind81 than oil to the body; and the end of life is better than
the birth, and to mourn is more desirable than to revel, and to be with the sorrowing is
better than to be with the drunken. For this is the fact, that he who comes to the end of life
has no further care about aught around him. And discreet anger is to be preferred to laughter;
for by the severe disposition of countenance the soul is kept upright.82 The souls of the wise,
indeed, are sad and downcast, but those of fools are elated, and given loose to merriment.
And yet it is far more desirable to receive blame from one wise man, than to become a
hearer of a whole chorus of worthless and miserable men in their songs. For the laughter of
fools is like the crackling of many thorns burning in a fierce fire. This, too, is misery, yea
the greatest of evils, namely oppression;83 for it intrigues against the souls of the wise, and
attempts to ruin the noble way of life84 which the good pursue. Moreover, it is right to
commend not the man who begins, but the man who finishes a speech;85 and what is
moderate ought to approve itself to the mind, and not what is swollen and inflated. Again,
one ought certainly to keep wrath in check, and not suffer himself to be carried rashly into
anger, the slaves of which are fools. Moreover, they are in error who assert that a better
manner of life was given to those before us, and they fail to see that wisdom is widely different
from mere abundance of possessions, and that it is as much more lustrous86 than these, as
silver shines more brightly than its shadow. For the life of man hath its excellence87 not in
the acquisition of perishable riches, but in wisdom. And who shall be able, tell me, to declare
the providence of God, which is so great and so beneficent? or who shall be able to recall
the things which seem to have been passed by of God? And in the former days of my vanity
I considered all things, and saw a righteous man continuing in his righteousness, and ceasing
not from it until death, but even suffering injury by reason thereof, and a wicked man per-

ishing with his wickedness. Moreover, it is proper that the righteous man should not seem
to be so overmuch, nor exceedingly and above measure wise, that he may not, as in making
some slip, seem to sin many times over. And be not thou audacious and precipitate, lest an
untimely death surprise thee. It is the greatest of all good to take hold of God, and by abiding
in Him to sin in nothing. For to touch things undefiled with an impure hand is abomination.
But he who in the fear of God submits himself,88 escapes all that is contrary. Wisdom availeth
more in the way of help than a band of the most powerful men in a city, and it often also
pardons righteously those who fail in duty. For there is not one that stumbleth not.89 Also
it becomes thee in no way to attend upon the words of the impious, that thou mayest not
become an ear-witness90 of words spoken against thyself, such as the foolish talk of a wicked
servant, and being thus stung in heart, have recourse afterwards thyself to cursing in turn
in many actions. And all these things have I known, having received wisdom from God,
which afterwards I lost, and was no longer able to be the same.91 For wisdom fled from me
to an infinite distance, and into a measureless deep, so that I could no longer get hold of it.
Wherefore afterwards I abstained altogether from seeking it; and I no longer thought of
considering the follies and the vain counsels of the impious, and their weary, distracted life.
And being thus disposed, I was borne on to the things themselves; and being seized with a
fatal passion, I knew woman—that she is like a snare or some such other object.92 For her
heart ensnares those who pass her; and if she but join hand to hand, she holds one as securely
as though she dragged him on bound with chains.93 And from her you can secure your deliverance
only by finding a propitious and watchful superintendent in God;94 for he who is
enslaved by sin cannot (otherwise) escape its grasp. Moreover, among all women I sought
for the chastity95 proper to them, and I found it in none. And verily a person may find one
man chaste among a thousand, but a woman never.96 And this above all things I observed,

<p>Moreover, wisdom, when it is found in a man, shows itself also in its possessor’s face,
and makes his countenance to shine; as, on the other hand, effrontery convicts the man in
whom it has taken up its abode, so soon as he is seen, as one worthy of hatred. And it is on
every account right to give careful heed to the words of the king, and by all manner of means
to avoid an oath, especially one taken in the name of God. It may be fit at the same time to
notice an evil word, but then it is necessary to guard against any blasphemy against God.
For it will not be possible to find fault with Him when He inflicts any penalty, nor to gainsay
the decrees of the Only Lord and King. But it will be better and more profitable for a man
to abide by the holy commandments, and to keep himself apart from the words of the wicked.
For the wise man knows and discerneth beforehand the judgment, which shall come at the
right time, and sees that it shall be just. For all things in the life of men await the retribution
from above; but the wicked man does not seem to know verily99 that as there is a mighty
providence over him, nothing in the future shall be hid. He knoweth not indeed the things
which shall be; for no man shall be able to announce any one of them to him duly: for no
one shall be found so strong as to be able to prevent the angel who spoils him of his life;100
neither shall any means be devised for cancelling in any way the appointed time of death.
But even as the man who is captured in the midst of the battle can only see flight cut off on
every side, so all the impiety of man perisheth utterly together. And I am astonished, as often
as I contemplate what and how great things men have studied to do for the hurt of their
neighbours. But this I know, that the impious are snatched prematurely from this life, and
put out of the way because they have given themselves to vanity. For whereas the providential
judgment101 of God does not overtake all speedily, by reason of His great long-suffering,
and the wicked is not punished immediately on the commission of his offences,—for this
reason he thinks that he may sin the more, as though he were to get off with impunity, not
understanding that the transgressor shall not escape the knowledge of God even after a long
interval. This, moreover, is the chief good, to reverence God; for if once the impious man
fall away from Him, he shall not be suffered long to misuse his own folly. But a most vicious
and false opinion often prevails among men concerning both the righteous and the unrighteous.
For they form a judgment contrary to truth regarding each of them; and the man who
is really righteous does not get the credit of being so, while, on the other hand, the impious
man is deemed prudent and upright. And this I judge to be among the most grievous of
errors. Once, indeed, I thought that the chief good consisted in eating and drinking, and
that he was most highly favoured of God who should enjoy these things to the utmost in

his life; and I fancied that this kind of enjoyment was the only comfort in life. And, accordingly,
I gave heed to nothing but to this conceit, so that neither by night nor by day did I
withdraw myself from all those things which have ever been discovered to minister luxurious
delights to men. And this much I learned thereby, that the man who mingles in these things
shall by no means be able, however sorely he may labour with them, to find the real good.</p>

<p>Now I thought at that time that all men were judged worthy of the same things. And if
any wise man practised righteousness, and withdrew himself from unrighteousness, and as
being sagacious avoided hatred with all (which, indeed, is a thing well pleasing to God), this
man seemed to me to labour in vain. For there seemed to be one end for the righteous and
for the impious, for the good and for the evil, for the pure and for the impure, for him that
worshipped102 God, and for him that worshipped not. For as the unrighteous man and the
good, the man who sweareth a false oath, and the man who avoids swearing altogether, were
suspected by me to be driving toward the same end, a certain sinister opinion stole secretly
into my mind, that all men come to their end in a similar way. But now I know that these
are the reflections of fools, and errors and deceits. And they assert largely, that he who is
dead has perished utterly, and that the living is to be preferred to the dead, even though he
may lie in darkness, and pass his life-journey after the fashion of a dog, which is better at
least than a dead lion. For the living know this at any rate, that they are to die; but the dead
know not anything, and there is no reward proposed to them after they have completed
their necessary course. Also hatred and love with the dead have their end; for their envy has
perished, and their life also is extinguished. And he has a portion in nothing who has once
gone hence. Error harping still on such a string, gives also such counsel as this: What
meanest thou, O man, that thou dost not enjoy thyself delicately, and gorge thyself with all
manner of pleasant food, and fill thyself to the full with wine? Dost thou not perceive that
these things are given us from God for our unrestrained enjoyment? Put on newly washed
attire, and anoint thy head with myrrh, and see this woman and that, and pass thy vain life
vainly.103 For nothing else remaineth for thee but this, neither here nor after death. But
avail thou thyself of all that chanceth; for neither shall any one take account of thee for these
things, nor are the things that are done by men known at all outside the circle of men. And
Hades, whatever that may be, whereunto we are said to depart, has neither wisdom nor
understanding. These are the things which men of vanity speak. But I know assuredly, that
neither shall they who seem the swiftest accomplish that great race; nor shall those who are
esteemed mighty and terrible in the judgment of men, overcome in that terrible battle.
Neither, again, is prudence proved by abundance of bread, nor is understanding wont to
consort with riches. Nor do I congratulate those who think that all shall find the same things
befall them. But certainly those who indulge such thoughts seem to me to be asleep, and to
fail to consider that, caught suddenly like fishes and birds, they will be consumed with woes,
and meet speedily their proper retribution. Also I estimate wisdom at so high a price, that
I should deem a small and poorly-peopled city, even though besieged also by a mighty king

with his forces, to be indeed great and powerful, if it had but one wise man, however poor,
among its citizens. For such a man would be able to deliver his city both from enemies and
from entrenchments. And other men, it may be, do not recognise that wise man, poor as
he is; but for my part I greatly prefer the power that resides in wisdom, to this might of the
mere multitude of the people. Here, however, wisdom, as it dwells with poverty, is held in
dishonour. But hereafter it shall be heard speaking with more authoritative voice than princes
and despots who seek after things evil. For wisdom is also stronger than iron; while the folly
of one individual works danger for many, even though he be an object of contempt to
many.104</p>

<p>Moreover, flies falling into myrrh, and suffocated therein, make both the appearance
of that pleasant ointment and the anointing therewith an unseemly thing;105 and to be
mindful of wisdom and of folly together is in no way proper. The wise man, indeed, is his
own leader to right actions; but the fool inclines to erring courses, and will never make his
folly available as a guide to what is noble. Yea, his thoughts also are vain and full of folly.
But if ever a hostile spirit fall upon thee, my friend, withstand it courageously, knowing that
God is able to propitiate106 even a mighty multitude of offences. These also are the deeds
of the prince and father of all wickedness: that the fool is set on high, while the man richly
gifted with wisdom is humbled; and that the slaves of sin are seen riding on horseback, while
men dedicated to God walk on foot in dishonour, the wicked exulting the while. But if any
one devises another’s hurt, he forgets that he is preparing a snare for himself first and alone.
And he who wrecks another’s safety, shall fall by the bite of a serpent. But he who removeth
stones, indeed shall undergo no light labour;107 and he who cleaveth wood shall bear danger
with him in his own weapon. And if it chance that the axe spring out of the handle,108 he
who engages in such work shall be put to trouble, gathering for no good109 and having to
put to more of his iniquitous and shortlived strength.110 The bite of a serpent, again, is
stealthy; and the charmers will not soothe the pain, for they are vain. But the good man
doeth good works for himself and for his neighbours alike; while the fool shall sink into
destruction through his folly. And when he has once opened his mouth, he begins foolishly
and soon comes to an end, exhibiting his senselessness in all. Moreover, it is impossible for
man to know anything, or to learn from man either what has been from the beginning, or
what shall be in the future. For who shall be the declarer thereof? Besides, the man who
knows not to go to the good city, sustains evil in the eyes and in the whole countenance.
And I prophesy woes to that city the king of which is a youth, and its rulers gluttons. But I
call the good land blessed, the king of which is the son of the free: there those who are entrusted
with the power of ruling shall reap what is good in due season. But the sluggard and
the idler become scoffers, and make the house decay; and misusing all things for the purposes
of their own gluttony, like the ready slaves of money,111 for a small price they are content

<p>Moreover, it is a righteous thing to give (to the needy) of thy bread, and of those things
which are necessary for the support of man’s life. For though thou seemest forthwith to
waste it upon some persons, as if thou didst cast thy bread upon the water, yet in the progress
of time thy kindness shall be seen to be not unprofitable for thee. Also give liberally, and
give a portion of thy means to many; for thou knowest not what the coming day doeth. The
clouds, again, do not keep back their plenteous rains, but discharge their showers upon the
earth. Nor does a tree stand for ever; but even though men may spare it, it shall be overturned
by the wind at any rate. But many desire also to know beforehand what is to come from the
heavens; and there have been those who, scrutinizing the clouds and waiting for the wind,
have had nought to do with reaping and winnowing, putting their trust in vanity, and being
all incapable of knowing aught of what may come from God in the future; just as men cannot
tell what the woman with child shall bring forth. But sow thou in season, and thus reap thy
fruits whenever the time for that comes on. For it is not manifest what shall be better than
those among all natural things.112 Would, indeed, that all things turned out well! Truly,
when a man considers with himself that the sun is good, and that this life is sweet, and that
it is a pleasant thing to have many years wherein one can delight himself continually, and
that death is a terror and an endless evil, and a thing that brings us to nought, he thinks that
he ought to enjoy himself in all the present and apparent pleasures of life. And he gives this
counsel also to the young, that they should use to the uttermost113 the season of their youth,
by giving up their minds to all manner of pleasure, and indulge their passions, and do all
that seemeth good in their own eyes, and look upon that which delighteth, and avert themselves
from that which is not so. But to such a man I shall say this much: Senseless art thou,
my friend, in that thou dost not look for the judgment that shall come from God upon all
these things. And profligacy and licentiousness are evil, and the filthy wantonness of our
bodies carries death in it. For folly attends on youth, and folly leads to destruction.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is right that thou shouldest fear God while thou art yet young, before thou
givest thyself over to evil things, and before the great and terrible day of God cometh, when
the sun shall no longer shine, neither the moon, nor the rest of the stars, but when in that
storm and commotion of all things, the powers above shall be moved, that is, the angels
who guard the world; so that the mighty men shall fail, and the women shall cease their labours,
and shall flee into the dark places of their dwellings, and shall have all the doors shut.
And a woman shall be restrained from grinding by fear, and shall speak with the weakest
voice, like the tiniest bird; and all the impure women shall sink into the earth; and cities and
their blood-stained governments shall wait for the vengeance that comes from above, while
the most bitter and bloody of all times hangs over them like a blossoming almond, and
continuous punishments impend like a multitude of flying locusts, and the transgressors
are cast out of the way like a black and despicable caper-plant. And the good man shall depart
with rejoicing to his own everlasting habitation; but the vile shall fill all their places with
wailing, and neither silver laid up in store, nor proved gold, shall be of use any more. For a
mighty stroke114 shall fall upon all things, even to the pitcher that standeth by the well, and
the wheel of the vessel which may chance to have been left in the hollow, when the course
of time comes to its end115 and the ablution-bearing period of a life that is like water has
passed away.116 And for men who lie on earth there is but one salvation, that their souls
acknowledge and wing their way to Him by whom they have been made. I say, then, again
what I have said already, that man’s estate is altogether vain, and that nothing can exceed
the utter vanity which attaches to the objects of man’s inventions. And superfluous is my
labour in preaching discreetly, inasmuch as I am attempting to instruct a people here, so
indisposed to receive either teaching or healing. And truly the noble man is needed for the
understanding of the words of wisdom. Moreover, I, though already aged, and having passed
a long life, laboured to find out those things which are well-pleasing to God, by means of
the mysteries of the truth. And I know that the mind is no less quickened and stimulated
by the precepts of the wise, than the body is wont to be when the goad is applied, or a nail

<head>Canon I.</head>
<p>The meats are no burden to us, most holy father,122 if the captives ate things which their
conquerors set before them, especially since there is one report from all, viz., that the barbarians
who have made inroads into our parts have not sacrificed to idols. For the apostle
says, “Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.”123
But the Saviour also, who cleanseth all meats, says, “Not that which goeth into a man defileth
the man, but that which cometh out.”124 And this meets the case of the captive women defiled
by the barbarians, who outraged their bodies. But if the previous life of any such person
convicted him of going, as it is written, after the eyes of fornicators, the habit of fornication
evidently becomes an object of suspicion also in the time of captivity. And one ought not
readily to have communion with such women in prayers. If any one, however, has lived in
the utmost chastity, and has shown in time past a manner of life pure and free from all suspicion,
and now falls into wantonness through force of necessity, we have an example for
our guidance,—namely, the instance of the damsel in Deuteronomy, whom a man finds in
the field, and forces her and lies with her. “Unto the damsel,” he says, “ye shall do nothing;
there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour,
and slayeth him, even so is this matter: the damsel cried, and there was none to help her.”125</p>

<p>Covetousness is a great evil; and it is not possible in a single letter to set forth those
scriptures in which not robbery alone is declared to be a thing horrible and to be abhorred,
but in general the grasping mind, and the disposition to meddle with what belongs to others,
in order to satisfy the sordid love of gain. And all persons of that spirit are excommunicated
from the Church of God. But that at the time of the irruption, in the midst of such woful
sorrows and bitter lamentations, some should have been audacious enough to consider the
crisis which brought destruction to all the very period for their own private aggrandizement,
that is a thing which can be averred only of men who are impious and hated of God, and of
unsurpassable iniquity. Wherefore it seemed good to excommunicate such persons, lest the
wrath (of God) should come upon the whole people, and upon those first of all who are set
over them in office, and yet fail to make inquiry. For I am afraid, as the Scripture says, lest
the impious work the destruction of the righteous along with his own.126 “For fornication,”
it says,127 “and covetousness are things on account of which the wrath of God cometh upon
the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. For ye were sometimes
darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light (for the fruit of the
light128 is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth), proving what is acceptable unto
the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
them; for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But
all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.” In this wise speaks the apostle.
But if certain parties who pay the proper penalty for that former covetousness of theirs,
which exhibited itself in the time of peace, now turn aside again to the indulgence of covetousness
in the very time of trouble (i.e., in the troubles of the inroads by the barbarians),
and make gain out of the blood and ruin of men who have been utterly despoiled, or taken
captive, (or) put to death, what else ought to be expected, than that those who struggle so
hotly for covetousness should heap up wrath both for themselves and for the whole people?</p>

<p>Behold, did not Achar129 the son of Zara transgress in the accursed thing, and trouble
then lighted on all the congregation of Israel? And this one man was alone in his sin; but
he was not alone in the death that came by his sin. And by us, too, everything of a gainful
kind at this time, which is ours not in our own rightful possession, but as property strictly
belonging to others, ought to be reckoned a thing devoted. For that Achar indeed took of
the spoil; and those men of the present time take also of the spoil. But he took what belonged

<p>Let no one deceive himself, nor put forward the pretext of having found such property.
For it is not lawful, even for a man who has found anything, to aggrandize himself by it. For
Deuteronomy says: “Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray in the way,
and pay no heed to them; but thou shalt in any wise bring them again unto thy brother. And
if thy brother come not nigh thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring them together,
and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek after them, and thou shalt restore
them to him again. And in like manner shalt thou do with his ass, and so shalt thou do with
his raiment, and so shalt thou do with all lost things of thy brother’s, which he hath lost,
and thou mayest find.”130 Thus much in Deuteronomy. And in the book of Exodus it is
said, with reference not only to the case of finding what is a friend’s, but also of finding what
is an enemy’s: “Thou shalt surely bring them back to the house of their master again.”131
And if it is not lawful to aggrandize oneself at the expense of another, whether he be brother
or enemy, even in the time of peace, when he is living at his ease and delicately, and without
concern as to his property, how much more must it be the case when one is met by adversity,
and is fleeing from his enemies, and has had to abandon his possessions by force of circumstances!</p>

along with the catechumens. Restoration149 is that one be associated with the faithful, and
go not forth with the catechumens; and last of all comes the participation in the holy ordinances.

<head>Elucidations.</head>
<p>I.
(The title, p. 18.)</p>
<p>This is a genuine epistle, all but the eleventh canon. It is addressed to an anonymous
bishop; one of his suffragans, some think. I suppose, rather, he consults, as Cyprian did, the
bishop of the nearest Apostolic See, and awaits his concurrence. It refers to the ravages of
the Goths in the days of Gallienus (a.d. 259–267), and proves the care of the Church to
maintain discipline, even in times most unfavourable to order and piety. The last canon is
an explanatory addition made to elucidate the four degrees or classes of penitents. It is a
very interesting document in this respect, and sheds light on the famous canonical epistles
of St. Basil.</p>

<p>II.
(Basil the Great, p. 18, note.)</p>
<p>The “Canonical Epistles” of St. Basil are not private letters, but canons of the churches
with which he was nearest related. When there was no art of printing, the chief bishops were
obliged to communicate with suffragans, and with their brethren in the Apostolic See nearest
to them. See them expounded at large in Dupin, Ecclesiastical Writers of the Fourth Century,
Works, vol. i., London, 1693 (translated), p. 139, etc.</p>

<p>III.
(Most holy father, p. 18.)</p>
<p>This expression leads me to think that this epistle is addressed to the Bishop of Antioch
or of some other Apostolic See. It must not be taken as a prescribed formula, however, as
when we say “Most Reverend” in our days; e.g., addressing the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Rather, it is an expression of personal reverence. As yet, titular distinctions, such as these,
were not known. In the West existing usages seem to have been introduced with the Carlovingian
system of dignities, expounded by Gibbon.</p>

   <head>Argument I.—For Eight Years Gregory Has Given Up the Practice of Oratory, Being
Busied with the Study Chiefly of Roman Law and the Latin Language.</head>
<p>An excellent152 thing has silence proved itself in many another person on many an occasion,
and at present it befits myself, too, most especially, who with or without purpose
may keep the door of my lips, and feel constrained to be silent. For I am unpractised and
unskilled153 in those beautiful and elegant addresses which are spoken or composed in a
regular and unbroken154 train, in select and well-chosen phrases and words; and it may be
that I am less apt by nature to cultivate successfully this graceful and truly Grecian art. Besides,
it is now eight years since I chanced myself to utter or compose any speech, whether
long or short; neither in that period have I heard any other compose or utter anything in
private, or deliver in public any laudatory or controversial orations, with the exception of
those admirable men who have embraced the noble study of philosophy, and who care less
for beauty of language and elegance of expression. For, attaching only a secondary importance
to the words, they aim, with all exactness, at investigating and making known the things
themselves, precisely as they are severally constituted. Not indeed, in my opinion, that they
do not desire, but rather that they do greatly desire, to clothe the noble and accurate results
of their thinking in noble and comely155 language. Yet it may be that they are not able so
lightly to put forth this sacred and godlike power (faculty) in the exercise of its own proper
conceptions, and at the same time to practise a mode of discourse eloquent in its terms, and
thus to comprehend in one and the same mind—and that, too, this little mind of man—two
accomplishments, which are the gifts of two distinct persons, and which are, in truth, most
contrary to each other. For silence is indeed the friend and helpmeet of thought and invention.
But if one aims at readiness of speech and beauty of discourse, he will get at them by
no other discipline than the study of words, and their constant practice. Moreover, another
branch of learning occupies my mind completely, and the mouth binds the tongue if I should
desire to make any speech, however brief, with the voice of the Greeks; I refer to those ad-

which is a wonderful and magnificent sort of language, and one very aptly conformable to
royal authority,159 but still difficult to me. Nor could it be otherwise with me, even though
I might say that it was my desire that it should be.160 And as our words are nothing else

<head>Argument II.—He Essays to Speak of the Well-Nigh Divine Endowments of Origen
in His Presence, into Whose Hands He Avows Himself to Have Been Led in a
Way Beyond All His Expectation.</head>
<p>But we, like any of the poor, unfurnished with these varied specifics161—whether as
never having been possessed of them, or, it may be, as having lost them—are under the necessity
of using, as it were, only charcoal and tiles, that is to say, those rude and common
words and phrases; and by means of these, to the best of our ability, we represent the native
dispositions of our mind, expressing them in such language as is at our service, and endeavouring
to exhibit the impressions of the figures162 of our mind, if not clearly or ornately,
yet at least with the faithfulness of a charcoal picture, welcoming gladly any graceful and
eloquent expression which may present itself from any quarter, although we make little of
such.163 But, furthermore,164 there is a third circumstance which hinders and dissuades me
from this attempt, and which holds me back much more even than the others, and recommends
me to keep silence by all means,—I allude to the subject itself, which made me indeed
ambitious to speak of it, but which now makes me draw back and delay. For it is my purpose
to speak of one who has indeed the semblance and repute of being a man, but who seems,
to those who are able to contemplate the greatness of his intellectual calibre,165 to be endowed
with powers nobler and well-nigh divine.166 And it is not his birth or bodily training that
I am about to praise, and that makes me now delay and procrastinate with an excess of
caution. Nor, again, is it his strength or beauty; for these form the eulogies of youths, of
which it matters little whether the utterance be worthy or not.167 For, to make an oration
on matters of a temporary and fugitive nature, which perish in many various ways and
quickly, and to discourse of these with all the grandeur and dignity of great affairs, and with
such timorous delays, would seem a vain and futile procedure.168 And certainly, if it had
been proposed to me to speak of any of those things which are useless and unsubstantial,

and such as I should never voluntarily have thought of speaking of,—if, I say, it had been
proposed to me to speak of anything of that character, my speech would have had none of
this caution or fear, lest in any statement I might seem to come beneath the merit of the
subject. But now, my subject dealing with that which is most godlike in the man, and that
in him which has most affinity with God, that which is indeed confined within the limits of
this visible and mortal form, but which strains nevertheless most ardently after the likeness
of God; and my object being to make mention of this, and to put my hand to weightier
matters, and therein also to express my thanksgivings to the Godhead, in that it has been
granted to me to meet with such a man beyond the expectation of men,—the expectation,
verily, not only of others, but also of my own heart, for I neither set such a privilege before
me at any time, nor hoped for it; it being, I say, my object, insignificant and altogether
without understanding as I am, to put my hand to such subjects, it is not without reason169
that I shrink from the task, and hesitate, and desire to keep silence. And, in truth, to keep
silence seems to me to be also the safe course, lest, with the show of an expression of
thanksgiving, I may chance, in my rashness, to discourse of noble and sacred subjects in
terms ignoble and paltry and utterly trite, and thus not only miss attaining the truth, but
even, so far as it depends on me, do it some injury with those who may believe that it stands
in such a category, when a discourse which is weak is composed thereon, and is rather calculated
to excite ridicule than to prove itself commensurate in its vigour with the dignity
of its themes. But all that pertains to thee is beyond the touch of injury and ridicule, O dear
soul; or, much rather let me say, that the divine herein remains ever as it is, unmoved and
harmed in nothing by our paltry and unworthy words. Yet I know not how we shall escape
the imputation of boldness and rashness in thus attempting in our folly, and with little either
of intelligence or of preparation, to handle matters which are weighty, and probably beyond
our capacity. And if, indeed, elsewhere and with others, we had aspired to make such
youthful endeavours in matters like these, we would surely have been bold and daring;
nevertheless in such a case our rashness might not have been ascribed to shamelessness, in
so far as we should not have been making the bold effort with thee. But now we shall be
filling out the whole measure of senselessness, or rather indeed we have already filled it out,
in venturing with unwashed feet (as the saying goes) to introduce ourselves to ears into
which the Divine Word Himself—not indeed with covered feet, as is the case with the gen-
eral mass of men, and, as it were, under the thick coverings of enigmatical and obscure170
sayings, but with unsandalled feet (if one may so speak)—has made His way clearly and
perspicuously, and in which He now sojourns; while we, who have but refuse and mud to
offer in these human words of ours, have been bold enough to pour them into ears which

are practised in hearing only words that are divine and pure. It might indeed suffice us,
therefore, to have transgressed thus far; and now, at least, it might be but right to restrain
ourselves, and to advance no further with our discourse. And verily I would stop here most
gladly. Nevertheless, as I have once made the rash venture, it may be allowed me first of all
to explain the reason under the force of which I have been led into this arduous enterprise,
if indeed any pardon can be extended to me for my forwardness in this matter.</p>

  <head>Argument III.—He is Stimulated to Speak of Him by the Longing of a Grateful Mind.
To the Utmost of His Ability He Thinks He Ought to Thank Him. From God
are the Beginnings of All Blessings; And to Him Adequate Thanks Cannot Be
Returned.</head>
<p>Ingratitude appears to me to be a dire evil; a dire evil indeed, yea, the direst of evils. For
when one has received some benefit, his failing to attempt to make any return by at least
the oral expression of thanks, where aught else is beyond his power, marks him out either
as an utterly irrational person, or as one devoid of the sense of obligations conferred, or as
a man without any memory. And, again, though171 one is possessed naturally and at once
by the sense and the knowledge of benefits received, yet, unless he also carries the memory
of these obligations to future days, and offers some evidence of gratitude to the author of
the boons, such a person is a dull, and ungrateful, and impious fellow; and he commits an
offence which can be excused neither in the case of the great nor in that of the small:—if we
suppose the case of a great and high-minded man not bearing constantly on his lips his great
benefits with all gratitude and honour, or that of a small and contemptible man not praising
and lauding with all his might one who has been his benefactor, not simply in great services,
but also in smaller. Upon the great, therefore, and those who excel in powers of mind, it is
incumbent, as out of their greater abundance and larger wealth, to render greater and worthier
praise, according to their capacity, to their benefactors. But the humble also, and those
in narrow circumstances, it beseems neither to neglect those who do them service, nor to
take their services carelessly, nor to flag in heart as if they could offer nothing worthy or
perfect; but as poor indeed, and yet as of good feeling, and as measuring not the capacity of
him whom they honour, but only their own, they ought to pay him honour according to
the present measure of their power,—a tribute which will probably be grateful and pleasant
to him who is honoured, and in no less consideration with him than it would have been had
it been some great and splendid offering, if it is only presented with decided earnestness,
and with a sincere mind. Thus is it laid down in the sacred writings,172 that a certain poor
and lowly woman, who was with the rich and powerful that were contributing largely and
richly out of their wealth, alone and by herself cast in a small, yea, the very smallest offering,
which was, however, all the while her whole substance, and received the testimony of having
presented the largest oblation. For, as I judge, the sacred word has not set up the large outward
quantity of the substance given, but rather the mind and disposition of the giver, as
the standard by which the worth and the magnificence of the offering are to be measured.
Wherefore it is not meet even for us by any means to shrink from this duty, through the
<note type="footnote">171 Reading ὅτῳ, with Hoeschelius, Bengel, and the Paris editor, while Voss. reads οτι.</note>
<note type="footnote">172 Luke xxi. 2.</note>

<pb n="57"/>
fear that our thanksgivings be not adequate to our obligations; but, on the contrary, we
ought to venture and attempt everything, so as to offer thanksgivings, if not adequate, at
least such as we have it in our power to exhibit, as in due return. And would that our discourse,
even though it comes short of the perfect measure, might at least reach the mark in
some degree, and be saved from all appearance of ingratitude! For a persistent silence,
maintained under the plausible cover of an inability to say anything worthy of the subject,
is a vain and evil thing; but it is the mark of a good disposition always to make the attempt
at a suitable return, even although the power of the person who offers the grateful acknowledgment
be inferior to the desert of the subject. For my part, even although I am unable to
speak as the matter merits, I shall not keep silence; but when I have done all that I possibly
can, then I may congratulate myself. Be this, then, the method of my eucharistic discourse.
To God, indeed, the God of the universe, I shall not think of speaking in such terms: yet is
it from Him that all the beginnings of our blessings come; and with Him consequently is it
that the beginning of our thanksgivings, or praises, or laudations, ought to be made. But,
in truth, not even though I were to devote myself wholly to that duty, and that, too, not as
I now am—to wit, profane and impure, and mixed up with and stained by every unhallowed173
and polluting evil—but sincere and as pure as pure may be, and most genuine,
and most unsophisticated, and uncontaminated by anything vile;—not even, I say, though
I were thus to devote myself wholly, and with all the purity of the newly born, to this task,
should I produce of myself any suitable gift in the way of honour and acknowledgment to
the Ruler and Originator of all things, whom neither men separately and individually, nor
yet all men in concert, acting with one spirit and one concordant impulse, as though all that
is pure were made to meet in one, and all that is diverse from that were turned also to that
service, could ever celebrate in a manner worthy of Him. For, in whatsoever measure any
man is able to form right and adequate conceptions of His works, and (if such a thing were
possible) to speak worthily regarding Him, then, so far as that very capacity is concerned,—a
capacity with which he has not been gifted by any other one, but which he has received from
Him alone, he cannot possibly find any greater matter of thanksgiving than what is implied
in its possession.</p>

<head>Argument IV.—The Son Alone Knows How to Praise the Father Worthily. In Christ
and by Christ Our Thanksgivings Ought to Be Rendered to the Father. Gregory
Also Gives Thanks to His Guardian Angel, Because He Was Conducted by Him
to Origen.</head>
<p>But let us commit the praises and hymns in honour of the King and Superintendent of
all things, the perennial Fount of all blessings, to the hand of Him who, in this matter as in
all others, is the Healer of our infirmity, and who alone is able to supply that which is lacking;
to the Champion and Saviour of our souls, His first-born Word, the Maker and Ruler of all
things, with whom also alone it is possible, both for Himself and for all, whether privately
and individually, or publicly and collectively, to send up to the Father uninterrupted and
ceaseless thanksgivings. For as He is Himself the Truth, and the Wisdom, and the Power of
the Father of the universe, and He is besides in Him, and is truly and entirely made one with
Him, it cannot be that, either through forgetfulness or unwisdom, or any manner of infirmity,
such as marks one dissociated from Him, He shall either fail in the power to praise Him,
or, while having the power, shall willingly neglect (a supposition which it is not lawful,
surely, to indulge) to praise the Father. For He alone is able most perfectly to fulfil the whole
meed of honour which is proper to Him, inasmuch as the Father of all things has made Him
one with Himself, and through Him all but completes the circle of His own being objectively,
174 and honours Him with a power in all respects equal to His own, even as also He is
honoured; which position He first and alone of all creatures that exist has had assigned Him,
this Only-begotten of the Father, who is in Him, and who is God the Word; while all others
of us are able to express our thanksgiving and our piety only if, in return for all the blessings
which proceed to us from the Father, we bring our offerings in simple dependence on Him
alone, and thus present the meet oblation of thanksgiving to Him who is the Author of all
things, acknowledging also that the only way of piety is in this manner to offer our memorials
through Him. Wherefore, in acknowledgment of that ceaseless providence which watches
over all of us, alike in the greatest and in the smallest concerns, and which has been sustained
even thus far, let this Word175 be accepted as the worthy and perpetual expression for all
thanksgivings and praises,—I mean the altogether perfect and living and verily animate
Word of the First Mind Himself. But let this word of ours be taken primarily as an eucharistic
address in honour of this sacred personage, who stands alone among all men;176 and

if I may seek to discourse177 of aught beyond this, and, in particular, of any of those beings
who are not seen, but yet are more godlike, and who have a special care for men, it shall be
addressed to that being who, by some momentous decision, had me allotted to him from
my boyhood to rule, and rear, and train,—I mean that holy angel of God who fed me from
my youth,178 as says the saint dear to God, meaning thereby his own peculiar one. Though
he, indeed, as being himself illustrious, did in these terms designate some angel exalted
enough to befit his own dignity (and whether it was some other one, or whether it was perchance
the Angel of the Mighty Counsel Himself, the Common Saviour of all, that he received
as his own peculiar guardian through his perfection, I do not clearly know),—he, I say, did
recognise and praise some superior angel as his own, whosoever that was. But we, in addition
to the homage we offer to the Common Ruler of all men, acknowledge and praise that being,
whosoever he is, who has been the wonderful guide of our childhood, who in all other
matters has been in time past my beneficent tutor and guardian. For this office of tutor and
guardian is one which evidently can suit179 neither me nor any of my friends and kindred;
for we are all blind, and see nothing of what is before us, so as to be able to judge of what is
right and fitting; but it can suit only him who sees beforehand all that is for the good of our
soul: that angel, I say, who still at this present time sustains, and instructs, and conducts
me; and who, in addition to all these other benefits, has brought me into connection with
this man, which, in truth, is the most important of all the services done me. And this, too,
he has effected for me, although between myself and that man of whom I discourse there
was no kinship of race or blood, nor any other tie, nor any relationship in neighbourhood
or country whatsoever; things which are made the ground of friendship and union among
the majority of men. But to speak in brief, in the exercise of a truly divine and wise forethought
he brought us together, who were unknown to each other, and strangers, and foreigners,
separated as thoroughly from each other as intervening nations, and mountains,
and rivers can divide man from man, and thus he made good this meeting which has been
full of profit to me, having, as I judge, provided beforehand this blessing for me from above
from my very birth and earliest upbringing. And in what manner this has been realized it
would take long to recount fully, not merely if I were to enter minutely into the whole subject,
and were to attempt to omit nothing, but even if, passing many things by, I should purpose
simply to mention in a summary way a few of the most important points.</p>

Birth of Heathen Parents is Stated. In the Fourteenth Year of His Age He Loses
His Father. He is Dedicated to the Study of Eloquence and Law. By a Wonderful
Leading of Providence, He is Brought to Origen.</head>
<p>For my earliest upbringing from the time of my birth onwards was under the hand of
my parents; and the manner of life in my father’s house was one of error,180 and of a kind
from which no one, I imagine, expected that we should be delivered; nor had I myself the
hope, boy as I was, and without understanding, and under a superstitious father.181 Then
followed the loss of my father, and my orphanhood, which182 perchance was also the beginning
of the knowledge of the truth to me. For then it was that I was brought over first to the
word of salvation and truth, in what manner I cannot tell, by constraint rather than by voluntary
choice. For what power of decision had I then, who was but fourteen years of age?
Yet from this very time this sacred Word began somehow to visit me, just at the period
when the reason common to all men attained its full function in me; yea, then for the first
time did it visit me. And though I thought but little of this in that olden time, yet now at
least, as I ponder it, I consider that no small token of the holy and marvellous providence
exercised over me is discernible in this concurrence, which was so distinctly marked in the
matter of my years, and which provided that all those deeds of error which preceded that
age might be ascribed to youth and want of understanding, and that the Holy Word might
not be imparted vainly to a soul yet ungifted with the full power of reason; and which secured
at the same time that when the soul now became endowed with that power, though not
gifted with the divine and pure reason,183 it might not be devoid at least of that fear which
is accordant with this reason, but that the human and the divine reason184 might begin to
act in me at once and together,—the one giving help with a power to me at least inexplicable,
185 though proper to itself, and the other receiving help. And when I reflect on this, I
am filled at once with gladness and with terror, while I rejoice indeed in the leading of
providence, and yet am also awed by the fear lest, after being privileged with such blessings,
I should still in any way fail of the end. But indeed I know not how my discourse has dwelt
so long on this matter, desirous as I am to give an account of the wonderful arrangement
(of God’s providence) in the course that brought me to this man, and anxious as nevertheless

I formerly was to pass with few words to the matters which follow in their order, not certainly
imagining that I could render to him who thus dealt with me that tribute of praise, or gratitude,
or piety which is due to him (for, were we to designate our discourse in such terms,
while yet we said nothing worthy of the theme, we might seem chargeable with arrogance),
but simply with the view of offering what may be called a plain narrative or confession, or
whatever other humble title may be given it. It seemed good to the only one of my parents
who survived to care for me—my mother, namely—that, being already under instruction
in those other branches in which boys not ignobly born and nurtured are usually trained,
I should attend also a teacher of public speaking, in the hope that I too should become a
public speaker. And accordingly I did attend such a teacher; and those who could judge in
that department then declared that I should in a short period be a public speaker. I for my
own part know not how to pronounce on that, neither should I desire to do so; for there
was no apparent ground for that gift then, nor was there as yet any foundation for those
forces186 which were capable of bringing me to it. But that divine conductor and true curator,
ever so watchful, when my friends were not thinking of such a step, and when I was not
myself desirous of it, came and suggested (an extension of my studies) to one of my teachers
under whose charge I had been put, with a view to instruction in the Roman tongue, not in
the expectation that I was to reach the completest mastery of that tongue, but only that I
might not be absolutely ignorant of it; and this person happened also to be not altogether
unversed in laws. Putting the idea, therefore, into this teacher’s mind,187 he set me to learn
in a thorough way the laws of the Romans by his help. And that man took up this charge
zealously with me; and I, on my side, gave myself to it—more, however, to gratify the man,
than as being myself an admirer of the study. And when he got me as his pupil, he began to
teach me with all enthusiasm. And he said one thing, which has proved to me the truest of
all his sayings, to wit, that my education in the laws would be my greatest viaticum188—for
thus he phrased it—whether I aspired to be one of the public speakers who contend in the
courts of justice, or preferred to belong to a different order. Thus did he express himself,
intending his word to bear simply on things human; but to me it seems that he was moved
to that utterance by a diviner impulse than he himself supposed. For when, willingly or
unwillingly, I was becoming well instructed in these laws, at once bonds, as it were, were
cast upon my movements, and cause and occasion for my journeying to these parts arose
from the city Berytus, which is a city not far distant189 from this territory, somewhat Latinized,
190 and credited with being a school for these legal studies. And this revered man

coming from Egypt, from the city of Alexandria, where previously he happened to have his
home, was moved by other circumstances to change his residence to this place, as if with
the express object of meeting us. And for my part, I cannot explain the reasons of these incidents,
and I shall willingly pass them by. This however is certain, that as yet no necessary
occasion for my coming to this place and meeting with this man was afforded by my purpose
to learn our laws, since I had it in my power also to repair to the city of Rome itself.191 How,
then, was this effected? The then governor of Palestine suddenly took possession of a friend
of mine, namely my sister’s husband, and separated him from his wife, and carried him off
here against his will, in order to secure his help, and have him associated with him in the
labours of the government of the country; for he was a person skilled in law, and perhaps
is still so employed. After he had gone with him, however, he had the good fortune in no
long time to have his wife sent for, and to receive her again, from whom, against his will,
and to his grievance, he had been separated. And thus he chanced also to draw us along
with her to that same place. For when we were minded to travel, I know not where, but
certainly to any other place rather than this, a soldier suddenly came upon the scene, bearing
a letter of instructions for us to escort and protect our sister in her restoration to her husband,
and to offer ourselves also as companion to her on the journey; in which we had the opportunity
of doing a favour to our relative, and most of all to our sister (so that she might not
have to address herself to the journey either in any unbecoming manner, or with any great
fear or hesitation), while at the same time our other friends and connections thought well
of it, and made it out to promise no slight advantage, as we could thus visit the city of Berytus,
and carry out there with all diligence192 our studies in the laws. Thus all things moved me
thither,—my sense of duty193 to my sister, my own studies, and over and above these, the
soldier (for it is right also to mention this), who had with him a larger supply of public
vehicles than the case demanded, and more cheques194 than could be required for our sister
alone. These were the apparent reasons for our journey; but the secret and yet truer reasons
were these,—our opportunity of fellowship with this man, our instruction through that

These were the real causes that brought us here, blind and ignorant, as we were, as

companion and beneficent conductor and guardian, ever leading us in safety through the
whole of this present life, as through a long journey, that carried us past other places, and
Berytus in especial, which city at that time we seemed most bent on reaching, and brought
us hither and settled us here, disposing and directing all things, until by any means he might
bind us in a connection with this man who was to be the author of the greater part of our
blessings. And he who came in such wise, that divine angel, gave over this charge197 to him,
and did, if I may so speak, perchance take his rest here, not indeed under the pressure of
labour or exhaustion of any kind (for the generation of those divine ministers knows no

<p>And from the very first day of his receiving us (which day was, in truth, the first day to
me, and the most precious of all days, if I may so speak, since then for the first time the true
Sun began to rise upon me), while we, like some wild creatures of the fields, or like fish, or
some sort of birds that had fallen into the toils or nets, and were endeavouring to slip out
again and escape, were bent on leaving him, and making off for Berytus198 or our native
country, he studied by all means to associate us closely with him, contriving all kinds of arguments,
and putting every rope in motion (as the proverb goes), and bringing all his powers
to bear on that object. With that intent he lauded the lovers of philosophy with large laudations
and many noble utterances, declaring that those only live a life truly worthy of reasonable
creatures who aim at living an upright life and who seek to know first of all themselves,
what manner of persons they are, and then the things that are truly good, which man ought
to strive after, and then the things that are really evil, from which man ought to flee. And
then he reprehended ignorance and all the ignorant: and there are many such, who, like
brute cattle,199 are blind in mind, and have no understanding even of what they are, and
are as far astray as though they were wholly void of reason, and neither know themselves
what is good and what is evil, nor care at all to learn it from others, but toil feverishly in
quest of wealth, and glory, and such honours as belong to the crowd, and bodily comforts,
and go distraught about things like these, as if they were the real good. And as though such
objects were worth much, yea, worth all else, they prize the things themselves, and the arts
by which they can acquire them, and the different lines of life which give scope for their attainment,—
the military profession, to wit, and the juridical, and the study of the laws. And
with earnest and sagacious words he told us that these are the objects that enervate us, when
we despise that reason which ought to be the true master within us.200 I cannot recount at
present all the addresses of this kind which he delivered to us, with the view of persuading

us to take up the pursuit of philosophy. Nor was it only for a single day that he thus dealt
with us, but for many days and, in fact, as often as we were in the habit of going to him at
the outset; and we were pierced by his argumentation as with an arrow from the very first
occasion of our hearing him201 (for he was possessed of a rare combination of a certain
sweet grace and persuasiveness, along with a strange power of constraint), though we still
wavered and debated the matter undecidedly with ourselves, holding so far by the pursuit
of philosophy, without however being brought thoroughly over to it, while somehow or
other we found ourselves quite unable to withdraw from it conclusively, and thus were always
drawn towards him by the power of his reasonings, as by the force of some superior necessity.
For he asserted further that there could be no genuine piety towards the Lord of all in the
man who despised this gift of philosophy,—a gift which man alone of all the creatures of
the earth has been deemed honourable and worthy enough to possess, and one which every
man whatsoever, be he wise or be he ignorant, reasonably embraces, who has not utterly
lost the power of thought by some mad distraction of mind. He asserted, then, as I have
said, that it was not possible (to speak correctly) for any one to be truly pious who did not
philosophize. And thus he continued to do with us, until, by pouring in upon us many such
argumentations, one after the other, he at last carried us fairly off somehow or other by a
kind of divine power, like people with his reasonings, and established us (in the practice of
philosophy), and set us down without the power of movement, as it were, beside himself by
his arts. Moreover, the stimulus of friendship was also brought to bear upon us,—a stimulus,
indeed, not easily withstood, but keen and most effective,—the argument of a kind and affectionate
disposition, which showed itself benignantly in his words when he spoke to us
and associated with us. For he did not aim merely at getting round us by any kind of reasoning;
but his desire was, with a benignant, and affectionate, and most benevolent mind,
to save us, and make us partakers in the blessings that flow from philosophy, and most especially
also in those other gifts which the Deity has bestowed on him above most men, or,
as we may perhaps say, above all men of our own time. I mean the power that teaches us
piety, the word of salvation, that comes to many, and subdues to itself all whom it visits: for
there is nothing that shall resist it, inasmuch as it is and shall be itself the king of all; although
as yet it is hidden, and is not recognised, whether with ease or with difficulty, by the common
crowd, in such wise that, when interrogated respecting it, they should be able to speak intelligently
about it. And thus, like some spark lighting upon our inmost soul, love was kindled
and burst into flame within us,—a love at once to the Holy Word, the most lovely object of
all, who attracts all irresistibly toward Himself by His unutterable beauty, and to this man,
His friend and advocate. And being most mightily smitten by this love, I was persuaded to

give up all those objects or pursuits which seem to us befitting, and among others even my
boasted jurisprudence,—yea, my very fatherland and friends, both those who were present
with me then, and those from whom I had parted. And in my estimation there arose but
one object dear and worth desire,—to wit, philosophy, and that master of philosophy, this
inspired man. “And the soul of Jonathan was knit with David.”202 This word, indeed, I did
not read till afterwards in the sacred Scriptures; but I felt it before that time, not less clearly
than it is written: for, in truth, it reached me then by the clearest of all revelations. For it
was not simply Jonathan that was knit with David; but those things were knit together which
are the ruling powers in man—their souls,—those objects which, even though all the things
which are apparent and ostensible in man are severed, cannot by any skill be forced to a
severance when they themselves are unwilling. For the soul is free, and cannot be coerced
by any means, not even though one should confine it and keep guard over it in some secret
prison-house. For wherever the intelligence is, there it is also of its own nature and by the
first reason. And if it seems to you to be in a kind of prison-house, it is represented as there
to you by a sort of second reason. But for all that, it is by no means precluded from subsisting
anywhere according to its own determination; nay, rather it is both able to be, and is reasonably
believed to be, there alone and altogether, wheresoever and in connection with what
things soever those actions which are proper only to it are in operation. Wherefore, what I
experienced has been most clearly declared in this very short statement, that “the soul of
Jonathan was knit with the soul of David;” objects which, as I said, cannot by any means be
forced to a separation against their will, and which of their own inclination certainly will
not readily choose it. Nor is it, in my opinion, in the inferior subject, who is changeful and
very prone to vary in purpose, and in whom singly there has been no capacity of union at
first, that the power of loosing the sacred bonds of this affection rests, but rather in the nobler
one, who is constant and not readily shaken, and through whom it has been possible to tie
these bonds and to fasten this sacred knot. Therefore it is not the soul of David that was
knit by the divine word with the soul of Jonathan; but, on the contrary, the soul of the latter,
who was the inferior, is said to be thus affected and knit with the soul of David. For the nobler
object would not choose to be knit with one inferior, inasmuch as it is sufficient for itself;
but the inferior object, as standing in need of the help which the nobler can give, ought
properly to be knit with the nobler, and fitted dependently to it: so that this latter, retaining
still its sufficiency in itself, might sustain no loss by its connection with the inferior; and
that that which is of itself without order203 being now united and fitted harmoniously with
the nobler, might, without any detriment done, be perfectly subdued to the nobler by the
constraints of such bonds. Wherefore, to apply the bonds is the part of the superior, and
<note type="footnote">202 1 Sam. xviii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">203 ἄτακτον.</note>

<pb n="67"/>
not of the inferior; but to be knit to the other is the part of the inferior, and this too in such
a manner that it shall possess no power of loosing itself from these bonds. And by a similar
constraint, then, did this David of ours once gird us to himself; and he holds us now, and
has held us ever since that time, so that, even though we desired it, we could not loose
ourselves from his bonds. And hence it follows that, even though we were to depart, he
would not release this soul of mine, which, as the Holy Scripture puts it, he holds knit so
closely with himself.</p>

<p>But after he had thus carried us captive at the very outset, and had shut us in, as it were,
on all sides, and when what was best204 had been accomplished by him, and when it seemed
good to us to remain with him for a time, then he took us in hand, as a skilled husbandman
may take in hand some field unwrought, and altogether unfertile, and sour, and burnt up,
and hard as a rock, and rough, or, it may be, one not utterly barren or unproductive, but
rather, perchance, by nature very productive, though then waste and neglected, and stiff
and untractable with thorns and wild shrubs; or as a gardener may take in hand some plant
which is wild indeed, and which yields no cultivated fruits, though it may not be absolutely
worthless, and on finding it thus, may, by his skill in gardening, bring some cultivated shoot
and graft it in, by making a fissure in the middle, and then bringing the two together, and
binding the one to the other, until the sap in each shall flow in one stream,205 and they shall
both grow with the same nurture: for one may often see a tree of a mixed and worthless206
species thus rendered productive in spite of its past barrenness, and made to rear the fruits
of the good olive on wild roots; or one may see a wild plant saved from being altogether
profitless by the skill of a careful gardener; or, once more, one may see a plant which otherwise
is one both of culture and of fruitfulness, but which, through the want of skilled attendance,
has been left unpruned and unwatered and waste, and which is thus choked by the
mass of superfluous shoots suffered to grow out of it at random,207 yet brought to discharge
its proper function in germination,208 and made to bear the fruit whose production was
formerly hindered by the superfluous growth.209 In suchwise, then, and with such a disposition
did he receive us at first; and surveying us, as it were, with a husbandman’s skill, and
gauging us thoroughly, and not confining his notice to those things only which are patent
to the eye of all, and which are looked upon in open light, but penetrating into us more
deeply, and probing what is most inward in us, he put us to the question, and made propositions
to us, and listened to us in our replies; and whenever he thereby detected anything in
us not wholly fruitless and profitless and waste, he set about clearing the soil, and turning

it up and irrigating it, and putting all things in movement, and brought his whole skill and
care to bear on us, and wrought upon our mind. And thorns and thistles,210 and every kind
of wild herb or plant which our mind (so unregulated and precipitate in its own action)
yielded and produced in its uncultured luxuriance and native wildness, he cut out and
thoroughly removed by the processes of refutation and prohibition; sometimes assailing us
in the genuine Socratic fashion, and again upsetting us by his argumentation whenever he
saw us getting restive under him, like so many unbroken steeds, and springing out of the
course and galloping madly about at random, until with a strange kind of persuasiveness
and constraint he reduced us to a state of quietude under him by his discourse, which acted
like a bridle in our mouth. And that was at first an unpleasant position for us, and one not
without pain, as he dealt with persons who were unused to it, and still all untrained to submit
to reason, when he plied us with his argumentations; and yet he purged us by them. And
when he had made us adaptable, and had prepared us successfully for the reception of the
words of truth, then, further, as though we were now a soil well wrought and soft, and ready
to impart growth to the seeds cast into it, he dealt liberally with us, and sowed the good seed
in season, and attended to all the other cares of the good husbandry, each in its own proper
season. And whenever he perceived any element of infirmity or baseness in our mind
(whether it was of that character by nature, or had become thus gross through the excessive
nurture of the body), he pricked it with his discourses, and reduced it by those delicate words
and turns of reasoning which, although at first the very simplest, are gradually evolved one
after the other, and skilfully wrought out, until they advance to a sort of complexity which
can scarce be mastered or unfolded, and which cause us to start up, as it were, out of sleep,
and teach us the art of holding always by what is immediately before one, without ever
making any slip by reason either of length or of subtlety. And if there was in us anything of
an injudicious and precipitate tendency, whether in the way of assenting to all that came
across us, of whatever character the objects might be, and even though they proved false,
or in the way of often withstanding other things, even though they were spoken truthfully,—
that, too, he brought under discipline in us by those delicate reasonings already
mentioned, and by others of like kind (for this branch of philosophy is of varied form), and
accustomed us not to throw in our testimony at one time, and again to refuse it, just at
random, and as chance impelled, but to give it only after careful examination not only into
things manifest, but also into those that are secret.211 For many things which are in high
repute of themselves, and honourable in appearance, have found entrance through fair
words into our ears, as though they were true, while yet they were hollow and false, and
have borne off and taken possession of the suffrage of truth at our hand, and then, no long

time afterwards, they have been discovered to be corrupt and unworthy of credit, and deceitful
borrowers of the garb of truth; and have thus too easily exposed us as men who are
ridiculously deluded, and who bear their witness inconsiderately to things which ought by
no means to have won it. And, on the contrary, other things which are really honourable
and the reverse of impositions, but which have not been expressed in plausible statements,
and thus have the appearance of being paradoxical and most incredible, and which have
been rejected as false on their own showing, and held up undeservedly to ridicule, have afterwards,
on careful investigation and examination, been discovered to be the truest of all
things, and wholly incontestable, though for a time spurned and reckoned false. Not simply,
then, by dealing with things patent and prominent, which are sometimes delusive and
sophistical, but also by teaching us to search into things within us, and to put them all individually
to the test, lest any of them should give back a hollow sound, and by instructing us
to make sure of these inward things first of all, he trained us to give our assent to outward
things only then and thus, and to express our opinion on all these severally. In this way, that
capacity of our mind which deals critically with words and reasonings, was educated in a
rational manner; not according to the judgments of illustrious rhetoricians—whatever Greek
or foreign honour appertains to that title212—for theirs is a discipline of little value and no
necessity: but in accordance with that which is most needful for all, whether Greek or outlandish,
whether wise or illiterate, and, in fine, not to make a long statement by going over
every profession and pursuit separately, in accordance with that which is most indispensable
for all men, whatever manner of life they have chosen, if it is indeed the care and interest
of all who have to converse on any subject whatever with each other, to be protected against
deception.</p>

<p>Nor did he confine his efforts merely to that form of the mind which it is the lot of the
dialectics to regulate;213 but he also took in hand that humble capacity of mind, (which
shows itself) in our amazement at the magnitude, and the wondrousness, and the magnificent
and absolutely wise construction of the world, and in our marvelling in a reasonless way,
and in our being overpowered with fear, and in our knowing not, like the irrational creatures,
what conclusion to come to. That, too, he aroused and corrected by other studies in natural
science, illustrating and distinguishing the various divisions of created objects, and with
admirable clearness reducing them to their pristine elements, taking them all up perspicuously
in his discourse, and going over the nature of the whole, and of each several section, and
discussing the multiform revolution and mutation of things in the world, until he carried
us fully along with him under his clear teaching; and by those reasonings which he had
partly learned from others, and partly found out for himself, he filled our minds with a rational
instead of an irrational wonder at the sacred economy of the universe, and irreproveable
constitution of all things. This is that sublime and heavenly study which is taught by
natural philosophy—a science most attractive to all. And what need is there now to speak
of the sacred mathematics, viz., geometry, so precious to all and above all controversy, and
astronomy, whose course is on high? These different studies he imprinted on our understandings,
training us in them, or calling them into our mind, or doing with us something
else which I know not how to designate rightly. And the one he presented lucidly as the
immutable groundwork and secure foundation of all, namely geometry; and by the other,
namely astronomy, he lifted us up to the things that are highest above us, while he made
heaven passable to us by the help of each of these sciences, as though they were ladders
reaching the skies.</p>

a wise and soothing tendency, and very often also by the most cogent addresses touching
our moral dispositions, and our modes of life. Nor was it only by words, but also by deeds,
that he regulated in some measure our inclinations,—to wit, by that very contemplation
and observation of the impulses and affections of the mind, by the issue of which most especially
the mind is wont to be reduced to a right estate from one of discord, and to be restored
to a condition of judgment and order out of one of confusion. So that, beholding itself
as in a mirror (and I may say specifically, viewing, on the one hand, the very beginnings
and roots of evil in it, and all that is reasonless within it, from which spring up all absurd
affections and passions; and, on the other hand, all that is truly excellent and reasonable
within it, under the sway of which it remains proof against injury and perturbation in itself215,
and then scrutinizing carefully the things thus discovered to be in it), it might cast out all
those which are the growth of the inferior part, and which waste our powers216 through
intemperance, or hinder and choke them through depression,—such things as pleasures
and lusts, or pains and fears, and the whole array of ills that accompany these different
species of evil. I say that thus it might cast them out and make away with them, by coping
with them while yet in their beginnings and only just commencing their growth, and not
leaving them to wax in strength even by a short delay, but destroying and rooting them out
at once; while, at the same time, it might foster all those things which are really good, and
which spring from the nobler part, and might preserve them by nursing them in their beginnings,
and watching carefully over them until they should reach their maturity. For it is thus
(he used to say) that the heavenly virtues will ripen in the soul: to wit, prudence, which first
of all is able to judge of those very motions in the mind at once from the things themselves,

and by the knowledge which accrues to it of things outside of us, whatever such there may
be, both good and evil; and temperance, the power that makes the right selection among
these things in their beginnings; and righteousness, which assigns what is just to each; and
that virtue which is the conserver of them all—fortitude. And therefore he did not accustom
us to a mere profession in words, as that prudence, for instance, is the knowledge217 of good
and evil, or of what ought to be done, and what ought not: for that would be indeed a vain
and profitless study, if there was simply the doctrine without the deed; and worthless would
that prudence be, which, without doing the things that ought to be done, and without
turning men away from those that ought not to be done, should be able merely to furnish
the knowledge of these things to those who possessed her,—though many such persons
come under our observation. Nor, again, did he content himself with the mere assertion
that temperance is simply the knowledge of what ought to be chosen and what ought not;
though the other schools of philosophers do not teach even so much as that, and especially
the more recent, who are so forcible and vigorous in words (so that I have often been astonished
at them, when they sought to demonstrate that there is the same virtue in God and in
men, and that upon earth, in particular, the wise man is equal218 to God), and yet are incapable
of delivering the truth as to prudence, so that one shall do the things which are dictated
by prudence, or the truth as to temperance, so that one shall choose the things he has learned
by it; and the same holds good also of their treatment of righteousness and fortitude. Not
thus, however, in mere words only did this teacher go over the truths concerning the virtues
with us; but he incited us much more to the practice of virtue, and stimulated us by the
deeds he did more than by the doctrines he taught.</p>

<head>Argument X.—Hence the Mere Word-Sages are Confuted, Who Say and Yet Act
    Not.</head>
<p>Now I beg of the philosophers of this present time, both those whom I have known
personally myself, and those of whom I have heard by report from others, and I beg also of
all other men, that they take in good part the statements I have just made. And let no one
suppose that I have expressed myself thus, either through simple friendship toward that
man, or through hatred toward the rest of the philosophers; for if there is any one inclined
to be an admirer of them for their discourses, and wishful to speak well of them, and pleased
at hearing the most honourable mention made of them by others, I myself am the man.
Nevertheless, those facts (to which I have referred) are of such a nature as to bring upon
the very name of philosophy the last degree of ridicule almost from the great mass of men;
and I might almost say that I would choose to be altogether unversed in it, rather than learn
any of the things which these men profess, with whom I thought it good no longer to associate
myself in this life,—though in that, it may be, I formed an incorrect judgment. But I
say that no one should suppose that I make these statements at the mere prompting of a
zealous regard for the praise of this man, or under the stimulus of any existing animosity219
towards other philosophers. But let all be assured that I say even less than his deeds merit,
lest I should seem to be indulging in adulation; and that I do not seek out studied words
and phrases, and cunning means of laudation—I who could never of my own will, even
when I was a youth, and learning the popular style of address under a professor of the art
of public speaking, bear to utter a word of praise, or pass any encomium on any one which
was not genuine. Wherefore on the present occasion, too, I do not think it right, in proposing
to myself the task simply of commending him, to magnify him at the cost of the reprobation
of others. And, in good sooth,220 I should speak only to the man’s injury, if, with the view
of having something grander to say of him, I should compare his blessed life with the failings
of others. We are not, however, so senseless.221 But I shall testify simply to what has come
within my own experience, apart from all ill-judged comparisons and trickeries in words.</p>

<head>Argument XI.—Origen is the First and the Only One that Exhorts Gregory to Add
to His Acquirements the Study of Philosophy, and Offers Him in a Certain
Manner an Example in Himself. Of Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude.
The Maxim, Know Thyself.</head>
<p>He was also the first and only man that urged me to study the philosophy of the Greeks,
and persuaded me by his own moral example both to hear and to hold by the doctrine of
morals, while as yet I had by no means been won over to that, so far as other philosophers
were concerned (I again acknowledge it),—not rightly so, indeed, but unhappily, as I may
say without exaggeration, for me. I did not, however, associate with many at first, but only
with some few who professed to be teachers, though, in good sooth, they all established their
philosophy only so far as words went.222 This man, however, was the first that induced me
to philosophize by his words, as he pointed the exhortation by deeds before he gave it in
words, and did not merely recite well-studied sentences; nay, he did not deem it right to
speak on the subject at all, but with a sincere mind, and one bent on striving ardently after
the practical accomplishment of the things expressed, and he endeavoured all the while to
show himself in character like the man whom he describes in his discourses as the person
who shall lead a noble life, and he ever exhibited (in himself), I would say, the pattern of
the wise man. But as our discourse at the outset proposed to deal with the truth, and not
with vain-glorious language,223 I shall not speak of him now as the exemplar of the wise
man. And yet, if I chose to speak thus of him, I should not be far astray from the truth.224
Nevertheless, I pass that by at present. I shall not speak of him as a perfect pattern, but as
one who vehemently desires to imitate the perfect pattern, and strives after it with zeal and
earnestness, even beyond the capacity of men, if I may so express myself; and who labours,
moreover, also to make us, who are so different,225 of like character with himself, not mere
masters and apprehenders of the bald doctrines concerning the impulses of the soul, but
masters and apprehenders of these impulses themselves. For he pressed226 us on both to

deed and to doctrine, and carried us along by that same view and method,227 not merely
into a small section of each virtue, but rather into the whole, if mayhap we were able to take
it in. And he constrained us also, if I may so speak, to practise righteousness on the ground
of the personal action of the soul itself,228 which he persuaded us to study, drawing us off
from the officious anxieties of life, and from the turbulence of the forum, and raising us to
the nobler vocation of looking into ourselves, and dealing with the things that concern
ourselves in truth. Now, that this is to practise righteousness, and that this is the true righteousness,
some also of our ancient philosophers have asserted (expressing it as the personal
action, I think), and have affirmed that this is more profitable for blessedness, both to the
men themselves and to those who are with them,229 if indeed it belongs to this virtue to re-
compense according to desert, and to assign to each his own. For what else could be supposed
to be so proper to the soul? Or what could be so worthy of it, as to exercise a care over itself,
not gazing outwards, or busying itself with alien matters, or, to speak shortly, doing the
worst injustice to itself, but turning its attention inwardly upon itself, rendering its own due
to itself, and acting thereby righteously?230 To practise righteousness after this fashion,
therefore, he impressed upon us, if I may so speak, by a sort of force. And he educated us
to prudence none the less,—teaching to be at home with ourselves, and to desire and endeavour
to know ourselves, which indeed is the most excellent achievement of philosophy, the
thing that is ascribed also to the most prophetic of spirits231 as the highest argument of
wisdom—the precept, Know thyself. And that this is the genuine function of prudence, and
that such is the heavenly prudence, is affirmed well by the ancients; for in this there is one
virtue common to God and to man; while the soul is exercised in beholding itself as in a
mirror, and reflects the divine mind in itself, if it is worthy of such a relation, and traces out
a certain inexpressible method for the attaining of a kind of apotheosis. And in correspondence
with this come also the virtues of temperance and fortitude: temperance, indeed, in

adopted this as the most evident sense. Thus ἄγχων is retained unchanged, and is taken as a parallel to the following

<head>Argument XII.—Gregory Disallows Any Attainment of the Virtues on His Part.
Piety is Both the Beginning and the End, and Thus It is the Parent of All the
Virtues.</head>
<p>It is true, indeed that in consequence of our dull and sluggish nature, he has not yet
succeeded in making us righteous, and prudent, and temperate, or manly, although he has
laboured zealously on us. For we are neither in real possession of any virtue whatsoever,
either human or divine, nor have we ever made any near approach to it, but we are still far
from it. And these are very great and lofty virtues, and none of them may be assumed by
any common person,234 but only by one whom God inspires with the power. We are also
by no means so favourably constituted for them by nature, neither do we yet profess ourselves
to be worthy of reaching them; for through our listlessness and feebleness we have not done
all these things which ought to be done by those who aspire after what is noblest, and aim
at what is perfect. We are not yet therefore either righteous or temperate, or endowed with
any of the other virtues. But this admirable man, this friend and advocate of the virtues, has
long ago done for us perhaps all that it lay in his power to do for us, in making us lovers of
virtue, who should love it with the most ardent affection. And by his own virtue he created
in us a love at once for the beauty of righteousness, the golden face of which in truth was
shown to us by him; and for prudence, which is worthy of being sought by all; and for the
true wisdom, which is most delectable; and for temperance, the heavenly virtue which forms
the sound constitution of the soul, and brings peace to all who possess it; and for manliness,
that most admirable grace; and for patience, that virtue peculiarly ours;235 and, above all,
for piety, which men rightly designate when they call it the mother of the virtues. For this
is the beginning and the end of all the virtues. And beginning with this one, we shall find
all the other virtues grow upon us most readily: if, while for ourselves we earnestly aspire
after this grace, which every man, be he only not absolutely impious, or a mere pleasureseeker,
ought to acquire for himself, in order to his being a friend of God and a maintainer236
of His truth, and while we diligently pursue this virtue, we also give heed to the other virtues,
in order that we may not approach our God in unworthiness and impurity, but with all
virtue and wisdom as our best conductors and most sagacious priests. And the end of all I

<head>Argument XIII.—The Method Which Origen Used in His Theological and Metaphysical
Instructions. He Commends the Study of All Writers, the Atheistic
Alone Excepted. The Marvellous Power of Persuasion in Speech. The Facility of
the Mind in Giving Its Assent.</head>
<p>And besides all his other patient and laborious efforts, how shall I in words give any
account of what he did for us, in instructing us in theology and the devout character? and
how shall I enter into the real disposition of the man, and show with what judiciousness
and careful preparation he would have us familiarized with all discourse about the Divinity,
guarding sedulously against our being in any peril with respect to what is the most needful
thing of all, namely, the knowledge of the Cause of all things? For he deemed it right for us
to study philosophy in such wise, that we should read with utmost diligence all that has been
written, both by the philosophers and by the poets of old, rejecting nothing,238 and repudiating
nothing (for, indeed, we did not yet possess the power of critical discernment), except
only the productions of the atheists, who, in their conceits, lapse from the general intelligence
of man, and deny that there is either a God or a providence. From these he would have us
abstain, because they are not worthy of being read, and because it might chance that the
soul within us that is meant for piety might be defiled by listening to words that are contrary
to the worship of God. For even those who frequent the temples of piety, as they think them
to be, are careful not to touch anything that is profane.239 He held, therefore, that the books
of such men did not merit to be taken at all into the consideration of men who have assumed
the practice of piety. He thought, however, that we should obtain and make ourselves familiar
with all other writings, neither preferring nor repudiating any one kind, whether it be
philosophical discourse or not, whether Greek or foreign, but hearing what all of them have
to convey. And it was with great wisdom and sagacity that he acted on this principle, lest
any single saying given by the one class or the other should be heard and valued above others
as alone true, even though it might not be true, and lest it might thus enter our mind and
deceive us, and, in being lodged there by itself alone, might make us its own, so that we
should no more have the power to withdraw from it, or wash ourselves clear of it, as one
washes out a little wool that has got some colour ingrained in it. For a mighty thing and an
energetic is the discourse of man, and subtle with its sophisms, and quick to find its way
into the ears, and mould the mind, and impress us with what it conveys; and when once it
has taken possession of us, it can win us over to love it as truth; and it holds its place within

us even though it be false and deceitful, overmastering us like some enchanter, and retaining
as its champion the very man it has deluded. And, on the other hand, the mind of man is
withal a thing easily deceived by speech, and very facile in yielding its assent; and, indeed,
before it discriminates and inquires into matters in any proper way, it is easily won over,
either through its own obtuseness and imbecility, or through the subtlety of the discourse,
to give itself up, at random often, all weary of accurate examination, to crafty reasonings
and judgments, which are erroneous themselves, and which lead into error those who receive
them. And not only so; but if another mode of discourse aims at correcting it, it will neither
give it admittance, nor suffer itself to be altered in opinion, because it is held fast by any
notion which has previously got possession of it, as though some inexorable tyrant were
lording over it.</p>

<head>Argument XIV.—Whence the Contentions of Philosophers Have Sprung. Against
Those Who Catch at Everything that Meets Them, and Give It Credence, and
Cling to It. Origen Was in the Habit of Carefully Reading and Explaining the
Books of the Heathen to His Disciples.</head>
<p>Is it not thus that contradictory and opposing tenets have been introduced, and all the
contentions of philosophers, while one party withstands the opinions of another, and some
hold by certain positions, and others by others, and one school attaches itself to one set of
dogmas, and another to another? And all, indeed, aim at philosophizing, and profess to
have been doing so ever since they were first roused to it, and declare that they desire it not
less now when they are well versed in the discussions than when they began them: yea, rather
they allege that they have even more love for philosophy now, after they have had, so to
speak, a little taste of it, and have had the liberty of dwelling on its discussions, than when
at first, and without any previous experience of it, they were urged by a sort of impulse to
philosophize. That is what they say; and henceforth they give no heed to any words of those
who hold opposite opinions. And accordingly, no one of the ancients has ever induced any
one of the moderns, or those of the Peripatetic school, to turn to his way of thinking, and
adopt his method of philosophizing; and, on the other hand, none of the moderns has imposed
his notions upon those of the ancient school. Nor, in short, has any one done so with
any other.240 For it is not an easy thing to induce one to give up his own opinions, and accept
those of others; although these might, perhaps, even be sentiments which, if he had been
led to credit them before he began to philosophize, the man might at first have admired and
accepted with all readiness: as, while the mind was not yet preoccupied, he might have directed
his attention to that set of opinions, and given them his approval, and on their behalf
opposed himself to those which he holds at present. Such, at least, has been the kind of
philosophizing exhibited by our noble and most eloquent and critical Greeks: for whatever
any one of these has lighted on at the outset, moved by some impulse or other, that alone
he declares to be truth, and holds that all else which is maintained by other philosophers is
simply delusion and folly, though he himself does not more satisfactorily establish his own
positions by argument, than do all the others severally defend their peculiar tenets; the man’s
object being simply to be under no obligation to give up and alter his opinions, whether by
constraint or by persuasion, while he has (if one may speak truth) nothing else but a kind
of unreasoning impulse towards these dogmas on the side of philosophy, and possesses no
other criterion of what he imagines to be true, than (let it not seem an incredible assertion)

is here hinted at, and what Hippolytus has worked out. Compare Col. ii. 8.]</note>

undistinguishing chance.241 And as each one thus becomes attached to those positions with
which he has first fallen in, and is, as it were, held in chains by them, he is no longer capable
of giving attention to others, if he happens to have anything of his own to offer on every
subject with the demonstration of truth, and if he has the aid of argument to show how false
the tenets of his adversaries are; for, helplessly and thoughtlessly and as if he looked for
some happy contingency, he yields himself to the reasonings that first take possession of
him.242 And such reasonings mislead those who accept them, not only in other matters, but
above all, in what is of greatest and most essential consequence—in the knowledge of God
and in piety. And yet men become bound by them in such a manner that no one can very
easily release them. For they are like men caught in a swamp stretching over some wide
impassable plain, which, when they have once fallen into it, allows them neither to retrace
their steps nor to cross it and effect their safety, but keeps them down in its soil until they
meet their end; or they may be compared to men in a deep, dense, and majestic forest, into
which the wayfarer enters, with the idea, perchance, of finding his road out of it again
forthwith, and of taking his course once more on the open plain,243 but is baffled in his
purpose by the extent and thickness of the wood. And turning in a variety of directions, and
lighting on various continuous paths within it, he pursues many a course, thinking that by
some of them he will surely find his way out: but they only lead him farther in, and in no
way open up an exit for him, inasmuch as they are all only paths within the forest itself;
until at last the traveller, utterly worn out and exhausted, seeing that all the ways he had
tried had proved only forest still, and despairing of finding any more his dwelling-place on
earth, makes up his mind to abide there, and establish his hearth, and lay out for his use
such free space as he can prepare in the wood itself. Or again, we might take the similitude
of a labyrinth, which has but one apparent entrance, so that one suspects nothing artful
from the outside, and goes within by the single door that shows itself; and then, after advancing
to the farthest interior, and viewing the cunning spectacle, and examining the construction
so skillfully contrived, and full of passages, and laid out with unending paths leading

have once got within it, as is discussion,244 at least as one may meet with it in the case of
certain of these philosophers.245 Wherefore, to secure us against falling into the unhappy
experience of most, he did not introduce us to any one exclusive school of philosophy; nor
did he judge it proper for us to go away with any single class of philosophical opinions, but
he introduced us to all, and determined that we should be ignorant of no kind of Grecian
doctrine.246 And he himself went on with us, preparing the way before us, and leading us
by the hand, as on a journey, whenever anything tortuous and unsound and delusive came
in our way. And he helped us like a skilled expert who has had long familiarity with such
subjects, and is not strange or inexperienced in anything of the kind, and who therefore
may remain safe in his own altitude, while he stretches forth his hand to others, and effects
their security too, as one drawing up the submerged. Thus did he deal with us, selecting and
setting before us all that was useful and true in all the various philosophers, and putting
aside all that was false. And this he did for us, both in other branches of man’s knowledge,
and most especially in all that concerns piety.</p>

<head>Argument XV.—The Case of Divine Matters. Only God and His Prophets are to Be
Heard in These. The Prophets and Their Auditors are Acted on by the Same
Afflatus. Origen’s Excellence in the Interpretation of Scripture.</head>
<p>With respect to these human teachers, indeed, he counselled us to attach ourselves to
none of them, not even though they were attested as most wise by all men, but to devote
ourselves to God alone, and to the prophets. And he himself became the interpreter of the
prophets247 to us, and explained whatsoever was dark or enigmatical in them. For there are
many things of that kind in the sacred words; and whether it be that God is pleased to hold
communication with men in such a way as that the divine word may not enter all naked
and uncovered into an unworthy soul, such as many are, or whether it be, that while every
divine oracle is in its own nature most clear and perspicuous, it seems obscure and dark to
us, who have apostatized from God, and have lost the faculty of hearing through time and
age, I cannot tell. But however the case may stand, if it be that there are some words really
enigmatical, he explained all such, and set them in the light, as being himself a skilled and
most discerning hearer of God; or if it be that none of them are really obscure in their own
nature, they were also not unintelligible to him, who alone of all men of the present time
with whom I have myself been acquainted, or of whom I have heard by the report of others,
has so deeply studied the clear and luminous oracles of God, as to be able at once to receive
their meaning into his own mind, and to convey it to others. For that Leader of all men,
who inspires248 God’s dear prophets, and suggests all their prophecies and their mystic and
heavenly words, has honoured this man as He would a friend, and has constituted him an
expositor of these same oracles; and things of which He only gave a hint by others, He made
matters of full instruction by this man’s instrumentality; and in things which He, who is
worthy of all trust, either enjoined in regal fashion, or simply enunciated, He imparted to
this man the gift of investigating and unfolding and explaining them: so that, if there chanced
to be any one of obtuse and incredulous mind, or one again thirsting for instruction, he
might learn from this man, and in some manner be constrained to understand and to decide
for belief, and to follow God. These things, moreover, as I judge, he gives forth only and
truly by participation in the Divine Spirit: for there is need of the same power for those who
prophesy and for those who hear the prophets; and no one can rightly hear a prophet, unless
the same Spirit who prophesies bestows on him the capacity of apprehending His words.
And this principle is expressed indeed in the Holy Scriptures themselves, when it is said
that only He who shutteth openeth, and no other one whatever;249 and what is shut is opened

<pb n="86"/>
when the word of inspiration explains mysteries. Now that greatest gift this man has received
from God, and that noblest of all endowments he has had bestowed upon him from heaven,
that he should be an interpreter of the oracles of God to men,250 and that he might understand
the words of God, even as if God spake them to him, and that he might recount them
to men in such wise as that they may hear them with intelligence.251 Therefore to us there
was no forbidden subject of speech;252 for there was no matter of knowledge hidden or inaccessible
to us, but we had it in our power to learn every kind of discourse, both foreign253
and Greek, both spiritual and political, both divine and human; and we were permitted with
all freedom to go round the whole circle of knowledge, and investigate it, and satisfy ourselves
with all kinds of doctrines, and enjoy the sweets of intellect. And whether it was some ancient
system of truth, or whether it was something one might otherwise name that was before us,
we had in him an apparatus and a power at once admirable and full of the most beautiful
views. And to speak in brief, he was truly a paradise to us after the similitude of the paradise
of God, wherein we were not set indeed to till the soil beneath us, or to make ourselves gross
with bodily nurture,254 but only to increase the acquisitions of mind with all gladness and
enjoyment,—planting, so to speak, some fair growths ourselves, or having them planted in
us by the Author of all things.</p>

<head>Argument XVI.—Gregory Laments His Departure Under a Threefold Comparison;
Likening It to Adam’s Departure Out of Paradise. To the Prodigal Son’s Abandonment
of His Father’s House, and to the Deportation of the Jews into Babylon.</head>
<p>Here, truly, is the paradise of comfort; here are true gladness and pleasure, as we have
enjoyed them during this period which is now at its end—no short space indeed in itself,
and yet all too short if this is really to be its conclusion, when we depart and leave this place
behind us. For I know not what has possessed me, or what offence has been committed by
me, that I should now be going away—that I should now be put away. I know not what I
should say, unless it be that I am like a second Adam and have begun to talk, outside of
paradise. How excellent might my life be, were I but a listener to the addresses of my
teacher, and silent myself! Would that even now I could have learned to be mute and
speechless, rather than to present this new spectacle of making the teacher the hearer! For
what concern had I with such a harangue as this? and what obligation was there upon me
to make such an address, when it became me not to depart, but to cleave fast to the place?
But these things seem like the transgressions that sprung from the pristine deceit, and the
penalties of these primeval offences still await me here. Do I not appear to myself to be disobedient255
in daring thus to overpass the words of God, when I ought to abide in them,
and hold by them? And in that I withdraw, I flee from this blessed life, even as the primeval
man fled from the face of God, and I return to the soil from which I was taken. Therefore
shall I have to eat of the soil all the days of my life there, and I shall have to till the soil—the
very soil which produces thorns and thistles for me, that is to say, pains and reproachful
anxieties—set loose as I shall be from cares that are good and noble. And what I left behind
me before, to that I now return—to the soil, as it were, from which I came, and to my common
relationships here below, and to my father’s house—leaving the good soil, where of
old I knew not that the good fatherland lay; leaving also the relations in whom at a later
period I began to recognise the true kinsmen of my soul, and the house, too, of him who is
in truth our father, in which the father abides, and is piously honoured and revered by the
genuine sons, whose desire it also is to abide therein. But I, destitute alike of all piety and
worthiness, am going forth from the number of these, and am turning back to what is behind,
and am retracing my steps. It is recorded that a certain son, receiving from his father the
portion of goods that fell to him proportionately with the other heir, his brother, departed,
by his own determination, into a strange country far distant from his father; and, living
there in riot, he scattered his ancestral substance, and utterly wasted it; and at last, under
the pressure of want, he hired himself as a swine-herd; and being driven to extremity by
hunger, he longed to share the food given to the swine, but could not touch it. Thus did he
pay the penalty of his dissolute life, when he had to exchange his father’s table, which was
<note type="footnote">255 ἀπειθεῖν. Bengel and Hoeschelius read ἀπελθεῖν, withdraw.</note>

<pb n="88"/>
a princely one, for something he had not looked forward to—the sustenance of swine and
serfs. And we also seem to have some such fortune before us, now that we are departing,
and that, too, without the full portion that falls to us. For though we have not received all
that we ought, we are nevertheless going away, leaving behind us what is noble and dear
with you and beside you, and taking in exchange only what is inferior. For all things melancholy
will now meet us in succession,—tumult and confusion instead of peace, and an unregulated
life instead of one of tranquillity and harmony, and a hard bondage, and the slavery
of market-places, and lawsuits, and crowds, instead of this freedom; and neither pleasure
nor any sort of leisure shall remain to us for the pursuit of nobler objects. Neither shall we
have to speak of the words of inspiration, but we shall have to speak of the works of men,—a
thing which has been deemed simply a bane by the prophet,256—and in our case, indeed,
those of wicked men. And truly we shall have night in place of day, and darkness in place
of the clear light, and grief instead of the festive assembly; and in place of a fatherland, a
hostile country will receive us, in which I shall have no liberty to sing my sacred song,257
for how could I sing it in a land strange to my soul, in which the sojourners have no permission
to approach God? but only to weep and mourn, as I call to mind the different state of
things here, if indeed even that shall be in my power. We read258 that enemies once assailed
a great and sacred city, in which the worship of God was observed, and dragged away its
inhabitants, both singers and prophets,259 into their own country, which was Babylon. And
it is narrated that these captives, when they were detained in the land, refused, even when
asked by their conquerors, to sing the divine song, or to play in a profane country, and hung
their harps on the willow-trees, and wept by the rivers of Babylon. Like one of these I verily
seem to myself to be, as I am cast forth from this city, and from this sacred fatherland of
mine, where both by day and by night the holy laws are declared, and hymns and songs and
spiritual words are heard; where also there is perpetual sunlight; where by day in waking

with what the soul has seen and handled in the day; and where, in short, the inspiration
of divine things prevails over all continually. From this city, I say, I am cast forth, and
borne captive to a strange land, where I shall have no power to pipe:262 for, like these men
of old, I shall have to hang my instrument on the willows, and the rivers shall be my place
of sojourn, and I shall have to work in mud, and shall have no heart to sing hymns, even
though I remember them; yea, it may be that, through constant occupation with other subjects,
I shall forget even them, like one spoiled of memory itself. And would that, in going
away, I only went away against my will, as a captive is wont to do; but I go away also of my
own will, and not by constraint of another; and by my own act I am dispossessed of this
city, when it is in my option to remain in it. Perchance, too, in leaving this place, I may be
going to prosecute no safe journey, as it sometimes fares with one who quits some safe and
peaceful city; and it is indeed but too likely that, in journeying, I may fall into the hands of
robbers, and be taken prisoner, and be stripped and wounded with many strokes, and be
cast forth to lie half-dead somewhere.</p>

possession, and all that we have received from thee,—those noble deposits of instruction,
with which we take our course; and though we weep, indeed, as those who go forth from
home, we yet carry those seeds with us. It may be, then, that the Keeper who presides over
us will bear us in safety through all that shall befall as; and it may be that we shall come yet
again to thee, bringing with us the fruits and handfuls yielded by these seeds, far from perfect
truly, for how could they be so? but still such as a life spent in civil business263 makes it
possible for us to rear, though marred indeed by a kind of faculty that is either unapt to bear

<head>Elucidations.</head>
<p>Neale, in his valuable work,268 does full justice to Dionysius, whose life is twinned with
Gregory’s; but he seems to me most unaccountably to slight the truly great and commanding
genius of Gregory. I take opportunity, then, to direct attention to Neale’s candid, and, on
the whole, favourable view of Origen; but it grieves me whenever I see in critics a manifest
inability to put themselves back into the times of which they write, as I think is the case, not
infrequently, even with Dr. Neale. The figure of this grand ornament of the mighty patriarchate
and school of Alexandria is colossal.269 His genius is Titanic, and has left all
Christendom profoundly his debtor to this day, by the variety of his work and the versatility
of his speech and pen. Doubtless the youthful Gregory’s panegyric does contain, as he
himself suggests, much that is “puerile or bordering on flattery;” but, as he protests with
transparent truthfulness, “there is nothing in it unreal.” It shines with “sincerity of thought
and integrity of judgment.” And as such, what a portrait it presents us of the love and patient
effort of this lifelong confessor! Let me commend this example to professors of theology
generally. All can learn from it the power of sweetness and love, united with holiness of
purpose, to stamp the minds and the characters of youth with the divine “image and superscription.”</p>
<p>But, as to the sharpness of modern censures upon Origen’s conspicuous faults, I must
suggest three important considerations, which should be applied to all the Ante-Nicene
doctors: (1) How could they who were working out the formulas of orthodoxy, be expected
to use phrases with the skill and precision which became necessary only after the great
Synodical period had embodied them in clear, dogmatic statements? (2) How could the
active intellect of an Origen have failed to make great mistakes in such an immensity of labours
and such a variety of works? (3) If, in our own day, we indulge speculative minds in
large liberties so long as they never make shipwreck of the faith, how much more should
we deem them excusable who were unable to consult libraries of well-digested thought, and
to employ, as we do, the accumulated wealth of fifty generations of believers, whenever we
are called to the solemn responsibility of impressing our convictions upon others? The
conclusion of Dr. Neale’s review of Origen balances the praise and blame accorded to him
by those nearest to his times;270 but let us reflect upon the painful conflicts of those times,
and upon the pressure under which, to justify their own positions, they were often forced
to object to any error glorified by even the apparent patronage of Origen.</p>

<p>Most hostile and alien to the Apostolic Confession are those who speak of the Son as

those who hold the same sentiments with respect to the Holy Spirit; those who say that the
Son is constituted divine by gift and grace, and that the Holy Spirit is made holy; those who
regard the name of the Son as one common to servants, and assert that thus He is the firstborn
of the creature, as becoming, like the creature, existent out of non-existence, and as
being first made, and who refuse to admit that He is the only-begotten Son,—the only One
that the Father has, and that He has given Himself to be reckoned in the number of mortals,
and is thus reckoned first-born; those who circumscribe the generation of the Son by the
Father with a measured interval after the fashion of man, and refuse to acknowledge that
the æon of the Begetter and that of the Begotten are without beginning; those who introduce
three separate and diverse systems of divine worship,273 whereas there is but one form of
legitimate service which we have received of old from the law and the prophets, and which
has been confirmed by the Lord and preached by the apostles. Nor less alienated from the
true confession are those who hold not the doctrine of the Trinity according to truth, as a
relation consisting of three persons, but impiously conceive it as implying a triple being in

Confession of Faith, and one widely different from the former, which this great Gregory of ours received by
revelation. This seems, however, to be designated an ἔκθεσις τῆς κατὰ μέρος πίστεως, either because it records
and expounds the matters of the faith only in part, or because the Creed is explained in it by parts. The Jesuit
theologian Franc. Torrensis (the interpreter and scholiast of this ἔκθεσις) has, however, rendered the phrase ἡ
κατὰ μέρος πίστις, by the Latin fides non universa sed in parte. And here we have a fides non universa sed in
parte, according to him,—a creed not of all the dogmas of the Church, but only of some in opposition to the
heretics who deny them. [The better view.]</note>

<p>But the Church’s Confession, and the Creed that brings salvation to the world, is that
which deals with the incarnation of the Word, and bears that He gave Himself over to the
flesh of man which He acquired of Mary, while yet He conserved His own identity, and
sustained no divine transposition or mutation, but was brought into conjunction with the
flesh after the similitude of man; so that the flesh was made one with the divinity, the divinity
having assumed the capacity of receiving the flesh in the fulfilling of the mystery. And after
the dissolution of death there remained to the holy flesh a perpetual impassibility and a
changeless immortality, man’s original glory being taken up into it again by the power of
the divinity, and being ministered then to all men by the appropriation of faith.275</p>

<p>If, then, there are any here, too, who falsify the holy faith, either by attributing to the
divinity as its own what belongs to the humanity—progressions,276 and passions, and a
glory coming with accession277—or by separating from the divinity the progressive and
passible body, as if subsisted of itself apart,—these persons also are outside the confession
of the Church and of salvation. No one, therefore, can know God unless he apprehends the
Son; for the Son is the wisdom by whose instrumentality all things have been created; and
these created objects declare this wisdom, and God is recognised in the wisdom. But the
wisdom of God is not anything similar to the wisdom which man possesses, but it is the
perfect wisdom which proceeds from the perfect God, and abides for ever, not like the
thought of man, which passes from him in the word that is spoken and (straightway) ceases
to be. Wherefore it is not wisdom only, but also God; nor is it Word only, but also Son. And
whether, then, one discerns God through creation, or is taught to know Him by the Holy
Scriptures, it is impossible either to apprehend Him or to learn of Him apart from His wisdom.
And he who calls upon God rightly, calls on Him through the Son; and he who approaches
Him in a true fellowship, comes to Him through Christ. Moreover, the Son Himself
cannot be approached apart from the Spirit. For the Spirit is both the life and the holy
formation of all things;278 and God sending forth this Spirit through the Son makes the
creature279 like Himself.</p>

<p>One therefore is God the Father, one the Word, one the Spirit, the life, the sanctification
of all. And neither is there another God as Father,280 nor is there another Son as Word of
God, nor is there another Spirit as quickening and sanctifying. Further, although the saints
are called both gods, and sons, and spirits, they are neither filled with the Spirit, nor are
made like the Son and God. And if, then, any one makes this affirmation, that the Son is
God, simply as being Himself filled with divinity, and not as being generated of divinity, he
has belied the Word, he has belied the Wisdom, he has lost the knowledge of God; he has
fallen away into the worship of the creature, he has taken up the impiety of the Greeks, to
that he has gone back; and he has become a follower of the unbelief of the Jews, who, supposing
the Word of God to be but a human son, have refused to accept Him as God, and
have declined to acknowledge Him as the Son of God. But it is impious to think of the Word
of God as merely human, and to think of the works which are done by Him as abiding, while
He abides not Himself. And if any one says that the Christ works all things only as commanded
by the Word, he will both make the Word of God idle,281 and will change the Lord’s
order into servitude. For the slave is one altogether under command, and the created is not
competent to create; for to suppose that what is itself created may in like manner create
other things, would imply that it has ceased to be like the creature.282</p>

<p>Again, when one speaks of the Holy Spirit as an object made holy,283 he will no longer
be able to apprehend all things as being sanctified in (the) Spirit. For he who has sanctified
one, sanctifies all things. That man, consequently, belies the fountain of sanctification, the
Holy Spirit, who denudes Him of the power of sanctifying, and he will thus be precluded
from numbering Him with the Father and the Son; he makes nought, too, of the holy (ordinance
of) baptism, and will no more be able to acknowledge the holy and august Trinity.284
For either we must apprehend the perfect Trinity285 in its natural and genuine glory, or we
shall be under the necessity of speaking no more of a Trinity, but only of a Unity;286 or else,
not numbering287 created objects with the Creator, nor the creatures with the Lord of all,
we must also not number what is sanctified with what sanctifies; even as no object that is
made can be numbered with the Trinity, but in the name of the Holy Trinity baptism and
invocation and worship are administered. For if there are three several glories, there must
also be three several forms of cultus with those who impiously worship the creature; for if
there is a distinction in the nature of the objects worshipped, there ought to be also with
these men a distinction in the nature of the worship offered. What is recent288 surely is not
to be worshipped along with what is eternal; for the recent comprehends all that has had a
beginning, while mighty and measureless is He who is before the ages. He, therefore, who
supposes some beginning of times in the life of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, therewith
also cuts off any possibility of numbering the Son and the Spirit with the Father. For as we
acknowledge the glory to be one, so ought we also to acknowledge the substance in the
Godhead to be one, and one also the eternity of the Trinity.</p>

<p>Moreover, the capital element of our salvation is the incarnation of the Word. We believe,
therefore, that it was without any change in the Divinity that the incarnation of the Word
took place with a view to the renewal of humanity. For there took place neither mutation
nor transposition, nor any circumscription in will,289 as regards the holy energy290 of God;
but while that remained in itself the same, it also effected the work of the incarnation with
a view to the salvation of the world: and the Word of God, living291 on earth after man’s
fashion, maintained likewise in all the divine presence, fulfilling all things, and being united292
properly and individually with flesh; and while the sensibilities proper to the flesh were
there, the divine energy maintained the impassibility proper to itself. Impious, therefore, is
the man who introduces the passibility293 into the energy. For the Lord of glory appeared
in fashion as a man when He undertook the economy294 upon the earth; and He fulfilled
the law for men by His deeds, and by His sufferings He did away with man’s sufferings, and
by His death He abolished death, and by his resurrection He brought life to light; and now
we look for His appearing from heaven in glory for the life and judgment of all, when the
resurrection of the dead shall take place, to the end that recompense may be made to all
according to their desert.</p>

<p>But some treat the Holy Trinity295 in an awful manner, when they confidently assert
that there are not three persons, and introduce (the idea of) a person devoid of subsistence.296
Wherefore we clear ourselves of Sabellius, who says that the Father and the Son are the
same. For he holds that the Father is He who speaks, and that the Son is the Word that
abides in the Father, and becomes manifest at the time of the creation,297 and thereafter
reverts to God on the fulfilling of all things. The same affirmation he makes also of the
Spirit. We forswear this, because we believe that three persons—namely, Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit—are declared to possess the one Godhead: for the one divinity showing itself
forth according to nature in the Trinity298 establishes the oneness of the nature; and thus
there is a (divinity that is the) property of the Father, according to the word, “There is one
God the Father;”299 and there is a divinity hereditary300 in the Son, as it is written, “The
Word was God;”301 and there is a divinity present according to nature in the Spirit—to wit,
what subsists as the Spirit of God—according to Paul’s statement, “Ye are the temple of
God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.”302</p>

<p>Now the person in each declares the independent being and subsistence.303 But divinity
is the property of the Father; and whenever the divinity of these three is spoken of as one,
testimony is borne that the property304 of the Father belongs also to the Son and the Spirit:
wherefore, if the divinity may be spoken of as one in three persons, the trinity is established,
and the unity is not dissevered; and the oneness which is naturally the Father’s is also acknowledged
to be the Son’s and the Spirit’s. If one, however, speaks of one person as he may
speak of one divinity, it cannot be that the two in the one are as one.305 For Paul addresses
the Father as one in respect of divinity, and speaks of the Son as one in respect of lordship:
“There is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him.”306 Wherefore if there is one God, and one
Lord, and at the same time one person as one divinity in one lordship,307 how can credit
be given to (this distinction in) the words “of whom” and “by whom,” as has been said before?
We speak, accordingly, not as if we separated the lordship from the divinity, nor as estranging
the one from the other, but as unifying them in the way warranted by actual fact and truth;
and we call the Son God with the property of the Father,308 as being His image and offspring;
and we call the Father Lord, addressing Him by the name of the One Lord, as being His
Origin and Begettor.</p>

<p>The same position we hold respecting the Spirit, who has that unity with the Son which
the Son has with the Father. Wherefore let the hypostasis of the Father be discriminated by
the appellation of God; but let not the Son be cut off from this appellation, for He is of God.
Again, let the person of the Son also be discriminated by the appellation of Lord; only let
not God be dissociated from that, for He is Lord as being the Father of the Lord. And as it
is proper to the Son to exercise lordship, for He it is that made (all things) by Himself, and
now rules the things that were made, while at the same time the Father has a prior possession
of that property, inasmuch as He is the Father of Him who is Lord; so we speak of the
Trinity as One God, and yet not as if we made the one by a synthesis of three: for the subsistence
that is constituted by synthesis is something altogether partitive and imperfect.309
But just as the designation Father is the expression of originality and generation, so the
designation Son is the expression of the image and offspring of the Father. Hence, if one
were to ask how there is but One God, if there is also a God of God, we would reply that
that is a term proper to the idea of original causation,310 so far as the Father is the one First
Cause.311 And if one were also to put the question, how there is but One Lord, if the Father
also is Lord, we might answer that again by saying that He is so in so far as He is the Father
of the Lord; and this difficulty shall meet us no longer.</p>

<p>And again, if the impious say, How will there not be three Gods and three Persons, on
the supposition that they have one and the same divinity?—we shall reply: Just because God
is the Cause and Father of the Son; and this Son is the image and offspring of the Father,
and not His brother; and the Spirit in like manner is the Spirit of God, as it is written, “God
is a Spirit.”312 And in earlier times we have this declaration from the prophet David: “By
the word of the Lord were the heavens stablished, and all the power of them by the breath
(spirit) of His mouth.”313 And in the beginning of the book of the creation314 it is written
thus: “And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”315 And Paul in his Epistle
to the Romans says: “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of
God dwell in you.”316 And again he says: “But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from
the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.”317 And again: “As many as are led by the Spirit
of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”318 And
again: “I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy
Ghost.”319 And again: “Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that ye may abound in hope, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”320</p>

<p>And again, writing to those same Romans, he says: “But I have written the more boldly
unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of
God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of
God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
Ghost. I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which
pertain to God. For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought
by me,321 to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and
wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit.”322 And again: “Now I beseech you, brethren, for

again he says: “As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into

hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep

<p>Seest thou that all through Scripture the Spirit is preached, and yet nowhere named a
creature? And what can the impious have to say if the Lord sends forth His disciples to
baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit?328 Without contradiction,
that implies a communion and unity between them, according to which there
are neither three divinities nor (three) lordships; but, while there remain truly and certainly
the three persons, the real unity of the three must be acknowledged. And in this way proper
credit will be given to the sending and the being sent329 (in the Godhead), according to which
the Father hath sent forth the Son, and the Son in like manner sends forth the Spirit. For
one of the persons surely could not (be said to) send Himself; and one could not speak of
the Father as incarnate. For the articles of our faith will not concur with the vicious tenets
of the heresies; and it is right that our conceptions should follow the inspired and apostolic

<p>But if they say, How can there be three Persons, and how but one Divinity?—we shall
make this reply: That there are indeed three persons, inasmuch as there is one person of
God the Father, and one of the Lord the Son, and one of the Holy Spirit; and yet that there
is but one divinity, inasmuch as the Son is the Image of God the Father, who is One,—that
is, He is God of God; and in like manner the Spirit is called the Spirit of God, and that, too,
of nature according to the very substance,330 and not according to simple participation of
God. And there is one substance331 in the Trinity, which does not subsist also in the case
of objects that are made; for there is not one substance in God and in the things that are
made, because none of these is in substance God. Nor, indeed, is the Lord one of these according
to substance, but there is one Lord the Son, and one Holy Spirit; and we speak also
of one Divinity, and one Lordship, and one Sanctity in the Trinity; because the Father is the
Cause332 of the Lord, having begotten Him eternally, and the Lord is the Prototype333 of
the Spirit. For thus the Father is Lord, and the Son also is God; and of God it is said that
“God is a Spirit.”334</p>

substance with the Father;335 and one Holy Spirit, who by nature and in truth sanctifies all,
and makes divine, as being of the substance of God.336 Those who speak either of the Son
or of the Holy Spirit as a creature we anathematize. All other things we hold to be objects
made, and in subjection,337 created by God through the Son, (and) sanctified in the Holy
Spirit. Further, we acknowledge that the Son of God was made a Son of man, having taken
to Himself the flesh from the Virgin Mary, not in name, but in reality; and that He is both
the perfect Son of God, and the (perfect) Son of man,—that the Person is but one, and that
there is one worship338 for the Word and the flesh that He assumed. And we anathematize
those who constitute different worships, one for the divine and another for the human, and
who worship the man born of Mary as though He were another than the God of God. For
we know that “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God.”339 And we worship Him who was made man on account of our salvation, not
indeed as made perfectly like in the like body,340 but as the Lord who has taken to Himself
the form of the servant. We acknowledge the passion of the Lord in the flesh, the resurrection
in the power of His divinity, the ascension to heaven, and His glorious appearing when He
comes for the judgment of the living and the dead, and for the eternal life of the saints.</p>

<p>And since some have given us trouble by attempting to subvert our faith in our Lord
Jesus Christ, and by affirming of Him that He was not God incarnated, but a man linked
with God; for this reason we present our confession on the subject of the aforementioned
matters of faith, and reject the faithless dogmas opposed thereto. For God, having been incarnated
in the flesh of man, retains also His proper energy pure, possessing a mind unsubjected
by the natural341 and fleshly affections, and holding the flesh and the fleshly motions
divinely and sinlessly, and not only unmastered by the power of death, but even destroying
death. And it is the true God unincarnate that has appeared incarnate, the perfect One with
the genuine and divine perfection; and in Him there are not two persons. Nor do we affirm
that there are four to worship, viz., God and the Son of God, and man and the Holy Spirit.
Wherefore we also anathematize those who show their impiety in this, and who thus give
the man a place in the divine doxology. For we hold that the Word of God was made man
on account of our salvation, in order that we might receive the likeness of the heavenly, and
be made divine342 after the likeness of Him who is the true Son of God by nature, and the
Son of man according to the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that the Son and the Spirit are consubstantial with the Father, and
that the substance of the Trinity is one,—that is, that there is one divinity according to
nature, the Father remaining unbegotten, and the Son being begotten of the Father in a true
generation, and not in a formation by will,344 and the Spirit being sent forth eternally from
the substance of the Father through the Son, with power to sanctify the whole creation. And
we further acknowledge that the Word was made flesh, and was manifested in the fleshmovement345
received of a virgin, and did not simply energize in a man. And those who
have fellowship with men that reject the consubstantiality as a doctrine foreign to the
Scriptures, and speak of any of the persons in the Trinity as created, and separate that person
from the one natural divinity, we hold as aliens, and have fellowship with none such.346
There is one God the Father, and there is only one divinity. But the Son also is God, as being
the true image of the one and only divinity, according to generation and the nature which
He has from the Father. There is one Lord the Son; but in like manner there is the Spirit,
who bears over347 the Son’s lordship to the creature that is sanctified. The Son sojourned
in the world, having of the Virgin received flesh, which He filled with the Holy Spirit for
the sanctification of us all; and having given up the flesh to death, He destroyed death
through the resurrection that had in view the resurrection of us all; and He ascended to
heaven, exalting and glorifying men in Himself; and He comes the second time to bring us
again eternal life.</p>

<p>One is the Son, both before the incarnation and after the incarnation. The same (Son)
is both man and God, both these together as though one; and the God the Word is not one
person, and the man Jesus another person, but the same who subsisted as Son before was
made one with flesh by Mary, so constituting Himself a perfect, and holy, and sinless man,
and using that economical position for the renewal of mankind and the salvation of all the
world. God the Father, being Himself the perfect Person, has thus the perfect Word begotten
of Him truly, not as a word that is spoken, nor yet again as a son by adoption, in the sense
in which angels and men are called sons of God, but as a Son who is in nature God. And
there is also the perfect Holy Spirit supplied348 of God through the Son to the sons of adoption,
living and life-giving, holy and imparting holiness to those who partake of Him,—not
like an unsubstantial breath349 breathed into them by man, but as the living Breath proceeding
from God. Wherefore the Trinity is to be adored, to be glorified, to be honoured, and
to be reverenced; the Father being apprehended in the Son even as the Son is of Him, and
the Son being glorified in the Father, inasmuch as He is of the Father, and being manifested
in the Holy Spirit to the sanctified.</p>

<p>And that the holy Trinity is to be worshipped without either separation or alienation,
is taught us by Paul, who says in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians: “The grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you
all.”350 And again, in that epistle he makes this explanation: “Now He which stablisheth us
with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God, who hath also sealed us, and given the
earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.”351 And still more clearly he writes thus in the same
epistle: “When Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to
the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of
the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord.”352</p>

<p>And again Paul says: “That mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now He that hath
wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the
Spirit.”353 And again he says: “Approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,
in afflictions, in necessities,”354 and so forth. Then he adds these words: “By kindness, by
the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God.”355 Behold
here again the saint has defined the holy Trinity, naming God, and the Word, and the Holy
Ghost. And again he says: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.”356
And again: “But ye are washed, but ye are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus, and by
the Spirit of our God.”357 And again: “What! know ye not that your bodies are the temple
of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God?”358 “And I think also that I have
the Spirit of God.”359</p>

<p>And again, speaking also of the children of Israel as baptized in the cloud and in the
sea, he says: “And they all drank of the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual
Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.”360 And again he says: “Wherefore I
give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed:
and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities
of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same
Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in
all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is
given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits;
to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these
worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. For as
the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being
many, are one body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body.”361
And again he says: “For if he who comes preaches another Christ whom we have not
preached, or ye receive another spirit that ye have received not, or another gospel which ye
have not obtained, ye will rightly be kept back.”362</p>

<p>Seest thou that the Spirit is inseparable from the divinity? And no one with pious apprehensions
could fancy that He is a creature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Hebrews he writes
again thus: “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began
to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also
bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of
the Holy Ghost?”363 And again he says in the same epistle: “Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost
saith, Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the
day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always
err in their heart; for364 they have not known my ways: as I sware in my wrath, that they
should not enter into my rest.”365 And there, too, they ought to give ear to Paul, for he by
no means separates the Holy Spirit from the divinity of the Father and the Son, but clearly
sets forth the discourse of the Holy Ghost as one from the person of the Father, and thus as
given expression to366 by God, just as it has been represented in the before-mentioned sayings.
Wherefore the holy Trinity is believed to be one God, in accordance with these testimonies
of Holy Scripture; albeit all through the inspired Scriptures numberless announcements
are supplied us, all confirmatory of the apostolic and ecclesiastical faith.</p>

<p>A Fragment of the Same Declaration of Faith, Accompanied by Glosses.367—From
Gregory Thaumaturgus, as They Say, in His Sectional Confession of Faith.</p>
<p>To maintain two natures368 in the one Christ, makes a Tetrad of the Trinity, says he;
for he expressed himself thus: “And it is the true God, the unincarnate, that was manifested
in the flesh, perfect with the true and divine perfection, not with two natures; nor do we
speak of worshipping four (persons), viz., God, and the Son of God, and man, and the Holy
Spirit.” First, however, this passage is misapprehended, and is of very doubtful import.
Nevertheless it bears that we should not speak of two persons in Christ, lest, by thus acknowledging
Him as God, and as in the perfect divinity, and yet speaking of two persons, we
should make a Tetrad of the divine persons, counting that of God the Father as one, and
that of the Son of God as one, and that of the man as one, and that of the Holy Spirit as one.
But, again, it bears also against recognising two divine natures,369 and rather for acknowledging
Him to be perfect God in one natural divine perfection, and not in two; for his object
is to show that He became incarnate without change, and that He retains the divinity without
duplication.370 Accordingly he says shortly: “And while the affections of the flesh spring,
the energy371 retains the impassibility proper to it. He, therefore, who introduces the (idea
of) passion into the energy is impious; for it was the Lord of glory that appeared in human
form, having taken to Himself the human economy.”</p>

<p>(The minister…to the Gentiles, p. 43.)</p>
<p>If St. Peter had been at Rome, St. Paul would not have come there (2 Cor. x. 16). The
two apostles had each his jurisdiction, and they kept to their own “line of things” respectively.
How, then, came St. Peter to visit Rome? The answer is clear: unless he came involuntarily,
as a prisoner, he came to look after the Church of the Circumcision,372 which was “in his
measure;” and doubtless St. Paul urged him to this, the Hebrew Christians there being so
large a proportion of the Church. St. Peter came “at the close of his life,” doubtless attended
by an apostolic companion, as St. Paul was, and Barnabas also (Acts xv. 39, 40). Linus
probably laboured for St. Paul (in prison) among the Gentile Romans,373 and Cletus for St.
Peter among Jewish Christians. St. Peter survived all his martyred associates, and left Clement
in charge of the whole Church. This most probable theory squares with all known facts, and
reconciles all difficulties. Clement, then, was first bishop of Rome (a.d. 65); and so says
Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 258, note 9.</p>
<p>That compendious but superficial little work, Smith’s History of the First Ten Centuries,
374 justly censures as “misleading” the usage, which it yet keeps up, of calling the early
bishops of Rome “Popes.”375 The same author utterly misunderstands Cyprian’s references
to Rome as “a principal cathedra,” “a root and matrix,” etc.; importing into the indefinite
Latin a definite article. Cyprian applies a similar principle, after his master Tertullian (vol.
iii. p. 260, this series), to all the Apostolic Sees, the matrices of Christian churches.
372 Origin says so, expressly. See Cave, Lives, i. p. 230.</p>

<head>On the Trinity.</head>

<p>Fragment from the Discourse.376</p>
<p>Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neo-Cæsareia in Pontus,377 near successor of the
apostles, in his discourse on the Trinity, speaks thus:—</p>
<p>I see in all three essentials—substance, genus, name. We speak of man, servant, curator
(curatorem),—man, by reason of substance; servant, by reason of genus or condition; curator,
by reason of denomination. We speak also of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: these, however,
are not names which have only supervened at some after period, but they are subsistences.
Again, the denomination of man is not in actual fact a denomination, but a substance
common to men, and is the denomination proper to all men. Moreover, names are such as
these,—Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: these, I say, are names. But the Divine Persons are
names indeed: and the names are still the persons; and the persons then signify that which
is and subsists,—which is the essence of God. The name also of the nature signifies subsistence;
378 as if we should speak of the man. All (the persons) are one nature, one essence, one
will, and are called the Holy Trinity; and these also are names subsistent, one nature in three
persons, and one genus. But the person of the Son is composite in its oneness (unita est),
being one made up of two, that is, of divinity and humanity together, which two constitute
one. Yet the divinity does not consequently receive any increment, but the Trinity remains
as it was. Nor does anything new befall the persons even or the names, but these are eternal
and without time. No one, however, was sufficient to know these until the Son being made
flesh manifested them, saying: “Father, I have manifested Thy name to men; glorify Thou
me also, that they may know me as Thy Son.”379 And on the mount the Father spake, and
said, “This is my beloved Son.”380 And the same sent His Holy Spirit at the Jordan. And
thus it was declared to us that there is an Eternal Trinity in equal honour. Besides, the generation
of the Son by the Father is incomprehensible and ineffable; and because it is spiritual,
its investigation becomes impracticable: for a spiritual object can neither be understood nor
traced by a corporeal object, for that is far removed from human nature. We men know indeed
the generation proper to us, as also that of other objects; but a spiritual matter is above
human condition, neither can it in any manner be understood by the minds of men. Spir-

itual substance can neither perish nor be dissolved; ours, however, as is easy to understand,
perishes and is dissolved. How, indeed, could it be possible for man, who is limited on six
sides—by east, west, south, north, deep, and sky—understand a matter which is above the
skies, which is beneath the deeps, which stretches beyond the north and south, and which
is present in every place, and fills all vacuity? But if, indeed, we are able to scrutinize spiritual
substance, its excellence truly would be undone. Let us consider what is done in our body;
and, furthermore, let us see whether it is in our power to ascertain in what manner thoughts
are born of the heart, and words of the tongue, and the like. Now, if we can by no means
apprehend things that are done in ourselves, how could it ever be that we should understand
the mystery of the uncreated Creator, which goes beyond every mind? Assuredly, if this
mystery were one that could be penetrated by man, the inspired John would by no means
have affirmed this: “No man hath seen God at any time.”381 He then, whom no man hath
seen at any time,—whom can we reckon Him to resemble, so that thereby we should understand
His generation? And we, indeed, without ambiguity apprehend that our soul dwells
in us in union with the body; but still, who has ever seen his own soul? who has been able
to discern its conjunction with his body? This one thing is all we know certainly, that there
is a soul within us conjoined with the body. Thus, then, we reason and believe that the Word
is begotten by the Father, albeit we neither possess nor know the clear rationale of the fact.
The Word Himself is before every creature—eternal from the Eternal, like spring from
spring, and light from light. The vocable Word, indeed, belongs to those three genera of
words which are named in Scripture, and which are not substantial,—namely, the word
conceived,382 the word uttered,383 and the word articulated.384 The word conceived, certainly,
is not substantial. The word uttered, again, is that voice which the prophets hear from God,
or the prophetic speech itself; and even this is not substantial. And, lastly, the word articulated
is the speech of man formed forth in air (aëre efformatus), composed of terms, which also
is not substantial.385 But the Word of God is substantial, endowed with an exalted and enduring
nature, and is eternal with Himself, and is inseparable from Him, and can never fall
away, but shall remain in an everlasting union. This Word created heaven and earth, and
in Him were all things made. He is the arm and the power of God, never to be separated
from the Father, in virtue of an indivisible nature, and, together with the Father, He is
without beginning. This Word took our substance of the Virgin Mary; and in so far as He
is spiritual indeed, He is indivisibly equal with the Father; but in so far as He is corporeal,

He is in like manner inseparably equal with us. And, again, in so far as He is spiritual, He
supplies in the same equality (æquiparat) the Holy Spirit, inseparably and without limit.
Neither were there two natures, but only one nature of the Holy Trinity before the incarnation
of the Word, the Son; and the nature of the Trinity remained one also after the incarnation
of the Son. But if any one, moreover, believes that any increment has been given to the
Trinity by reason of the assumption of humanity by the Word, he is an alien from us, and
from the ministry of the Catholic and Apostolic Church. This is the perfect, holy, Apostolic
faith of the holy God. Praise to the Holy Trinity for ever through the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Petavius, to whom the translator refers his readers, may be trusted in points where he
has no theory of his own to sustain, but must always be accepted with caution. The Greek
Fathers in this very series, from Justin386 onward, enable us to put the later terminology to
the test of earlier exposition (see examples in the notes to the Praxeas of Tertullian, and
consult Dr. Holmes’ valuable note embodied in my elucidations).387 We may go back to
Theophilus for the distinction between the ἐνδιάθετος and the προφορικός , the immanent
and the uttered Word.388 Compare Tertullian, also, against Marcion.389 Evidences, therefore,
are abundant and archaic, indeed, to prove that the Ante-Nicene Fathers, with those of the
Nicene and the Post-Nicene periods, were of one mind, and virtually of one voice.</p>

<p>How could the body be said to be uncreated? For the uncreated is the passionless, invulnerable,
intangible. But Christ, on rising from the dead, showed His disciples the print of
the nails and the wound made by the spear, and a body that could be handled, although He
also had entered among them when the doors were shut, with the view of showing them at
once the energy of the divinity and the reality of the body.</p>
<p>Yet, while being God, He was recognised as man in a natural manner; and while subsisting
truly as man, He was also manifested as God by His works.391</p>

<p>How could it be said that Christ (the Lord) assumed the perfect man just like one of the
prophets, when He, being the Lord Himself, became man by the incarnation effected through
the Virgin? Wherefore it is written, that “the first man was of the earth, earthy.”395 But
whereas he that was formed of the earth returned to the earth, He that became the second
man returned to heaven. And so we read of the “first Adam and the last Adam.”396 And as
it is admitted that the second came by the first according to the flesh, for which reason also
Christ is called man and the Son of man; so is the witness given that the second is the Savior
of the first, for whose sake He came down from heaven. And as the Word came down from
heaven, and was made man, and ascended again to heaven, He is on that account said to be
the second Adam from heaven.</p>

exhibited in Himself the exercise of the affections and susceptibilities proper to us, having
endued Himself with our passibility, even as it is written, that “He hath borne our griefs,
and carried our sorrows.”420 For perturbation, and grief, and distress, are disorders of soul;

<p>If any one says that Christ was manifested in the world only in semblance, and refuses

<p>Explication.</p>
<p>How could one say that Christ was manifested only in semblance in the world, born as
He was in Bethlehem, and made to submit to the circumcising of the flesh, and lifted up by
Simeon, and brought up on to His twelfth year (at home), and made subject to His parents,
and baptized in Jordan, and nailed to the cross, and raised again from the dead?</p>
<p>Wherefore, when it is said that He was “troubled in spirit,”421 that “He was sorrowful
in soul,”422 that “He was wounded in body,”423 He places before us designations of susceptibilities
proper to our constitution, in order to show that He was made man in the world,
and had His conversation with men,424 yet without sin. For He was born in Bethlehem according
to the flesh, in a manner meet for Deity, the angels of heaven recognising Him as
their Lord, and hymning as their God Him who was then wrapped in swaddling-clothes in
a manger, and exclaiming, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will
among men.”425 He was brought up in Nazareth; but in divine fashion He sat among the
doctors, and astonished them by a wisdom beyond His years, in respect of the capacities of
His bodily life, as is recorded in the Gospel narrative. He was baptized in Jordan, not as receiving
any sanctification for Himself, but as gifting a participation in sanctification to
others. He was tempted in the wilderness, not as giving way, however, to temptation, but
as putting our temptations before Himself on the challenge of the tempter, in order to show
the powerlessness of the tempter.</p>
<p>Wherefore He says, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”426 And this He said,
not as holding before us any contest proper only to a God, but as showing our own flesh in
its capacity to overcome suffering, and death, and corruption, in order that, as sin entered
into the world by flesh, and death came to reign by sin over all men, the sin in the flesh
might also be condemned through the selfsame flesh in the likeness thereof;427 and that

of the resurrection be shown, and the principle of righteousness begin its course in the world
through faith, and the kingdom of heaven be preached to men, and fellowship be established
between God and men.</p>
<p>In behalf of this grace let us glorify the Father, who has given His only begotten Son for
the life of the world. Let us glorify the Holy Spirit that worketh in us, and quickeneth us,
and furnisheth the gifts meet for the fellowship of God; and let us not intermeddle with the
word of the Gospel by lifeless disputations, scattering about endless questionings and logomachies,

us work the work of faith, let us love peace, let us exhibit concord, let us preserve unity, let
us cultivate love, with which God is well pleased.</p>

own power,428 but only to believe that there will come an end to time, and that there will
be a manifestation of a future world, and a revelation of judgment, and an advent of the Son
of God, and a recompense of works, and an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, so it is
not for us to know how the Son of God became man; for this is a great mystery, as it is
written, “Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth.”429 But it
is for us to believe that the Son of God became man, according to the Scriptures; and that
He was seen on the earth, and had His conversation with men, according to the Scriptures,
in their likeness, yet without sin; and that He died for us, and rose again from the dead, as
it is written; and that He was taken up to heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the
Father, whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead, as it is written; lest, while
we war against each other with words, any should be led to blaspheme the word of faith,

<p>These “twelve anathemas,” as they are called, do evidently refute the Nestorians and
later heretics. Evidently, therefore, we must assign this document to another author. And,
as frequent references are made to such tests, I subjoin a list of OEcumenical or Catholic
Councils, properly so called, as follows:—</p>
<p>1. Jerusalem, against Judaism,432 a.d. 50.</p>
<p>2. Nicæa, against Arianism (1),433 a.d. 325.</p>
<p>3. Constantinople (I.), against Semi-Arianism (2), a.d. 381.</p>
<p>4. Ephesus, against Nestorianism (3), a.d. 431.</p>
<p>5. Chalcedon, against Eutychianism (4), a.d. 451.</p>
<p>6. Constantinople (II.), against Monophysitism (5), a.d. 553.</p>
<p>7. Constantinople (III.), against Monothelitism (6),434 a.d. 680.435</p>
<p>These are all the undisputed councils. The Seventh Council, so called (a.d. 537), was not
a free council, and was rejected by a free council of the West, convened at Frankfort a.d.
794. Its acceptance by the Roman pontiffs, subsequently, should have no logical force with
the Easterns, who do not recognise their supremacy even over the councils of the West; and
no free council has ever been held under pontifical authority. The above list, therefore, is a
complete list of all the councils of the undivided Church as defined by Catholic canons.
There has been no possibility of a Catholic council since the division of East and West. The
Council of Frankfort is the pivot of subsequent history, and its fundamental importance
has not been sufficiently insisted upon.</p>

<head>On the Subject of the Soul.436</head>
<p>You have instructed us, most excellent Tatian,437 to forward for your use a discourse
upon the soul, laying it out in effective demonstrations. And this you have asked us to do
without making use of the testimonies of Scripture,—a method which is opened to us, and
which, to those who seek the pious mind, proves a manner of setting forth doctrine more
convincing than any reasoning of man.438 You have said, however, that you desire this, not
with a view to your own full assurance, taught as you already have been to hold by the Holy
Scriptures and traditions, and to avoid being shaken in your convictions by any subtleties
of man’s disputations, but with a view to the confuting of men who have different sentiments,
and who do not admit that such credit is to be given to the Scriptures, and who endeavour,
by a kind of cleverness of speech, to gain over those who are unversed in such discussions.
Wherefore we were led to comply readily with this commission of yours, not shrinking from
the task on account of inexperience in this method of disputation, but taking encouragement
from the knowledge of your good-will toward us. For your kind and friendly disposition
towards us will make you understand how to put forward publicly whatever you may approve
of as rightly expressed by us, and to pass by and conceal whatever statement of ours you
may judge to come short of what is proper. Knowing this, therefore, I have betaken myself
with all confidence to the exposition. And in my discourse I shall use a certain order and
consecution, such as those who are very expert in these matters employ towards those who
desire to investigate any subject intelligently.</p>
<p>First of all, then, I shall propose to inquire by what criterion the soul can, according to
its nature, be apprehended; then by what means it can be proved to exist; thereafter,
whether it is a substance or an accident;439 then consequently on these points, whether it is
a body or is incorporeal; then, whether it is simple or compound; next, whether it is mortal
or immortal; and finally, whether it is rational or irrational.</p>
<p>For these are the questions which are wont, above all, to be discussed, in any inquiry
about the soul, as most important, and as best calculated to mark out its distinctive nature.
And as demonstrations for the establishing of these matters of investigation, we shall employ
those common modes of consideration440 by which the credibility of matters under hand

<p>All things that exist are either known by sense442 or apprehended by thought.443 And
what falls under sense has its adequate demonstration in sense itself; for at once, with the
application, it creates in us the impression444 of what underlies it. But what is apprehended
by thought is known not by itself, but by its operations.445 The soul, consequently, being
unknown by itself, shall be known property by its effects.</p>

<head>II. Whether the Soul Exists.</head>
<p>Our body, when it is put in action, is put in action either from without or from within.
And that it is not put in action from without, is manifest from the circumstance that it is
put in action neither by impulsion446 nor by traction,447 like soulless things. And again, if
it is put in action from within, it is not put in action according to nature, like fire. For fire
never loses its action as long as there is fire; whereas the body, when it has become dead, is
a body void of action. Hence, if it is put in action neither from without, like soulless things,
nor according to nature, after the fashion of fire, it is evident that it is put in action by the
soul, which also furnishes life to it. If, then, the soul is shown to furnish the life to our body,
the soul will also be known for itself by its operations.</p>

<head>III. Whether the Soul is a Substance.</head>
<p>That the soul is a substance,448 is proved in the following manner. In the first place,
because the definition given to the term substance suits it very well. And that definition is
to the effect, that substance is that which, being ever identical, and ever one in point of numeration
with itself, is yet capable of taking on contraries in succession.449 And that this
soul, without passing the limit of its own proper nature, takes on contraries in succession,
is, I fancy, clear to everybody. For righteousness and unrighteousness, courage and cowardice,
temperance and intemperance, are seen in it successively; and these are contraries. If, then,
it is the property of a substance to be capable of taking on contraries in succession, and if
the soul is shown to sustain the definition in these terms, it follows that the soul is a substance.
And in the second place, because if the body is a substance, the soul must also be a substance.
For it cannot be, that what only has life imparted should be a substance, and that what imparts
the life should be no substance: unless one should assert that the non-existent is the cause
of the existent; or unless, again, one were insane enough to allege that the dependent object
is itself the cause of that very thing in which it has its being, and without which it could not
subsist.450</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="143"/>
<head>IV. Whether the Soul is Incorporeal.</head>
<p>That the soul is in our body, has been shown above. We ought now, therefore, to ascertain
in what manner it is in the body. Now, if it is in juxtaposition with it, as one pebble with
another, it follows that the soul will be a body, and also that the whole body will not be animated
with soul,451 inasmuch as with a certain part it will only be in juxtaposition. But if
again, it is mingled or fused with the body, the soul will become multiplex,452 and not simple,
and will thus be despoiled of the rationale proper to a soul. For what is multiplex is also divisible
and dissoluble; and what is dissoluble, on the other hand, is compound;453 and what
is compound is separable in a threefold manner. Moreover, body attached to body makes
weight;454 but the soul, subsisting in the body, does not make weight, but rather imparts
life. The soul, therefore, cannot be a body, but is incorporeal.</p>
<p>Again, if the soul is a body, it is put in action either from without or from within. But
it is not put in action from without; for it is moved neither by impulsion nor by traction,
like soulless things. Nor is it put in action from within, like objects animated with soul; for
it is absurd to talk of a soul of the soul: it cannot, therefore, be a body, but it is incorporeal.</p>
<p>And besides, if the soul is a body, it has sensible qualities, and is maintained by nurture.
But it is not thus nurtured. For if it is nurtured, it is not nurtured corporeally, like the body,
but incorporeally; for it is nurtured by reason. It has not, therefore, sensible qualities: for
neither is righteousness, nor courage, nor any one of these things, something that is seen;
yet these are the qualities of the soul. It cannot, therefore, be a body, but is incorporeal.</p>
<p>Still further, as all corporeal substance is divided into animate and inanimate, let those
who hold that the soul is a body tell us whether we are to call it animate or inanimate.</p>
<p>Finally, if every body has colour, and quantity, and figure, and if there is not one of
these qualities perceptible in the soul, it follows that the soul is not a body.455</p>

<pb n="144"/>
<p>V. Whether the Soul is Simple or Compound.</p>
<p>We prove, then, that the soul is simple, best of all, by those arguments by which its incorporeality
has been demonstrated. For if it is not a body, while every body is compound,
and what is composite is made up of parts, and is consequently multiplex, the soul, on the
other hand, being incorporeal, is simple; since thus it is both uncompounded and indivisible
into parts.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="145"/>
<head>VI. Whether Our Soul is Immortal.</head>
<p>It follows, in my opinion, as a necessary consequence, that what is simple is immortal.
And as to how that follows, hear my explanation: Nothing that exists is its own corrupter,456
else it could never have had any thorough consistency, even from the beginning. For things
that are subject to corruption are corrupted by contraries: wherefore everything that is
corrupted is subject to dissolution; and what is subject to dissolution is compound; and
what is compound is of many parts; and what is made up of parts manifestly is made up of
diverse parts; and the diverse is not the identical: consequently the soul, being simple, and
not being made up of diverse parts, but being uncompound and indissoluble, must be, in
virtue of that, incorruptible and immortal.</p>
<p>Besides, everything that is put in action by something else, and does not possess the
principle of life in itself, but gets it from that which puts it in action, endures just so long as
it is held by the power that operates in it; and whenever the operative power ceases, that
also comes to a stand which has its capacity of action from it. But the soul, being self-acting,
has no cessation of its being. For it follows, that what is self-acting is ever-acting; and what
is ever-acting is unceasing; and what is unceasing is without end; and what is without end
is incorruptible; and what is incorruptible is immortal. Consequently, if the soul is self-acting,
as has been shown above, it follows that it is incorruptible and immortal, in accordance with
the mode of reasoning already expressed.</p>
<p>And further, everything that is not corrupted by the evil proper to itself, is incorruptible;
and the evil is opposed to the good, and is consequently its corrupter. For the evil of the
body is nothing else than suffering, and disease, and death; just as, on the other hand, its
excellency is beauty, life, health, and vigour. If, therefore, the soul is not corrupted by the
evil proper to itself, and the evil of the soul is cowardice, intemperance, envy, and the like,
and all these things do not despoil it of its powers of life and action, it follows that it is immortal.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="146"/>
<head>VII. Whether Our Soul is Rational.</head>
<p>That our soul is rational, one might demonstrate by many arguments. And first of all
from the fact that it has discovered the arts that are for the service of our life. For no one
could say that these arts were introduced casually and accidentally, as no one could prove
them to be idle, and of no utility for our life. If, then, these arts contribute to what is profitable
for our life, and if the profitable is commendable, and if the commendable is constituted by
reason, and if these things are the discovery of the soul, it follows that our soul is rational.</p>
<p>Again, that our soul is rational, is also proved by the fact that our senses are not sufficient
for the apprehension of things. For we are not competent for the knowledge of things by
the simple application of the faculty of sensation. But as we do not choose to rest in these
without inquiry,457 that proves that the senses, apart from reason, are felt to be incapable
of discriminating between things which are identical in form and similar in colour, though
quite distinct in their natures. If, therefore, the senses, apart from reason, give us a false
conception of things, we have to consider whether things that are can be apprehended in
reality or not. And if they can be apprehended, then the power which enables us to get at
them is one different from, and superior to, the senses. And if they are not apprehended, it
will not be possible for us at all to apprehend things which are different in their appearance
from the reality. But that objects are apprehensible by us, is clear from the fact that we employ
each in a way adaptable to utility, and again turn them to what we please. Consequently, if
it has been shown that things which are can be apprehended by us, and if the senses, apart
from reason, are an erroneous test of objects, it follows that the intellect458 is what distinguishes
all things in reason, and discerns things as they are in their actuality. But the intellect
is just the rational portion of the soul, and consequently the soul is rational.</p>
<p>Finally, because we do nothing without having first marked it out for ourselves; and as
that is nothing else than just the high prerogative459 of the soul,—for its knowledge of things
does not come to it from without, but it rather sets out these things, as it were, with the adornment
of its own thoughts, and thus first pictures forth the object in itself, and only
thereafter carries it out to actual fact,—and because the high prerogative of the soul is
nothing else than the doing of all things with reason, in which respect it also differs from
the senses, the soul has thereby been demonstrated to be rational.</p>

<p>I.
(Substance or accident, p. 54.)</p>
<p>This essay is “rather the work of a philosopher than a bishop,” says Dupin. He assigns
it to an age when “Aristotle began to be in some reputation,”—a most important concession
as to the estimate of this philosopher among the early faithful. We need not wonder that
such admissions, honourable to his candour and to his orthodoxy, brought on him the
hatred and persecutions of the Jesuits. Even Bossuet thought he went too far, and wrote
against him. But, the whole system of Roman dogma being grounded in Aristotle’s physics
as well as in his metaphysics, Dupin was not orthodox in the eyes of the society that framed
Aristotle into a creed, and made it the creed of the “Roman-Catholic Church.” Note, e.g.,
“transubstantiation,” which is not true if Aristotle’s theory of accidents, etc., is false.460 It
assumes an exploded science.</p>

<p>If this “Discourse” be worthy of study, it may be profitably contrasted, step by step, with
Tertullian’s treatises on kindred subjects.461 That the early Christians should reason concerning
the Soul, the Mind, the immortal Spirit, was natural in itself. But it was also forced
upon them by the “philosophers” and the heretics, with whom they daily came into conflict.
This is apparent from the Anti-Marcion462 of the great Carthaginian. The annotations upon
that treatise, and those On the Soul’s Testimony and On the Soul, may suffice as pointing
out the best sources463 of information on speculative points and their bearings on theology.
Compare, however, Athenagoras464 and the great Clement of Alexandria.465</p>

<head>The First Homily.</head>
<p>On the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin Mary.467</p>
<p>To-day are strains of praise sung joyfully by the choir of angels, and the light of the advent
of Christ shines brightly upon the faithful. Today is the glad spring-time to us, and Christ
the Sun of righteousness has beamed with clear light around us, and has illumined the minds
of the faithful. To-day is Adam made anew,468 and moves in the choir of angels, having
winged his way to heaven. To-day is the whole circle of the earth filled with joy, since the
sojourn of the Holy Spirit has been realized to men. To-day the grace of God and the hope
of the unseen shine through all wonders transcending imagination, and make the mystery
that was kept hid from eternity plainly discernible to us. To-day are woven the chaplets of
never-fading virtue. To-day, God, willing to crown the sacred heads of those whose pleasure
is to hearken to Him, and who delight in His festivals, invites the lovers of unswerving faith
as His called and His heirs; and the heavenly kingdom is urgent to summon those who mind
celestial things to join the divine service of the incorporeal choirs. To-day is fulfilled the
word of David, “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. The fields shall be joyful,
and all the trees of the wood before the Lord, because He cometh.”469 David thus made
mention of the trees;470 and the Lord’s forerunner also spoke of them as trees471 “that should
<note type="footnote">466 [This very homily has been cited to prove the antiquity of the festival of the Annunciation, observed, in
the West, March 25. But even Pellicia objects that this is a spurious work. The feast of the Nativity was introduced
into the East by Chrysostom after the records at Rome had been inspected, and the time of the taxing at Bethlehem
had been found. See his Sermon (a.d. 386), beautifully translated by Dr. Jarvis in his Introduction, etc., p. 541.
Compare Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 164, and Justin, vol. i. p. 174, this series. Now, as the selection of the 25th of
March is clearly based on this, we may say no more of that day. Possibly some Sunday was associated with the
Annunciation. The four Sundays preceding Christmas are all observed by the Nestorians in commemoration
of the Annunciation.]</note>

bring forth fruits meet for repentance,”472 or rather for the coming of the Lord. But our
Lord Jesus Christ promises perpetual gladness to all those who believe on Him. For He says,
“I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.”473 To-day is the
illustrious and ineffable mystery of Christians, who have willingly474 set their hope like a
seal upon Christ, plainly declared to us. To-day did Gabriel, who stands by God, come to
the pure virgin, bearing to her the glad annunciation, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured!475
And she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. And the angel immediately
proceeded to say, The Lord is with thee: fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with
God. Behold,476 thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call477
His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord
God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign over the house
of Jacob for ever: and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel,
How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?”478 Shall I still remain a virgin? is the honour
of virginity not then lost by me? And while she was yet in perplexity as to these things, the
angel placed shortly before her the summary of his whole message, and said to the pure
virgin, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
God.” For what it is, that also shall it be called by all means. Meekly, then, did grace make
election of the pure Mary alone out of all generations. For she proved herself prudent truly
in all things; neither has any woman been born like her in all generations. She was not like
the primeval virgin Eve, who, keeping holiday479 alone in paradise, with thoughtless mind,
unguardedly hearkened to the word of the serpent, the author of all evil, and thus became
depraved in the thoughts of her mind;480 and through her that deceiver, discharging his
poison and refusing death with it, brought it into the whole world; and in virtue of this has
arisen all the trouble of the saints. But in the holy Virgin alone is the fall of that (first
mother) repaired. Yet was not this holy one competent to receive the gift until she had first
learned who it was that sent it, and what the gift was, and who it was that conveyed it. While
the holy one pondered these things in perplexity with herself, she says to the angel, “Whence

hast thou brought to us the blessing in such wise? Out of what treasure-stores is the pearl
of the word despatched to us? Whence has the gift acquired its purpose481 toward us? From
heaven art thou come, yet thou walkest upon earth! Thou dost exhibit the form of man, and
(yet) thou art glorious with dazzling light.”482 These things the holy one considered with
herself, and the archangel solved the difficulty expressed in such reasonings by saying to
her: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
God. And fear not, Mary; for I am not come to overpower thee with fear, but to repel the
subject of fear. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God. Question not grace by
the standard of nature. For grace does not endure to pass under the laws of nature. Thou
knowest, O Mary, things kept hid from the patriarchs and prophets. Thou hast learned, O
virgin, things which were kept concealed till now from the angels. Thou hast heard, O purest
one, things of which even the choir of inspired men483 was never deemed worthy. Moses,
and David, and Isaiah, and Daniel, and all the prophets, prophesied of Him; but the manner
they knew not. Yet thou alone, O purest virgin, art now made the recipient of things of
which all these were kept in ignorance, and thou dost learn484 the origin of them. For where
the Holy Spirit is, there are all things readily ordered. Where divine grace is present, all
things are found possible with God. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.” And if He is the Son of God, then is He also God, of
one form with the Father, and co-eternal; in Him the Father possesses all manifestation;485
He is His image in the person, and through His reflection the (Father’s) glory shines forth.
And as from the ever-flowing fountain the streams proceed, so also from this ever-flowing
and ever-living fountain does the light of the world proceed, the perennial and the true,
namely Christ our God. For it is of this that the prophets have preached: “The streams of
the river make glad the city of God.”486 And not one city only, but all cities; for even as it
makes glad one city, so does it also the whole world. Appropriately, therefore, did the angel487
say to Mary the holy virgin first of all, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with
thee;” inasmuch as with her was laid up the full treasure of grace. For of all generations she
alone has risen as a virgin pure in body and in spirit; and she alone bears Him who bears

all things on His word. Nor is it only the beauty of this holy one in body that calls forth our
admiration, but also the innate virtue of her soul. Wherefore also the angel488 addressed
her first with the salutation, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured,489 the Lord is with thee,
and no spouse of earth;” He Himself is with thee who is the Lord of sanctification, the
Father of purity, the Author of incorruption, and the Bestower of liberty, the Curator of
salvation, and the Steward and Provider of the true peace, who out of the virgin earth made
man, and out of man’s side formed Eve in addition. Even this Lord is with thee, and on the
other hand also is of thee. Come, therefore, beloved brethren, and let us take up the angelic
strain, and to the utmost of our ability return the due meed of praise, saying, “Hail,490 thou
that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee!” For it is thine truly to rejoice, seeing that
the grace of God, as he knows, has chosen to dwell with thee—the Lord of glory dwelling
with the handmaiden; “He that is fairer than the children of men”491 with the fair virgin;
He who sanctifies all things with the undefiled. God is with thee, and with thee also is the
perfect man in whom dwells the whole fulness of the Godhead. Hail, thou that art highly
favoured, the fountain of the light that lightens all who believe upon Him! Hail, thou that
art highly favoured, the rising of the rational Sun,492 and the undefiled flower of Life! Hail,
thou that art highly favoured, the mead493 of sweet savour! Hail, thou that art highly favoured,
the ever-blooming vine, that makes glad the souls of those who honour thee! Hail, thou that
art highly favoured!—the soil that, all untilled, bears bounteous fruit: for thou hast brought
forth in accordance with the law of nature indeed, as it goes with us, and by the set time of
practice,494 and yet in a way beyond nature, or rather above nature, by reason that God the
Word from above took His abode in thee, and formed the new Adam in thy holy womb,
and inasmuch as the Holy Ghost gave the power of conception to the holy virgin; and the
reality of His body was assumed from her body. And just as the pearl495 comes of the two
natures, namely lightning and water, the occult signs of the sea; so also our Lord Jesus Christ
proceeds, without fusion and without mutation, from the pure, and chaste, and undefiled,
and holy Virgin Mary; perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, in all things equal to the
Father, and in all things consubstantial with us, apart from sin.</p>

<p>Most of the holy fathers, and patriarchs, and prophets desired to see Him, and to be
eye-witnesses of Him, but did not attain hereto. And some of them by visions beheld Him
in type, and darkly; others, again, were privileged to hear the divine voice through the medium
of the cloud, and were favoured with sights of holy angels; but to Mary the pure virgin
alone did the archangel Gabriel manifest himself luminously, bringing her the glad address,
“Hail, thou that art highly favoured!” And thus she received the word, and in the due time
of the fulfilment according to the body’s course she brought forth the priceless pearl. Come,
then, ye too, dearly beloved, and let us chant the melody which has been taught us by the
inspired harp of David, and say, “Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest; Thou, and the ark of Thy
sanctuary.”496 For the holy Virgin is in truth an ark, wrought with gold both within and
without, that has received the whole treasury of the sanctuary. “Arise, O Lord, into Thy
rest.” Arise, O Lord, out of the bosom of the Father, in order that Thou mayest raise up the
fallen race of the first-formed man. Setting these things forth,497 David in prophecy said to
the rod that was to spring from himself, and to sprout into the flower of that beauteous fruit,
“Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear, and forget thine own people and thy
father’s house; so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty: for He is the Lord thy God, and
thou shalt worship Him.”498 Hearken, O daughter, to the things which were prophesied
beforetime of thee, in order that thou mayest also behold the things themselves with the
eyes of understanding. Hearken to me while I announce things beforehand to thee, and
hearken to the archangel who declares expressly to thee the perfect mysteries. Come then,
dearly beloved, and let us fall back on the memory of what has gone before us; and let us
glorify, and celebrate, and laud, and bless that rod that has sprung so marvellously from
Jesse. For Luke, in the inspired Gospel narratives, delivers a testimony not to Joseph only,
but also to Mary the mother of God, and gives this account with reference to the very family
and house of David: “For Joseph went up,” says he, “from Galilee, unto a city of Judea which
is called Bethlehem, to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child, because
they were of the house and family of David. And so it was, that while they were there, the
days were accomplished that she should be delivered; and she brought forth her son, the
first-born of the whole creation,499 and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in
a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.”500 She wrapped in swaddlingclothes
Him who is covered with light as with a garment.501 She wrapped in swaddling-

clothes Him who made every creature. She laid in a manger Him who sits above the cherubim502
and is praised by myriads of angels. In the manger set apart for dumb brutes did
the Word of God repose, in order that He might impart to men, who are really irrational
by free choice, the perceptions of true reason. In the board from which cattle eat was laid
the heavenly Bread,503 in order that He might provide participation in spiritual sustenance
for men who live like the beasts of the earth. Nor was there even room for Him in the inn.
He found no place, who by His word established heaven and earth; “for though He was rich,
for our sakes He became poor,”504 and chose extreme humiliation on behalf of the salvation
of our nature, in His inherent goodness toward us. He who fulfilled the whole administration505
of unutterable mysteries of the economy506 in heaven in the bosom of the Father,
and in the cave in the arms of the mother, reposed in the manger. Angelic choirs encircled
Him, singing of glory in heaven and of peace upon earth. In heaven He was seated at the
right hand of the Father; and in the manger He rested, as it were, upon the cherubim. Even
there was in truth His cherubic throne; there was His royal seat. Holy of the holy, and alone
glorious upon the earth, and holier than the holy, was that wherein Christ our God rested.
To Him be glory, honour, and power, together with the Father undefiled, and the altogether
holy and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<head>The Second Homily.</head>
<p>On the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin Mary.507</p>
<p>Discourse Second.</p>
<p>It is our duty to present to God, like sacrifices, all the festivals and hymnal celebrations;
and first of all, the annunciation to the holy mother of God, to wit, the salutation made to
her by the angel, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured!” For first of all wisdom508 and saving
doctrine in the New Testament was this salutation, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured!”
conveyed to us from the Father of lights. And this address, “highly favoured,”509 embraced
the whole nature of men. “Hail, thou that art highly favoured”510 in the holy conception
and in the glorious pregnancy, “I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people.”511 And again the Lord, who came for the purpose of accomplishing a saving passion,
said, “I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.”512 And
after His resurrection again, by the hand of the holy women, He gave us first of all the salutation
“Hail!”513 And again, the apostle made the announcement in similar terms, saying,
“Rejoice evermore: pray without ceasing: in everything give thanks.”514 See, then, dearly
beloved, how the Lord has conferred upon us everywhere, and indivisibly, the joy that is
beyond conception, and perennial. For since the holy Virgin, in the life of the flesh, was in
possession of the incorruptible citizenship, and walked as such in all manner of virtues, and
lived a life more excellent than man’s common standard; therefore the Word that cometh
from God the Father thought it meet to assume the flesh, and endue the perfect man from
her, in order that in the same flesh in which sin entered into the world, and death by sin,
sin might be condemned in the flesh, and that the tempter of sin might be overcome in the
burying515 of the holy body, and that therewith also the beginning of the resurrection might
be exhibited, and life eternal instituted in the world, and fellowship established for men
with God the Father. And what shall we state, or what shall we pass by here? or who shall

<pb n="155"/>
explain what is incomprehensible in the mystery? But for the present let us fall back upon
our subject. Gabriel was sent to the holy virgin; the incorporeal was despatched to her who
in the body pursued the incorruptible conversation, and lived in purity and in virtues. And
when he came to her, he first addressed her with the salutation, “Hail, thou that art highly
favoured! the Lord is with thee.” Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for thou doest what is
worthy of joy indeed, since thou hast put on the vesture of purity, and art girt with the
cincture of prudence. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for to thy lot it has fallen to be the
vehicle of celestial joy. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for through thee joy is decreed
for the whole creation, and the human race receives again by thee its pristine dignity. Hail,
thou that art highly favoured! for in thy arms the Creator of all things shall be carried. And
she was perplexed by this word; for she was inexperienced in all the addresses of men, and
welcomed quiet, as the mother of prudence and purity; (yet) being a pure, and immaculate,
and stainless image516 herself, she shrank not in terror from the angelic apparition, like
most of the prophets, as indeed true virginity has a kind of affinity and equality with the
angels. For the holy Virgin guarded carefully the torch of virginity, and gave diligent heed
that it should not be extinguished or defiled. And as one who is clad in a brilliant robe deems
it a matter of great moment that no impurity or filth be suffered to touch it anywhere, so
did the holy Mary consider with herself, and said: Does this act of attention imply any deep
design or seductive purpose? Shall this word “Hail” prove the cause of trouble to me, as of
old the fair promise of being made like God, which was given her by the serpent-devil,
proved to our first mother Eve? Has the devil, who is the author of all evil, become transformed
again into an angel of light; and bearing a grudge against my espoused husband for
his admirable temperance, and having assailed him with some fair-seeming address, and
finding himself powerless to overcome a mind so firm, and to deceive the man, has he turned
his attack upon me, as one endowed with a more susceptible mind; and is this word “Hail”
(Grace be with thee) spoken as the sign of gracelessness hereafter? Is this benediction and
salutation uttered in irony? Is there not some poison concealed in the honey? Is it not the
address of one who brings good tidings, while the end of the same is to make me the designer’s
prey? And how is it that he can thus salute one whom he knows not? These things she
pondered in perplexity with herself, and expressed in words. Then again the archangel addressed
her with the announcement of a joy which all may believe in, and which shall not
be taken away, and said to her, “Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.”
Shortly hast thou the proof of what has been said. For I not only give you to understand
that there is nothing to fear, but I show you the very key to the absence of all cause for fear.
For through me all the heavenly powers hail thee, the holy virgin: yea rather, He Himself,
who is Lord of all the heavenly powers and of all creation, has selected thee as the holy one
<note type="footnote">516 ἄγαλμα.</note>

<pb n="156"/>
and the wholly fair; and through thy holy, and chaste, and pure, and undefiled womb the
enlightening Pearl comes forth for the salvation of all the world: since of all the race of man
thou art by birth the holy one, and the more honourable, and the purer, and the more pious
than any other: and thou hast a mind whiter than the snow, and a body made purer than
any gold, however fine, and a womb such as the object which Ezekiel saw, and which he has
described in these terms: “And the likeness of the living creatures upon the head was as the
firmament, and as the appearance of the terrible crystal, and the likeness of the throne above
them was as the appearance of a sapphire-stone: and above the throne it was as the likeness
of a man, and as the appearance of amber; and within it there was, as it were, the likeness
of fire round about.”517</p>
<p>Clearly, then, did the prophet behold in type Him who was born of the holy virgin,
whom thou, O holy virgin, wouldest have had no strength to bear, hadst thou not beamed
forth for that time518 with all that is glorious and virtuous. And with what words of laudation,
then, shall we describe her virgin-dignity? With what indications and proclamations of
praise shall we celebrate her stainless figure? With what spiritual song or word shall we
honour her who is most glorious among the angels? She is planted in the house of God like
a fruitful olive that the Holy Spirit overshadowed; and by her means are we called sons and
heirs of the kingdom of Christ. She is the ever-blooming paradise of incorruptibility, wherein
is planted the tree that giveth life, and that furnisheth to all the fruits of immortality. She is
the boast and glory of virgins, and the exultation of mothers. She is the sure support of the
believing, and the succourer519 of the pious. She is the vesture of light, and the domicile of
virtue.520 She is the ever-flowing fountain, wherein the water of life sprang and produced
the Lord’s incarnate manifestation. She is the monument of righteousness; and all who become
lovers of her, and set their affections on virgin-like ingenuousness and purity, shall
enjoy the grace of angels. All who keep themselves from wine and intoxication, and from
the wanton enjoyments of strong drink, shall be made glad with the products of the lifebearing
plant. All who have preserved the lamp of virginity unextinguished shall be privileged
to receive the amaranthine crown of immortality. All who have possessed themselves of the
stainless robe of temperance shall be received into the mystical bride-chamber of righteousness.
All who have come nearer the angelic degree than others shall also enter into the more
real enjoyment of their Lord’s beatitude. All who have possessed the illuminating oil of understanding,
and the pure incense of conscience, shall inherit the promise of spiritual favour
and the spiritual adoption. All who worthily observe the festival of the Annunciation of the

Virgin Mary, the mother of God, acquire as their meet recompense the fuller interest in the
message, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured!” It is our duty, therefore, to keep this feast,
seeing that it has filled the whole world with joy and gladness. And let us keep it with psalms,
and hymns, and spiritual songs. Of old did Israel also keep their festival, but then it was
with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, of which the prophet says: “I will turn their feasts
into afflictions and lamentation, and their joy into shame.”521 But our afflictions our Lord
has assured us He will turn into joy by the fruits of penitence.522 And again, the first covenant
maintained the righteous requirements523 of a divine service, as in the case of our forefather
Abraham; but these stood in the inflictions of pain in the flesh by circumcision, until the
time of the fulfilment. “The law was given to them through Moses” for their discipline; “but
grace and truth” have been given to us by Jesus Christ.524 The beginning of all these blessings
to us appeared in the annunciation to Mary, the highly-favoured, in the economy of the
Saviour which is worthy of all praise, and in His divine and supra-mundane instruction.
Thence rise the rays of the light of understanding upon us. Thence spring for us the fruits
of wisdom and immortality, sending forth the clear pure streams of piety. Thence come to
us the brilliant splendours of the treasures of divine knowledge. “For this is life eternal, that
we may know the true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.”525 And again, “Search
the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life.”526 For on this account the treasure
of the knowledge of God is revealed to them who search the divine oracles. That treasure
of the inspired Scriptures the Paraclete has unfolded to us this day. And let the tongue of
prophecy and the doctrine of apostles be the treasure of wisdom to us; for without the law
and the prophets, or the evangelists and the apostles, it is not possible to have the certain
hope of salvation. For by the tongue of the holy prophets and apostles our Lord speaks, and
God takes pleasure in the words of the saints; not that He requires the spoken address, but
that He delights in the good disposition; not that He receives any profit from men, but that
He finds a restful satisfaction in the rightly-affected soul of the righteous. For it is not that
Christ is magnified by what we say; but as we receive benefits from Him, we proclaim with
grateful mind His beneficence to us; not that we can attain to what is worthy therein, but
that we give the meet return to the best of our ability. And when the Gospels or the Epistles,
therefore, are read, let not your attention centre on the book or on the reader, but on the
God who speaks to you from heaven. For the book is but that which is seen, while Christ is

the divine subject spoken of. It brings us then the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour,
which is worthy of all praise, to wit, that, though He was God, He became man through
kindness toward man, and did not lay aside, indeed, the dignity which was His from all
eternity, but assumed the economy that should work salvation. It brings us the glad tidings
of that economy of the Saviour worthy of all praise, to wit, that He sojourned with us as a
physician for the sick, who did not heal them with potions, but restored them by the inclination
of His philanthropy.</p>
<p>It brings us the glad tidings of this economy of the Saviour altogether to be praised, to
wit, that to them who had wandered astray the way of salvation was shown, and that to the
despairing the grace of salvation was made known, which blesses all in different modes;
searching after the erring, enlightening the blinded, giving life to the dead, setting free the
slaves, redeeming the captives, and becoming all things to all of us in order to be the true
way of salvation to us: and all this He does, not by reason of our goodwill toward Him, but
in virtue of a benignity that is proper to our Benefactor Himself. For the Saviour did all, not
in order that He might acquire virtue Himself, but that He might put us in possession of
eternal life. He made man, indeed, after the image of God, and appointed him to live in a
paradise of pleasure. But the man being deceived by the devil, and having become a transgressor
of the divine commandment, was made subject to the doom of death. Whence, also,
those born of him were involved in their father’s liability in virtue of their succession, and
had the reckoning of condemnation required of them. “For death reigned from Adam to
Moses.”527 But the Lord, in His benignity toward man, when He saw the creature He
Himself had formed now held by the power of death, did not turn away finally from him
whom He had made in His own image, but visited him in each generation, and forsook him
not; and manifesting Himself first of all among the patriarchs, and then proclaiming Himself
in the law, and presenting the likeness of Himself528 in the prophets, He presignified the
economy of salvation. When, moreover, the fulness of the times came for His glorious appearing,
He sent beforehand the archangel Gabriel to bear the glad tidings to the Virgin
Mary. And he came down from the ineffable powers above to the holy Virgin, and addressed
her first of all with the salutation, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured.” And when this word,
“Hail, thou that art highly favoured,” reached her, in the very moment of her hearing it, the
Holy Spirit entered into the undefiled temple of the Virgin, and her mind and her members
were sanctified together. And nature stood opposite, and natural intercourse at a distance,
beholding with amazement the Lord of nature, in a manner contrary to nature, or rather
above nature, doing a miraculous work in the body; and by the very weapons by which the
devil strove against us, Christ also saved us, taking to Himself our passible body in order

that He might impart the greater grace529 to the being who was deficient in it. And “where
sin abounded, grace did much more abound.” And appropriately was grace sent to the holy
Virgin. For this word also is contained in the oracle of the evangelic history: “And in the
sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was
Joseph, of the house and lineage of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary;”530 and so forth.
And this was the first month to the holy Virgin. Even as Scripture says in the book of the
law: “This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month
among the months of the year to you.”531 “Keep ye the feast of the holy passover to the Lord
in all your generations.” It was also the sixth month to Zacharias. And rightly, then, did the
holy Virgin prove to be of the family of David, and she had her home in Bethlehem, and
was betrothed rightfully to Joseph, in accordance with the laws of relationship. And her espoused
husband was her guardian, and possessor also of the untarnished incorruption which
was hers. And the name given to the holy Virgin was one that became her exceedingly. For
she was called Mary, and that, by interpretation, means illumination. And what shines more
brightly than the light of virginity? For this reason also the virtues are called virgins by those
who strive rightly to get at their true nature. But if it is so great a blessing to have a virgin
heart, how great a boon will it be to have the flesh that cherishes virginity along with the
soul!</p>
<p>Thus the holy Virgin, while still in the flesh, maintained the incorruptible life, and received
in faith the things which were announced by the archangel. And thereafter she journeyed
diligently to her relation Elisabeth in the hill-country. “And she entered into the house
of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth,”532 in imitation of the angel. “And it came to pass, that,
when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt with joy in her womb; and
Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.”533 Thus the voice of Mary wrought with power,
and filled Elisabeth with the Holy Ghost. And by her tongue, as from an ever-flowing
fountain, she sent forth a stream of gracious gifts in the way of prophecy to her relation;
and while the feet of her child were bound in the womb,534 she prepared to dance and leap.
And that was the sign of a marvellous jubilation. For wherever she was who was highly favoured,
there she filled all things with joy. “And Elisabeth spake out with a loud voice, and
said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is
this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? Blessed art thou among wo-

men.”535 For thou hast become to women the beginning of the new creation.536 Thou hast
given to us boldness of access into paradise, and thou hast put to flight our ancient woe. For
after thee the race of woman shall no more be made the subject of reproach. No more do
the successors of Eve fear the ancient curse, or the pangs of childbirth. For Christ, the Redeemer
of our race, the Saviour of all nature, the spiritual Adam who has healed the hurt
of the creature of earth, cometh forth from thy holy womb. “Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.” For He who bears all blessings for us is manifested as
thy fruit. This we read in the clear words of her who was barren; but yet more clearly did
the holy Virgin herself express this again when she presented to God the song replete with
thanksgiving, and acceptance, and divine knowledge; announcing ancient things together
with what was new; proclaiming along with things which were of old, things also which
belong to the consummation of the ages; and summing up in a short discourse the mysteries
of Christ. “And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in
God my Saviour,” and so forth. “He hath holpen His servant Israel in remembrance of His
mercy, and of the covenant which He established with Abraham and with his seed for
ever.”537 Thou seest how the holy Virgin has surpassed even the perfection of the patriarchs,
and how she confirms the covenant which was made with Abraham by God, when He said,
“This is the covenant which I shall establish between me and thee.”538 Wherefore He has
come and confirmed the covenant with Abraham, having received mystically in Himself
the sign of circumcision, and having proved Himself the fulfilment of the law and the
prophets. This song of prophecy, therefore, did the holy mother of God render to God,
saying, “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour:
for He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His name.” For having made
me the mother of God, He has also preserved me a virgin; and by my womb the fulness of
all generations is headed up together for sanctification. For He hath blessed every age, both
men and women, both young men and youths, and old men. “He hath made strength with
His arm,”539 on our behalf, against death and against the devil, having torn the handwriting
of our sins. “He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts;” yea, He hath
scattered the devil himself, and all the demons that serve under him. For he was overweeningly
haughty in his heart, seeing that he dared to say, “I will set my throne above the clouds,
and I will be like the Most High.”540 And now, how He scattered him the prophet has indic-

ated in what follows, where he says, “Yet now thou shalt be brought down to hell,”541 and
all thy hosts with thee. For He has overthrown everywhere his altars and the worship of vain
gods, and He has prepared for Himself a peculiar people out of the heathen nations. “He
hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.” In these terms
is intimated in brief the extrusion of the Jews and the admission of the Gentiles. For the
elders of the Jews and the scribes in the law, and those who were richly privileged with
other prerogatives, because they used their riches ill and their power lawlessly, were cast
down by Him from every seat, whether of prophecy or of priesthood, whether of legislature
or of doctrine, and were stripped of all their ancestral wealth, and of their sacrifices and
multitudinous festivals, and of all the honourable privileges of the kingdom. Spoiled of all
these boons, as naked fugitives they were cast out into captivity. And in their stead the
humble were exalted, namely, the Gentile peoples who hungered after righteousness. For,
discovering their own lowliness, and the hunger that pressed upon them for the knowledge
of God, they pleaded for the divine word, though it were but for crumbs of the same, like
the woman of Canaan;542 and for this reason they were filled with the riches of the divine
mysteries. For the Christ who was born of the Virgin, and who is our God, has given over
the whole inheritance of divine blessings to the Gentiles. “He hath holpen His servant Israel.”
543 Not any Israel in general, indeed, but His servant, who in very deed maintains the
true nobility of Israel. And on this account also did the mother of God call Him servant
(Son) and heir. For when He had found the same labouring painfully in the letter and the
law, He called him by grace. It is such an Israel, therefore, that He called and hath holpen
in remembrance of His mercy. “As He spake to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for
ever.” In these few words is comprehended the whole mystery of the economy. For, with
the purpose of saving the race of men, and fulfilling the covenant that was made with our
fathers, Christ has once “bowed the heavens and come down.”544 And thus He shows
Himself to us as we are capable of receiving Him, in order that we might have power to see
Him, and handle Him, and hear Him when the speaketh. And on this account did God the
Word deem it meet to take to Himself the flesh and the perfect humanity by a woman, the
holy Virgin; and He was born a man, in order that He might discharge our debt, and fulfil
even in Himself545 the ordinances of the covenant made with Abraham, in its rite of circumcision,
and all the other legal appointments connected with it. And after she had spoken
these words the holy Virgin went to Nazareth; and from that a decree of Cæsar led her to

come again to Bethlehem; and so, as proceeding herself from the royal house, she was brought
to the royal house of David along with Joseph her espoused husband. And there ensued
there the mystery which transcends all wonders,—the Virgin brought forth and bore in her
hand Him who bears the whole creation by His word. “And there was no room for them in
the inn.”546 He found no room who founded the whole earth by His word. She nourished
with her milk Him who imparts sustenance and life to everything that hath breath. She
wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes who binds the whole creation fast with His word. She
laid Him in a manger who rides seated upon the cherubim.547 A light from heaven shone
round about Him who lighteneth the whole creation. The hosts of heaven attended Him
with their doxologies who is glorified in heaven from before all ages. A star with its torch
guided them who had come from the distant parts of earth toward Him who is the true
Orient. From the East came those who brought gifts to Him who for our sakes became poor.
And the holy mother of God kept these words, and pondered them in her heart, like one
who was the receptacle of all the mysteries. Thy praise, O most holy Virgin, surpasses all
laudation, by reason of the God who received the flesh and was born man of thee. To thee
every creature, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, offers
the meet offering of honour. For thou hast been indeed set forth as the true cherubic throne.
Thou shinest as the very brightness of light in the high places of the kingdoms of intelligence;
548 where the Father, who is without beginning, and whose power thou hadst overshadowing
thee, is glorified; where also the Son is worshipped, whom thou didst bear according
to the flesh; and where the Holy Spirit is praised, who effected in thy womb the
generation of the mighty King. Through thee, O thou that art highly favoured, is the holy
and consubstantial Trinity known in the world. Together with thyself, deem us also worthy
to be made partakers of thy perfect grace in Jesus Christ our Lord: with whom, and with the
Holy Spirit, be glory to the Father, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages. Amen.549</p>

<p>On the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin Mary.550</p>
<p>Again have we the glad tidings of joy, again the announcements of liberty, again the
restoration, again the return, again the promise of gladness, again the release from slavery.
An angel talks with the Virgin, in order that the serpent may no more have converse with
the woman. In the sixth month, it is said, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a virgin
espoused to a man.551 Gabriel was sent to declare the world-wide salvation: Gabriel was
sent to bear to Adam the signature of his restoration; Gabriel was sent to a virgin, in order
to transform the dishonour of the female sex into honour; Gabriel was sent to prepare the
worthy chamber for the pure spouse; Gabriel was sent to wed the creature with the Creator;
Gabriel was sent to the animate palace of the King of the angels; Gabriel was sent to a virgin
espoused to Joseph, but preserved for Jesus the Son of God. The incorporeal servant was
sent to the virgin undefiled. One free from sin was sent to one that admitted no corruption.
The light was sent that should announce the Sun of righteousness. The dawn was sent that
should precede the light of the day. Gabriel was sent to proclaim Him who is in the bosom
of the Father, and who yet was to be in the arms of the mother. Gabriel was sent to declare
Him who is upon the throne, and yet also in the cavern. The subaltern was sent to utter
aloud the mystery of the great King; the mystery, I mean, which is discerned by faith, and
which cannot be searched out by officious curiosity; the mystery which is to be adored, not
weighed; the mystery which is to be taken as a thing divine, and not measured. “In the sixth
month Gabriel was sent to a virgin.” What is meant by this sixth month? What? It is the
sixth month from the time when Elisabeth received the glad tidings, from the time that she
conceived John. And how is this made plain? The archangel himself gives us the interpretation,
when he says to the virgin: “Behold, thy relation Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
son in her old age: and this is now the sixth month with her, who was called barren.”552 In
the sixth month—that is evidently, therefore, the sixth month of the conception of John.
For it was meet that the subaltern should go before; it was meet that the attendant should
precede; it was meet that the herald of the Lord’s coming should prepare the way for Him.
In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a man; espoused, not
united; espoused, yet kept intact. And for what purpose was she espoused? In order that the
spoiler might not learn the mystery prematurely. For that the King was to come by a virgin,
was a fact known to the wicked one. For he too heard these words of Isaiah: “Behold, a virgin
<note type="footnote">550 “The Third Discourse by the same sainted Gregory, Bishop of Neo-Cæsareia, surnamed Thaumaturgus,
on the Annunciation to the all-holy Virgin Mary, mother of God.”</note>

<note type="footnote">552 Luke i. 36.</note>

<pb n="164"/>
shall conceive, and bear a son.”553 And on every occasion, consequently, he kept watch
upon the virgin’s words, in order that, whenever this mystery should be fulfilled, he might
prepare her dishonour. Wherefore the Lord came by an espoused virgin, in order to elude
the notice of the wicked one; for one who was espoused was pledged in fine to be her husband’s.
“In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a man whose
name was Joseph.” Hear what the prophet says about this man and the virgin: “This book
that is sealed shall be delivered to a man that is learned.”554 What is meant by this sealed
book, but just the virgin undefiled? From whom is this to be given? From the priests evidently.
And to whom? To the artisan Joseph. As, then, the priests espoused Mary to Joseph as to a
prudent husband, and committed her to his care in expectation of the time of marriage, and
as it behoved him then on obtaining her to keep the virgin untouched, this was announced
by the prophet long before, when he said: “This book that is sealed shall be delivered to a
man that is learned.” And that man will say, I cannot read it. But why canst thou not read
it, O Joseph? I cannot read it, he says, because the book is sealed. For whom, then, is it preserved?
It is preserved as a place of sojourn for the Maker of the universe. But let us return
to our immediate subject. In the sixth month Gabriel was sent to a virgin—he who received,
indeed, such injunctions as these: “Come hither now, archangel, and become the minister
of a dread mystery which has been kept hid, and be thou the agent in the miracle. I am
moved by my compassions to descend to earth in order to recover the lost Adam. Sin hath
made him decay who was made in my image, and hath corrupted the work of my hands,
and hath obscured the beauty which I formed. The wolf devours my nursling, the home of
paradise is desolate, the tree of life is guarded by the flaming sword, the location of enjoyments
is closed. My pity is evoked for the object of this enmity, and I desire to seize the enemy.
Yet I wish to keep this mystery, which I confide to thee alone, still hid from all the
powers of heaven. Go thou, therefore, to the Virgin Mary. Pass thou on to that animate city
whereof the prophet spake in these words: ‘Glorious things were spoken of thee, O city of
God.’555 Proceed, then, to my rational paradise; proceed to the gate of the east; proceed to
the place of sojourn that is worthy of my word; proceed to that second heaven on earth;
proceed to the light cloud, and announce to it the shower of my coming; proceed to the
sanctuary prepared for me; proceed to the hall of the incarnation; proceed to the pure
chamber of my generation after the flesh. Speak in the ears of my rational ark, so as to prepare
for me the accesses of hearing. But neither disturb nor vex the soul of the virgin. Manifest
thyself in a manner befitting that sanctuary, and hail her first with the voice of gladness.
And address Mary with the salutation, ‘Hail, thou that art highly favoured,’ that I may show

compassion for Eve in her depravation.” The archangel heard these things, and considered
them within himself, as was reasonable, and said: “Strange is this matter; passing comprehension
is this thing that is spoken. He who is the object of dread to the cherubim, He who
cannot be looked upon by the seraphim, He who is incomprehensible to all the heavenly556
powers, does He give the assurance of His connection with a maiden? does He announce
His own personal coming? yea more, does He hold out an access by hearing? and is He who
condemned Eve, urgent to put such honour upon her daughter? For He says: ‘So as to prepare
for me the accesses of hearing.’ But can the womb contain Him who cannot be contained
in space? Truly this is a dread mystery.” While the angel is indulging such reflections, the
Lord says to Him: “Why art thou troubled and perplexed, O Gabriel? Hast thou not already
been sent by me to Zacharias the priest? Hast thou not conveyed to him the glad tidings of
the nativity of John? Didst thou not inflict upon the incredulous priest the penalty of
speechlessness? Didst thou not punish the aged man with dumbness? Didst thou not make
thy declaration, and I confirmed it? And has not the actual fact followed upon thy announcement
of good? Did not the barren woman conceive? Did not the womb obey the word? Did
not the malady of sterility depart? Did not the inert disposition of nature take to flight? Is
not she now one that shows fruitfulness, who before was never pregnant? Can anything be
impossible with me, the Creator of all? Wherefore, then, art thou tossed with doubt?” What
is the angel’s answer to this? “O Lord,” he says, “to remedy the defects of nature, to do away
with the blast of evils, to recall the dead members to the power of life, to enjoin on nature
the potency of generation, to remove barrenness in the case of members that have passed
the common limit,557 to change the old and withered stalk into the appearance of verdant
vigour, to set forth the fruitless soil suddenly as the producer of sheaves of corn,—to do all
this is a work which, as it is ever the case, demands Thy power. And Sarah is a witness
thereto, and along with her558 also Rebecca, and again Anna, who all, though bound by the
dread ill of barrenness, were afterwards gifted by Thee with deliverance from that malady.
But that a virgin should bring forth, without knowledge of a man, is something that goes
beyond all the laws of nature; and dost Thou yet announce Thy coming to the maiden? The
bounds of heaven and earth do not contain Thee, and how shall the womb of a virgin contain
Thee?” And the Lord says: “How did the tent of Abraham contain me?”559 And the angel
says: “As there were there the deeps of hospitality, O Lord, Thou didst show Thyself there
to Abraham at the door of the tent, and didst pass quickly by it, as He who filleth all things.

of its splendour, and can the virgin receive Thee without being consumed?” Then the Lord
says: “Yea surely, if the fire in the wilderness injured the bush, my coming will indeed also
injure Mary; but if that fire which served as the adumbration of the advent of the fire of divinity
from heaven fertilized the bush, and did not burn it, what wilt thou say of the Truth
that descends not in a flame of fire, but in the form of rain?”560 Thereupon the angel set
himself to carry out the commission given him, and repaired to the Virgin, and addressed
her with a loud voice, saying: “Hail, thou that are highly favoured! the Lord is with thee. No
longer shalt the devil be against thee; for where of old that adversary inflicted the wound,
there now first of all does the Physician apply the salve of deliverance. Where death came
forth, there has life now prepared its entrance. By a woman came the flood of our ills, and
by a woman also our blessings have their spring. Hail, thou that are highly favoured! Be not
thou ashamed, as if thou wert the cause of our condemnation. For thou art made the
mother of Him who is at once Judge and Redeemer. Hail, thou stainless mother of the
Bridegroom561 of a world bereft! Hail, thou that hast sunk in thy womb the death (that
came) of the mother (Eve)! Hail, thou animate temple of temple of God! Hail, thou equal562
home of heaven and earth alike! Hail, thou amplest receptacle of the illimitable nature!” But
as these things are so, through her has come for the sick the Physician; for them that sit in
darkness, the Sun of righteousness; for all that are tossed and tempest-beaten, the Anchor
and the Port undisturbed by storm. For the servants in irreconcilable enmity has been born
the Lord; and One has sojourned with us to be the bond of peace and the Redeemer of those
led captive, and to be the peace for those involved in hostility. For He is our peace;563 and
of that peace may it be granted that all we may receive the enjoyment, by the grace and
kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory, honour, and power, now and ever,
and unto all the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<p>O ye who are the friends of Christ, and the friends of the stranger, and the friends of
the brethren, receive in kindness my speech to-day, and open your ears like the doors of
hearing, and admit within them my discourse, and accept from me this saving proclamation
of the baptism565 of Christ, which took place in the river Jordan, in order that your loving
desires may be quickened after the Lord, who has done so much for us in the way of condescension.
For even though the festival of the Epiphany of the Saviour is past, the grace of the
same yet abides with us through all. Let us therefore enjoy it with insatiable minds; for insatiate
desire is a good thing in the case of what pertains to salvation—yea, it is a good thing.
Come therefore, all of us, from Galilee to Judea, and let us go forth with Christ; for blessed
is he who journeys in such company on the way of life. Come, and with the feet of thought
let us make for the Jordan, and see John the Baptist as he baptizes One who needs no baptism,
and yet submits to the rite in order that He may bestow freely upon us the grace of baptism.
Come, let us view the image of our regeneration, as it is emblematically presented in these
waters. “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.”566 O
how vast is the humility of the Lord! O how vast His condescension! The King of the heavens
hastened to John, His own forerunner, without setting in motion the camps567 of His angels,
without despatching beforehand the incorporeal powers as His precursors; but presenting
Himself in utmost simplicity, in soldier-like form,568 He comes up to His own subaltern.
And He approached him as one of the multitude, and humbled Himself among the captives
though He was the Redeemer, and ranged Himself with those under judgment though He
was the Judge, and joined Himself with the lost sheep though He was the Good Shepherd
who on account of the straying sheep came down from heaven, and yet did not forsake His
heavens, and was mingled with the tares though He was that heavenly grain that springs
unsown. And when the Baptist John then saw Him, recognising Him whom before in his
mother’s womb he had recognised and worshipped, and discerning clearly that this was He
on whose account, in a manner surpassing the natural time, he had leaped in the womb of
his mother, in violation of the limits of nature, he drew his right hand within his double
cloak, and bowing his head like a servant full of love to his master, addressed Him in these

words: I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?569 What is this Thou
doest, my Lord? Why dost Thou reverse the order of things? Why seekest Thou along with
the servants, at the hand of Thy servant, the things that are proper to servants? Why dost
Thou desire to receive what Thou requirest not? Why dost Thou burden me, Thy servitor,
with Thy mighty condescension? I have need to be baptized of Thee, but Thou hast no need
to be baptized of me. The less is blessed by the greater, and the greater is not blessed and
sanctified by the less. The light is kindled by the sun, and the sun is not made to shine by
the rush-lamp. The clay is wrought by the potter, and the potter is not moulded by the clay.
The creature is made anew by the Creator, and the Creator is not restored by the creature.
The infirm is healed by the physician, and the physician is not cured by the infirm. The poor
man receives contributions from the rich, and the rich borrow not from the poor. I have
need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? Can I be ignorant who Thou art, and
from what source Thou hast Thy light, and whence Thou art come? Or, because Thou hast
been born even as I have been,570 am I, then, to deny the greatness of Thy divinity? Or, because
Thou hast condescended so far to me as to have approached my body, and dost bear
me wholly in Thyself in order to effect the salvation of the whole man, am I, on account of
that body of Thine which is seen, to overlook that divinity of Thine which is only apprehended?
Or, because on behalf of my salvation Thou hast taken to Thyself the offering of my
first-fruits, am I to ignore the fact that Thou “coverest Thyself with light as with a garment?”
571 Or, because Thou wearest the flesh that is related to me, and dost show Thyself
to men as they are able to see Thee, am I to forget the brightness of Thy glorious divinity?
Or, because I see my own form in Thee, am I to reason against Thy divine substance, which
is invisible and incomprehensible? I know Thee, O Lord; I know Thee clearly. I know Thee,
since I have been taught by Thee; for no one can recognise Thee, unless He enjoys Thine
illumination. I know Thee, O Lord, clearly; for I saw Thee spiritually before I beheld this
light. When Thou wert altogether in the incorporeal bosom of the heavenly Father, Thou
wert also altogether in the womb of Thy handmaid and mother; and though held in the
womb of Elisabeth by nature as in a prison, and bound with the indissoluble bonds of the
children unborn, leaped and celebrated Thy birth with anticipative rejoicings. Shall I then,
who gave intimation of Thy sojourn on earth before Thy birth, fail to apprehend Thy coming
after Thy birth? Shall I, who in the womb was a teacher of Thy coming, be now a child in
understanding in view of perfect knowledge? But I cannot but worship Thee, who art adored
by the whole creation; I cannot but proclaim Thee, of whom heaven gave the indication by
the star, and for whom earth offered a kind reception by the wise men, while the choirs of

angels also praised Thee in joy over Thy condescension to us, and the shepherds who kept
watch by night hymned Thee as the Chief Shepherd of the rational sheep. I cannot keep silence
while Thou art present, for I am a voice; yea, I am the voice, as it is said, of one crying
in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.572 I have need to be baptized of Thee,
and comest Thou to me? I was born, and thereby removed the barrenness of the mother
that bore me; and while still a babe I became the healer of my father’s speechlessness, having
received of Thee from my childhood the gift of the miraculous. But Thou, being born of the
Virgin Mary, as Thou didst will, and as Thou alone dost know, didst not do away with her
virginity; but Thou didst keep it, and didst simply gift her with the name of mother: and
neither did her virginity preclude Thy birth, nor did Thy birth injure her virginity. But these
two things, so utterly opposite—bearing and virginity—harmonized with one intent; for
such a thing abides possible with Thee, the Framer of nature. I am but a man, and am a
partaker of the divine grace; but Thou art God, and also man to the same effect: for Thou
art by nature man’s friend. I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?
Thou who wast in the beginning, and wast with God, and wast God;573 Thou who art the
brightness of the Father’s glory;574 Thou who art the perfect image of the perfect Father;575
Thou who art the true light that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world;576 Thou
who wast in the world, and didst come where Thou wast; Thou who wast made flesh, and
yet wast not changed into the flesh; Thou who didst dwell among us, and didst manifest
Thyself to Thy servants in the form of a servant; Thou who didst bridge earth and heaven
together by Thy holy name,—comest Thou to me? One so great to such a one as I am? The
King to the forerunner? The Lord to the servant? But though Thou wast not ashamed to be
born in the lowly measures of humanity, yet I have no ability to pass the measures of nature.
I know how great is the measure of difference between earth and the Creator. I know how
great is the distinction between the clay and the potter. I know how vast is the superiority
possessed by Thee, who art the Sun of righteousness, over me who am but the torch of Thy
grace. Even though Thou art compassed with the pure cloud of the body, I can still recognise
Thy lordship. I acknowledge my own servitude, I proclaim Thy glorious greatness, I recognise
Thy perfect lordship, I recognise my own perfect insignificance, I am not worthy to unloose
the latchets of Thy shoes;577 and how shall I dare to touch Thy stainless head? How can I
stretch out the right hand upon Thee, who didst stretch out the heavens like a curtain,578

and didst set the earth above the waters?579 How shall I spread those menial hands of mine
upon Thy head? How shall I wash Thee, who art undefiled and sinless? How shall I enlighten
the light? What manner of prayer shall I offer up over Thee, who dost receive the prayers
even of those who are ignorant of Thee?
When I baptize others, I baptize into Thy name, in order that they may believe on Thee,
who comest with glory; but when I baptize Thee, of whom shall I make mention? and into
whose name shall I baptize Thee? Into that of the Father? But Thou hast the Father altogether
in Thyself, and Thou art altogether in the Father. Or into that of the Son? But beside Thee
there is no other Son of God by nature. Or into that of the Holy Spirit? But He is ever together
with Thee, as being of one substance, and of one will, and of one judgment, and of one
power, and of one honour with Thee; and He receives, along with Thee, the same adoration
from all. Wherefore, O Lord, baptize Thou me, if Thou pleasest; baptize me, the Baptist.
Regenerate one whom Thou didst cause to be generated. Extend Thy dread right hand,
which Thou hast prepared for Thyself, and crown my head by Thy touch, in order that I
may run the course before Thy kingdom, crowned like a forerunner, and diligently announce
the good tidings to the sinners, addressing them with this earnest call: “Behold the Lamb of
God, that taketh away the sin of the world!”580 O river Jordan, accompany me in the joyous
choir, and leap with me, and stir thy waters rhythmically, as in the movements of the dance;
for thy Maker stands by thee in the body. Once of old didst thou see Israel pass through
thee, and thou didst divide thy floods, and didst wait in expectation of the passage of the
people; but now divide thyself more decidedly, and flow more easily, and embrace the
stainless limbs of Him who at that ancient time did convey the Jews581 through thee. Ye
mountains and hills, ye valleys and torrents, ye seas and rivers, bless the Lord, who has come
upon the river Jordan; for through these streams He transmits sanctification to all streams.
And Jesus answered and said to him: Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil
all righteousness.582 Suffer it to be so now; grant the favour of silence, O Baptist, to the
season of my economy. Learn to will whatever is my will. Learn to minister to me in those
things on which I am bent, and do not pry curiously into all that I wish to do. Suffer it to
be so now: do not yet proclaim my divinity; do not yet herald my kingdom with thy lips, in
order that the tyrant may not learn the fact and give up the counsel he has formed with respect
to me. Permit the devil to come upon me, and enter the conflict with me as though I were
but a common man, and receive thus his mortal wound. Permit me to fulfil the object for
which I have come to earth. It is a mystery that is being gone through this day in the Jordan.

My mysteries are for myself and my own. There is a mystery here, not for the fulfilling of
my own need, but for the designing of a remedy for those who have been wounded. There
is a mystery, which gives in these waters the representation of the heavenly streams of the
regeneration of men. Suffer it to be so now: when thou seest me doing what seemeth to me
good among the works of my hands, in a manner befitting divinity, then attune thy praises
to the acts accomplished. When thou seest me cleansing the lepers, then proclaim me as the
framer of nature. When thou seest me make the lame ready runners, then with quickened
pace do thou also prepare thy tongue to praise me. When thou seest me cast out demons,
then hail my kingdom with adoration. When thou seest me raise the dead from their graves
by my word, then, in concert with those thus raised, glorify me as the Prince of Life. When
thou seest me on the Father’s right hand, then acknowledge me to be divine, as the equal of
the Father and the Holy Spirit, on the throne, and in eternity, and in honour. Suffer it to be
so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. I am the Lawgiver, and the Son
of the Lawgiver; and it becometh me first to pass through all that is established, and then
to set forth everywhere the intimations of my free gift. It becometh me to fulfil the law, and
then to bestow grace. It becometh me to adduce the shadow, and then the reality. It becometh
me to finish the old covenant, and then to dictate the new, and to write it on the hearts of
men, and to subscribe it with my blood,583 and to seal it with my Spirit. It becometh me to
ascend the cross, and to be pierced with its nails, and to suffer after the manner of that nature
which is capable of suffering, and to heal sufferings by my suffering, and by the tree to cure
the wound that was inflicted upon men by the medium of a tree. It becometh me to descend
even into the very depths of the grave, on behalf of the dead who are detained there. It becometh
me, by my three days’ dissolution in the flesh, to destroy the power of the ancient
enemy, death. It becometh me to kindle the torch of my body for those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death. It becometh me to ascend in the flesh to that place where I am
in my divinity. It becometh me to introduce to the Father the Adam reigning in me. It becometh
me to accomplish these things, for on account of these things I have taken my position
with the works of my hands. It becometh me to be baptized with this baptism for the
present, and afterwards to bestow the baptism of the consubstantial Trinity upon all men.
Lend me, therefore, O Baptist, thy right hand for the present economy, even as Mary lent
her womb for my birth. Immerse me in the streams of Jordan, even as she who bore me
wrapped me in children’s swaddling-clothes. Grant me thy baptism even as the Virgin
granted me her milk. Lay hold of this head of mine, which the seraphim revere. With thy
right hand lay hold of this head, that is related to thyself in kinship. Lay hold of this head,
which nature has made to be touched. Lay hold of this head, which for this very purpose
has been formed by myself and my Father. Lay hold of this head of mine, which, if one does
<note type="footnote">583 Or, with my name.</note>

<pb n="172"/>
lay hold of it in piety, will save him from ever suffering shipwreck. Baptize me, who am
destined to baptize those who believe on me with water, and with the Spirit, and with fire:
with water, capable of washing away the defilement of sins; with the Spirit, capable of making
the earthly spiritual; with fire, naturally fitted to consume the thorns of transgressions. On
hearing these words, the Baptist directed his mind to the object of the salvation,584 and
comprehended the mystery which he had received, and discharged the divine command;
for he was at once pious and ready to obey. And stretching forth slowly his right hand, which
seemed both to tremble and to rejoice, he baptized the Lord. Then the Jews who were present,
with those in the vicinity and those from a distance, reasoned together, and spake thus with
themselves and with each other: Was it, then, without cause that we imagined John to be
superior to Jesus? Was it without cause that we considered the former to be greater than
the latter? Does not this very baptism attest the Baptist’s pre-eminence? Is not he who baptizeth
presented as the superior, and he who is baptized as the inferior? But while they, in
their ignorance of the mystery of the economy, babbled in such wise with each other, He
who alone is Lord, and by nature the Father of the Only-begotten, He who alone knoweth
perfectly Him whom He alone in passionless fashion begat, to correct the erroneous imaginations
of the Jews, opened the gates of the heavens, and sent down the Holy Spirit in the
form of a dove, lighting upon the head of Jesus, pointing out thereby the new Noah, yea the
maker of Noah, and the good pilot of the nature which is in shipwreck. And He Himself
calls with clear voice out of heaven, and says: “This is my beloved Son,”585—the Jesus there,
namely, and not the John; the one baptized, and not the one baptizing; He who was begotten
of me before all periods of time and not he who was begotten of Zacharias; He who was
born of Mary after the flesh, and not he who was brought forth by Elisabeth beyond all expectation;
He who was the fruit of the virginity yet preserved intact, and not he who was
the shoot from a sterility removed; He who has had His conversation with you, and not he
who was brought up in the wilderness. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:
my Son, of the same substance with myself, and not of a different; of one substance with me
according to what is unseen, and of one substance with you according to what is seen, yet
without sin. This is He who along with me made man. This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased. This Son of mine and this son of Mary are not two distinct persons; but
this is my beloved Son,—this one who is both seen with the eye and apprehended with the
mind. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear Him. If He shall say, I and
my Father are one,586 hear Him. If He shall say, He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,587

hear Him. If He shall say, He that hath sent me is greater than I,588 adapt the voice to the
economy. If He shall say, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?589 answer ye Him
thus: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.590 By these words, as they were sent
from the Father out of heaven in thunder-form, the race of men was enlightened: they apprehended
the difference between the Creator and the creature, between the King and the
soldier (subject), between the Worker and the work; and being strengthened in faith, they
drew near through the baptism of John to Christ, our true God, who baptizeth with the
Spirit and with fire. To Him be glory, and to the Father, and to the most holy and quickening
Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<p>I can do no better than follow Dupin as to the authorship of these Homilies. He thinks
the style of Proclus (of Constantinople) may be detected in them, though the fourth is beyond
him for eloquence, and has even been thought worthy of St. Chrysostom. It was produced
after Nicæa, and probably after Ephesus, its somewhat exaggerated praises of the θεοτόκος
being unusual at an earlier period. The titles of these Homilies are the work of much later
editors; and interpolations probably occur frequently, by the same hands.</p>

<head>On All the Saints.591</head>
<p>Grant thy blessing, Lord.</p>
<p>It was my desire to be silent, and not to make a public592 display of the rustic rudeness
of my tongue. For silence is a matter of great consequence when one’s speech is mean.593
And to refrain from utterance is indeed an admirable thing, where there is lack of training;
and verily he is the highest philosopher who knows how to cover his ignorance by abstinence
from public address. Knowing, therefore, the feebleness of tongue proper to me, I should
have preferred such a course. Nevertheless the spectacle of the onlookers impels me to speak.
Since, then, this solemnity is a glorious one among our festivals, and the spectators form a
crowded gathering, and our assembly is one of elevated fervour in the faith, I shall face the
task of commencing an address with confidence.594 And this I may attempt all the more
boldly, since the Father595 requests me, and the Church is with me, and the sainted martyrs
with this object strengthen what is weak in me. For these have inspired aged men to accomplish
with much love a long course, and constrained them to support their failing steps by
the staff of the word;596 and they have stimulated women to finish their course like the
young men, and have brought to this, too, those of tender years, yea, even creeping children.
In this wise have the martyrs shown their power, leaping with joy in the presence of death,
laughing at the sword, making sport of the wrath of princes, grasping at death as the producer
of deathlessness, making victory their own by their fall, through the body taking their leap
to heaven, suffering their members to be scattered abroad in order that they might hold597
their souls, and, bursting the bars of life, that they might open the gates598 of heaven. And
if any one believes not that death is abolished, that Hades is trodden under foot, that the
chains thereof are broken, that the tyrant is bound, let him look on the martyrs disporting
themselves599 in the presence of death, and taking up the jubilant strain of the victory of

Christ. O the marvel! Since the hour when Christ despoiled Hades, men have danced in
triumph over death. “O death, where is thy sting! O grave, where is thy victory?”600 Hades
and the devil have been despoiled, and stripped of their ancient armour, and cast out of
their peculiar power. And even as Goliath had his head cut off with his own sword, so also
is the devil, who has been the father of death, put to rout through death; and he finds that
the selfsame thing which he was wont to use as the ready weapon of his deceit, has become
the mighty instrument of his own destruction. Yea, if we may so speak, casting his hook at
the Godhead, and seizing the wonted enjoyment of the baited pleasure, he is himself manifestly
caught while he deems himself the captor, and discovers that in place of the man he
has touched the God. By reason thereof do the martyrs leap upon the head of the dragon,
and despise every species of torment. For since the second Adam has brought up the first
Adam out of the deeps of Hades, as Jonah was delivered out of the whale, and has set forth
him who was deceived as a citizen of heaven to the shame of the deceiver, the gates of Hades
have been shut, and the gates of heaven have been opened, so as to offer an unimpeded entrance
to those who rise thither in faith. In olden time Jacob beheld a ladder erected reaching
to heaven, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it. But now, having been
made man for man’s sake, He who is the Friend of man has crushed with the foot of His
divinity him who is the enemy of man, and has borne up the man with the hand of His
Christhood,601 and has made the trackless ether to be trodden by the feet of man. Then the
angels were ascending and descending; but now the Angel of the great counsel neither ascendeth
nor descendeth: for whence or where shall He change His position, who is present
everywhere, and filleth all things, and holds in His hand the ends of the world? Once, indeed,
He descended, and once He ascended,—not, however, through any change602 of nature,
but only in the condescension603 of His philanthropic Christhood;604 and He is seated as
the Word with the Father, and as the Word He dwells in the womb, and as the Word He is
found everywhere, and is never separated from the God of the universe. Aforetime did the
devil deride the nature of man with great laughter, and he has had his joy over the times of
our calamity as his festal-days. But the laughter is only a three days’ pleasure, while the
wailing is eternal; and his great laughter has prepared for him a greater wailing and ceaseless
tears, and inconsolable weeping, and a sword in his heart. This sword did our Leader forge
against the enemy with fire in the virgin furnace, in such wise and after such fashion as He

willed, and gave it its point by the energy of His invincible divinity, and dipped it in the
water of an undefiled baptism, and sharpened it by sufferings without passion in them, and
made it bright by the mystical resurrection; and herewith by Himself He put to death the
vengeful adversary, together with his whole host. What manner of word, therefore, will express
our joy or his misery? For he who was once an archangel is now a devil; he who once
lived in heaven is now seen crawling like a serpent upon earth; he who once was jubilant
with the cherubim, is now shut up in pain in the guard-house of swine; and him, too, in
fine, shall we put to rout if we mind those things which are contrary to his choice, by the
grace and kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the power unto the
ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<p>The feast of All Saints is very ancient in the Oriental churches, and is assigned to the
Octave of Pentecost, the Anglican Trinity Sunday. See Neale, Eastern Church, vol. ii. pp. 734,
753. In the West it was instituted when Boniface III. (who accepted from the Emperor Phocas
the title of “Universal Bishop,” a.d. 607) turned the Pantheon into a church, and with a sort
of practical epigram called it the church of “All the Saints.” It was a local festival until the
ninth century, when the Emperor Louis the Pious introduced it into France and Germany.
Thence it came to England. It falls on the 1st of November.</p>
<p>The gates of the church at Rome are the same which once opened for the worship of
“all the gods.” They are of massive bronze, and are among the most interesting of the antiquities
of the city.</p>
<p>The modern gates of St. Peter’s, at Rome, are offensive copies of heathen mythology;
and among the subjects there represented, is the shameful tale of Leda,—a symbol of the

<head>On the Gospel According to Matthew.605</head>
<p>(Chapter VI. 22, 23.)</p>
<p>“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full
of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the
light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!”</p>
<p>The single eye is the love unfeigned; for when the body is enlightened by it, it sets forth
through the medium of the outer members only things which are perfectly correspondent
with the inner thoughts. But the evil eye is the pretended love, which is also called hypocrisy,
by which the whole body of the man is made darkness. We have to consider that deeds meet
only for darkness may be within the man, while through the outer members he may produce
words that seem to be of the light:606 for there are those who are in reality wolves, though
they may be covered with sheep’s clothing. Such are they who wash only the outside of the
cup and platter, and do not understand that, unless the inside of these things is cleansed,
the outside itself cannot be made pure. Wherefore, in manifest confutation of such persons,
the Saviour says: “If the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!” That
is to say, if the love which seems to thee to be light is really a work meet for darkness, by
reason of some hypocrisy concealed in thee, what must be thy patent transgressions!</p>

<head>Introductory Note
to
Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>[a.d. 200–265.] The great Origen had twin children in Gregory and Dionysius. Their
lives ran in parallel lines, and are said to have ended on the same day; and nobly did they
sustain the dignity and orthodoxy of the pre-eminent school which was soon to see its bright
peculiar star in Athanasius. Dionysius is supposed to have been a native of Alexandria, of
heathen parentage, and of a family possessed of wealth and honourable rank. Early in life
he seems to have been brought under the influence of certain presbyters; and a voice seemed
to speak to him in a vision607 encouraging him to “prove all things, and hold fast that which
is good.” We find him at the feet of Origen a diligent pupil, and afterwards, as a presbyter,
succeeding Heraclas (a.d. 232) as the head of the school, sitting in Origen’s seat. For about
fifteen years he further illuminated this illustrious chair; and then, in ripe years, about a.d.
246, he succeeded Heraclas again as bishop of Alexandria, at that time, beyond all comparison,
the greatest and the most powerful See of Christendom.</p>
<p>For a year or two he fed his flock in peace; but then troubles broke in upon his people,
even under the kindly reign of Philip. Things grew worse, till under Decius the eighth persecution
was let loose throughout the empire. Like Cyprian, Dionysius retired for a season,
upon like considerations, but not until he had been arrested and providentially delivered
from death in a singular manner. On returning to his work, he found the Church greatly
disturbed by the questions concerning the lapsed, with which Cyprian’s history has made
us acquainted. In the letter to Fabius will be found details of the earlier persecution, and in
that against Germanus are interesting facts of his own experience. The Epistle to the Alexandrians
contains very full particulars of the pestilence which succeeded these calamities;
and it is especially noteworthy as contrasting the humanity and benevolence of Christians
with the cruel and cowardly indifference of the pagans towards the dying and the dead.
Seditions and tumults followed, on which we have our author’s reflections in the Epistle to
Hierax, with not a few animated touches of description concerning the condition of Alexandria
after such desolations. In the affair of Cyprian with Stephen he stood by the great
Carthaginian doctor, and maintained the positions expressed in the letter of Firmilian.608
Wars, pestilences, and the irruptions of barbarians, make up the history of the residue of

the period, through which Dionysius was found a “burning and a shining light” to the
Church; his great influence extending throughout the East, and to the West also. I may leave
the residue of his story to the introductory remarks of the translator, and to his valuable
annotations, to which it will not be necessary for me to add many of my own. But I must
find room to express my admiration for his character, which was never found wanting amid
many terrible trials of character and of faith itself. His pen was never idle; his learning and
knowledge of the Scriptures are apparent, even in the fragments that have come down to
us; his fidelity to the traditions received from Origen and Heraclas are not less conspicuous;
and in all his dealings with his brethren of the East and West there reigns over his conduct
that pure spirit of the Gospel which proves that the virgin-age of the Church was not yet of
the past. A beautiful moderation and breadth of sympathy distinguish his episcopal utterances;
and, great as was his diocese, he seems equally devoid of prelatic pride and of that
wicked ambition which too soon after the martyr-ages proved the bane of the Church’s existence.
The following is the</p>
<p>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</p>
<p>For our knowledge of the career of this illustrious disciple of Origen we are indebted
chiefly to Eusebius, in the sixth and seventh books of his Historia Ecclesiastica, and in the
fourteenth book of his Præparatio Evangelica.609 He appears to have been the son of pagan
parents; but after studying the doctrines of various of the schools of philosophy, and coming
under the influence of Origen, to whom he had attached himself as a pupil, he was led to
embrace the Christian faith. This step was taken at an early period, and, as he informs us,
only after free examination and careful inquiry into the great systems of heathen belief. He
was made a presbyter in Alexandria after this decision; and on the elevation of Heraclas to
the bishopric of that city, Dionysius succeeded him in the presidency of the catechetical
school there about a.d. 232. After holding that position for some fifteen years Heraclas died,
and Dionysius was again chosen to be his successor; and ascending the episcopal throne of
Alexandria about a.d. 247 or 248, he retained that See till his death in the year 265. The
period of his activity as bishop was a time of great suffering and continuous anxiety; and
between the terrors of persecution on the one hand, and the cares of controversy on the
<note type="footnote">609 There are also passages, of larger or smaller extent, bearing upon his life and his literary activity, in Jerome
(De viris illustr., ch. 69; and Præfatio ad Lib., xviii., Comment. in Esaiam), Athanasius (De Sententia Dionysii,
and De Synodi Nicænæ Decretis), Basil (De Spiritu Sancto, ch. 29; Epist. ad Amphiloch., and Epist. ad Maximum).
Among modern authorities, we may refer specially to the Dissertation on his life and writings by S. de Magistris,
in the folio edition issued under his care in Greek and Latin at Rome in 1796; to the account given by Basnage
in the Histoire de l’Eglise, tome i. livre ii. ch. v. p. 68; to the complete collection of his extant works in Gallandi’s
Bibliotheca Patrum, iii. p. 481, etc.; as well as to the accounts in Cave’s Hist. Lit., i. p. 95, and elsewhere.</note>

other, he found little repose in his office. During the Decian persecution he was arrested
and hurried off by the soldiers to a small town named Taposiris, lying between Alexandria
and Canopus. But he was rescued from the peril of that seizure in a remarkably providential
manner, by a sudden rising of the people of the rural district through which he was carried.
Again, however, he was called to suffer, and that more severely, when the persecution under
Valerian broke out in the year 257. On making open confession of his faith on this occasion
he was banished, at a time when he was seriously ill, to Cephro, a wild and barren district
in Libya; and not until he had spent two or three years in exile there was he enabled to return
to Alexandria, in virtue of the edict of Gallienus. At various times he had to cope, too, with
the miseries of pestilence and famine and civil conflicts in the seat of his bishopric. In the
many ecclesiastical difficulties of his age he was also led to take a prominent part. When the
keen contest was waged on the subject of the rebaptism of recovered heretics about the year
256, the matter in dispute was referred by both parties to his judgment, and he composed
several valuable writings on the question. Then he was induced to enter the lists with the
Sabellians, and in the course of a lengthened controversy did much good service against
their tenets. The uncompromising energy of his opposition to that sect carried him, however,
beyond the bounds of prudence, so that he himself gave expression to opinions not easily
reconcilable with the common orthodox doctrine. For these he was called to account by
Dionysius bishop of Rome;610 and when a synod had been summoned to consider the case,
he promptly and humbly acknowledged the error into which his precipitate zeal had drawn
him. Once more, he was urged to give his help in the difficulty with Paul of Samosata. But
as the burden of years and infirmities made it impossible for him to attend the synod convened
at Antioch in 265 to deal with that troublesome heresiarch, he sent his opinion on
the subject of discussion in a letter to the council, and died soon after, towards the close of
the same year. The responsible duties of his bishopric had been discharged with singular
faithfulness and patience throughout the seventeen eventful years during which he occupied
the office. Among the ancients he was held in the highest esteem both for personal worth
and for literary usefulness; and it is related that there was a church dedicated to him in Alexandria.
One feature that appears very prominently in his character, is the spirit of independent
investigation which possessed him. It was only after candid examination of the
current philosophies that he was induced to become a Christian; and after his adoption of
the faith, he kept himself abreast of all the controversies of the time, and perused with an
impartial mind the works of the great heretics. He acted on this principle through his whole
course as a teacher, pronouncing against such writings only when he had made himself familiar
with their contents, and saw how to refute them. And we are told in Eusebius,611 that
<note type="footnote">610 [Not, however, as an inferior, but as one bishop in those days remonstrated with another, and as he
himself remonstrated with Stephen. See infra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">611 Hist. Eccl., viii. 7.</note>

<pb n="184"/>
when a certain presbyter once remonstrated with him on this subject, and warned him of
the injury he might do to his own soul by habituating himself to the perusal of these heterodox
productions, Dionysius was confirmed in his purpose by a vision and a voice which
were sent him, as he thought, from heaven to relieve him of all such fear, and to encourage
him to read and prove all that might come into his hand, because that method had been
from the very first the cause of faith to him. The moderation of his character, again, is not
less worthy of notice. In the case of the Novatian schism, while he was from the first decidedly
opposed to the principles of the party, he strove by patient and affectionate argumentation
to persuade the leader to submit. So, too, in the disputes on baptism we find him urgently
entreating the Roman bishop Stephen not to press matters to extremity with the Eastern
Church, nor destroy the peace she had only lately begun to enjoy. Again, in the chiliastic
difficulties excited by Nepos, and kept up by Coracion, we see him assembling all the parochial
clergy who held these opinions, and inviting all the laymen of the diocese also to attend
the conference, and discussing the question for three whole days with all these ministers,
considering their arguments, and meeting all their objections patiently by Scripture testimony,
until he persuades Coracion himself to retract, and receives the thanks of the pastors, and
restores unity of faith in his bishopric. On these occasions his mildness, and benignity, and
moderation stand out in bold relief; and on others we trace similar evidences of his broad
sympathies and his large and liberal spirit. He was possessed also of a remarkably fertile
pen; and the number of his theological writings, both formal treatises and more familiar
epistles, was very considerable. All these, however, have perished, with the exception of
what Eusebius and other early authors already referred to have preserved. The most important
of these compositions are the following: 1. A Treatise on the Promises, in two books, which
was written against Nepos, and of which Eusebius has introduced two pretty large extracts
into the third and seventh books of his History. 2. A Book on Nature, addressed to Timotheus,
in opposition to the Epicureans, of which we have some sections in the Præpar. Evangel. of
Eusebius. 3. A Work against the Sabellians, addressed to Dionysius bishop of Rome, in four
books or letters, in which he deals with his own unguarded statements in the controversy
with Sabellius, and of which certain portions have come down to us in Athanasius and Basil.
In addition to these, we possess a number of his epistles in whole or part, and a few exegetical
fragments. There is a Scholium in the Codex Amerbachianus which may be given
here:—It should be known that this sainted Dionysius became a hearer of Origen in the
fourth year of the reign of Philip, who succeeded Gordian in the empire. On the death of
Heraclas, the thirteenth bishop of the church of Alexandria, he was put in possession of the
headship of that church; and after a period of seventeen years, embracing the last three years
of the reign of Philip, and the one year of that of Decius, and the one year of Gallus and
Volusianus the son of Decius, and twelve years of the reigns of Valerian and his son Gallus
(Gallienus), he departed to the Lord. And Basilides was bishop of the parishes in the

<p>1. But as they produce a certain composition by Nepos,613 on which they insist very
strongly, as if it demonstrated incontestably that there will be a (temporal) reign of Christ
upon the earth, I have to say, that in many other respects I accept the opinion of Nepos, and
love him at once for his faith, and his laboriousness, and his patient study in the Scriptures,
as also for his great efforts in psalmody,614 by which even now many of the brethren are
<note type="footnote">612 In opposition to Noëtus, a bishop in Egypt. Eusebius, Hist. Eccl., vii. 24 and 25. Eusebius introduces this
extract in the following terms: “There are also two books of his on the subject of the promises. The occasion of
writing these was furnished by a certain Nepos, a bishop in Egypt, who taught that the promises which were
given to holy men in the sacred Scriptures were to be understood according to the Jewish sense of the same; and
affirmed that there would be some kind of a millennial period, plenished with corporeal delights, upon this
earth. And as he thought that he could establish this opinion of his by the Revelation of John, he had composed
a book on this question, entitled Refutation of the Allegorists. This, therefore, is sharply attacked by Dionysius
in his books on the Promises. And in the first of these books he states his own opinion on the subject; while in
the second he gives us a discussion on the Revelation of John, in the introduction to which he makes mention
of Nepos.” [Of this Noëtus, see the Philosophumena, vol. v., this series.]</note>
<note type="footnote">613 As it is clear from this passage that this work by Dionysius was written against Nepos, it is strange that,
in his preface to the eighteenth book of his Commentaries on Isaiah, Jerome should affirm it to have been
composed against Irenæus of Lyons. Irenæus was certainly of the number of those who held millennial views,
and who had been persuaded to embrace such by Papias, as Jerome himself tells us in the Catalogus and as Eusebius
explains towards the close of the third book of his History. But that this book by Dionysus was written
not against Irenæus but against Nepos, is evident, not only from this passage in Eusebius, but also from Jerome
himself, in his work On Ecclesiastical Writers, where he speaks of Dionysius.—Vales. [Compare (this series, infra)
the comments of Victorinus of Petau for a Western view of the millennial subject.]</note>

delighted. I hold the man, too, in deep respect still more, inasmuch as615 he has gone to his
rest before us. Nevertheless the truth is to be prized and reverenced above all things else.
And while it is indeed proper to praise and approve ungrudgingly anything that is said
aright, it is no less proper to examine and correct anything which may appear to have been
written unsoundly. If he had been present then himself, and had been stating his opinions
orally, it would have been sufficient to discuss the question together without the use of
writing, and to endeavour to convince the opponents, and carry them along by interrogation
and reply. But the work is published, and is, as it seems to some, of a very persuasive character;
and there are unquestionably some teachers, who hold that the law and the prophets
are of no importance, and who decline to follow the Gospels, and who depreciate the epistles
of the apostles, and who have also made large promises616 regarding the doctrine of this
composition, as though it were some great and hidden mystery, and who, at the same time,
do not allow that our simpler brethren have any sublime and elevated conceptions either
of our Lord’s appearing in His glory and His true divinity, or of our own resurrection from
the dead, and of our being gathered together to Him, and assimilated to Him, but, on the
contrary, endeavour to lead them to hope617 for things which are trivial and corruptible,
and only such as what we find at present in the kingdom of God. And since this is the case,
it becomes necessary for us to discuss this subject with our brother Nepos just as if he were
present.</p>
<note type="footnote">Eusebius bears witness to this in the end of the fifth book of his History. Mention is made of these psalms in the
Epistle of the Council of Antioch against Paul of Samosata, and in the penultimate canon of the Council of
Laodicea, where there is a clear prohibition of the use of ψαλμοὶ ἰδιωτικοί in the church, i.e., of psalms composed
by private individuals. For this custom had obtained great prevalence, so that many persons composed psalms
in honour of Christ, and got them sung in the church. It is psalms of this kind, consequently, that the Fathers
of the Council of Laodicea forbid to be sung thereafter in the church, designating them ἰδιωτικοί, i.e., composed
by unskilled men, and not dictated by the Holy Spirit. Thus is the matter explained by Agobardus in his book
De ritu canendi psalmos in Ecclesia.—Vales. [See vol. v., quotation from Pliny.]</note>

<p>2. After certain other matters, he adds the following statement:—Being then in the
Arsinoitic618 prefecture—where, as you are aware, this doctrine was current long ago, and
caused such division, that schisms and apostasies took place in whole churches—I called
together the presbyters and the teachers among the brethren in the villages, and those of
the brethren also who wished to attend were present. I exhorted them to make an investigation
into that dogma in public. Accordingly, when they had brought this book before us,
as though it were a kind of weapon or impregnable battlement, I sat with them for three
days in succession from morning till evening, and attempted to set them right on the subjects
propounded in the composition. Then, too, I was greatly gratified by observing the constancy
of the brethren, and their love of the truth, and their docility and intelligence, as we proceeded,
in an orderly method, and in a spirit of moderation, to deal with questions, and
difficulties, and concessions. For we took care not to press, in every way and with jealous
urgency, opinions which had once been adopted, even although they might appear to be
correct.619 Neither did we evade objections alleged by others; but we endeavoured as far as
possible to keep by the subject in hand, and to establish the positions pertinent to it. Nor,
again, were we ashamed to change our opinions, if reason convinced us, and to acknowledge
the fact; but rather with a good conscience, and in all sincerity, and with open hearts620
before God, we accepted all that could be established by the demonstrations and teachings
of the Holy Scriptures. And at last the author and introducer of this doctrine, whose name
was Coracion, in the hearing of all the brethren present, made acknowledgment of his position,
and engaged to us that he would no longer hold by his opinion, nor discuss it, nor
mention it, nor teach it, as he had been completely convinced by the arguments of those
opposed to it. The rest of the brethren, also, who were present, were delighted with the
conference, and with the conciliatory spirit and the harmony exhibited by all.</p>
<p>3. Then, a little further on, he speaks of the Revelation of John as follows:—Now some
before our time have set aside this book, and repudiated it entirely, criticising it chapter by
<note type="footnote">618 ἐν μὲν οὖν τῷ ᾽Αρσενοείτῃ. In the three codices here, as well as in Nicephorus and Ptolemy, we find this

Queen Arsinoe.—Vales.</note>
<note type="footnote">619 εἱ καὶ φαίνοιντο. There is another reading, εἱ καὶ μὴ φαίνοιντο, although they might not appear to be

chapter, and endeavouring to show it to be without either sense or reason. They have alleged
also that its title is false; for they deny that John is the author. Nay, further, they hold that
it can be no sort of revelation, because it is covered with so gross and dense a veil of ignorance.
They affirm, therefore, that none of the apostles, nor indeed any of the saints, nor any person
belonging to the Church, could be its author; but that Cerinthus,621 and the heretical sect
founded by him, and named after him the Cerinthian sect, being desirous of attaching the
authority of a great name to the fiction propounded by him, prefixed that title to the book.
For the doctrine inculcated by Cerinthus is this: that there will be an earthly reign of Christ;
and as he was himself a man devoted to the pleasures of the body, and altogether carnal in
his dispositions, he fancied622 that that kingdom would consist in those kinds of gratifications
on which his own heart was set,—to wit, in the delights of the belly, and what comes beneath
the belly, that is to say, in eating and drinking, and marrying, and in other things under the
guise of which he thought he could indulge his appetites with a better grace,623 such as
festivals, and sacrifices, and the slaying of victims. But I, for my part, could not venture to
set this book aside, for there are many brethren who value it highly. Yet, having formed an
idea of it as a composition exceeding my capacity of understanding, I regard it as containing
a kind of hidden and wonderful intelligence on the several subjects which come under it.
For though I cannot comprehend it, I still suspect that there is some deeper sense underlying
the words. And I do not measure and judge its expressions by the standard of my own
reason, but, making more allowance for faith, I have simply regarded them as too lofty for
my comprehension; and I do not forthwith reject what I do not understand, but I am only
the more filled with wonder at it, in that I have not been able to discern its import.624</p>
<p>4. After this, he examines the whole book of the Revelation; and having proved that it
cannot possibly be understood according to the bald, literal sense, he proceeds thus:—When
the prophet now has completed, so to speak, the whole prophecy, he pronounces those
blessed who should observe it, and names himself, too, in the number of the same: “For

is given in the mss., Cod. Maz., and Med., as also in Eusebius, iii. 28, and in Nicephorus, iii. 14. So Rufinus
renders it: et ut aliquid sacratius dicere videretur, legales aiebat festivitates rursum celebrandas. [These gross
views of millennial perfection entailed upon subsequent ages a reactionary neglect of the study of the Second

blessed,” says he, “is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book; and I John who
saw and heard these things.”625 That this person was called John, therefore, and that this
was the writing of a John, I do not deny. And I admit further, that it was also the work of
some holy and inspired man. But I could not so easily admit that this was the apostle, the
son of Zebedee, the brother of James, and the same person with him who wrote the Gospel
which bears the title according to John, and the catholic epistle. But from the character of
both, and the forms of expression, and the whole disposition and execution626 of the book,
I draw the conclusion that the authorship is not his. For the evangelist nowhere else subjoins
his name, and he never proclaims himself either in the Gospel or in the epistle.</p>
<p>And a little further on he adds:—John, moreover, nowhere gives us the name, whether
as of himself directly (in the first person), or as of another (in the third person). But the
writer of the Revelation puts himself forward at once in the very beginning, for he says: “The
Revelation of Jesus Christ, which He gave to him to show to His servants quickly; and He
sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John, who bare record of the Word of God,
and of his testimony, and of all things that he saw.”627 And then he writes also an epistle,
in which he says: “John to the seven churches which are in Asia, grace be unto you, and
peace.” The evangelist, on the other hand, has not prefixed his name even to the catholic
epistle; but without any circumlocution, he has commenced at once with the mystery of the
divine revelation itself in these terms: “That which was from the beginning, which we have
heard, which we have seen with our eyes.”628 And on the ground of such a revelation as
that the Lord pronounced Peter blessed, when He said: “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona;
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.”629
And again in the second epistle, which is ascribed to John, the apostle, and in the third,
though they are indeed brief, John is not set before us by name; but we find simply the anonymous
writing, “The elder.” This other author, on the contrary, did not even deem it
sufficient to name himself once, and then to proceed with his narrative; but he takes up his
name again, and says: “I John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation, and
in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos for the
Word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”630 And likewise toward the end he
speaks thus: “Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book; and I John

who saw these things and heard them.”631 That it is a John, then, that writes these things
we must believe, for he himself tells us.</p>
<p>5. What John this is, however, is uncertain. For he has not said, as he often does in the
Gospel, that he is the disciple beloved by the Lord, or the one that leaned on His bosom, or
the brother of James, or one that was privileged to see and hear the Lord. And surely he
would have given us some of these indications if it had been his purpose to make himself
clearly known. But of all this he offers us nothing; and he only calls himself our brother and
companion, and the witness of Jesus, and one blessed with the seeing and hearing of these
revelations. I am also of opinion that there were many persons of the same name with John
the apostle, who by their love for him, and their admiration and emulation of him, and their
desire to be loved by the Lord as he was loved, were induced to embrace also the same designation,
just as we find many of the children of the faithful called by the names of Paul and
Peter.632 There is, besides, another John mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, with the
surname Mark, whom Barnabas and Paul attached to themselves as companion, and of
whom again it is said: “And they had also John to their minister.”633 But whether this is the
one who wrote the Revelation, I could not say. For it is not written that he came with them
into Asia. But the writer says: “Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they
came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.”634 I
think, therefore, that it was some other one of those who were in Asia. For it is said that
there were two monuments in Ephesus, and that each of these bears the name of John.</p>
<note type="footnote">631 Rev. xxii. 7, 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">632 It is worth while to note this passage of Dionysius on the ancient practice of the Christians, in giving their
children the names of Peter and Paul, which they did both in order to express the honour and affection in which
they held these saints, and to secure that their children might be dear and acceptable to God, just as those saints
were. Hence it is that Chrysostom in his first volume, in his oration on St. Meletius, says that the people of Antioch
had such love and esteem for Meletius, that the parents called their children by his name, in order that
they might have their homes adorned by his presence. And the same Chrysostom, in his twenty-first homily on
Genesis, exhorts his hearers not to call their children carelessly by the names of their grandfathers, or greatgrandfathers,
or men of fame; but rather by the names of saintly men, who have been shining patterns of virtue,
in order that the children might be fired with the desire of virtue by their example.—Vales. [A chapter in the
history of civilization might here be given on the origin of Christian names and on the motives which should
influence Christians in the bestowal of names. The subject is treated, after Plato, by De Maistre.]</note>

<p>6. And from the ideas, and the expressions, and the collocation of the same, it may be
very reasonably conjectured that this one is distinct from that.635 For the Gospel and the
Epistle agree with each other, and both commence in the same way. For the one opens thus,
“In the beginning was the Word;” while the other opens thus, “That which was from the
beginning.” The one says: “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we
beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father.”636 The other says the
same things, with a slight alteration: “That which we have heard, which we have seen with
our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life: and
the life was manifested.”637 For these things are introduced by way of prelude, and in opposition,
as he has shown in the subsequent parts, to those who deny that the Lord is come in
the flesh. For which reason he has also been careful to add these words: “And that which
we have seen we testify, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and
was manifested unto us: that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.”638 Thus
he keeps to himself, and does not diverge inconsistently from his subjects, but goes through
them all under the same heads and in the same phraseologies, some of which we shall briefly
mention. Thus the attentive reader will find the phrases, “the life,” “the light,” occurring
often in both; and also such expressions as fleeing from darkness, holding the truth, grace,
joy, the flesh and the blood of the Lord, the judgment, the remission of sins, the love of God
toward us, the commandment of love on our side toward each other; as also, that we ought
to keep all the commandments, the conviction of the world, of the devil, of Antichrist, the
promise of the Holy Spirit, the adoption of God, the faith required of us in all things, the
Father and the Son, named as such everywhere. And altogether, through their whole course,
it will be evident that the Gospel and the Epistle are distinguished by one and the same
character of writing. But the Revelation is totally different, and altogether distinct from this;
and I might almost say that it does not even come near it, or border upon it. Neither does
<note type="footnote">635 This is the second argument by which Dionysius reasoned that the Revelation and the Gospel of John
are not by one author. For the first argument he used in proof of this is drawn from the character and usage of
the two writers; and this argument Dionysius has prosecuted up to this point. Now, however, he adduces a
second argument, drawn from the words and ideas of the two writers, and from the collocation of the expressions.
For, with Cicero, I thus interpret the word σύνταξιν. See the very elegant book of Dionysius Hal. entitled Περὶ
συντάξεως ὀνομάτων—On the Collocation of Names; although in this passage σύνταξις appears to comprehend
the disposition of sentences as well as words. Further, from this passage we can see what experience Dionysius
had in criticism; for it is the critic’s part to examine the writings of the ancients, and distinguish what is genuine
and authentic from what is spurious and counterfeit.—Vales.</note>

it contain a syllable in common with these other books. Nay more, the Epistle—for I say
nothing of the Gospel—does not make any mention or evince any notion of the Revelation
and the Revelation, in like manner, gives no note of the Epistle. Whereas Paul gives some
indication of his revelations in his epistles; which revelations, however, he has not recorded
in writing by themselves.</p>
<p>7. And furthermore, on the ground of difference in diction, it is possible to prove a
distinction between the Gospel and the Epistle on the one hand, and the Revelation on the
other. For the former are written not only without actual error as regards the Greek language,
but also with the greatest elegance, both in their expressions and in their reasonings, and
in the whole structure of their style. They are very far indeed from betraying any barbarism
or solecism, or any sort of vulgarism, in their diction. For, as might be presumed, the writer
possessed the gift of both kinds of discourse,639 the Lord having bestowed both these capacities
upon him, viz., that of knowledge and that of expression. That the author of the latter,
however, saw a revelation, and received knowledge and prophecy, I do not deny. Only I
perceive that his dialect and language are not of the exact Greek type, and that he employs
barbarous idioms, and in some places also solecisms. These, however, we are under no necessity
of seeking out at present. And I would not have any one suppose that I have said
these things in the spirit of ridicule; for I have done so only with the purpose of setting right
this matter of the dissimilarity subsisting between these writings.640</p>
<note type="footnote">639 The old reading was, τὸν λόγον, τὴν γνῶσιν. Valesius expunges the τὴν γνῶσιν, as disturbing the sense,

editor adopts τόν τε τῆς γνώσεως, τόν τε τῆς φράσεως, which is the reading of various manuscripts, and is accepted
in the translation. Valesius understands that by the ἑκάτερον λόγον Dionysus means the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος

<p>I. In Opposition to Those of the School of Epicurus Who Deny the Existence of a
Providence, and Refer the Constitution of the Universe to Atomic Bodies.</p>
<p>Is the universe one coherent whole, as it seems to be in our own judgment, as well as in
that of the wisest of the Greek philosophers, such as Plato and Pythagoras, and the Stoics
and Heraclitus? or is it a duality, as some may possibly have conjectured? or is it indeed
something manifold and infinite, as has been the opinion of certain others who, with a
variety of mad speculations and fanciful usages of terms, have sought to divide and resolve
the essential matter642 of the universe, and lay down the position that it is infinite and unoriginated,
and without the sway of Providence?643 For there are those who, giving the name
of atoms to certain imperishable and most minute bodies which are supposed to be infinite
in number, and positing also the existence of a certain vacant space of an unlimited vastness,
allege that these atoms, as they are borne along casually in the void, and clash all fortuitously
against each other in an unregulated whirl, and become commingled one with another in
a multitude of forms, enter into combination with each other, and thus gradually form this
world and all objects in it; yea, more, that they construct infinite worlds. This was the
opinion of Epicurus and Democritus; only they differed in one point, in so far as the former
supposed these atoms to be all most minute and consequently imperceptible, while Democritus
held that there were also some among them of a very large size. But they both hold
that such atoms do exist, and that they are so called on account of their indissoluble consistency.
There are some, again, who give the name of atoms to certain bodies which are indivisible
into parts, while they are themselves parts of the universe, out of which in their undivided
state all things are made up, and into which they are dissolved again. And the allegation
is, that Diodorus was the person who gave them their names as bodies indivisible into

<head>II. A Refutation of This Dogma on the Ground of Familiar Human Analogies.</head>
<p>How, shall we bear with these men who assert that all those wise, and consequently also
noble, constructions (in the universe) are only the works of common chance? those objects,
I mean, of which each taken by itself as it is made, and the whole system collectively, were
seen to be good by Him by whose command they came into existence. For, as it is said, “God
saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.”647 But truly these men
do not reflect on648 the analogies even of small familiar things which might come under
their observation at any time, and from which they might learn that no object of any utility,
and fitted to be serviceable, is made without design or by mere chance, but is wrought by
skill of hand, and is contrived so as to meet its proper use. And when the object falls out of
service and becomes useless, then it also begins to break up indeterminately, and to decompose
and dissipate its materials in every casual and unregulated way, just as the wisdom by
which it was skilfully constructed at first no longer controls and maintains it. For a cloak,
for example, cannot be made without the weaver, as if the warp could be set aright and the
woof could be entwined with it by their own spontaneous action; while, on the other hand,
if it is once worn out, its tattered rags are flung aside. Again, when a house or a city is built,
it does not take on its stones, as if some of them placed themselves spontaneously upon the
foundations, and others lifted themselves up on the several layers, but the builder carefully
disposes the skilfully prepared stones in their proper positions; while if the structure happens
once to give way, the stones are separated and cast down and scattered about. And so, too,
when a ship is built, the keel does not lay itself, neither does the mast erect itself in the centre,
nor do all the other timbers take up their positions casually and by their own motion. Nor,
again, do the so-called hundred beams in the wain fit themselves spontaneously to the vacant
spaces they severally light on. But the carpenter in both cases puts the materials together in
the right way and at the right time.649 And if the ship goes to sea and is wrecked, or if the
wain drives along on land and is shattered, their timbers are broken up and cast abroad
anywhere,—those of the former by the waves, and those of the latter by the violence of the
impetus. In like manner, then, we might with all propriety say also to these men, that those
atoms of theirs, which remain idle and unmanipulated and useless, are introduced vainly.
Let them, accordingly, seek for themselves to see into what is beyond the reach of sight, and
conceive what is beyond the range of conception;650 unlike him who in these terms confesses

<p>Or who can bear to hear it maintained, that this mighty habitation, which is constituted
of heaven and earth, and which is called “Cosmos” on account of the magnitude and the
plenitude of the wisdom which has been brought to bear upon it, has been established in
all its order and beauty by those atoms which hold their course devoid of order and beauty,
and that that same state of disorder has grown into this true Cosmos, Order? Or who can
believe that those regular movements and courses are the products of a certain unregulated
impetus? Or who can allow that the perfect concord subsisting among the celestial bodies
derives its harmony from instruments destitute both of concord and harmony? Or, again,
if there is but one and the same substance654 in all things, and if there is the same incorruptible
nature655 in all,—the only elements of difference being, as they aver, size and figure,—
how comes it that there are some bodies divine and perfect,656 and eternal,657 as they
would phrase it, or lasting,658 as some one may prefer to express it; and among these some
that are visible and others that are invisible,—the visible including such as sun, and moon,
and stars, and earth, and water; and the invisible including gods, and demons, and spirits?
For the existence of such they cannot possibly deny however desirous to do so. And again,
there are other objects that are long-lived, both animals and plants. As to animals, there are,
for example, among birds, as they say, the eagle, the raven, and the phoenix; and among
creatures living on land, there are the stag, and the elephant, and the dragon; and among
aquatic creatures there are the whales, and such like monsters of the deep. And as to trees,
there are the palm, and the oak, and the persea;659 and among trees, too, there are some
that are evergreens, of which kind fourteen have been reckoned up by some one; and there
are others that only bloom for a certain season, and then shed their leaves. And there are
other objects, again—which indeed constitute the vast mass of all which either grow or are
begotten—that have an early death and a brief life. And among these is man himself, as a
certain holy scripture says of him: “Man that is born of woman is of few days.”660 Well, but
I suppose they will reply that the varying conjunctions of the atoms account fully for differences661
so great in the matter of duration. For it is maintained that there are some things

that are compressed together by them, and firmly interlaced, so that they become closely
compacted bodies, and consequently exceedingly hard to break up; while there are others
in which more or less the conjunction of the atoms is of a looser and weaker nature, so that
either quickly or after some time they separate themselves from their orderly constitution.
And, again, there are some bodies made up of atoms of a definite kind and a certain common
figure, while there are others made up of diverse atoms diversely disposed. But who, then,
is the sagacious discriminator,662 that brings certain atoms into collocation, and separates
others; and marshals some in such wise as to form the sun, and others in such a way as to
originate the moon, and adapts all in natural fitness, and in accordance with the proper
constitution of each star? For surely neither would those solar atoms, with their peculiar
size and kind, and with their special mode of collocation, ever have reduced themselves so
as to effect the production of a moon; nor, on the other hand, would the conjunctions of
these lunar atoms ever have developed into a sun. And as certainly neither would Arcturus,
resplendent as he is, ever boast his having the atoms possessed by Lucifer, nor would the
Pleiades glory in being constituted of those of Orion. For well has Paul expressed the distinction
when he says: “There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another
glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.”663 And if the coalition
effected among them has been an unintelligent one, as is the case with soulless664 objects,
then they must needs have had some sagacious artificer; and if their union has been one
without the determination of will, and only of necessity, as is the case with irrational objects,
then some skilful leader665 must have brought them together and taken them under his
charge. And if they have linked themselves together spontaneously, for a spontaneous work,
then some admirable architect must have apportioned their work for them, and assumed
the superintendence among them; or there must have been one to do with them as the
general does who loves order and discipline, and who does not leave his army in an irregular
condition, or suffer all things to go on confusedly, but marshals the cavalry in their proper
succession, and disposes the heavy-armed infantry in their due array, and the javelin-men
by themselves, and the archers separately, and the slingers in like manner, and sets each
force in its appropriate position, in order that all those equipped in the same way may engage
together. But if these teachers think that this illustration is but a joke, because I institute a
comparison between very large bodies and very small, we may pass to the very smallest.</p>

motion of the stream in which they move, and convey themselves safely through the mighty
uproar of the collisions, and if like atoms meet and group themselves with like, not as being
brought together by God, according to the poet’s fancy, but rather as naturally recognising
the affinities subsisting between each other, then truly we have here a most marvellous
democracy of atoms, wherein friends welcome and embrace friends, and all are eager to
sojourn together in one domicile; while some by their own determination have rounded
themselves off into that mighty luminary the sun, so as to make day; and others have formed
themselves into many pyramids of blazing stars, it may be, so as to crown also the whole
heavens; and others have reduced themselves into the circular figure, so as to impart a certain
solidity to the ether, and arch it over, and constitute it a vast graduated ascent of luminaries,
with this object also, that the various conventions of the commoner atoms may select settlements
for themselves, and portion out the sky among them for their habitations and stations.</p>
<p>Then, after certain other matters, the discourse proceeds thus:—But inconsiderate men
do not see even things that are apparent, and certainly they are far from being cognisant of
things that are unapparent. For they do not seem even to have any notion of those regulated
risings and settings of the heavenly bodies,—those of the sun, with all their wondrous glory,
no less than those of the others; nor do they appear to make due application of the aids
furnished through these to men, such as the day that rises clear for man’s work, and the
night that overshadows earth for man’s rest. “For man,” it is said, “goeth forth unto his
work, and to his labour, until the evening.”666 Neither do they consider that other revolution,
by which the sun makes out for us determinate times, and convenient seasons, and regular
successions, directed by those atoms of which it consists. But even though men like
these—and miserable men they are, however they may believe themselves to be righteous—
may choose not to admit it, there is a mighty Lord that made the sun, and gave it the
impetus667 for its course by His words. O ye blind ones, do these atoms of yours bring you
the winter season and the rains, in order that the earth may yield food for you, and for all
creatures living on it? Do they introduce summertime, too, in order that ye may gather their
fruits from the trees for your enjoyment? And why, then, do ye not worship these atoms,
and offer sacrifices to them as the guardians of earth’s fruits?668 Thankless surely are ye, in
not setting solemnly apart for them even the most scanty first-fruits of that abundant bounty
which ye receive from them.</p>

stituted, have marked off by a kind of covenant the tracts for their several possessions, portioning
these out like colonies and governments, but without the presidency of any founder
or house-master; and with pledged fealty and in peace they respect the laws of vicinity with
their neighbours, and abstain from passing beyond the boundaries which they received at
the outset, just as if they enjoyed the legislative administration of true princes in the atoms.
Nevertheless these atoms exercise no rule. For how could these, that are themselves nothing,
do that? But listen to the divine oracles: “The works of the Lord are in judgment; from the
beginning, and from His making of them, He disposed the parts thereof. He garnished His
works for ever, and their principles669 unto their generations.”670</p>
<p>Again, after a little, he proceeds thus:—Or what phalanx ever traversed the plain in such
perfect order, no trooper outmarching the others, or falling out of rank, or obstructing the
course, or suffering himself to be distanced by his comrades in the array, as is the case with
that steady advance in regular file, as it were, and with close-set shields, which is presented
by this serried and unbroken and undisturbed and unobstructed progress of the hosts of
the stars? Albeit by side inclinations and flank movements certain of their revolutions become
less clear. Yet, however that may be, they assuredly always keep their appointed periods,
and again bear onward determinately to the positions from which they have severally risen,
as if they made that their deliberate study. Wherefore let these notable anatomizers of
atoms,671 these dividers of the indivisible, these compounders of the uncompoundable,
these adepts in the apprehension of the infinite, tell us whence comes this circular march
and course of the heavenly bodies, in which it is not any single combination of atoms that
merely chances all unexpectedly to swing itself round in this way;672 but it is one vast circular
choir that moves thus, ever equally and concordantly, and whirls in these orbits. And whence
comes it that this mighty multitude of fellow-travellers, all unmarshalled by any captain, all
ungifted with any determination of will, and all unendowed with any knowledge of each
other, have nevertheless held their course in perfect harmony? Surely, well has the prophet
ranked this matter among things which are impossible and undemonstrable,—namely, that
two strangers should walk together. For he says, “Shall two come to the same lodging unless
they know each other?”673</p>

<p>Further, those men understand neither themselves nor what is proper to themselves.
For if any of the leaders in this impious doctrine only considered what manner of person
he is himself, and whence he comes, he would surely be led to a wise decision, like one who
has obtained understanding of himself, and would say, not to these atoms, but to his Father
and Maker, “Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.”674 And he would take up, too,
this wonderful account of his formation as it has been given by one of old: “Hast Thou not
poured me out as milk, and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and Thy
visitation hath preserved my spirit.”675 For of what quantity and of what origin were the
atoms which the father of Epicurus gave forth from himself when he begat Epicurus? And
how, when they were received within his mother’s womb, did they coalesce, and take form
and figure? and how were they put in motion and made to increase? And how did that little
seed of generation draw together the many atoms that were to constitute Epicurus, and
change some of them into skin and flesh for a covering, and make bone of others for erectness
and strength, and form sinews of others for compact contexture? And how did it frame and
adapt the many other members and parts—heart and bowels, and organs of sense, some
within and some without—by which the body is made a thing of life? For of all these things
there is not one either idle or useless: not even the meanest of them—the hair, or the nails,
or such like—is so; but all have their service to do, and all their contribution to make, some
of them to the soundness of bodily constitution, and others of them to beauty of appearance.
For Providence cares not only for the useful, but also for the seasonable and beautiful.676
Thus the hair is a kind of protection and covering for the whole head, and the beard is a
seemly ornament for the philosopher. It was Providence, then, that formed the constitution
of the whole body of man, in all its necessary parts, and imposed on all its members their
due connection with each other, and measured out for them their liberal supplies from the
universal resources. And the most prominent of these show clearly, even to the uninstructed,
by the proof of personal experience, the value and service attaching to them: the head, for
example, in the position of supremacy, and the senses set like a guard about the brain, as
the ruler in the citadel; and the advancing eyes, and the reporting ears; and the taste which,

and the touch, which manipulates all put under it.</p>
<p>Hence we shall only run over in a summary way, at present, some few of the works of
an all-wise Providence; and after a little we shall, if God grant it, go over them more minutely,
when we direct our discourse toward one who has the repute of greater learning. So, then,
we have the ministry of the hands, by which all kinds of works are wrought, and all skilful
professions practised, and which have all their various faculties furnished them, with a view
to the discharge of one common function; and we have the shoulders, with their capacity
for bearing burdens; and the fingers, with their power of grasping; and the elbows, with
their faculty of bending, by which they can turn inwardly, upon the body, or take an outward
inclination, so as to be able either to draw objects toward the body, or to thrust them away
from it. We have also the service of the feet, by which the whole terrestrial creation is made
to come under our power, the earth itself is traversed thereby, the sea is made navigable,
the rivers are crossed, and intercourse is established for all with all things. The belly, too, is
the storehouse of meats, with all its parts arranged in their proper collocations, so that it
apportions for itself the right measure of aliment, and ejects what is over and above that.
And so is it with all the other things by which manifestly the due administration of the
constitution of man is wisely secured.678 Of all these, the intelligent and the unintelligent
alike enjoy the same use; but they have not the same comprehension of them.679 For there
are some who refer this whole economy to a power which they conceive to be a true divinity,
680 and which they apprehend as at once the highest intelligence in all things, and the
best benefactor to themselves, believing that this economy is all the work of a wisdom and
a might which are superior to every other, and in themselves truly divine. And there are
others who aimlessly attribute this whole structure of most marvellous beauty to chance
and fortuitous coincidence. And in addition to these, there are also certain physicians, who,

having made a more effective examination into all these things, and having investigated
with utmost accuracy the disposition of the inward parts in especial, have been struck with
astonishment at the results of their inquiry, and have been led to deify nature itself. The
notions of these men we shall review afterwards, as far as we may be able, though we may
only touch the surface of the subject.681 Meantime, to deal with this matter generally and
summarily, let me ask who constructed this whole tabernacle of ours, so lofty, erect, graceful,
sensitive, mobile, active, and apt for all things? Was it, as they say, the irrational multitude
of atoms? Nay, these, by their conjunctions, could not mould even an image of clay, neither
could they hew and polish a statue of stone; nor could they cast and finish an idol of silver
or gold; but arts and handicrafts calculated for such operations have been discovered by
men who fabricate these objects.682 And if, even in these, representations and models cannot
be made without the aid of wisdom, how can the genuine and original patterns of these
copies have come into existence spontaneously? And whence have come the soul, and the
intelligence, and the reason, which are born with the philosopher? Has he gathered these
from those atoms which are destitute alike of soul, and intelligence, and reason? and has
each of these atoms inspired him with some appropriate conception and notion? And are
we to suppose that the wisdom of man was made up by these atoms, as the myth of Hesiod
tells us that Pandora was fashioned by the gods? Then shall the Greeks have, to give up
speaking of the various species of poetry, and music, and astronomy, and geometry, and all
the other arts and sciences, as the inventions and instructions of the gods, and shall have to
allow that these atoms are the only muses with skill and wisdom for all subjects. For this
theogony, constructed of atoms by Epicurus, is indeed something extraneous to the infinite
worlds of order,683 and finds its refuge in the infinite disorder.684</p>

<head>V. That to Work is Not a Matter of Pain and Weariness to God.</head>
<p>Now to work, and administer, and do good, and exercise care, and such like actions,
may perhaps be hard tasks for the idle, and silly, and weak, and wicked; in whose number
truly Epicurus reckons himself, when he propounds such notions about the gods. But to
the earnest, and powerful, and intelligent, and prudent, such as philosophers ought to
be—and how much more so, therefore, the gods!—these things are not only not disagreeable
and irksome, but ever the most delightful, and by far the most welcome of all. To persons
of this character, negligence and procrastination in the doing of what is good are a reproach,
as the poet admonishes them in these words of counsel:—</p>
<p>“Delay not aught till the morrow.”685</p>
<p>And then he adds this further sentence of threatening:—</p>
<p>“The lazy procrastinator is ever wrestling with miseries.”686</p>
<p>And the prophet teaches us the same lesson in a more solemn fashion, and declares that
deeds done according to the standard of virtue are truly worthy of God,687 and that the man
who gives no heed to these is accursed: “For cursed be he that doeth the works of the Lord
carelessly.”688 Moreover, those who are unversed in any art, and unable to prosecute it
perfectly, feel it to be wearisome when they make their first attempts in it, just by reason of
the novelty689 of their experience, and their want of practice in the works. But those, on the
other hand, who have made some advance, and much more those who are perfectly trained
in the art, accomplish easily and successfully the objects of their labours, and have great
pleasure in the work, and would choose rather thus, in the discharge of the pursuits to which
they are accustomed, to finish and carry perfectly out what their efforts aim at, than to be
made masters of all those things which are reckoned advantageous among men. Yea,
Democritus himself, as it is reported, averred that he would prefer the discovery of one true
cause to being put in possession of the kingdom of Persia. And that was the declaration of
a man who had only a vain and groundless conception of the causes of things,690 inasmuch
as he started with an unfounded principle, and an erroneous hypothesis, and did not discern
the real root and the common law of necessity in the constitution of natural things, and held

as the greatest wisdom the apprehension of things that come about simply in an unintelligent
and random way, and set up chance691 as the mistress and queen of things universal, and
even things divine, and endeavoured to demonstrate that all things happen by the determination
of the same, although at the same time he kept it outside the sphere of the life of
men, and convicted those of senselessness who worshipped it. At any rate, at the very beginning
of his Precepts692he speaks thus: “Men have made an image693 of chance, as a cover694
for their own lack of knowledge. For intellect and chance are in their very nature antagonistic
to each other.695 And men have maintained that this greatest adversary to intelligence
is its sovereign. Yea, rather, they completely subvert and do away with the one, while they
establish the other in its place. For they do not celebrate intelligence as the fortunate,696 but
they laud chance697 as the most intelligent.”698 Moreover, those who attend to things conducing
to the good of life, take special pleasure in what serves the interests of those of the
same race with themselves, and seek the recompense of praise and glory in return for labours
undertaken in behalf of the general good; while some exert themselves as purveyors of ways
and means,699 others as magistrates, others as physicians, others as statesmen; and even
philosophers pride themselves greatly in their efforts after the education of men. Will, then,
Epicurus or Democritus be bold enough to assert that in the exertion of philosophizing they
only cause distress to themselves? Nay, rather they will reckon this a pleasure of mind second
to none. For even though they maintain the opinion that the good is pleasure, they will be
ashamed to deny that philosophizing is the greater pleasure to them.700 But as to the gods,
of whom the poets among them sing that they are the “bestowers of good gifts,”701 these
philosophers scoffingly celebrate them in strains like these: “The gods are neither the bestowers
nor the sharers in any good thing.” And in what manner, forsooth, can they
demonstrate that there are gods at all, when they neither perceive their presence, nor discern
them as the doers of aught, wherein, indeed, they resemble those who, in their admiration

and wonder at the sun and the moon and the stars, have held these to have been named
gods,702 from their running703 such courses: when, further, they do not attribute to them
any function or power of operation,704 so as to hold them gods705 from their constituting,706
that is, from their making objects,707 for thereby in all truth the one maker and operator of
all things must be God: and when, in fine, they do not set forth any administration, or
judgment, or beneficence of theirs in relation to men, so that we might be bound either by
fear or by reverence to worship them? Has Epicurus then been able, forsooth, to see beyond
this world, and to overpass the precincts of heaven? or has he gone forth by some secret
gates known to himself alone, and thus obtained sight of the gods in the void?708 and,
deeming them blessed in their full felicity, and then becoming himself a passionate aspirant
after such pleasure, and an ardent scholar in that life which they pursue in the void, does
he now call upon all to participate in this felicity, and urge them thus to make themselves
like the gods, preparing709 as their true symposium of blessedness neither heaven nor
Olympus, as the poets feign, but the sheer void, and setting before them the ambrosia of
atoms,710 and pledging them in711 nectar made of the same? However, in matters which
have no relation to us, he introduces into his books a myriad oaths and solemn asseverations,
swearing constantly both negatively and affirmatively by Jove, and making those whom he
meets, and with whom he discusses his doctrines, swear also by the gods, not certainly that
he fears them himself, or has any dread of perjury, but that he pronounces all this to be vain,
and false, and idle, and unintelligible, and uses it simply as a kind of accompaniment to his
words, just as he might also clear his throat, or spit, or twist his face, or move his hand. So
completely senseless and empty a pretence was this whole matter of the naming of the gods,
in his estimation. But this is also a very patent fact, that, being in fear of the Athenians after
(the warning of) the death of Socrates, and being desirous of preventing his being taken for
what he really was—an atheist—the subtle charlatan invented for them certain empty
shadows of unsubstantial gods. But never surely did he look up to heaven with eyes of true
intelligence, so as to hear the clear voice from above, which another attentive spectator did

<head>III.—From the Books Against Sabellius.718 On the Notion that Matter is Ungenerated.
719</head>
<p>These certainly are not to be deemed pious who hold that matter is ungenerated, while
they allow, indeed, that it is brought under the hand of God so far as its arrangement and
regulation are concerned; for they do admit that, being naturally passive720 and pliable, it
yields readily to the alterations impressed upon it by God. It is for them, however, to show
us plainly how it can possibly be that the like and the unlike should be predicated as subsisting
together in God and matter. For it becomes necessary thus to think of one as a superior to
either, and that is a thought which cannot legitimately be entertained with regard to God.
For if there is this defect of generation which is said to be the thing like in both, and if there
is this point of difference which is conceived of besides in the two, whence has this arisen
in them? If, indeed, God is the ungenerated, and if this defect of generation is, as we may
say, His very essence, then matter cannot be ungenerated; for God and matter are not one
and the same. But if each subsists properly and independently—namely, God and matter—
and if the defect of generation also belongs to both, then it is evident that there is
something different from each, and older and higher than both. But the difference of their
contrasted constitutions is completely subversive of the idea that these can subsist on an
equality together, and more, that this one of the two—namely, matter—can subsist of itself.
For then they will have to furnish an explanation of the fact that, though both are supposed
to be ungenerated, God is nevertheless impassible, immutable, imperturbable, energetic;
while matter is the opposite, impressible, mutable, variable, alterable. And now, how can
these properties harmoniously co-exist and unite? Is it that God has adapted Himself to the
nature of the matter, and thus has skilfully wrought it? But it would be absurd to suppose
that God works in gold, as men are wont to do, or hews or polishes stone, or puts His hand
to any of the other arts by which different kinds of matter are made capable of receiving
form and figure. But if, on the other hand, He has fashioned matter according to His own
will, and after the dictates of His own wisdom, impressing upon it the rich and manifold
forms produced by His own operation, then is this account of ours one both good and true,
<note type="footnote">718 In Eusebius, Præpar. Evangel., book vii. ch. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">719 Eusebius introduces this extract thus: “And I shall adduce the words of those who have most thoroughly
examined the dogma before us, and first of all Dionysius indeed, who, in the first book of his Exercitations

refutation of Sabellianism, and see (vol. v.) the story of Callistus.]</note>

and still further one that establishes the position that the ungenerated God is the hypostasis
(the life and foundation) of all things in the universe. For with this fact of the defect of
generation it conjoins the proper mode of His being. Much, indeed, might be said in confutation
of these teachers, but that is not what is before us at present. And if they are put
alongside the most impious polytheists,721 these will seem the more pious in their speech.</p>

<head>From the First Book.</head>
<p>1. There certainly was not a time when God was not the Father.723</p>
<p>2. Neither, indeed, as though He had not brought forth these things, did God afterwards
beget the Son, but because the Son has existence not from Himself, but from the Father.
And after a few words he says of the Son Himself:—</p>
<p>3. Being the brightness of the eternal Light, He Himself also is absolutely eternal. For
since light is always in existence, it is manifest that its brightness also exists, because light
is perceived to exist from the fact that it shines, and it is impossible that light should not
shine. And let us once more come to illustrations. If the sun exists, there is also day; if
nothing of this be manifest, it is impossible that the sun should be there. If then the sun
were eternal, the day would never end; but now, for such is not really the state of the case,
the day begins with the beginning of the sun, and ends with its ending. But God is the
eternal Light, which has neither had a beginning, nor shall ever fail. Therefore the eternal
brightness shines forth before Him, and co-exists with Him, in that, existing without a beginning,
and always begotten, He always shines before Him; and He is that Wisdom which
says, “I was that wherein He delighted, and I was daily His delight before His face at all
times.”724</p>
<p>And a little after he thus pursues his discourse from the same point:—</p>
<p>4. Since, therefore, the Father is eternal, the Son also is eternal, Light of Light. For where
there is the begetter, there is also the offspring. And if there is no offspring, how and of what
can He be the begetter? But both are, and always are. Since, then, God is the Light, Christ
is the Brightness. And since He is a Spirit—for says He, “God is a Spirit”725—fittingly again
is Christ called Breath; for “He,”726 saith He, “is the breath of God’s power.”727
And again he says:—</p>

subjoined, are in no wise discrepant from this view, because I brought forward as
an illustration human offspring, which assuredly is of the same kind as the begetter; and I
said that parents are absolutely distinguished from their children by the fact alone that they
themselves are not their children, or that it would assuredly be a matter of necessity that
there would neither be parents nor children. But, as I said before, I have not the letter in my
possession, on account of the present condition of affairs; otherwise I would have sent you
the very words that I then wrote, yea, and a copy of the whole letter, and I will send it if at
any time I shall have the opportunity. I remember, further, that I added many similitudes
from things kindred to one another. For I said that the plant, whether it grows up from seed
or from a root, is different from that whence it sprouted, although it is absolutely of the
same nature; and similarly, that a river flowing from a spring takes another form and name:
for that neither is the spring called the river, nor the river the spring, but that these are two
things, and that the spring indeed is, as it were, the father, while the river is the water from
the spring. But they feign that they do not see these things and the like to them which are
written, as if they were blind; but they endeavour to assail me from a distance with expressions
too carelessly used, as if they were stones, not observing that on things of which they are
ignorant, and which require interpretation to be understood, illustrations that are not only
remote, but even contrary, will often throw light.</p>

<p>7. It was said above that God is the spring of all good things, but the Son was called the
river flowing from Him; because the word is an emanation of the mind, and—to speak after
human fashion—is emitted from the heart by the mouth. But the mind which springs forth
by the tongue is different from the word which exists in the heart. For this latter, after it has
emitted the former, remains and is what it was before; but the mind sent forth flies away,
and is carried everywhere around, and thus each is in each although one is from the other,
and they are one although they are two. And it is thus that the Father and the Son are said
to be one, and to be in one another.</p>

<p>8. The individual names uttered by me can neither be separated from one another, nor
parted.729 I spoke of the Father, and before I made mention of the Son I already signified
Him in the Father. I added the Son; and the Father, even although I had not previously
named Him, had already been absolutely comprehended in the Son. I added the Holy Spirit;
but, at the same time, I conveyed under the name whence and by whom He proceeded. But
they are ignorant that neither the Father, in that He is Father, can be separated from the
Son, for that name is the evident ground of coherence and conjunction; nor can the Son be
separated from the Father, for this word Father indicates association between them. And
there is, moreover, evident a Spirit who can neither be disjoined from Him who sends, nor
from Him who brings Him. How, then, should I who use such names think that these are
absolutely divided and separated the one from the other?

<p>10. But if any quibbler, from the fact that I said that God is the Maker and Creator of
all things, thinks that I said that He is also Creator of Christ, let him observe that I first called
Him Father, in which word the Son also is at the same time expressed.730 For after I called
the Father the Creator, I added, Neither is He the Father of those things whereof He is
Creator, if He who begot is properly understood to be a Father (for we will consider the
latitude of this word Father in what follows). Nor is a maker a father, if it is only a framer
who is called a maker. For among the Greeks, they who are wise are said to be makers of
their books. The apostle also says, “a doer (scil. maker) of the law.”731 Moreover, of matters
of the heart, of which kind are virtue and vice, men are called doers (scil. makers); after
which manner God said, “I expected that it should make judgment, but it made iniquity.”732</p>
<p>11. That neither must this saying be thus blamed;733 for he says that he used the name
of Maker on account of the flesh which the Word had assumed, and which certainly was
made. But if any one should suspect that that had been said of the Word, even this also was
to be heard without contentiousness. For as I do not think that the Word was a thing made,
so I do not say that God was its Maker, but its Father. Yet still, if at any time, discoursing
of the Son, I may have casually said that God was His Maker, even this mode of speaking
would not be without defence. For the wise men among the Greeks call themselves the
makers of their books, although the same are fathers of their books. Moreover, divine
Scripture calls us makers of those motions which proceed from the heart, when it calls us
doers of the law of judgment and of justice.</p>

<p>14. Even as our mind emits from itself a word,739—as says the prophet, “My heart hath
uttered forth a good word,”740—and each of the two is distinct the one from the other, and
maintaining a peculiar place, and one that is distinguished from the other; since the former
indeed abides and is stirred in the heart, while the latter has its place in the tongue and in
the mouth. And yet they are not apart from one another, nor deprived of one another;
neither is the mind without the word, nor is the word without the mind; but the mind makes
the word and appears in the word, and the word exhibits the mind wherein it was made.
And the mind indeed is, as it were, the word immanent, while the word is the mind breaking
forth.741 The mind passes into the word, and the word transmits the mind to the surrounding
hearers; and thus the mind by means of the word takes its place in the souls of the hearers,
entering in at the same time as the word. And indeed the mind is, as it were, the father of
the word, existing in itself; but the word is as the son of the mind, and cannot be made before
it nor without it, but exists with it, whence it has taken its seed and origin. In the same
manner, also, the Almighty Father and Universal Mind has before all things the Son, the
Word, and the discourse,742 as the interpreter and messenger of Himself.</p>

<p>Dionysius to Basilides, my beloved son, and my brother, a fellow-minister with me in
holy things, and an obedient servant of God, in the Lord greeting.</p>
<p>You have sent to me, most faithful and accomplished son, in order to inquire what is
the proper hour for bringing the fast to a close747 on the day of Pentecost.748 For you say
that there are some of the brethren who hold that that should be done at cockcrow, and
others who hold that it should be at nightfall.749 For the brethren in Rome, as they say, wait
for the cock; whereas, regarding those here, you told us that they would have it earlier.750
And it is your anxious desire, accordingly, to have the hour presented accurately, and determined
with perfect exactness,751 which indeed is a matter of difficulty and uncertainty.
However, it will be acknowledged cordially by all, that from the date of the resurrection of
our Lord, those who up to that time have been humbling their souls with fastings, ought at
once to begin their festal joy and gladness. But in what you have written to me you have
made out very clearly, and with an intelligent understanding of the Holy Scriptures, that no
very exact account seems to be offered in them of the hour at which He rose. For the evan-

<note type="footnote">747 ἀπονηστίζεσθαι δεῖ. Gentianus Hervetus renders this by jejunandus sit dies Paschæ; and thus he translates
the word by jejunare, “to fast,” wherever it occurs, whereas it rather means always, jejunium solvere, “to have
done fasting.” In this sense the word is used in the Apostolic Constitutions repeatedly: see book v. chap. 12, 18,
etc. It occurs in the same sense in the 89th Canon of the Concilium Trullanum. The usage must evidently be
the same here: so that it does not mean, What is the proper hour for fasting on the day of Pentecost? but, What
is the hour at which the ante-paschal fast ought to be terminated—whether on the evening preceding the paschal
festival itself, or at cockcrowing, or at another time?—Gall. See also the very full article in Suicer, s.v.</note>

gelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after
another,752 and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was “in the end
of the Sabbath,” as Matthew has said;753 it was “early, when it was yet dark,” as John writes;754
it was “very early in the morning,” as Luke puts it; and it was “very early in the morning, at
the rising of the sun,” as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time
when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of
the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,755 found Him no longer
lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But
even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry,
if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ
with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their
statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: “In the end of the Sabbath as it began
to dawn toward the first day of the week,756 came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to
see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended
from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance
was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did
shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear
not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as
He said.”757 Now this phrase “in the end” will be thought by some to signify, according to
the common use758 of the word, the evening of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception
of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,759 as
the phrase “in the end”760 denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of
night, and not of evening, he has added the words, “as it began to dawn toward the first day
of the week.” And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, “bearing spices,” but
“to see the sepulchre;” and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel
sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, “He is not here, He is risen.”
And to the same effect is the testimony of John. “The first day of the week,” says he, “came
Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken

away from the sepulchre.”761 Only, according to this “when it was yet dark,” she had come
in advance.762 And Luke says: “They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment.
Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre,
bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from
the sepulchre.”763 This phrase “very early in the morning”764 probably indicates the early
dawn765 of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and
also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing
spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And
Mark follows this, and says: “They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come
and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto
the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.”766 For this evangelist also has used the term “very
early,” which is just the same as the “very early in the morning” employed by the former;
and he has added, “at the rising of the sun.” Thus they set out, and took their way first when
it was “very early in the morning,” or (as Mark says) when it was “very early;” but on the
road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the
young man clad in white said to them, “He is risen, He is not here.” As the case stands thus,
we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the
specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing
over our Lord’s rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before
midnight,767 we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their
course in their precipitation,768 for it is a wise man’s word, “That is not little in life which
is within a little.” And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere
even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself
walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious
disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved
or as they are able, let us not press very hard:769 for all do not carry out the six days of fasting770
either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without

food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and
others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted
fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended
if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only
decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge
themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two
days—viz., the preparation and the Sabbath—fast with due rigour during these, and these
alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning,
I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have
been practising the same during several days before. This is the counsel which, in accordance
with my apprehension of the question, I have offered you in writing on these matters.771</p>

<p>The question touching women in the time of their separation, whether it is proper for

For I do not think that, if they are believing and pious women, they will themselves be rash
enough in such a condition either to approach the holy table or to touch the body and blood
of the Lord. Certainly the woman who had the issue of blood of twelve years’ standing did
not touch the Lord Himself, but only the hem of His garment, with a view to her cure.772
For to pray, however a person may be situated, and to remember the Lord, in whatever

the attendants (ὑπηρετῶν) will be the civil followers of the magistrates.</note>
<note type="footnote">781 This happened in the first persecution under Decius, when Dionysius was carried off by the decision of
the prefect Sabinus to Taposiris, as he informs us in his epistle to Germanus. Certainly any one who compares
that epistle of Dionysius to Germanus with this one to Domitius, will have no doubt that he speaks of one and
the same event in both. Hence Eusebius is in error in thinking that in this epistle of Dionysius to Domitius we
have a narrative of the events relating to the persecution of Valerian,—a position which may easily be refuted
from Dionysius himself. For in the persecution under Valerian, Dionysius was not carried off into exile under</note>

brethren, and shut up alone in a desert and sterile place in Libya, at a distance of three days’
journey from Parætonium.</p>
<p>3. And a little further on, he proceeds thus:—And they concealed themselves in the city,
and secretly visited the brethren. I refer to the presbyters Maximus, Dioscorus, Demetrius,
and Lucius. For Faustinus and Aquila, who are persons of greater prominence in the world,
are wandering about in Egypt. I specify also the deacons who survived those who died in
the sickness,782 viz., Faustus, Eusebius, and Chæremon. And of Eusebius I speak as one
whom the Lord strengthened from the beginning, and qualified for the task of discharging
energetically the services due to the confessors who are in prison, and of executing the perilous
office of dressing out and burying783 the bodies of those perfected and blessed martyrs.
For even up to the present day the governor does not cease to put to death, in a cruel manner,
as I have already said, some of those who are brought before him; while he wears others out
by torture, and wastes others away with imprisonment and bonds, commanding also that
no one shall approach them and making strict scrutiny lest any one should be seen to do
so. And nevertheless God imparts relief to the oppressed by the tender kindness and earnestness
of the brethren.</p>
<note type="footnote">military custody, nor were there any men from Mareotis, who came and drove off the soldiers, and bore him
away unwillingly, and set him at liberty again; nor had Dionysius on that occasion the presbyters Gaius and
Faustus, and Peter and Paul, with him. All these things happened to Dionysius in that persecution which began
a little before Decius obtained the empire, as he testifies himself in his epistle to Germanus. But in the persecution
under Valerian, Dionysius was accompanied in exile by the presbyter Maximus, and the deacons Faustus, and
Eusebius, and Chæremon, and a certain Roman cleric, as he tells us in the epistle to Germanus.—Valesius.</note>
<note type="footnote">782 ἐν τῇ νόσῳ. Rufinus reads νήσῳ, and renders it, “But of the deacons, some died in the island after the
pains of confession.” But Dionysius refers to the pestilence which traversed the whole Roman world in the times
of Gallus and Volusianus, as Eusebius in his Chroniconand others record. See Aurelius Victor. Dionysius makes
mention of this sickness again in the paschal epistle to the Alexandrians, where he also speaks of the deacons
who were cut off by that plague.—Vales.</note>
<note type="footnote">783 περιστολὰς ἐκτελεῖν. Christophorsonus renders it: “to prepare the linen cloths in which the bodies of
the blessed martyrs who departed this life might be wrapped.” In this Valesius thinks he errs by looking at the
modern method of burial, whereas among the ancient Christians the custom was somewhat different, the bodies
being dressed out in full attire, and that often at great cost, as Eusebius shows us in the case of Astyrius, in the
Hist. Eccles., vii. 16. Yet Athanasius, in his Life of Antonius, has this sentence: “The Egyptians are accustomed
to attend piously to the funerals of the bodies of the dead, and especially those of the holy martyrs, and to wrap
them in linen cloths: they are not wont, however, to consign them to the earth, but to place them on couches,
and keep them in private apartments.”</note>

<head>Epistle II.—To Novatus.784</head>
<p>Dionysius to Novatus785 his brother, greeting. If you were carried on against your will,
as you say, you will show that such has been the case by your voluntary retirement. For it
would have been but dutiful to have suffered any kind of ill, so as to avoid rending the
Church of God. And a martyrdom borne for the sake of preventing a division of the Church,
would not have been more inglorious than one endured for refusing to worship idols;786
nay, in my opinion at least, the former would have been a nobler thing than the latter. For
in the one case a person gives such a testimony simply for his own individual soul, whereas
in the other case he is a witness for the whole Church. And now, if you can persuade or
constrain the brethren to come to be of one mind again, your uprightness will be superior
to your error; and the latter will not be charged against you, while the former will be commended
in you. But if you cannot prevail so far with your recusant brethren, see to it that
you save your own soul. My wish is, that in the Lord you may fare well as you study peace.</p>

So in the Chronicon of Georgius Syncellus we have Διονύσιος Ναυατιανῷ. Rufinus’ account appears to be that
there were two such epistles,—one to Novatus, and another to Novatianus. The confounding of these two forms
seems, however, to have been frequent among the Greeks. [See Lardner, Credib., sub voce Novat. Wordsworth

<head>Epistle III.—To Fabius,787 Bishop of Antioch.</head>
<p>1. The persecution with us did not commence with the imperial edict, but preceded it
by a whole year. And a certain prophet and poet, an enemy to this city,788 whatever else he
was, had previously roused and exasperated against us the masses of the heathen, inflaming
them anew with the fires of their native superstition. Excited by him, and finding full liberty
for the perpetration of wickedness, they reckoned this the only piety and service to their
demons,789 namely, our slaughter.</p>
<p>2. First, then, they seized an old man of the name of Metras, and commanded him to
utter words of impiety; and as he refused, they beat his body with clubs, and lacerated his
face and eyes with sharp reeds, and then dragged him off to the suburbs and stoned him
there. Next they carried off a woman named Quinta, who was a believer, to an idol temple,
and compelled her to worship the idol; and when she turned away from it, and showed how
she detested it, they bound her feet and dragged her through the whole city along the rough
stone-paved streets, knocking her at the same time against the millstones, and scourging
her, until they brought her to the same place, and stoned her also there. Then with one impulse
they all rushed upon the houses of the God-fearing, and whatever pious persons any
of them knew individually as neighbours, after these they hurried and bore them with them,
and robbed and plundered them, setting aside the more valuable portions of their property
for themselves, and scattering about the commoner articles, and such as were made of wood,
and burning them on the roads, so that they made these parts present the spectacle of a city
taken by the enemy. The brethren, however, simply gave way and withdrew, and, like those
to whom Paul bears witness,790 they took the spoiling of their goods with joy. And I know
not that any of them—except possibly some solitary individual who may have chanced to
fall into their hands—thus far has denied the Lord.</p>
<p>3. But they also seized that most admirable virgin Apollonia, then in advanced life, and
knocked out all her teeth,791 and cut her jaws; and then kindling a fire before the city, they

of Antioch, gives the following account of the conflicts of those who suffered martyrdom at Alexandria.”</note>

threatened to burn her alive unless she would repeat along with them their expressions of
impiety.792 And although she seemed to deprecate793 her fate for a little, on being let go,
she leaped eagerly into the fire and was consumed. They also laid hold of a certain Serapion
in his own house;794 and after torturing him with severe cruelties, and breaking all his limbs,
they dashed him headlong from an upper storey to the ground. And there was no road, no
thoroughfare, no lane even, where we could walk, whether by night or by day; for at all times
and in every place they all kept crying out, that if any one should refuse to repeat their
blasphemous expressions, he must be at once dragged off and burnt. These inflictions were
carried rigorously on for a considerable time795 in this manner. But when the insurrection
and the civil war in due time overtook these wretched people,796 that diverted their savage
cruelty from us, and turned it against themselves. And we enjoyed a little breathing time,
as long as leisure failed them for exercising their fury against us.797</p>
<p>4. But speedily was the change from that more kindly reign798 announced to us; and
great was the terror of threatening that was now made to reach us. Already, indeed, the edict
had arrived; and it was of such a tenor as almost perfectly to correspond with what was intimated
to us beforetime by our Lord, setting before us the most dreadful horrors, so as, if
that were possible, to cause the very elect to stumble.799 All verily were greatly alarmed, and
<note type="footnote">792 τὰ τῆς ἀσεβείας κηρύγματα. What these precisely were, it is not easy to say. Dionysius speaks of them
also as δύσφημα ῥήματα in this epistle, and as ἄθεοι φωναί in that to Germanus. Gallandi thinks the reference
is to the practice, of which we read also in the Acts of Polycarp, ch. 9, where the proconsul addresses the martyr
with the order: λοιδόρησον τὸν Χριστόν—Revile Christ. And that the test usually put to reputed Christians by
the early persecutors was this cursing of Christ, we learn from Pliny, book x. epist. 97. [Vol. i. p. 41.]</note>

<note type="footnote">798 This refers to the death of the Emperor Philip, who showed a very righteous and kindly disposition toward
the Christians. Accordingly the matters here recounted by Dionysius took place in the last year of the Emperor
Philip. This is also indicated by Dionysius in the beginning of this epistle, where he says that the persecution
began at Alexandria a whole year before the edict of the Emperor Decius. But Christophorsonus, not observing
this, interprets the μεταβολὴν τῆς βασιλείας as signifying a change in the emperor’s mind toward the Christians,
in which error he is followed by Baronius, ch. 102.—Vales.</note>

of the more notable there were some, and these a large number, who speedily accommodated
themselves to the decree in fear;800 others, who were engaged in the public service, were
drawn into compliance by the very necessities of their official duties;801 others were dragged
on to it by their friends, and on being called by name approached the impure and unholy
sacrifices; others yielded pale and trembling, as if they were not to offer sacrifice, but to be
themselves the sacrifices and victims for the idols, so that they were jeered by the large
multitude surrounding the scene, and made it plain to all that they were too cowardly either
to face death or to offer the sacrifices. But there were others who hurried up to the altars
with greater alacrity, stoutly asserting802 that they had never been Christians at all before;
of whom our Lord’s prophetic declaration holds most true, that it will be hard for such to
be saved. Of the rest, some followed one or other of these parties already mentioned; some
fled, and some were seized. And of these, some went as far in keeping their faith as bonds
and imprisonment; and certain persons among them endured imprisonment even for several
days, and then after all abjured the faith before coming into the court of justice; while
others, after holding out against the torture for a time, sank before the prospect of further
sufferings.803</p>
<p>5. But there were also others, stedfast and blessed pillars of the Lord, who, receiving
strength from Himself, and obtaining power and vigour worthy of and commensurate with
the force of the faith that was in themselves, have proved admirable witnesses for His kingdom.
And of these the first was Julianus, a man suffering from gout, and able neither to

measure to represent the most fearful of all times, viz., those of Antichrist.—Vales.</note>
<note type="footnote">800 ἀπήντων δεδιότες.</note>
<note type="footnote">801 οἱ δὲ δημοσιεύοντες ὑπὸ τῶν πράξεων ἤγοντο. This is rendered by Christophorsonus, “alii ex privatis
ædibus in publicum raptati ad delubra ducuntur a magistratibus.” But δημοσιευοντες is the same as τὰ δημόσια
πράττοντες, i.e., decurions and magistrates. For when the edict of Decius was conveyed to them, commanding
all to sacrifice to the immortal gods, these officials had to convene themselves in the court-house as usual, and
stand and listen while the decree was there publicly recited. Thus they were in a position officially which led
them to be the first to sacrifice. The word πραξεις occurs often in the sense of the acts and administration of
magistrates: thus, in Eusebius, viii. 11; in Aristides, in the funeral oration on Alexander, τὰ δ᾽ εἰς πράξεις τε καὶ
πολιτειας, etc. There are similar passage also in Plutarch’s Πολιτικὰ παραγγέλματα, and in Severianus’s sixth
oration on the Hexameron. So Chrysostom, in his eighty-third homily on Matthew, calls the decurions τοὺς τὰ
πολιτικὰ πράττοντας. The word δημοσιεύοντες, however, may also be explained of those employed in the departments
of law or finance; so that the clause might be rendered, with Valesius: “alii, qui in publico versabantur,
rebus ipsis et reliquorum exemplo, ad sacrificandum ducebantur.” See the note in Migne.</note>

stand nor to walk, who was arranged along with two other men who carried him. Of these
two persons, the one immediately denied Christ; but the other, a person named Cronion,
and surnamed Eunus, and together with him the aged Julianus himself, confessed the Lord,
and were carried on camels through the whole city, which is, as you know, a very large one,
and were scourged in that elevated position, and finally were consumed in a tremendous
fire, while the whole populace surrounded them. And a certain soldier who stood by them
when they were led away to execution, and who opposed the wanton insolence of the people,
was pursued by the outcries they raised against him; and this most courageous soldier of
God, Besas by name, was arranged; and after bearing himself most nobly in that mighty
conflict on behalf of piety, he was beheaded. And another individual, who was by birth a
Libyan, and who at once in name and in real blessedness was also a true Macar,804 although
much was tried by the judge to persuade him to make a denial, did not yield, and was consequently
burned alive. And these were succeeded by Epimachus and Alexander, who, after
a long time805 spent in chains, and after suffering countless agonies and inflictions of the
scraper806 and the scourge, were also burnt to ashes in an immense fire.</p>
<p>6. And along with these there were four women. Among them was Ammonarium, a
pious virgin, who was tortured for a very long time by the judge in a most relentless manner,
because she declared plainly from the first that she would utter none of the things which he
commanded her to repeat; and after she had made good her profession she was led off to
execution. The others were the most venerable and aged Mercuria, and Dionysia, who had
been the mother of many children, and yet did not love her offspring better than her Lord.807
These, when the governor was ashamed to subject them any further to profitless torments,
and thus to see himself beaten by women, died by the sword, without more experience of
tortures. For truly their champion Ammonarium had received tortures for them all.</p>

judge, tried to deceive the youth with fair speeches, thinking he could easily seduce him,
and then attempted also to compel him by force of tortures, fancying he might be made to
yield without much difficulty in that way, Dioscorus neither submitted to his persuasions
nor gave way to his terrors. And the rest, after their bodies had been lacerated in a most
savage manner, and their stedfastness had nevertheless been maintained, he consigned also
to the flames. But Dioscorus he dismissed, wondering at the distinguished appearance he
had made in public, and at the extreme wisdom of the answers he gave to his interrogations,
and declaring that, on account of his age, he granted him further time for repentance. And
this most godly Dioscorus is with us at present, tarrying for a greater conflict and a more
lengthened contest. A certain person of the name of Nemesion, too, who was also an Egyptian,
was falsely accused of being a companion of robbers; and after he had cleared himself of
this charge before the centurion, and proved it to be a most unnatural calumny, he was informed
against as a Christian, and had to come as a prisoner before the governor. And that
most unrighteous magistrate inflicted on him a punishment twice as severe as that to which
the robbers were subjected, making him suffer both tortures and scourgings, and then
consigning him to the fire between the robbers. Thus the blessed martyr was honoured after
the pattern of Christ.</p>
<p>8. There was also a body of soldiers,810 including Ammon, and Zeno, and Ptolemy, and
Ingenuus, and along with them an old man, Theophilus, who had taken up their position
in a mass in front of the tribunal; and when a certain person was standing his trial as a
Christian, and was already inclining to make a denial, these stood round about and ground
their teeth, and made signs with their faces, and stretched out their hands, and made all
manner of gestures with their bodies. And while the attention of all was directed to them,
before any could lay hold of them, they ran quickly up to the bench of judgment811 and
declared themselves to be Christians, and made such an impression that the governor and
his associates were filled with fear; and those who were under trial seemed to be most
courageous in the prospect of what they were to suffer, while the judges themselves trembled.
810 σύνταγμα στρατιωτικόν. Rufinus and Christophorsonus make it turmam militum. Valesius prefers manipulum
or contubernium. These may have been the apparitors or officers of the præfectus Augustalis. Valesius
thinks rather that they were legionaries, from the legion which had to guard the city of Alexandria, and which
was under the authority of the præfectus Augustalis. For at that time the præfectus Augustalis had charge of
military affairs as well as civil.

These, then, went with a high spirit from the tribunals, and exulted in their testimony, God
Himself causing them to triumph gloriously.812</p>
<p>9. Moreover, others in large numbers were torn asunder by the heathen throughout the
cities and villages. Of one of these I shall give some account, as an example. Ischyrion served
one of the rulers in the capacity of steward for stated wages. His employer ordered this man
to offer sacrifice; and on his refusal to do so, he abused him. When he persisted in his noncompliance,
his master treated him with contumely; and when he still held out, he took a
huge stick and thrust it through his bowels and heart, and slew him. Why should I mention
the multitudes of those who had to wander about in desert places and upon the mountains,
and who were cut off by hunger, and thirst, and cold, and sickness, and robbers, and wild
beasts? The survivors of such are the witnesses of their election and their victory. One circumstance,
however, I shall subjoin as an illustration of these things. There was a certain
very aged person of the name of Chæremon, bishop of the place called the city of the Nile.813
He fled along with his partner to the Arabian mountain,814 and never returned. The brethren,
too, were unable to discover anything of them, although they made frequent search; and
they never could find either the men themselves, or their bodies. Many were also carried
off as slaves by the barbarous Saracens815 to that same Arabian mount. Some of these were
ransomed with difficulty, and only by paying a great sum of money; others of them have
not been ransomed to this day. And these facts I have related, brother, not without a purpose,
but in order that you may know how many and how terrible are the ills that have befallen
us; which troubles also will be best understood by those who have had most experience of
them.</p>
<note type="footnote">812 θριαμβεύοντος αὐτούς. Rufinus makes it, “God thus triumphing in them;” from which it would seem
that he had read δι᾽ αὐτούς. But θριαμβεύειν is probably put here for θριαμβεύειν ποιεῖν, as βασιλεύειν is also

works have come down to us there is none more ancient than Dionysius of Alexandria that has named the
Saracens. Ammianus Marcellinus, however, writes in his fourteenth book that he has made mention of the
Saracens in the Acts of Marcus. Spartianus also mentions the Saracens in his Niger, and says that the Roman
soldiers were beaten by them.—Vales. [“The barbarous Saracens:” what a nominis umbra projected by “coming

<p>10. Those sainted martyrs, accordingly, who were once with us, and who now are seated
with Christ,816 and are sharers in His kingdom, and partakers with Him in His judgment817
and who act as His judicial assessors,818 received there certain of the brethren who had
fallen away, and who had become chargeable with sacrificing to the idols. And as they saw
that the conversion and repentance of such might be acceptable to Him who desires not at
all the death of the sinner,819 but rather his repentance, they proved their sincerity, and received
them, and brought them together again, and assembled with them, and had fellowship
with them in their prayers and at their festivals.820 What advice then, brethren, do you give
us as regards these? What should we do? Are we to stand forth and act with the decision
and judgment which those (martyrs) formed, and to observe the same graciousness with
them, and to deal so kindly with those toward whom they showed such compassion? or are
we to treat their decision as an unrighteous one,821 and to constitute ourselves judges of
their opinion on such subjects, and to throw clemency into tears, and to overturn the established
order?822</p>
<p>11. But I shall give a more particular account of one case here which occurred among
us:823 There was with us a certain Serapion, an aged believer. He had spent his long life
blamelessly, but had fallen in the time of trial (the persecution). Often did this man pray

sick, he continued three successive days dumb and senseless. Recovering a little on the fourth
day, he called to him his grandchild, and said, “My son, how long do you detain me? Hasten,
I entreat you, and absolve me quickly. Summon one of the presbyters to me.” And when he
had said this, he became speechless again. The boy ran for the presbyter; but it was night,
and the man was sick, and was consequently unable to come. But as an injunction had been
issued by me,825 that persons at the point of death, if they requested it then, and especially
if they had earnestly sought it before, should be absolved,826 in order that they might depart
this life in cheerful hope, he gave the boy a small portion of the Eucharist,827 telling him to
steep it in water828 and drop it into the old man’s mouth. The boy returned bearing the
portion; and as he came near, and before he had yet entered, Serapion again recovered, and
said, “You have come, my child, and the presbyter was unable to come; but do quickly what
you were instructed to do, and so let me depart.” The boy steeped the morsel in water, and

<head>Epistle VI.—To Sixtus, Bishop.840</head>
<p>1. Previously, indeed, (Stephen) had written letters about Helanus and Firmilianus, and
about all who were established throughout Cilicia and Cappadocia, and all the neighbouring
provinces, giving them to understand that for that same reason he would depart from their
communion, because they rebaptized heretics. And consider the seriousness of the matter.
For, indeed, in the most considerable councils of the bishops, as I hear, it has been decreed
that they who come from heresy should first be trained in Catholic doctrine, and then should
be cleansed by baptism from the filth of the old and impure leaven. Asking and calling him
to witness on all these matters, I sent letters.</p>
<p>And a little after Dionysius proceeds:—</p>
<p>2. And, moreover, to our beloved co-presbyters Dionysius and Philemon, who before
agreed with Stephen, and had written to me about the same matters, I wrote previously in
few words, but now I have written again more at length.</p>
<p>In the same letter, says Eusebius,841 he informs Xystus842 of the Sabellian heretics, that
they were gaining ground at that time, in these words:—</p>
<p>3. For since of the doctrine, which lately has been set on foot at Ptolemais, a city of
Pentapolis, impious and full of blasphemy against Almighty God and the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ; full of unbelief and perfidy towards His only begotten Son and the first-born
of every creature, the Word made man, and which takes away the perception of the Holy
Spirit,—on either side both letters were brought to me, and brethren had come to discuss
it, setting forth more plainly as much as by God’s gift I was able,—I wrote certain letters,
copies of which I have sent to thee.</p>

<head>Epistle VII.—To Philemon, a Presbyter.843</head>
<p>I indeed gave attention to reading the books and carefully studying the traditions of
heretics, to the extent indeed of corrupting my soul with their execrable opinions; yet receiving
from them this advantage, that I could refute them in my own mind, and detested them
more heartily than ever. And when a certain brother of the order of presbyters sought to
deter me, and feared lest I should be involved in the same wicked filthiness, because he said
that my mind would be contaminated, and indeed with truth, as I myself perceived, I was
strengthened by a vision that was sent me from God. And a word spoken to me, expressly
commanded me, saying, Read everything which shall come into thy hands, for thou art fit
to do so, who correctest and provest each one; and from them to thee first of all has appeared
the cause and the occasion of believing. I received this vision as being what was in accordance
with the apostolic word, which thus urges all who are endowed with greater virtue, “Be ye
skilful money-changers.”844</p>
<p>Then, says Eusebius, he subjoins some things parenthetically about all heresies:—</p>
<p>This rule and form I have received from our blessed Father Heraclus: For thou, who
came from heresies, even if they had fallen away from the Church, much rather if they had
not fallen away, but when they were seen to frequent the assemblies of the faithful, were
charged with going to hear the teachers of perverse doctrine, and ejected from the Church,
he did not admit after many prayers, before they had openly and publicly narrated whatever
things they had heard from their adversaries. Then he received them at length to the assemblies
of the faithful, by no means asking of them to receive baptism anew. Because they had
already previously received the Holy Spirit from that very baptism.</p>
<p>Once more, this question being thoroughly ventilated, he adds:—</p>
<p>I learned this besides, that this custom is not now first of all imported among the
Africans845 alone; but moreover, long before, in the times of former bishops, among most
populous churches, and that when synods of the brethren of Iconium and Synades were
held, it also pleased as many as possible, I should be unwilling, by overturning their judg-

<p>For truly, brother, I have need of advice, and I crave your judgment, lest perchance I
should be mistaken upon the matters which in such wise happen to me. One of the brethren
who come together to the church, who for some time has been esteemed as a believer, and
who before my ordination, and, if I am not deceived, before even the episcopate of Heraclas
himself, had been a partaker of the assembly of the faithful, when he had been concerned
in the baptism of those who were lately baptized, and had heard the interrogatories and
their answers, came to me in tears, and bewailing his lot. And throwing himself at my feet,
he began to confess and to protest that this baptism by which he had been initiated among
heretics was not of this kind, nor had it anything whatever in common with this of ours,
because that it was full of blasphemy and impiety. And he said that his soul was pierced with
a very bitter sense of sorrow, and that he did not dare even to lift up his eyes to God, because
he had been initiated by those wicked words and things. Wherefore he besought that, by
this purest laver, he might be endowed with adoption and grace. And I, indeed, have not
dared to do this; but I have said that the long course of communion had been sufficient for
this. For I should not dare to renew afresh, after all, one who had heard the giving of thanks,
and who had answered with others Amen; who had stood at the holy table, and had stretched
forth his hands849 to receive the blessed food, and had received it, and for a very long time
had been a partaker of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Henceforth I bade him
be of good courage, and approach to the sacred elements with a firm faith and a good conscience,
and become a partaker of them. But he makes no end of his wailing, and shrinks
from approaching to the table; and scarcely, when entreated, can he bear to be present at
the prayers.</p>

<head>Epistle X.—Against Bishop Germanus.850</head>
<p>1. Now I speak also before God, and He knoweth that I lie not: it was not by my own
choice,851 neither was it without divine instruction, that I took to flight. But at an earlier
period,852 indeed, when the edict for the persecution under Decius was determined upon,
Sabinus at that very hour sent a certain Frumentarius853 to make search for me. And I remained
in the house for four days, expecting the arrival of this Frumentarius. But he went
about examining all other places, the roads, the rivers, the fields, where he suspected that I
should either conceal myself or travel. And he was smitten with a kind of blindness, and
never lighted on the house; for he never supposed that I should tarry at home when under
pursuit. Then, barely after the lapse of four days, God giving me instruction to remove, and
opening the way for me in a manner beyond all expectation, my domestics854 and I, and a
considerable number of the brethren, effected an exit together. And that this was brought
about by the providence of God, was made plain by what followed: in which also we have
been perhaps of some service to certain parties.</p>
<p>2. Then, after a certain break, he narrates the events which befell him after his flight,
subjoining the following statement:—Now about sunset I was seized, along with those who
were with me, by the soldiers, and was carried off to Taposiris. But by the providence of
God, it happened that Timotheus was not present with me then, nor indeed had he been
apprehended at all. Reaching the place later, he found the house deserted, and officials
keeping guard over it, and ourselves borne into slavery.</p>

<p>3. And after some other matters, he proceeds thus:—And what was the method of this
marvellous disposition of Providence in his case? For the real facts shall be related. When
Timotheus was fleeing in great perturbation, he was met855 by a man from the country.856
This person asked the reason for his haste, and he told him the truth plainly. Then the man
(he was on his way at the time to take part in certain marriage festivities; for it is their custom
to spend the whole night in such gatherings), on hearing the fact, held on his course to the
scene of the rejoicings, and went in and narrated the circumstances to those who were seated
at the feast; and with a single impulse, as if it had been at a given watchword, they all started
up, and came on all in a rush, and with the utmost speed. Hurrying up to us, they raised a
shout; and as the soldiers who were guarding us took at once to flight, they came upon us,
stretched as we were upon the bare couches.857 For my part, as God knows, I took them at
first to be robbers who had come to plunder and pillage us; and remaining on the bedstead
on which I was lying naked, save only that I had on my linen underclothing, I offered them
the rest of my dress as it lay beside me. But they bade me get up and take my departure as
quickly as I could. Then I understood the purpose of their coming, and cried, entreated,
and implored them to go away and leave us alone; and I begged that, if they wished to do
us any good, they might anticipate those who led me captive, and strike off my head. And
while I was uttering such vociferations, as those who were my comrades and partners in all
these things know, they began to lift me up by force. And I threw myself down on my back
upon the ground; but they seized me by the hands and feet, and dragged me away, and bore
me forth. And those who were witnesses of all these things followed me,—namely, Caius,
Faustus, Peter, and Paul. These men also took me up, and hurried me off858 out of the little
town, and set me on an ass without saddle, and in that fashion carried me away.</p>
<p>4. I fear that I run the risk of being charged with great folly and senselessness, placed as
I am under the necessity of giving a narrative of the wonderful dispensation of God’s
providence in our case. Since, however, as one says, it is good to keep close the secret of a
king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God,859 I shall come to close quarters with

the violence of Germanus. I came to Æmilianus not alone; for there accompanied me also
my co-presbyter Maximus, and the deacons Faustus and Eusebius and Chæremon; and one
of the brethren who had come from Rome went also with us. Æmilianus, then, did not lead
off by saying to me, “Hold no assemblies.” That was indeed a thing superfluous for him to

prime importance:860 for his concern was not about our gathering others together in as-
sembly, but about our not being Christians ourselves. From this, therefore, he commanded
me to desist, thinking, doubtless, that if I myself should recant, the others would also follow
me in that. But I answered him neither unreasonably nor in many words, “We must obey
God rather than men.”861 Moreover, I testified openly that I worshipped the only true God
and none other, and that I could neither alter that position nor ever cease to be a Christian.

with nature, and to worship the gods who also maintain them in their kingdom, and to
forget those things which are repugnant to nature. What say ye then to these things? for I
by no means expect that you will be ungrateful to them for their clemency, since indeed
what they aim at is to bring you over to better courses.” Dionysius made reply thus: “All
men do not worship all the gods, but different men worship different objects that they suppose
to be true gods. Now we worship the one God, who is the Creator of all things, and the
very Deity who has committed the sovereignty to the hands of their most sacred majesties
Valerian and Gallienus. Him we both reverence and worship; and to Him we pray continually
on behalf of the sovereignty of these princes, that it may abide unshaken.” Æmilianus, as
prefect, said to them: “But who hinders you from worshipping this god too, if indeed he is
a god, along with those who are gods by nature? for you have been commanded to worship
the gods, and those gods whom all know as such.” Dionysius replied: “We worship no other
one.” Æmilianus, as prefect, said to them: “I perceive that you are at once ungrateful to and
insensible of the clemency of our princes. Wherefore you shall not remain in this city; but

you shall be despatched to the parts of Libya, and settled in a place called Cephro: for of this
place I have made choice in accordance with the command of our princes. It shall not in
any wise be lawful for you or for any others, either to hold assemblies or to enter those places
which are called cemeteries. And if any one is seen not to have betaken himself to this place
whither I have ordered him to repair, or if he be discovered in any assembly, he will prepare
peril for himself; for the requisite punishment will not fail. Be off, therefore, to the place
whither you have been commanded to go.” So he forced me away, sick as I was; nor did he
grant me the delay even of a single day. What opportunity, then, had I to think either of
holding assemblies, or of not holding them?864</p>
<p>6. Then after some other matters he says:—Moreover, we did not withdraw from the
visible assembling of ourselves together, with the Lord’s presence.865 But those in the city
I tried to gather together with all the greater zeal, as if I were present with them; for I was
absent indeed in the body, as I said,866 but present in the spirit. And in Cephro indeed a
considerable church sojourned with us, composed partly of the brethren who followed us
from the city, and partly of those who joined us from Egypt. There, too, did God open to
us a door867 for the word. And at first we were persecuted, we were stoned; but after a
period some few of the heathen forsook their idols, and turned to God. For by our means
the word was then sown among them for the first time, and before that they had never received
it. And as if to show that this had been the very purpose of God in conducting us to
them, when we had fulfilled this ministry, He led us away again. For Æmilianus was minded
to remove us to rougher parts, as it seemed, and to more Libyan-like districts; and he gave
orders to draw all in every direction into the Mareotic territory, and assigned villages to
each party throughout the country. But he issued instructions that we should be located
specially by the public way, so that we might also be the first to be apprehended;868 for he
evidently made his arrangements and plans with a view to an easy seizure of all of us
whenever he should make up his mind to lay hold of us.</p>
<note type="footnote">864 Germanus had accused Dionysius of neglecting to hold the assemblies of the brethren before the persecutions
broke out, and of rather providing for his own safety by flight. For when persecution burst on them, the
bishops were wont first to convene the people, in order to exhort them to hold fast the faith of Christ; there infants
and catechumens were baptized, to provide against their departing this life without baptism, and the Eucharist
was given to the faithful.—Vales.</note>

<p>7. Now when I received the command to depart to Cephro, I had no idea of the situation
of the place, and had scarcely even heard its name before; yet for all that, I went away courageously
and calmly. But when word was brought me that I had to remove to the parts of
Colluthion,869 those present know how I was affected; for here I shall be my own accuser.
At first, indeed, I was greatly vexed, and took very ill; for though these places happened to
be better known and more familiar to us, yet people declared that the region was one destitute
of brethren, and even of men of character, and one exposed to the annoyances of travellers
and to the raids of robbers. I found comfort, however when the brethren reminded me that
it was nearer the city; and while Cephro brought us large intercourse with brethren of all
sorts who came from Egypt, so that we were able to hold our sacred assemblies on a more
extensive scale, yet there, on the other hand, as the city was in the nearer vicinity, we could
enjoy more frequently the sight of those who were the really beloved, and in closest relationship
with us, and dearest to us: for these would come and take their rest among us, and, as
in the more remote suburbs, there would be distinct and special meetings.870 And thus it
turned out.</p>
<p>8. Then, after some other matters, he gives again the following account of what befell him:
—Germanus, indeed, boasts himself of many professions of faith. He, forsooth, is able to
speak of many adverse things which have happened to him! Can he then reckon up in his
own case as many condemnatory sentences871 as we can number in ours, and confiscations
<note type="footnote">869 τὰ Κολλουθίωνος, supplying μέρη, as Dionysius has already used the phrase τὰ μέρη τῆς Λιβύης. This
was a district in the Mareotic prefecture. Thus we have mention made also of τὰ Βουκόλου, a certain tract in
Egypt, deriving its name from the old masters of the soil. Nicephorus writes Κολούθιον, which is probably more
correct; for Κολλουθίων is a derivative from Colutho, which was a common name in Egypt. Thus a certain poet
of note in the times of Anastasius, belonging to the Thebaid, was so named, as Suidas informs us. There was
also a Coluthus, a certain schismatic, in Egypt, in the times of Athanasius, who is mentioned often in the Apologia;
and Gregory of Nyssa names him Acoluthus in his Contra Eunomium, book ii.—Vales.</note>
<note type="footnote">870 κατὰ μέρος συναγωγαί. When the suburbs were somewhat distant from the city, the brethren resident
in them were not compelled to attend the meetings of the larger church, but had meetings of their own in a basilica,
or some building suitable for the purpose. The Greeks, too, gave the name προάστειον to places at some considerable
distance from the city, as well as to suburbs immediately connected with it. Thus Athanasius calls Canopus
a προάστειον; and so Daphne is spoken of as the προάστειον of Antioch, Achyrona as that of Nicomedia, and
Septimum as that of Constantinople, though these places were distant some miles from the cities. From this
place it is also inferred that in the days of Dionysius there was still but one church in Alexandria, where all the
brethren met for devotions. But in the time of Athanasius, when several churches had been built by the various
bishops, the Alexandrians met in different places, κατὰ μέρος καὶ διῃρημένως , as Athanasius says in his first
Apology to Constantius; only that on the great festivals, as at the paschal season and at Pentecost, the brethren
did not meet separately, but all in the larger church, as Athanasius also shows us—Vales.</note>

worldly honour, and contemnings of the laudations of governors and councillors, and patient
subjections to the threatenings of the adversaries,873 and to outcries, and perils, and persecutions,
and a wandering life, and the pressure of difficulties, and all kinds of trouble, such
as befell me in the time of Decius and Sabinus,874 and such also as I have been suffering
under the present severities of Æmilianus? But where in the world did Germanus make his
appearance? And what mention is made of him? But I retire from this huge act of folly into
which I am suffering myself to fall on account of Germanus; and accordingly I forbear giving
to the brethren, who already have full knowledge of these things, a particular and detailed
narrative of all that happened.</p>

<p>1. But Gallus did not understand the wickedness of Decius, nor did he note beforehand
what it was that wrought his ruin. But he stumbled at the very stone which was lying before
his eyes; for when his sovereignty was in a prosperous position, and when affairs were
turning out according to his wish,876 he oppressed those holy men who interceded with
God on behalf of his peace and his welfare. And consequently, persecuting them, he persecuted
also the prayers offered in his own behalf.</p>
<p>2. And to John a revelation is made in like manner:877 “And there was given unto him,”
he says, “a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemy; and power was given unto him,
and forty and two months.”878 And one finds both things to wonder at in Valerian’s case;
and most especially has one to consider how different it was with him before these
events,879—how mild and well-disposed he was towards the men of God. For among the
emperors who preceded him, there was not one who exhibited so kindly and favourable a
disposition toward them as he did; yea, even those who were said to have become Christians
openly880 did not receive them with that extreme friendliness and graciousness with which

he received them at the beginning of his reign; and his whole house was filled then with the
pious, and it was itself a very church of God. But the master and president881 of the Magi
of Egypt882 prevailed on him to abandon that course, urging him to slay and persecute those
pure and holy men as adversaries and obstacles to their accursed and abominable incantations.
For there are, indeed, and there were men who, by their simple presence, and by
merely showing themselves, and by simply breathing and uttering some words, have been
able to dissipate the artifices of wicked demons. But he put it into his mind to practise the
impure rites of initiation, and detestable juggleries, and execrable sacrifices, and to slay
miserable children, and to make oblations of the offspring of unhappy fathers, and to divide
the bowels of the newly-born, and to mutilate and cut up the creatures made by God, as if
by such means they883 would attain to blessedness.</p>

which Macrianus brought them884 for that empire which was the object of his hopes; who,
while formerly reputed as the sovereign’s faithful public treasurer,885 had yet no mind for
anything which was either reasonable in itself or conducive to the public good,886 but subjected
himself to that curse of prophecy which says, “Woe unto those who prophesy from
their own heart, and see not the public good!”887 For he did not discern that providence
which regulates all things; nor did he think of the judgment of Him who is before all, and
through all, and over all. Wherefore he also became an enemy to His Catholic Church; and
besides that, he alienated and estranged himself from the mercy of God, and fled to the utmost

a due return to them, by setting Valerian in arms against the Christians.</note>

possible distance from His salvation.888 And in this indeed he demonstrated the reality of
the peculiar significance of his name.889</p>
<p>4. And again, after some other matters, he proceeds thus:—For Valerian was instigated
to these acts by this man, and was thereby exposed to contumely and reproach, according
to the word spoken by the Lord to Isaiah: “Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their
own abominations in which their souls delighted; I also will choose their mockeries,890 and
will recompense their sin.”891 But this man892 (Macrianus), being maddened with his passion
for the empire, all unworthy of it as he was, and at the same time having no capacity for assuming
the insignia of imperial government,893 by reason of his crippled894 body,895 put
forward his two sons as the bearers, so to speak, of their father’s offences. For unmistakeably
apparent in their case was the truth of that declaration made by God, when He said, “Visiting
the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me.” For he heaped his own wicked passions, for which he had failed in securing
satisfaction,896 upon the heads of his sons, and thus wiped off897 upon them his own
wickedness, and transferred to them, too, the hatred he himself had shown toward God.</p>
<p>5.898 That man,899 then, after he had betrayed the one and made war upon the other of
the emperors preceding him, speedily perished, with his whole family, root and branch.

And Gallienus was proclaimed, and acknowledged by all. And he was at once an old emperor
and a new; for he was prior to those, and he also survived them. To this effect indeed is the
word spoken by the Lord to Isaiah: “Behold, the things which were from the beginning have
come to pass; and there are new things which shall now arise.”900 For as a cloud which intercepts
the sun’s rays, and overshadows it for a little, obscures it, and appears itself in its
place, but again, when the cloud has passed by or melted away, the sun, which had risen
before, comes forth again and shows itself: so did this Macrianus put himself forward,901
and achieve access902 for himself even to the very empire of Gallienus now established; but
now he is that no more, because indeed he never was it, while this other, i.e., Gallienus, is
just as he was. And his empire, as if it had cast off old age, and had purged itself of the
wickedness formerly attaching to it, is at present in a more vigorous and flourishing condition,
and is now seen and heard of at greater distances, and stretches abroad in every direction.</p>
<p>6. Then he further indicates the exact time at which he wrote this account, as follows:—And
it occurs to me again to review the days of the imperial years. For I see that those most impious
men, whose names may have been once so famous, have in a short space become
nameless. But our more pious and godly prince903 has passed his septennium, and is now
in his ninth year, in which we are to celebrate the festival.904</p>

<note type="footnote">904 Who ever expressed himself thus,—that one after his seven years was passing his ninth year? This septennium
(επταετηρίς ) must designate something peculiar, and different from the time following it. It is therefore
the septennium of imperial power which he had held along with his father. In the eighth year of that empire,
Macrianus possessed himself of the imperial honour specially in Egypt. After his assumption of the purple,
however, Gallienus had still much authority in Egypt. At length, in the ninth year of Gallienus, that is, in 261,
Macrianus the father and the two sons being slain, the sovereignty of Gallienus was recognised also among the
Egyptians. And then Gallienus gave a rescript to Dionysius, Pinna, and Demetrius, bishops of Egypt, to re-establish
the sacred places,—a boon which he had granted in the former year. The ninth year of Gallienus, moreover,
began about the midsummer of this year; and the time at which this letter was written by Dionysius, as Eusebius
observes, may be gathered from that, and falls consequently before the Paschal season of 262 a.d.—Pearson, p.

<p>1. To other men, indeed, the present state of matters would not appear to offer a fit
season for a festival: and this certainly is no festal time to them; nor, in sooth, is any other
that to them. And I say this, not only of occasions manifestly sorrowful,906 but even or all
occasions whatsoever which people might consider to be most joyous.907 And now certainly
all things are turned to mourning, and all men are in grief, and lamentations resound through
the city, by reason of the multitude of the dead and of those who are dying day by day. For
as it is written in the case of the first-born of the Egyptians, so now too a great cry has arisen.
“For there is not a house in which there is not one dead.”908 And would that even this were
all!</p>
<p>2. Many terrible calamities, it is true, have also befallen us before this. For first they
drove us away; and though we were quite alone, and pursued by all, and in the way of being
slain, we kept our festival, even at such a time. And every place that had been the scene of
some of the successive sufferings which befell any of us, became a seat for our solemn assemblies,—
the field, the desert, the ship, the inn, the prison,—all alike. The most gladsome
festival of all, however, has been celebrated by those perfect martyrs who have sat down at
the feast in heaven. And after these things war and famine surprised us. These were calamities
which we shared, indeed, with the heathen. But we had also to bear by ourselves alone
those ills with which they outraged us, and we had at the same time to sustain our part in
those things which they either did to each other or suffered at each other’s hands; while
again we rejoiced deeply in that peace of Christ which He imparted to us alone.</p>
<note type="footnote">905 Eusebius, Hist. Eccles., vii. 22. Eusebius prefaces the 21st chapter of his seventh book thus: “When peace
had scarcely yet been established, he (Dionysius) returned to Alexandria. But when sedition and war again broke
out, and made it impossible for him to have access to all the brethren in that city, divided as they then were into
different parties, he addressed them again by an epistle at the Passover, as if he were still an exile from Alexandria.”
Then he inserts the epistle to Hierax; and thereafter, in ch. xxii., introduces the present excerpt thus: “After these
events, the pestilence succeeding the war, and the festival being now at hand, he again addressed the brethren
by letters, in which he gave the following description of the great troubles connected with that calamity.”</note>
<note type="footnote">906 οὐχ ὅπως τῶν ἐπιλύπων is the reading of Codices Maz., Med., and Savil.; others give, less correctly,

construction, ὃν οἵοιντο ἀν μάλιστα περιχαρῆ. Nicephorus reads, εἴ τις περιχαρης ὢν οἰθείη. The idea is, that
the heathen could have no real festal time. All seasons, those apparently most joyous, no less than those evidently
sorrowful, must be times void of all real rejoicing to them, until they learn the grace of God.</note>

<p>3. And after we and they together had enjoyed a very brief season of rest, this pestilence
next assailed us,—a calamity truly more dreadful to them than all other objects of dread,
and more intolerable than any other kind of trouble whatsoever;909 and a misfortune which,
as a certain writer of their own declares, alone prevails over all hope. To us, however, it was
not so; but in no less measure than other ills it proved an instrument for our training and
probation. For it by no means kept aloof from us, although it spread with greatest violence
among the heathen.</p>
<p>4. To these statements he in due succession makes this addition:—Certainly very many
of our brethren, while, in their exceeding love and brotherly-kindness, they did not spare
themselves, but kept by each other, and visited the sick without thought of their own peril,
and ministered to them assiduously, and treated them for their healing in Christ, died from
time to time most joyfully along with them, lading themselves with pains derived from
others, and drawing upon themselves their neighbours’ diseases, and willingly taking over
to their own persons the burden of the sufferings of those around them.910 And many who
had thus cured others of their sicknesses, and restored them to strength, died themselves,
having transferred to their own bodies the death that lay upon these. And that common
saying, which else seemed always to be only a polite form of address,911 they expressed in
actual fact then, as they departed this life, like the “off-scourings of all.”912 Yea, the very best

and closed914 their eyes, and shut their mouths. And carrying them in company,915
and laying them out decently, they clung to them, and embraced them, and prepared them
duly with washing and with attire. And then in a little while after they had the same services
done for themselves, as those who survived were ever following those who departed before
them. But among the heathen all was the very reverse. For they thrust aside any who began
to be sick, and kept aloof even from their dearest friends, and cast the sufferers out upon
the public roads half dead, and left them unburied, and treated them with utter contempt
when they died, steadily avoiding any kind of communication and intercourse with death;
which, however, it was not easy for them altogether to escape, in spite of the many precautions
they employed.916</p>

<p>1. But what wonder should there be if I find it difficult to communicate by letter with
those who are settled in remote districts, when it seems beyond my power even to reason
with myself, and to take counsel with918 my own soul? For surely epistolary communications
are very requisite for me with those who are, as it were, my own bowels, my closest associates,
and my brethren—one in soul with myself, and members, too, of the same Church. And yet
no way opens up by which I can transmit such addresses. Easier, indeed, would it be for
one, I do not say merely to pass beyond the limits of the province, but to cross from east to
west, than to travel from this same Alexandria to Alexandria. For the most central pathway
in this city919 is vaster920 and more impassable even than that extensive and untrodden
desert which Israel only traversed in two generations; and our smooth and waveless harbours
have become an image of that sea through which the people drove, at the time when it divided
itself and stood up like walls on either side, and in whose thoroughfare the Egyptians were
drowned. For often they have appeared like the Red Sea, in consequence of the slaughter
perpetrated in them. The river, too, which flows by the city, has sometimes appeared drier
than the waterless desert, and more parched than that wilderness in which Israel was so
overcome with thirst on their journey, that they kept crying out against Moses, and the
water was made to stream for them from the precipitous921 rock by the power of Him who
alone doeth wondrous things. And sometimes, again, it has risen in such flood-tide, that it
has overflowed all the country round about, and the roads, and the fields, as if it threatened
to bring upon us once more that deluge of waters which occurred in the days of Noah.</p>
<p>2. But now it always flows onward, polluted with blood and slaughters and the drowning
struggles of men, just as it did of old, when on Pharaoh’s account it was changed by Moses
into blood, and made putrid. And what other liquid could cleanse water, which itself cleanses
all things? How could that ocean, so vast and impassable for men, though poured out on it,
ever purge this bitter sea? Or how could even that great river which streams forth from

channel of the Gihon,923 wash away these pollutions? Or when will this air, befouled as it
is by noxious exhalations which rise in every direction, become pure again? For there are
such vapours sent forth from the earth, and such blasts from the sea, and breezes from the
rivers, and reeking mists from the harbours, that for dew we might suppose ourselves to
have the impure fluids924 of the corpses which are rotting in all the underlying elements.
And yet, after all this, men are amazed, and are at a loss to understand whence come these
constant pestilences, whence these terrible diseases, whence these many kinds of fatal inflictions,
whence all that large and multiform destruction of human life, and what reason there
is why this mighty city no longer contains within it as great a number of inhabitants, taking
all parties into account, from tender children up to those far advanced in old age, as once
it maintained of those alone whom it called hale old men.925 But those from forty years of
age up to seventy were so much more numerous then, that their number cannot be made
up now even when those from fourteen to eighty years of age have been added to the roll
and register of persons who are recipients of the public allowances of grain. And those who
are youngest in appearance have now become, as it were, equals in age with those who of
old were the most aged. And yet, although they thus see the human race constantly diminishing
and wasting away upon the earth, they have no trepidation in the midst of this increasing
and advancing consumption and annihilation of their own number.</p>

<head>Epistle XIV.—From His Fourth Festival Epistle.926</head>
<p>Love is altogether and for ever on the alert, and casts about to do some good even to
one who is unwilling to receive it. And many a time the man who shrinks from it under a
feeling of shame, and who declines to accept services of kindness on the ground of unwillingness
to become troublesome to others, and who chooses rather to bear the burden of his
own grievances than cause annoyance and anxiety to any one, is importuned by the man
who is full of love to bear with his aids, and to suffer himself to be helped by another, though
it might be as one sustaining a wrong, and thus to do a very great service, not to himself,
but to another, in permitting that other to be the agent in putting an end to the ill in which
he has been involved.</p>

<p>The moderation of Dionysius is hardly less conspicuous than his fearlessness of inquiry
in the questions he raises about the Apocalypse.927 He utterly refuses to reject it.928 He
testifies to the value set upon it by his fellow-Christians. Only, he doubts as to (the John)
the “inspired person” who was its author, and with critical skill exposes the inferiority of
the Greek of the Apocalypse to that of the Gospel and Epistles of St. John. Obviously he accepts
it as part of the canon, only doubting as to the author. Modestly he owns that it passes
his understanding. So Calvin forbore to comment upon it, and owned to “headache” when
he came to it.</p>

For what man is there who, although he may have become rich by toiling after the objects
of this earth, has been able to make himself three cubits in stature, if he is naturally only of
two cubits in stature? Or who, if blind, has by these means recovered his sight? Therefore
we ought to direct our toils to a goal beyond the sun: for thither, too, do the exertions of the

of all the ancients. Consequently he shows the vanity of it, as what follows in like manner
demonstrates: “And my heart uttered936 many things: I knew wisdom, and knowledge, and
parables, and sciences.” But this was not the genuine wisdom or knowledge, but that which,
as Paul says, puffeth up. He spake, moreover, as it is written,937 three thousand parables.
But these were not parables of a spiritual kind, but only such as fit the common polity of
men; as, for instance, utterances about animals or medicines. For which reason he has added
in a tone of raillery, “I knew that this also is the spirit’s choice.” He speaks also of the multitude
of knowledge, not the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, but that which the prince of this
world works, and which he conveys to men in order to overreach their souls, with officious
questions as to the measures of heaven, the position of earth, the bounds of the sea. But he
says also, “He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.” For they search even into things
deeper than these,—inquiring, for example, what necessity there is for fire to go upward,
and for water to go downward; and when they have learned that it is because the one is light
and the other heavy, they do but increase sorrow: for the question still remains, Why might
it not be the very reverse? </p>

<head>Chapter II.</head>
<p>Ver. 1. “I said in mine heart, Go to now, make trial as in mirth, and behold in good.
And this, too, is vanity.”</p>
<p>For it was for the sake of trial, and in accordance with what comes by the loftier and the
severe life, that he entered into pleasure. And he makes mention of the mirth, which men
call so. And he says, “in good,” referring to what men call good things, which are not capable
of giving life to their possessor, and which make the man who engages in them vain like
themselves.</p>
<p>2. “I said of laughter, It is mad;938 and of mirth, What doest thou?”
Laughter has a twofold madness; because madness begets laughter, and does not allow
the sorrowing for sins; and also because a man of that sort is possessed with madness,939 in
the confusing of seasons, and places, and persons. For he flees from those who sorrow. “And
to mirth, What doest thou?” Why dost thou repair to those who are not at liberty to be
merry? Why to the drunken, and the avaricious, and the rapacious? And why this phrase,
“as wine?”940 Because wine makes the heart merry; and it acts upon the poor in spirit. The
flesh, however, also makes the heart merry, when it acts in a regular and moderate fashion.</p>
<p>3. “And my heart directed me in wisdom, and to overcome in mirth, until I should know
what is that good thing to the sons of men which they shall do under the sun for the number
of the days of their life.”</p>
<p>Being directed, he says, by wisdom, I overcame pleasures in mirth. Moreover, for me
the aim of knowledge was to occupy myself with nothing vain, but to find the good; for if a
person finds that, he does not miss the discernment also of the profitable. The sufficient is
also the opportune,941 and is commensurate with the length of life.</p>
<p>4. “I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards.</p>
<p>5. I made me gardens and orchards.</p>
<p>6. I made me pools of water, that by these I might rear woods producing trees.</p>
<p>7. I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had large
possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me.</p>
<p>8. I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the
provinces. I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men,
as cups and the cupbearer.</p>
<p>9. And I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also
my wisdom remained with me.</p>

<p>10. And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart
from any pleasure.”</p>
<p>You see how he reckons up a multitude of houses and fields, and the other things which
he mentions, and then finds nothing profitable in them. For neither was he any better in
soul by reason of these things, nor by their means did he gain friendship with God. Necessarily
he is led to speak also of the true riches and the abiding property. Being minded,
therefore, to show what kinds of possessions remain with the possessor, and continue
steadily and maintain themselves for him, he adds: “Also my wisdom remained with me.”
For this alone remains, and all these other things, which he has already reckoned up, flee
away and depart. Wisdom, therefore, remained with me, and I remained in virtue of it. For
those other things fall, and also cause the fall of the very persons who run after them. But,
with the intention of instituting a comparison between wisdom and those things which are
held to be good among men, he adds these words, “And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I
kept not from them,” and so forth; whereby he describes as evil, not only those toils which
they endure who toil in gratifying themselves with pleasures, but those, too, which by necessity
and constraint men have to sustain for their maintenance day by day, labouring at their
different occupations in the sweat of their faces. For the labour, he says, is great; but the
art942 by the labour is temporary, adding943 nothing serviceable among things that please.
Wherefore there is no profit. For where there is no excellence there is no profit. With reason,
therefore, are the objects of such solicitude but vanity, and the spirit’s choice. Now this name
of “spirit” he gives to the “soul.” For choice is a quality, not a motion.944 And David says:
“Into Thy hands I commit my spirit.”945 And in good truth “did my wisdom remain with
me,” for it made me know and understand, so as to enable me to speak of all that is not advantageous946
under the sun. If, therefore, we desire the righteously profitable, if we seek
the truly advantageous, if it is our aim to be incorruptible, let us engage those labours which
reach beyond the sun. For in these there is no vanity, and there is not the choice of a spirit
at once inane and hurried hither and thither to no purpose.</p>
<p>12. “And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what man is
there that shall come after counsel in all those things which it has done?”947</p>
<p>He means the wisdom which comes from God, and which also remained with him. And
by madness and folly he designates all the labours of men, and the vain and silly pleasure

<pb n="271"/>
they have in them. Distinguishing these, therefore, and their measure, and blessing the true
wisdom, he has added: “For what man is there that shall come after counsel?” For this
counsel instructs us in the wisdom that is such indeed, and gifts us with deliverance from
madness and folly.</p>
<p>13. “Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as much as light excelleth darkness.”
He does not say this in the way of comparison. For things which are contrary to each
other, and mutually destructive, cannot be compared. But his decision was, that the one is
to be chosen, and the other avoided. To like effect is the saying, “Men loved darkness rather
than light.”948 For the term “rather” in that passage expresses the choice of the person loving,
and not the comparison of the objects themselves.</p>
<p>14. “The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness.”
That man always inclines earthward, he means, and has the ruling faculty949 darkened.
It is true, indeed, that we men have all of us our eyes in our head, if we speak of the mere
disposition of the body. But he speaks here of the eyes of the mind. For as the eyes of the
swine do not turn naturally up towards heaven, just because it is made by nature to have an
inclination toward the belly; so the mind of the man who has once been enervated by
pleasures is not easily diverted from the tendency thus assumed, because he has not “respect
unto all the commandments of the Lord.”950 Again: “Christ is the head of the Church.”951
And they, therefore, are the wise who walk in His way; for He Himself has said, “I am the
way.”952 On this account, then, it becomes the wise man always to keep the eyes of his mind
directed toward Christ Himself, in order that he may do nothing out of measure, neither
being lifted up in heart in the time of prosperity, nor becoming negligent in the day of adversity:
“for His judgments are a great deep,”953 as you will learn more exactly from what
is to follow.</p>
<p>14. “And I perceived myself also that one event happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>15. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and
why was I then more wise?”
The run of the discourse in what follows deals with those who are of a mean spirit as
regards this present life, and in whose judgment the article of death and all the anomalous
pains of the body are a kind of dreaded evil, and who on this account hold that there is no
profit in a life of virtue, because there is no difference made in ills like these between the

wise man and the fool. He speaks consequently of these as the words of a madness inclining
to utter senselessness; whence he also adds this sentence, “For the fool talks over-much;”954
and by the “fool” here he means himself, and every one who reasons in that way. Accordingly
he condemns this absurd way of thinking. And for the same reason he has given utterance
to such sentiments in the fears of his heart; and dreading the righteous condemnation of
those who are to be heard, he solves the difficulty in its pressure by his own reflections. For
this word, “Why was I then wise?” was the word of a man in doubt and difficulty whether
what is expended on wisdom is done well or to no purpose; and whether there is no difference
between the wise man and the fool in point of advantage, seeing that the former is involved
equally with the latter in the same sufferings which happen in this present world. And for
this reason he says, “I spoke over-largely955 in my heart,” in thinking that there is no difference
between the wise man and the fool.</p>
<p>16. “For there is no remembrance of the wise equally with the fool forever.”
For the events that happen in this life are all transitory, be they even the painful incidents,
of which he says, “As all things now are consigned to oblivion.”956 For after a short space
has passed by, all the things that befall men in this life perish in forgetfulness. Yea, the very
persons to whom these things have happened are not remembered all in like manner, even
although they may have gone through like chances in life. For they are not remembered for
these, but only for what they may have evinced of wisdom or folly, virtue or vice. The
memories of such are not extinguished (equally) among men in consequence of the changes
of lot befalling them. Wherefore he has added this: “And how shall the wise man die along
with the fool? The death of sinners, indeed, is evil: yet the memory of the just is blessed, but
the name of the wicked is extinguished.”957</p>
<p>22. “For that falls to man in all his labour.”
In truth, to those who occupy their minds with the distractions of life, life becomes a
painful thing, which, as it were, wounds the heart with its goads, that is, with the lustful
desires of increase. And sorrowful also is the solicitude connected with covetousness: it does
not so much gratify those who are successful in it, as it pains those who are unsuccessful;
while the day is spent in laborious anxieties, and the night puts sleep to flight from the eyes,
with the cares of making gain. Vain, therefore, is the zeal of the man who looks to these
things.</p>

show to his soul good in his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</p>
<p>25. For who eats and drinks from his own resources?”958 That the discourse does not
deal now with material meats, he will show by what follows; namely, “It is better to go to
the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting.”959 And so in the present passage
he proceeds to add: “And (what) will show to his soul good in its labour.” And surely mere
material meats and drinks are not the soul’s good. For the flesh, when luxuriously nurtured,
wars against the soul, and rises in revolt against the spirit. And how should not intemperate
eatings and drinkings also be contrary to God?960 He speaks, therefore, of things mystical.

in the case of him who can show a wound that will bear remedy.</p>

A time to weep, when it is the time of suffering; as when the Lord also says, “Verily I

“For your sorrow,” He says, “shall be turned into joy.”963</p>
<p>4. “A time to mourn, and a time to dance.”
When one thinks of the death which the transgression of Adam brought on us, it is a
time to mourn; but it is a time to hold festal gatherings when we call to mind the resurrection
from the dead which we expect through the new Adam.964</p>
<p>6. “A time to keep, and a time to cast away.”
A time to keep the Scripture against the unworthy, and a time to put it forth for the

was a time to cast it away when the truth came in its flower.</p>

its space from the beginning and unto the end, that is to say, the period appointed for it,
and the limits before determined unto it; forasmuch as God has set the whole world as a
realm of ignorance in our hearts. And thus one says: “Declare to me the shortness of my

<p>An Interpretation.—Chap. XXII. 42–48</p>
<p>Ver. 42. “Father, if Thou be willing to remove967 this cup from me: nevertheless not my
will, but Thine, be done.”</p>
<p>But let these things be enough to say on the subject of the will. This word, however, “Let
the cup pass,” does not mean, Let it not come near me, or approach me.968 For what can
“pass from Him,” certainly must first come nigh Him; and what does pass thus from Him,
must be by Him. For if it does not reach Him, it cannot pass from Him. For He takes to
Himself the person of man, as having been made man. Wherefore also on this occasion He
deprecates the doing of the inferior, which is His own, and begs that the superior should be
done, which is His Father’s, to wit, the divine will; which again, however, in respect of the
divinity, is one and the same will in Himself and in the Father. For it was the Father’s will
that He should pass through every trial (temptation); and the Father Himself in a marvellous
manner brought Him on this course, not indeed with the trial itself as His goal, nor in order
simply that He might enter into that, but in order that He might prove Himself to be above
the trial, and also beyond it.969 And surely it is the fact, that the Saviour asks neither what
is impossible, nor what is impracticable, nor what is contrary to the will of the Father. It is
something possible; for Mark makes mention of His saying, “Abba, Father, all things are
possible unto Thee.”970 And they are possible if He wills them; for Luke tells us that He said,
“Father, if Thou be willing, remove971 this cup from me.” The Holy Spirit, therefore, apportioned
among the evangelists, makes up the full account of our Saviour’s whole disposition
by the expressions of these several narrators together. He does not, then, ask of the Father
what the Father wills not. For the words, “If Thou be willing,” were demonstrative of subjection
and docility,972 not of ignorance or hesitancy. For this reason, the other scripture says,
“All things are possible unto Thee.” And Matthew again admirably describes the submission
and humility973 when he says, “If it be possible.” For unless I adapt the sense in this way,974

some will perhaps assign an impious signification to this expression, “If it be possible;” as
if there were anything impossible for God to do, except that only which He does not will to
do. But…being straightway strengthened in His humanity by His ancestral975 divinity, he
urges the safer petition, and desires no longer that should be the case, but that it might be
accomplished in accordance with the Father’s good pleasure, in glory, in constancy, and in
fulness. For John, who has given us the record of the sublimest and divinest of the Saviour’s
words and deeds, heard Him speak thus: “And the cup which my Father hath given me,
shall I not drink it?”976 Now, to drink the cup was to discharge the ministry and the whole
economy of trial with fortitude, to follow and fulfil the Father’s determination, and to surmount
all apprehensions. And the exclamation, “Why hast Thou forsaken me?” was in due
accordance with the requests He had previously made: Why is it that death has been in
conjunction with me all along up till now, and that I bear not yet the cup? This I judge to
have been the Saviour’s meaning in this concise utterance.</p>
<p>And He certainly spake truth then. Nevertheless He was not forsaken. But He drank
out the cup at once, as His plea had implied, and then passed away.977 And the vinegar
which was handed to Him seems to me to have been a symbolical thing. For the turned
wine978 indicated very well the quick turning979 and change which He sustained, when He
passed from His passion to impassibility, and from death to deathlessness, and from the
position of one judged to that of one judging, and from subjection under the despot’s power
to the exercise of kingly dominion. And the sponge, as I think, signified the complete
transfusion980 of the Holy Spirit that was realized in Him. And the reed symbolized the
royal sceptre and the divine law. And the hyssop expressed that quickening and saving resurrection
of His, by which He has also brought health to us.981</p>
<p>43. “And there appeared an angel unto Him from heaven, strengthening Him.</p>
<p>44. And being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat was as it were great
drops of blood falling down to the ground.”</p>
<p>The phrase, “a sweat of blood,” is a current parabolic expression used of persons in intense
pain and distress; as also of one in bitter grief people say that the man “weeps tears of
blood.” For in using the expression, “as it were great drops of blood,” he does not declare

<note type="footnote">981 The text is, ἡμᾶς ὕγια ἔδειξεν. Migne proposes ὑγίασεν.</note>

<pb n="278"/>
the drops of sweat to have been actually drops of blood.982 For he would not then have said
that these drops of sweat were like blood. For such is the force of the expression, “as it were
great drops.” But rather with the object of making it plain that the Lord’s body was not bedewed
with any kind of subtle moisture which had only the show and appearance of actuality,
but that it was really suffused all over with sweat in the shape of large thick drops, he has
taken the great drops of blood as an illustration of what was the case with Him. And accordingly,
as by the intensity of the supplication and the severe agony, so also by the dense and
excessive sweat, he made the facts patent, that the Saviour was man by nature and in reality,
and not in mere semblance and appearance, and that He was subject to all the innocent
sensibilities natural to men. Nevertheless the words, “I have power to lay down my life, and
I have power to take it again,”983 show that His passion was a voluntary thing; and besides
that, they indicate that the life which is laid down and taken again is one thing, and the divinity
which lays that down and takes it again is another.</p>
<p>He says, “one thing and another,” not as making a partition into two persons, but as
showing the distinction between the two natures.984</p>
<p>And as, by voluntarily enduring the death in the flesh, He implanted incorruptibility
in it; so also, by taking to Himself of His own free-will the passion of our servitude,985 He
set in it the seeds of constancy and courage, whereby He has nerved those who believe on
Him for the mighty conflicts belonging to their witness-bearing. Thus, also, those drops of
sweat flowed from Him in a marvellous way like great drops of blood, in order that He
might, as it were, drain off986 and empty the fountain of the fear which is proper to our
nature. For unless this had been done with a mystical import, He certainly would not, even
had He been987 the most timorous and ignoble of men, have been bedewed in this unnatural
way with drops of sweat like drops of blood under the mere force of His agony.</p>
<p>Of like import is also the sentence in the narrative which tells us that an angel stood by
the Saviour and strengthened Him. For this, too, bore also on the economy entered into on
our behalf. For those who are appointed to engage in the sacred exertions of conflicts on
account of piety, have the angels from heaven to assist them. And the prayer, “Father, remove
the cup,” He uttered probably not as if He feared the death itself, but with the view of challenging
the devil by these words to erect the cross for Him. With words of deceit that per-

sonality deluded Adam; with the words of divinity, then, let the deceiver himself now be
deluded. Howbeit assuredly the will of the Son is not one thing, and the will of the Father
another.988 For He who wills what the Father wills, is found to have the Father’s will. It is
in a figure, therefore, that He says, “not my will, but Thine.” For it is not that He wishes the
cup to be removed, but that He refers to the Father’s will the right issue of His passion, and
honours thereby the Father as the First.989 For if the fathers990 style one’s disposition
gnomè,991 and if such disposition relates also to what is in consideration hidden as if by
settled purpose, how say some that the Lord, who is above all these things, bears a gnomic
will?992 Manifestly that can be only by defect of reason.</p>
<p>45. “And when He rose from prayer, and was come to His disciples, He found them
sleeping for sorrow;</p>
<p>46. And said unto them, Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.”
For in the most general sense it holds good that it is apparently not possible for any
man993 to remain altogether without experience of ill. For, as one says, the whole world lieth
in wickedness;”994 and again, “The most of the days of man are labour and trouble.”995 But
you will perhaps say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering
into temptation? Well, if one is overcome of evil—and he will be overcome unless he struggles
against it himself, and unless God protects him with His shield—that man has entered into
temptation, and is in it, and is brought under it like one that is led captive. But if one withstands
and endures, that man is indeed tempted; but he has not entered into temptation, or
fallen into it. Thus Jesus was led up of the Spirit, not indeed to enter into temptation, but
to be tempted of the devil.996 And Abraham, again, did not enter into temptation, neither
did God lead him into temptation, but He tempted (tried) him; yet He did not drive him
into temptation. The Lord Himself, moreover, tempted (tried) the disciples. Thus the wicked
one, when he tempts us, draws us into the temptations, as dealing himself with the temptations
of evil. But God, when He tempts (tries), adduces the temptations (trials) as one un-

tempted of evil. For God, it is said, “cannot be tempted of evil.”997 The devil, therefore,
drives us on by violence, drawing us to destruction; but God leads us by hand, training us
for our salvation.</p>
<p>47. “And while He yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of
the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus, and kissed Him.</p>
<p>48. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
How wonderful this endurance of evil by the Lord, who even kissed the traitor, and
spake words softer even than the kiss! For He did not say, O thou abominable, yea, utterly
abominable traitor, is this the return you make to us for so great kindness? But, somehow,
He says simply “Judas,” using the proper name, which was the address that would be used
by one who commiserated a person, or who wished to call him back, rather than of one in
anger. And He did not say, “thy Master, the Lord, thy benefactor;” but He said simply, “the
Son of man,” that is, the tender and meek one: as if He meant to say, Even supposing that
I was not your Master, or Lord, or benefactor, dost thou still betray one so guilelessly and
so tenderly affected towards thee, as even to kiss thee in the hour of thy treachery, and that,
too, when the kiss was the signal for thy treachery? Blessed art Thou, O Lord! How great is
this example of the endurance of evil that Thou hast shown us in Thine own person! how
great, too, the pattern of lowliness! Howbeit, the Lord has given us this example, to show
us that we ought not to give up offering our good counsel to our brethren, even should
nothing remarkable be effected by our words.</p>
<p>For as incurable wounds are wounds which cannot be remedied either by severe applications,
or by those which may act more pleasantly upon them;998 so999 the soul, when it is
once carried captive, and gives itself up to any kind of1000 wickedness, and refuses to consider
what is really profitable for it, although a myriad counsels should echo in it, takes no good
to itself. But just as if the sense of hearing were dead within it, it receives no benefit from
exhortations addressed to it; not because it cannot, but only because it will not. This was
what happened in the case of Judas. And yet Christ, although He knew all these things beforehand,
did not at any time, from the beginning on to the end, omit to do all in the way
of counsel that depended on Him. And inasmuch as we know that such was His practice,
we ought also unceasingly to endeavour to set those right1001 who prove careless, even although
no actual good may seem to be effected by that counsel.</p>

<p>But let these things be enough to say on the subject of the will. This word, however, “Let
the cup pass,” does not mean, Let it not come near me, or approach me. For what can pass
from Him must certainly first come nigh Him, and what does thus pass from Him must be
by Him. For if it does not reach Him, it cannot pass from Him. Accordingly, as if He now
felt it to be present, He began to be in pain, and to be troubled, and to be sore amazed, and
to be in an agony. And as if it was at hand and placed before Him, He does not merely say
“the cup,” but He indicates it by the word “this.” Therefore, as what passes from one is
something which neither has no approach nor is permanently settled with one, so the Saviour’s
first request is that the temptation which has come softly and plainly upon Him, and
associated itself lightly with Him, may be turned aside. And this is the first form of that
freedom from falling into temptation, which He also counsels the weaker disciples to make
the subject of their prayers; that, namely, which concerns the approach of temptation: for
it must needs be that offences come, but yet those to whom they come ought not to fall into
the temptation. But the most perfect mode in which this freedom from entering into
temptation is exhibited, is what He expresses in His second request, when He says not
merely, “Not as I will,” but also, “but as Thou wilt.” For with God there is no temptation in
evil; but He wills to give us good exceeding abundantly above what we ask or think. That
His will, therefore, is the perfect will, the Beloved Himself knew; and often does He say that
He has come to do that will, and not His own will,—that is to say, the will of men. For He
takes to Himself the person of men, as having been made man. Wherefore also on this occasion
He deprecates the doing of the inferior, which is His own, and begs that the superior
should be done, which is His Father’s, to wit, the divine will, which again, however, in respect
of the divinity, is one and the same will in Himself and in His Father. For it was the Father’s
will that He should pass through every trial (temptation), and the Father Himself in a marvellous
manner brought Him on this course; not indeed, with the trial itself as His goal, nor
in order simply that He might enter into that, but in order that He might prove Himself to
be above the trial, and also beyond it. And surely it is the fact that the Saviour asks neither
what is impossible, nor what is impracticable, nor what is contrary to the will of the Father.
It is something possible, for Mark makes mention of His saying, “Abba, Father, all things
are possible unto Thee;” and they are possible if He wills them, for Luke tells us that He

said, “Father, if Thou be willing, remove this cup from me.” The Holy Spirit therefore, apportioned
among the evangelists, makes up the full account of our Saviour’s whole disposition
by the expressions of these several narrators together. He does not then ask of the Father
what the Father wills not. For the words, “if Thou be willing,” were demonstrative of subjection
and docility, not of ignorance or hesitancy. And just as when we make any request that
may be accordant with his judgment, at the hand of father or ruler or any one of those whom
we respect, we are accustomed to use the address, though not certainly as if we were in doubt
about it, “if you please;” so the Saviour also said, “if Thou be willing:” not that He thought
that He willed something different, and thereafter learned the fact, but that He understood
exactly God’s willingness to remove the cup from Him, and as doing so also apprehended
justly that what He wills is also possible unto Him. For this reason the other scripture says,
“All things are possible unto Thee.” And Matthew again admirably describes the submission
and the humility, when he says, “if it be possible.” For unless we adapt the sense in this way,
some will perhaps assign an impious signification to this expression “if it be possible,” as if
there were anything impossible for God to do, except that only which He does not will to
do. Therefore the request which He made was nothing independent, nor one which pleased
Himself only, or opposed His Father’s will, but one also in conformity with the mind of
God. And yet some one may say that He is overborne and changes His mind, and asks
presently something different from what He asked before, and holds no longer by His own
will, but introduces His Father’s will. Well, such truly is the case. Nevertheless He does not
by any means make any change from one side to another; but He embraces another way,
and a different method of carrying out one and the same transaction, which is also a thing
agreeable to both; choosing, to wit, in place of the mode which is the inferior, and which
appears unsatisfying also to Himself, the superior and more admirable mode marked out
by the Father. For no doubt He did pray that the cup might pass from Him; but He says
also, “Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.” He longs painfully, on the one hand, for
its passing from Him, but (He knows that) it is better as the Father wills. For He does not
utter a petition for its not passing away now, instead of one for its removal; but when its
withdrawal is now before His view, He chooses rather that this should be ordered as the
Father wills. For there is a twofold kind1003 of withdrawal: there is one in the instance of an
object that has shown itself and reached another, and is gone at once on being followed by
it or on outrunning it, as is the case with racers when they graze each other in passing; and
there is another in the instance of an object that has sojourned and tarried with another,
and sat down by it, as in the case of a marauding band or a camp, and that after a time
withdraws on being conquered, and on gaining the opposite of a success. For if they prevail
they do not retire, but carry off with them those whom they have reduced; but if they prove
<note type="footnote">1003 δύναμις.</note>

<pb n="283"/>
unable to win the mastery, they withdraw themselves in disgrace. Now it was after the former
similitude that He wished that the cup might come into His hands, and promptly pass from
Him again very readily and quickly; but as soon as He spake thus, being at once strengthened
in His humanity by the Father’s divinity, He urges the safer petition, and desires no longer
that that should be the case, but that it might be accomplished in accordance with the
Father’s good pleasure, in glory, in constancy, and in fulness. For John, who has given us
the record of the sublimest and divinest of the Saviour’s words and deeds, heard Him speak
thus: “And the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?” Now, to drink the
cup was to discharge the ministry and the whole economy of trial with fortitude, to follow
and fulfil the Father’s determination, and to surmount all apprehensions; and, indeed, in
the very prayer which He uttered He showed that He was leaving these (apprehensions)
behind Him. For of two objects, either may be said to be removed from the other: the object
that remains may be said to be removed from the one that goes away, and the one that goes
away may be said to be removed from the one that remains. Besides, Matthew has indicated
most clearly that He did indeed pray that the cup might pass from Him, but yet that His
request was that this should take place not as He willed, but as the Father willed it. The
words given by Mark and Luke, again, ought to be introduced in their proper connection.
For Mark says, “Nevertheless not what I will, but what Thou wilt;” and Luke says, “Nevertheless
not my will, but Thine be done.” He did then express Himself to that effect, and He
did desire that His passion might abate and reach its end speedily. But it was the Father’s
will at the same time that He should carry out His conflict in a manner demanding sustained
effort,1004 and in sufficient measure. Accordingly He (the Father) adduced all that assailed
Him. But of the missiles that were hurled against Him, some were shivered in pieces, and
others were dashed back as with invulnerable arms of steel, or rather as from the stern and
immoveable rock. Blows, spittings, scourgings, death, and the lifting up in that death,1005
all came upon Him; and when all these were gone through, He became silent and endured
in patience unto the end, as if He suffered nothing, or was already dead. But when His death
was being prolonged, and when it was now overmastering Him, if we may so speak, beyond
His utmost strength, He cried out to His Father, “Why hast Thou forsaken me?” And this
exclamation was in due accordance with the requests He had previously made: Why is it
that death has been in such close conjunction with me all along up till now, and Thou dost
not yet bear the cup past me?1006 Have I not drank it already, and drained it? But if not, my
dread is that I may be utterly consumed by its continuous pressure;1007 and that is what

away, and be made of none effect.1008 Now, then, I entreat Thee, let my baptism be finished,

have been the Saviour’s meaning in this concise utterance. And He certainly spake truth
then. Nevertheless He was not forsaken. Albeit He drank out the cup at once, as His plea
had implied, and then passed away. And the vinegar which was handed to Him seems to
me to have been a symbolical thing. For the turned wine indicated very well the quick
turning and change which He sustained when He passed from His passion to impassibility,
and from death to deathlessness, and from the position of one judged to that of one judging,

<p>This prayer He also offered up Himself, falling repeatedly on His face; and on both occasions
He urged His request for not entering into temptation: both when He prayed, “If it
be possible, let this cup pass from me;” and when He said, “Nevertheless not as I will, but
as Thou wilt.” For He spoke of not entering into temptation, and He made that His prayer;
but He did not ask that He should have no trial whatsoever in these circumstances, or1011
that no manner of hardship should ever befall Him. For in the most general application it
holds good, that it does not appear to be possible for any man to remain altogether without
experience of ill: for, as one says, “The whole world lieth in wickedness;”1012 and again,
“The most of the days of man are labour and trouble,”1013 as men themselves also admit.
Short is our life, and full of sorrow. Howbeit it was not meet that He should bid them pray
directly that that curse might not be fulfilled, which is expressed thus: “Cursed is the ground
in thy works: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;”1014 or thus, “Earth thou
art, and unto earth shalt thou return.”1015 For which reason the Holy Scriptures, that indicate
in many various ways the dire distressfulness of life, designate it as a valley of weeping. And
most of all indeed is this world a scene of pain to the saints, to whom He addresses this
word, and He cannot lie in uttering it: “In the world ye shall have tribulation.”1016 And to
the same effect also He says by the prophet, “Many are the afflictions of the righteous.”1017
But I suppose that He refers to this entering not into temptation, when He speaks in the
prophet’s words of being delivered out of the afflictions. For He adds, “The Lord will deliver
him out of them all.” And this is just in accordance with the Saviour’s word, whereby He
promises that they will overcome their afflictions, and that they will participate in that victory
which He has won for them. For after saying, “In the world ye shall have tribulation,” He
added, “But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” And again, He taught them to
pray that they might not fall into temptation, when He said, “And lead us not into tempta-

tion;” which means, “Suffer us not to fall into temptation.” And to show that this did not
imply they should not be tempted, but really that they should be delivered from the evil, He
added, “But deliver us from evil.” But perhaps you will say, What difference is there between
being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation? Well, if one is overcome of evil—and
he will be overcome unless he struggles against it himself, and unless God protects him with
His shield—that man has entered into temptation, and is in it, and is brought under it like
one that is led captive. But if one withstands and endures, that man is indeed tempted; but
he has not entered into temptation, or fallen under it. Thus Jesus was led up of the Spirit,
not indeed to enter into temptation, but “to be tempted of the devil.”1018 And Abraham,
again, did not enter into temptation, neither did God lead him into temptation, but He
tempted (tried) him; yet He did not drive him into temptation. The Lord Himself, moreover,
tempted (tried) the disciples. And thus the wicked one, when he tempts us, draws us into
the temptations, as dealing himself with the temptations of evil; but God, when He tempts
(tries), adduces the temptations as one untempted of evil. For God, it is said, “cannot be
tempted of evil.”1019 The devil, therefore, drives us on by violence, drawing us to destruction;
but God leads us by the hand, training us for our salvation.</p>

<p>Now this word “I am” expresses His eternal subsistence. For if He is the reflection of
the eternal light, He must also be eternal Himself. For if the light subsists for ever, it is
evident that the reflection also subsists for ever. And that this light subsists, is known only
by its shining; neither can there be a light that does not give light. We come back, therefore,
to our illustrations. If there is day, there is light; and if there is no such thing, the sun certainly
cannot be present.1021 If, therefore, the sun had been eternal, there would also have been
endless day. Now, however, as it is not so, the day begins when the sun rises, and it ends
when the sun sets. But God is eternal light, having neither beginning nor end. And along
with Him there is the reflection, also without beginning, and everlasting. The Father, then,
being eternal, the Son is also eternal, being light of light; and if God is the light, Christ is the
reflection; and if God is also a Spirit, as it is written, “God is a Spirit,” Christ, again, is called
analogously Spirit.1022</p>

<p>But now we are doing the opposite. For whereas Christ, who is the good Shepherd, goes
in quest of one who wanders, lost among the mountains, and calls him back when he flees
from Him, and is at pains to take him up on His shoulders when He has found him, we, on
the contrary, harshly spurn such a one even when He approaches us. Yet let us not consult
so miserably for ourselves, and let us not in this way be driving the sword against ourselves.
For when people set themselves either to do evil or to do good to others, what they do is
certainly not confined to the carrying out of their will on those others; but just as they attach
themselves to iniquity or to goodness, they will themselves become possessed either by divine
virtues or by unbridled passions. And the former will become the followers and comrades
of the good angels; and both in this world and in the other, with the enjoyment of perfect
peace and immunity from all ills, they will fulfil the most blessed destinies unto all eternity,
and in God’s fellowship they will be for ever (in possession of) the supremest good. But
these latter will fall away at once from the peace of God and from peace with themselves,
and both in this world and after death they will abide with the spirits of blood-guiltiness.1026
Wherefore let us not thrust from us those who seek a penitent return; but let us receive them
gladly, and number them once more with the stedfast, and make up again what is defective
in them.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Julius Africanus.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 200–232–245.</del>In a former volume, strengthened by a word from Archbishop
Usher,1027 I have not hesitated to claim for Theophilus of Antioch a primary place among
Christian chronologists. It is no detraction from the fame of our author to admit this, and
truth requires it. But the great Alexandrian school must again come into view when we
speak of any considerable achievements, among early Christian writers, in this important
element of all biblical, in fact, all historical, science. Africanus was a pupil of Heraclas, and
we must therefore date his pupilage in Alexandria before a.d. 232, when Dionysius succeeded
Heraclas in the presidency of that school. It appears that in a.d. 226 he was performing some
duty in behalf of Emmaus (Nicopolis) in Palestine; but Heraclas, who had acted subordinately
as Origen’s assistant as early as a.d. 218, could not have become the head of the school, even
provisionally, till after Origen’s unhappy ordination.1028 Let us assume the period of our
author’s attending the school under Heraclas to be between a.d. 228 and a.d. 232, however.
We may then venture to reckon his birth as circa a.d. 200. And, if he became “bishop of
Emmaus,” it could hardly have been before the year 240, when he was of ripe age and experience.
He adds additional lustre to the age of Gregory Thaumaturgus and Dionysius, as well
as to that of their common mother in letters and theology, the already ancient academy of
Pantænus and of Clement. His reviving credit in modern times has been largely due to the
learned criticism of Dr. Routh, to whose edition of these Fragments the student must necessarily
apply. Their chief interest arises from the important specimen which treats of the
difficult question of the genealogies of our Lord contained in the evangelists. For a succinct
statement of the points involved, and for a candid concession that they were not preserved
to meet what modern curiosity would prefer to see established, I know of nothing more
satisfactory than the commentary of Wordsworth,1029 from which I have borrowed almost
wholly one of my elucidations.</p>
<p>The reader will remember the specimen of our author’s critical judgment which is given
with the works of Origen.1030 He differed with that great author, and the Church Catholic

has sustained his judgment as just. I regret that the Edinburgh editors thought it necessary
to make the Letter to Origen concerning the Apocryphal Book of Susannah a mere preface to
Origen’s answer. It might have been quoted there as a preface; but it is too important not
to be included here, with the other fragments of his noble contributions to primitive
Christian literature.</p>
<p>It does not clearly appear, from the Edinburgh edition, who the translator is; but here
follows the
Translator’s Introductory Notice.</p>
<p>The principal facts known to us in the life of Africanus are derived from himself and
the Chronicon of Eusebius. He says of himself that he went to Alexandria on account of the
fame of Heraclas. In the Chronicon, under the year 226, it is stated that “Nicopolis in Palestine,
which formerly bore the name of Emmaus, was built, Africanus, the author of the Chronology,
acting as ambassador on behalf of it, and having the charge of it.” Dionysius Bar-Salibi
speaks of Africanus as bishop of Emmaus.</p>
<p>Eusebius describes Africanus as being the author of a work called κεστοί.1031 Suidas
says that this book detailed various kinds of cures, consisting of charms and written forms,
and such like. Some have supposed that such a work is not likely to have been written by a
Christian writer: they appeal also to the fact that no notice is taken of the κεστοί by Jerome
in his notice of Africanus, nor by Rufinus in his translation of Eusebius. They therefore
deem the clause in Eusebius an interpolation, and they suppose that two bore the name of
Africanus,—one the author of the κεστοί, the other the Christian writer. Suidas identifies
them, says that he was surnamed Sextus, and that he was a Libyan philosopher.</p>
<p>The works ascribed to Africanus, beside the Cesti, are the following:—</p>
<p>1. Five Books of Chronology. Photius1032 says of this work, that it was concise, but
omitted nothing of importance. It began with the cosmogony of Moses, and went down to
the advent of Christ. It summarized also the events from the time of Christ to the reign of
the Emperor Macrinus.</p>
<p>2. A very famous letter to Aristides, in which he endeavoured to reconcile the apparent
discrepancies in the genealogies of Christ given by Matthew and Luke.</p>
<p>3. A letter to Origen, in which he endeavoured to prove that the story of Susanna in
Daniel was a forgery. A translation of this letter has been given with the Works of Origen.
The Acts of Symphorosa and her Seven Sonsare attributed in the mss. to Africanus; but
no ancient writer speaks of him as the author of this work.</p>

<p>[Africanus on the Genealogy in the Holy Gospels.1033—Some indeed incorrectly allege
that this discrepant enumeration and mixing of the names both of priestly men, as they
think, and royal, was made properly,1034 in order that Christ might be shown rightfully to
be both Priest and King; as if any one disbelieved this, or had any other hope than this, that
Christ is the High Priest of His Father, who presents our prayers to Him, and a supramundane
King, who rules by the Spirit those whom He has delivered, a cooperator in the government
of all things. And this is announced to us not by the catalogue of the tribes, nor by the
mixing of the registered generations, but by the patriarchs and prophets. Let us not therefore
descend to such religious trifling as to establish the kingship and priesthood of Christ by
the interchanges of the names. For the priestly tribe of Levi, too, was allied with the kingly
tribe of Juda, through the circumstance that Aaron married Elizabeth the sister of Naasson,
1035 and that Eleazar again married the daughter of Phatiel,1036 and begat children. The
evangelists, therefore, would thus have spoken falsely, affirming what was not truth, but a
fictitious commendation. And for this reason the one traced the pedigree of Jacob the father
of Joseph from David through Solomon; the other traced that of Heli also, though in a different
way, the father of Joseph, from Nathan the son of David. And they ought not indeed
to have been ignorant that both orders of the ancestors enumerated are the generation of
David, the royal tribe of Juda.1037 For if Nathan was a prophet, so also was Solomon, and
so too the father of both of them; and there were prophets belonging to many of the tribes,
but priests belonging to none of the tribes, save the Levites only. To no purpose, then, is

this fabrication of theirs. Nor shall an assertion of this kind prevail in the Church of Christ
against the exact truth, so as that a lie should be contrived for the praise and glory of Christ.
For who does not know that most holy word of the apostle also, who, when he was preaching
and proclaiming the resurrection of our Saviour, and confidently affirming the truth, said
with great fear, “If any say that Christ is not risen, and we assert and have believed this, and
both hope for and preach that very thing, we are false witnesses of God, in alleging that He
raised up Christ, whom He raised not up?”1038 And if he who glorifies God the Father is
thus afraid lest he should seem a false witness in narrating a marvellous fact, how should
not he be justly afraid, who tries to establish the truth by a false statement, preparing an
untrue opinion? For if the generations are different, and trace down no genuine seed to
Joseph, and if all has been stated only with the view of establishing the position of Him who
was to be born—to confirm the truth, namely, that He who was to be would be king and
priest, there being at the same time no proof given, but the dignity of the words being brought
down to a feeble hymn,—it is evident that no praise accrues to God from that, since it is a
falsehood, but rather judgment returns on him who asserts it, because he vaunts an unreality
as though it were reality. Therefore, that we may expose the ignorance also of him who
speaks thus, and prevent any one from stumbling at this folly, I shall set forth the true history
of these matters.]</p>

<p>For1039 whereas in Israel the names of their generations were enumerated either accord-
ing to nature or according to law,—according to nature, indeed, by the succession of legitimate
offspring, and according to law whenever another raised up children to the name of
a brother dying childless; for because no clear hope of resurrection was yet given them, they
had a representation of the future promise in a kind of mortal resurrection, with the view
of perpetuating the name of one deceased;—whereas, then, of those entered in this genealogy,
some succeeded by legitimate descent as son to father, while others begotten in one family
were introduced to another in name, mention is therefore made of both—of those who were
progenitors in fact, and of those who were so only in name. Thus neither of the evangelists
is in error, as the one reckons by nature and the other by law. For the several generations,
viz., those descending from Solomon and those from Nathan, were so intermingled1040 by
the raising up of children to the childless,1041 and by second marriages, and the raising up
of seed, that the same persons are quite justly reckoned to belong at one time to the one,
and at another to the other, i.e., to their reputed or to their actual fathers. And hence it is
that both these accounts are true, and come down to Joseph, with considerable intricacy
indeed, but yet quite accurately.</p>

<head>III.</head>
<p>But in order that what I have said may be made evident, I shall explain the interchange1042
of the generations. If we reckon the generations from David through Solomon,
Matthan is found to be the third from the end, who begat Jacob the father of Joseph. But if,
with Luke, we reckon them from Nathan the son of David, in like manner the third from
the end is Melchi, whose son was Heli the father of Joseph. For Joseph was the son of Heli,
the son of Melchi.1043 As Joseph, therefore, is the object proposed to us, we have to show
how it is that each is represented as his father, both Jacob as descending from Solomon, and
Heli as descending from Nathan: first, how these two, Jacob and Heli, were brothers; and
then also how the fathers of these, Matthan and Melchi, being of different families, are
shown to be the grandfathers of Joseph. Well, then, Matthan and Melchi, having taken the
same woman to wife in succession, begat children who were uterine brothers, as the law did
not prevent a widow,1044 whether such by divorce or by the death of her husband, from
marrying another. By Estha, then—for such is her name according to tradition—Matthan
first, the descendant of Solomon, begets Jacob; and on Matthan’s death, Melchi, who traces
his descent back to Nathan, being of the same tribe but of another family, having married
her, as has been already said, had a son Heli. Thus, then, we shall find Jacob and Heli uterine
brothers, though of different families. And of these, the one Jacob having taken the wife of
his brother Heli, who died childless, begat by her the third, Joseph—his son by nature and
by account.1045 Whence also it is written, “And Jacob begat Joseph.” But according to law
he was the son of Heli, for Jacob his brother raised up seed to him. Wherefore also the
genealogy deduced through him will not be made void, which the Evangelist Matthew in
his enumeration gives thus: “And Jacob begat Joseph.” But Luke, on the other hand, says,
“Who was the son, as was supposed1046 (for this, too, he adds), of Joseph, the son of Heli,
<note type="footnote">1042 The reading of the Codex Regius is ἀκολουθίαν , i.e., succession; the other leading mss. give ἐπολλαγήν,
i.e. interchange or confusion.</note>
<note type="footnote">1043 But in our text in Luke iii. 23, 24, and so, too, in the Vulgate, Matthat and Levi are inserted between Heli
and Melchi. It may be that these two names were not found in the copy used by Africanus.</note>
<note type="footnote">1044 Here Africanus applies the term “widow” (χηρεύουσαν) to one divorced an well as to one bereaved.</note>
<note type="footnote">1045 κατὰ λόγον.</note>
<note type="footnote">1046 Two things may be remarked here: first, that Africanus refers the phrase “as was supposed” not only to
the words “son of Joseph,” but also to those that follow, “the son of Heli;” so that Christ would be the son of
Joseph by legal adoption, just in the same way as Joseph was the son of Heli, which would lead to the absurd
and impious conclusion that Christ was the son of Mary and a brother of Joseph married by her after the death
of the latter. And second, that in the genealogy here assigned to Luke, Melchi holds the third place; whence it
would seem either that Africanus’s memory had failed him, or that as Bede conjectures in his copy of the Gospel
Melchi stood in place of Matthat (Migne). [A probable solution.]</note>

the son of Melchi.” For it was not possible more distinctly to state the generation according
to law; and thus in this mode of generation he has entirely omitted the word “begat” to the
very end, carrying back the genealogy by way of conclusion to Adam and to God.1047</p>

<p>Nor indeed is this incapable of proof, neither is it a rash conjecture. For the kinsmen
of the Saviour after the flesh, whether to magnify their own origin or simply to state the fact,
but at all events speaking truth, have also handed down the following account: Some Idumean
robbers attacking Ascalon, a city of Palestine, besides other spoils which they took from a
temple of Apollo, which was built near the walls, carried off captive one Antipater, son of
a certain Herod, a servant of the temple. And as the priest1048 was not able to pay the ransom
for his son, Antipater was brought up in the customs of the Idumeans, and afterwards enjoyed
the friendship of Hyrcanus, the high priest of Judea. And being sent on an embassy to
Pompey on behalf of Hyrcanus, and having restored to him the kingdom which was being
wasted by Aristobulus his brother, he was so fortunate as to obtain the title of procurator
of Palestine.1049 And when Antipater was treacherously slain through envy of his great good
fortune, his son Herod succeeded him, who was afterwards appointed king of Judea under
Antony and Augustus by a decree of the senate. His sons were Herod and the other tetrarchs.
These accounts are given also in the histories of the Greeks.1050</p>
<note type="footnote">1048 The word “priest” is used here perhaps improperly for “servant of the temple,” i.e., ἱερεύς for ἱερόδουλος.</note>

Idumea by Alexander king of the Jews, and laid the foundation of the power to which his descendants rose. He
acquired great wealth, and was on terms of friendship with Ascalon, Gaza, and the Arabians.</note>

<p>But as up to that time the genealogies of the Hebrews had been registered in the public
archives, and those, too, which were traced back to the proselytes1051—as, for example, to
Achior the Ammanite, and Ruth the Moabitess, and those who left Egypt along with the
Israelites, and intermarried with them—Herod, knowing that the lineage of the Israelites
contributed nothing to him, and goaded by the consciousness of his ignoble birth, burned
the registers of their families. This he did, thinking that he would appear to be of noble birth,
if no one else could trace back his descent by the public register to the patriarchs or proselytes,
and to that mixed race called georæ.1052 A few, however, of the studious, having private records

way from the archives, pride themselves in preserving the memory of their noble descent;
and among these happen to be those already mentioned, called desposyni,1053 on account
of their connection with the family of the Saviour. And these coming from Nazara and
Cochaba, Judean villages, to other parts of the country, set forth the above-named genealogy1054
as accurately as possible from the Book of Days.1055 Whether, then, the case stand
thus or not, no one could discover a more obvious explanation, according to my own
opinion and that of any sound judge. And let this suffice us for the matter, although it is

reading should be ἄχρι τῶν ἀρχιπροσηλύτων, i.e., back to the “chief proselytes,”—these being, as it were, patriarchs
among the proselytes, like Achior, and those who joined the Israelites on their flight from Egypt.</note>

Martyr has the form γηόραν in Dialogue with Trypho, ch. cxxii. The root of the term is evidently the Hebrew

<head>II.—Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ.1057</head>
<p>The best introduction to this production will be the following preface, as given in
Migne:—Many men of learning thus far have been of opinion that the narrative by Africanus
of events happening in Persia on Christ’s birth,1058 is a fragment of that famous work which
Sextus Julius Africanus, a Christian author of the third century after Christ, composed on
the history of the world in the chronological order of events up to the reign of Macrinus,
and presented in five books to Alexander, son of Mammæa, with the view of obtaining the
restoration of his native town Emmaus. With the same expectation which I see incited
Lambecius and his compendiator Nesselius, I, too, set myself with the greatest eagerness to
go over the codices of our Electoral Library.…But, as the common proverb goes, I found
coals instead of treasure. This narrative, so far from its being to be ascribed to a writer well
reputed by the common voice of antiquity, does not contain anything worthy of the genius
of the chronographer Africanus. Wherefore, since by the unanimous testimony of the ancients
he was a man of consummate learning and sharpest judgment, while the author of the Cesti,
which also puts forward the name of Africanus, has been long marked by critics with the
character either of anile credulity, or of a marvellous propensity to superstitious fancies, I
can readily fall in with the opinion of those who think that he is a different person from the
chronographer, and would ascribe this wretched production also to him. But, dear reader,
on perusing these pages, if your indignation is not stirred against the man’s rashness, you
will at least join with me in laughing at his prodigious follies, and will learn, at the same
time, that the testimonies of men most distinguished for learning are not to be rated so
highly as to supersede personal examination when opportunity permits.
Events in Persia: On the Incarnation of Our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Christ first of all became known from Persia. For nothing escapes the learned jurists of
that country, who investigate all things with the utmost care. The facts,1059 therefore, which
are inscribed upon the golden plates,1060 and laid up in the royal temples, I shall record; for

An absurd appendix, indeed.]</note>

<pb n="304"/>
it is from the temples there, and the priests connected with them, that the name of Christ
has been heard of. Now there is a temple there to Juno, surpassing even the royal palace,
which temple Cyrus, that prince instructed in all piety, built, and in which he dedicated in
honour of the gods golden and silver statues, and adorned them with precious stones,—that
I may not waste words in a profuse description of that ornamentation. Now about that time
(as the records on the plates testify), the king having entered the temple, with the view of
getting an interpretation of certain dreams, was addressed by the priest Prupupius thus: I
congratulate thee, master: Juno has conceived. And the king, smiling, said to him, Has she
who is dead conceived? And he said, Yes, she who was dead has come to life again, and begets
life. And the king said, What is this? explain it to me. And he replied, In truth, master, the
time for these things is at hand. For during the whole night the images, both of gods and
goddesses, continued beating the ground, saying to each other, Come, let us congratulate
Juno. And they say to me, Prophet, come forward; congratulate Juno, for she has been embraced.
And I said, How can she be embraced who no longer exists? To which they reply,
She has come to life again, and is no longer called Juno,1061 but Urania. For the mighty Sol
has embraced her. Then the goddesses say to the gods, making the matter plainer, Pege1062
is she who is embraced; for did not Juno espouse an artificer? And the gods say, That she is
rightly called Pege, we admit. Her name, moreover, is Myria; for she bears in her womb, as
in the deep, a vessel of a myriad talents’ burden. And as to this title Pege, let it be understood
thus: This stream of water sends forth the perennial stream of spirit,—a stream containing
but a single fish,1063 taken with the hook of Divinity, and sustaining the whole world with
its flesh as though it were in the sea. You have well said, She has an artificer [in espousal];
but by that espousal she does not bear an artificer on an equality with herself. For this artificer
who is born, the son of the chief artificer, framed by his excellent skill the roof of the third
heavens, and established by his word this lower world, with its threefold sphere1064 of habitation.</p>
<p>Thus, then, the statues disputed with each other concerning Juno and Pege, and [at
length] with one voice they said: When the day is finished, we all, gods and goddesses, shall
know the matter clearly. Now, therefore, master, tarry for the rest of the day. For the matter
shall certainly come to pass. For that which emerges is no common affair.
1061 There is a play upon the words, perhaps, in the original. The Greek term for Juno (῞Ηρα) may be derived
from ἔρα, terra, so that the antithesis intended is, “She is no longer called Earthly, but Heavenly.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1062 i.e., Fountain, Spring, or Stream.</note>
<note type="footnote">1063 The initial letters of the Greek ᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ, i.e., “Jesus Christ the Son of God the
Savior,” when joined together, make the word ἱχθύς, i.e., fish; and the fathers used the word, therefore, as a
mystic symbol of Christ, who could live in the depth of our mortality as in the abyss of the sea. [Vol. ii. p. 297.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1064 i.e., as sea, land, and sky</note>

<pb n="305"/>
<p>And when the king abode there and watched the statues, the harpers of their own accord
began to strike their harps, and the muses to sing; and whatsoever creatures were within,
whether quadruped or fowl, in silver and gold, uttered their several voices. And as the king
shuddered, and was filled with great fear, he was about to retire. For he could not endure
the spontaneous tumult. The priest therefore said to him, Remain, O king, for the full revelation
is at hand which the God of gods has chosen to declare to us.</p>
<p>And when these things were said, the roof was opened, and a bright star descended and
stood above the pillar of Pege, and a voice was heard to this effect: Sovereign Pege, the mighty
Son has sent me to make the announcement to you, and at the same time to do you service
in parturition, designing blameless nuptials with you, O mother of the chief of all ranks of
being, bride of the triune Deity. And the child begotten by extraordinary generation is called
the Beginning and the End,—the beginning of salvation, and the end of perdition.
And when this word was spoken, all the statues fell upon their faces, that of Pege alone
standing, on which also a royal diadem was found placed, having on its upper side a star set
in a carbuncle and an emerald. And on its lower side the star rested.</p>
<p>And the king forthwith gave orders to bring in all the interpreters of prodigies, and the
sages who were under his dominion. And when all the heralds sped with their proclamations,
all these assembled in the temple. And when they saw the star above Pege, and the diadem
with the star and the stone, and the statues lying on the floor, they said: O king, a root (offspring)
divine and princely has risen, bearing the image of the King of heaven and earth.
For Pege-Myria is the daughter of the Bethlehemite Pege. And the diadem is the mark of a
king, and the star is a celestial announcement of portents to fall on the earth. Out of Judah
has arisen a kingdom which shall subvert all the memorials of the Jews. And the prostration
of the gods upon the floor prefigured the end of their honour. For he who comes, being of
more ancient dignity, shall displace all the recent. Now therefore, O king, send to Jerusalem.
For you will find the Christ of the Omnipotent God borne in bodily form in the bodily arms
of a woman. And the star remained above the statue of Pege, called the Celestial, until the
wise men came forth, and then it went with them.</p>
<p>And then, in the depth of evening, Dionysus appeared in the temple, unaccompanied
by the Satyrs, and said to the images: Pege is not one of us, but stands far above us, in that
she gives birth to a man whose conception is in divine fashion.1065 O priest Prupupius! what
dost thou tarrying here? An action, indicated in writings of old,1066 has come upon us, and
we shall be convicted as false by a person of power and energy.1067 Wherein we have been
deceivers, we have been deceivers; and wherein we have ruled, we have ruled. No longer

give we oracular responses. Gone from us is our honour. Without glory and reward are we
become. There is One, and One only, who receives again at the hands of all His proper
honour. For the rest, be not disturbed.1068 No longer shall the Persians exact tribute of earth
and sky. For He who established these things is at hand, to bring practical tribute1069 to
Him who sent Him, to renew the ancient image, and to put image with image, and bring
the dissimilar to similarity. Heaven rejoices with earth, and earth itself exults at receiving
matter of exultation from heaven. Things which have not happened above, have happened
on earth beneath. He whom the order of the blessed has not seen, is seen by the order of the
miserable. Flame threatens those; dew attends these. To Myria is given the blessed lot of
bearing Pege in Bethlehem, and of conceiving grace of grace. Judæa has seen its bloom, and
this country is fading. To Gentiles and aliens, salvation is come; to the wretched, relief is
ministered abundantly. With right do women dance, and say, Lady Pege, Spring-bearer,
thou mother of the heavenly constellation. Thou cloud that bringest us dew after heat, remember
thy dependants, O mistress.</p>
<p>The king then, without delay, sent some of the Magi under his dominion with gifts, the
star showing them the way. And when they returned, they narrated to the men of that time
those same things which were also written on the plates of gold, and which were to the following
effect:—</p>
<p>When we came to Jerusalem, the sign, together with our arrival, roused all the people.
How is this, say they, that wise men of the Persians are here, and that along with them there
is this strange stellar phenomenon? And the chief of the Jews interrogated us in this way:
What is this that attends you,1070 and with what purpose are you here? And we said: He
whom ye call Messias is born. And they were confounded, and dared not withstand us. But
they said to us, By the justice of Heaven, tell us what ye know of this matter. And we made
answer to them: Ye labour under unbelief; and neither without an oath nor with an oath do
ye believe us, but ye follow your own heedless counsel. For the Christ, the Son of the Most
High, is born, and He is the subverter of your law and synagogues. And therefore is it that,
struck with this most excellent response as with a dart,1071 ye hear in bitterness this name
which has come upon you suddenly. And they then, taking counsel together, urged us to
accept their gifts, and tell to none that such an event had taken place in that land of theirs,
lest, as they say, a revolt rise against us. But we replied: We have brought gifts in His honour,
with the view of proclaiming those mighty things which we know to have happened in our

country on occasion of His birth; and do ye bid us take your bribes, and conceal the things
which have been communicated to us by the Divinity who is above the heavens, and neglect
the commandments of our proper King? And after urging many considerations on us, they
gave the matter up. And when the king of Judæa sent for us and had some converse with
us, and put to us certain questions as to the statements we made to him, we acted in the
same manner, until he was thoroughly enraged at our replies. We left him accordingly,
without giving any greater heed to him than to any common person.</p>
<p>And we came to that place then to which we were sent, and saw the mother and the
child, the star indicating to us the royal babe. And we said to the mother: What art thou
named, O renowned mother? And she says: Mary, masters. And we said to her: Whence art
thou sprung?1072 And she replies: From this district of the Bethlehemites.1073 Then said
we: Hast thou not had a husband? And she answers: I was only betrothed with a view to the
marriage covenant, my thoughts being far removed from this. For I had no mind to come
to this. And while I was giving very little concern to it, when a certain Sabbath dawned, and
straightway at the rising of the sun, an angel appeared to me bringing me suddenly the glad
tidings of a son. And in trouble I cried out, Be it not so to me, Lord, for I have not a husband.
And he persuaded me to believe, that by the will of God I should have this son.</p>
<p>Then said we to her: Mother, mother, all the gods of the Persians have called thee blessed.
Thy glory is great; for thou art exalted above all women of renown, and thou art shown to
be more queenly than all queens.</p>
<p>The child, moreover, was seated on the ground, being, as she said, in His second year,
and having in part the likeness of His mother. And she had long hands,1074 and a body
somewhat delicate; and her colour was like that of ripe wheat;1075 and she was of a round
face, and had her hair bound up. And as we had along with us a servant skilled in painting
from the life, we brought with us to our country a likeness of them both; and it was placed
by our hand in the sacred1076 temple, with this inscription on it: To Jove the Sun, the mighty
God, the King of Jesus, the power of Persia dedicated this.</p>
<p>And taking the child up, each of us in turn, and bearing Him in our arms, we saluted
Him and worshipped Him, and presented to Him gold, and myrrh, and frankincense, addressing
Him thus: We gift Thee with Thine own, O Jesus, Ruler of heaven. Ill would things
unordered be ordered, wert Thou not at hand. In no other way could things heavenly be

brought into conjunction with things earthly, but by Thy descent. Such service cannot be
discharged, if only the servant is sent us, as when the Master Himself is present; neither can
so much be achieved when the king sends only his satraps to war, as when the king is there
himself. It became the wisdom of Thy system, that Thou shouldst deal in this manner with
men.1077</p>
<p>And the child leaped and laughed at our caresses and words. And when we had bidden
the mother farewell,1078 and when she had shown us honour, and we had testified to her
the reverence which became us, we came again to the place in which we lodged. And at
eventide there appeared to us one of a terrible and fearful countenance, saying: Get ye out
quickly, lest ye be taken in a snare. And we in terror said: And who is he, O divine leader,
that plotteth against so august an embassage? And he replied: Herod; but get you up
straightway and depart in safety and peace.</p>
<p>And we made speed to depart thence in all earnestness; and we reported in Jerusalem
all that we had seen. Behold, then, the great things that we have told you regarding Christ;
and we saw Christ our Saviour, who was made known as both God and man. To Him be
the glory and the power unto the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

a sort of account of it by the hand of their astrologers in cycles and myriads of years; which
some of those who have had the repute of studying such subjects profoundly have in a
summary way called lunar years; and inclining no less than others to the mythical, they think
they fall in with the eight or nine thousands of years which the Egyptian priests in Plato

<p>For why should I speak of the three myriad years of the Phoenicians, or of the follies of
the Chaldeans, their forty-eight myriads? For the Jews, deriving their origin from them as
descendants of Abraham, having been taught a modest mind, and one such as becomes
men, together with the truth by the spirit of Moses, have handed down to us, by their extant
Hebrew histories, the number of 5500 years as the period up to the advent of the Word of
salvation, that was announced to the world in the time of the sway of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>When men multiplied on the earth, the angels of heaven came together with the

in my opinion, is that the descendants of Seth are called the sons of God on account of the
righteous men and patriarchs who have sprung from him, even down to the Saviour Himself;
but that the descendants of Cain are named the seed of men, as having nothing divine in
them, on account of the wickedness of their race and the inequality of their nature, being a
mixed people, and having stirred the indignation of God.1082 But if it is thought that these
refer to angels, we must take them to be those who deal with magic and jugglery, who taught
the women the motions of the stars and the knowledge of things celestial, by whose power
they conceived the giants as their children, by whom wickedness came to its height on the

<p>God decreed to destroy the whole race of the living by a flood, having threatened that
men should not survive beyond 120 years. Nor let it be deemed a matter of difficulty, because
some lived afterwards a longer period than that. For the space of time meant was 100 years
up to the flood in the case of the sinners of that time; for they were 20 years old. God instructed
Noe, who pleased him on account of his righteousness, to prepare an ark; and when it
was finished, there entered it Noe himself and his sons, his wife and his daughters-in-law,
and firstlings of every living creature, with a view to the duration of the race. And Noe was
600 years old when the flood came on. And when the water abated, the ark settled on the
mountains of Ararat, which we know to be in Parthia;1085 but some say that they are at
Celænæ1086 of Phrygia, and I have seen both places. And the flood prevailed for a year, and
then the earth became dry. And they came out of the ark in pairs, as may be found, and not
in the manner in which they had entered, viz., distinguished according to their species, and
were blessed by God. And each of these things indicates something useful to us.</p>

<p>From this rises the appellation of the Hebrews. For the word Hebrews is interpreted to
mean those who migrate across, viz., who crossed the Euphrates with Abraham; and it is not
derived, as some think, from the fore-mentioned Heber. From the flood and Noe, therefore,
to Abraham’s entrance into the promised land, there are in all 1015 years; and from Adam,
in 20 generations 3277 years.</p>

<p>Of Abraham and Lot.</p>
<p>When a famine pressed the land of Canaan, Abraham came down to Egypt; and fearing
lest he should be put out of the way on account of the beauty of his wife, he pretended that
he was her brother. But Pharaoh took her to himself when she was commended to him; for
this is the name the Egyptians give their kings. And he was punished by God; and Abraham,
along with all pertaining to him, was dismissed enriched. In Canaan, Abraham’s shepherds
and Lot’s contended with each other; and with mutual consent they separated, Lot choosing
to dwell in Sodom on account of the fertility and beauty of the land, which had five cities,
Sodom, Gomorrah, Adama, Seboim, Segor, and as many kings. On these their neighbours
the four Syrian kings made war, whose leader was Chodollogomor king of Ælam. And they
met by the Salt Sea, which is now called the Dead Sea. In it I have seen very many wonderful
things. For that water sustains no living thing, and dead bodies are carried beneath its depths,
while the living do not readily even dip under it. Lighted torches are borne upon it, but
when extinguished they sink. And there are the springs of bitumen; and it yields alum and
salt a little different from the common kinds, for they are pungent and transparent. And
wherever fruit is found about it, it is found full of a thick, foul smoke. And the water acts
as a cure to those who use it, and it is drained in a manner contrary to any other water.1092
And if it had not the river Jordan feeding it like a shell,1093 and to a great extent withstanding
its tendency, it would have failed more rapidly than appears. There is also by it a great
quantity of the balsam plant; but it is supposed to have been destroyed by God on account
of the impiety of the neighbouring people.</p>

<head>XIII.1105</head>
<p>1. Up to the time of the Olympiads there is no certain history among the Greeks, all
things before that date being confused, and in no way consistent with each other. But these
Olympiads were thoroughly investigated1106 by many, as the Greeks made up the records
of their history not according to long spaces, but in periods of four years. For which reason
I shall select the most remarkable of the mythical narratives before the time of the first
Olympiad, and rapidly run over them. But those after that period, at least those that are
notable, I shall take together, Hebrew events in connection with Greek, according to their
dates, examining carefully the affairs of the Hebrews, and touching more cursorily on those
of the Greeks; and my plan will be as follows: Taking up some single event in Hebrew history
synchronous with another in Greek history, and keeping by it as the main subject, subtracting
or adding as may seem needful in the narrative, I shall note what Greek or Persian of note,
or remarkable personage of any other nationality, flourished at the date of that event in
Hebrew history; and thus I may perhaps attain the object which I propose to myself.</p>
<p>2. The most famous exile that befell the Hebrews, then—to wit, when they were led
captive by Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon—lasted 70 years, as Jeremias had prophesied.
Berosus the Babylonian, moreover, makes mention of Nabuchodonosor. And after the 70
years of captivity, Cyrus became king of the Persians at the time of the 55th Olympiad, as
may be ascertained from the Bibliothecæ of Diodorus and the histories of Thallus and Castor,
and also from Polybius and Phlegon, and others besides these, who have made the
Olympiads a subject of study. For the date is a matter of agreement among them all. And
Cyrus then, in the first year of his reign, which was the first year of the 55th Olympiad, effected
the first partial restoration of the people by the hand of Zorobabel, with whom also
was Jesus the son of Josedec, since the period of 70 years was now fulfilled, as is narrated in
Esdra the Hebrew historian. The narratives of the beginning of the sovereignty of Cyrus
and the end of the captivity accordingly coincide. And thus, according to the reckoning of
the Olympiads, there will be found a like harmony of events even to our time. And by following
this, we shall also make the other narratives fit in with each other in the same manner.</p>
<p>3. But if the Attic time-reckoning is taken as the standard for affairs prior to these, then
from Ogygus, who was believed by them to be an autochthon, in whose time also the first
great flood took place in Attica, while Phoroneus reigned over the Argives, as Acusilaus
relates, up to the date of the first Olympiad, from which period the Greeks thought they
could fix dates accurately, there are altogether 1020 years; which number both coincides
with the above-mentioned, and will be established by what follows. For these things are also

recorded by the Athenian1107 historians Hellanicus and Philochorus, who record Attic affairs;
and by Castor and Thallus, who record Syrian affairs; and by Diodorus, who writes a universal
history in his Bibliothecæ; and by Alexander Polyhistor, and by some of our own time, yet
more carefully, and1108 by all the Attic writers. Whatever narrative of note, therefore, meets
us in these 1020 years, shall be given in its proper place.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with this writing, therefore, we affirm that Ogygus, who gave his name
to the first flood, and was saved when many perished, lived at the time of the exodus of the
people from Egypt along with Moses.1109 And this we make out in the following manner.
From Ogygus up to the first Olympiad already mentioned, it will be shown that there are
1020 years; and from the first Olympiad to the first year of the 55th, that is the first year of
King Cyrus, which was also the end of the captivity, are 217 years. From Ogygus, therefore,
to Cyrus are 1237. And if one carries the calculation backwards from the end of the captivity,
there are 1237 years. Thus, by analysis, the same period is found to the first year of the exodus
of Israel under Moses from Egypt, as from the 55th Olympiad to Ogygus, who founded
Eleusis. And from this point we get a more notable beginning for Attic chronography.</p>
<p>5. So much, then, for the period prior to Ogygus. And at his time Moses left Egypt. And
we demonstrate in the following manner how reliable is the statement that this happened
at that date. From the exodus of Moses up to Cyrus, who reigned after the captivity, are
1237 years. For the remaining years of Moses are 40. The years of Jesus, who led the people
after him, are 25; those of the elders, who were judges after Jesus, are 30; those of the judges,
whose history is given in the book of Judges, are 490; those of the priests Eli and Samuel are
90; those of the successive kings of the Hebrews are 490. Then come the 70 years of the captivity,
1110 the last year of which was the first year of the reign of Cyrus, as we have already
said.</p>
<p>6. And from Moses, then, to the first Olympiad there are 1020 years, as to the first year
of the 55th Olympiad from the same are 1237, in which enumeration the reckoning of the
Greeks coincides with us. And after Ogygus, by reason of the vast destruction caused by the
flood, the present land of Attica remained without a king up to Cecrops, a period of 189
years. For Philochorus asserts that the Actæus who is said to have succeeded Ogygus, or
whatever other fictitious names are adduced, never existed. And again: From Ogygus,
therefore, to Cyrus, says he, the same period is reckoned as from Moses to the same date,
viz., 1237 years; and some of the Greeks also record that Moses lived at that same time.

Polemo, for instance, in the first book of his Greek History, says: In the time of Apis, son of
Phoroneus, a division of the army of the Egyptians left Egypt, and settled in the Palestine
called Syrian, not far from Arabia: these are evidently those who were with Moses. And
Apion the son of Poseidonius, the most laborious of grammarians, in his book Against the
Jews, and in the fourth book of his History, says that in the time of Inachus king of Argos,
when Amosis reigned over Egypt, the Jews revolted under the leadership of Moses. And
Herodotus also makes mention of this revolt, and of Amosis, in his second book, and in a
certain way also of the Jews themselves, reckoning them among the circumcised, and calling
them the Assyrians of Palestine, perhaps through Abraham. And Ptolemy the Mendesian,
who narrates the history of the Egyptians from the earliest times, gives the same account of
all these things; so that among them in general there is no difference worth notice in the
chronology.</p>
<p>7. It should be observed, further, that all the legendary accounts which are deemed
specially remarkable by the Greeks by reason of their antiquity, are found to belong to a
period posterior to Moses; such as their floods and conflagrations, Prometheus, Io, Europa,
the Sparti, the abduction of Proserpine, their mysteries, their legislations, the deeds of Dionysus,
Perseus, the Argonauts, the Centaurs, the Minotaur, the affairs of Troy, the labours
of Hercules, the return of the Heraclidæ, the Ionian migration and the Olympiads. And it
seemed good to me to give an account especially of the before-noted period of the Attic
sovereignty, as I intend to narrate the history of the Greeks side by side with that of the
Hebrews. For any one will be able, if he only start from my position, to make out the reckoning
equally well with me. Now, in the first year of that period of 1020 years, stretching
from Moses and Ogygus to the first Olympiad, the passover and the exodus of the Hebrews
from Egypt took place, and also in Attica the flood of Ogygus. And that is according to
reason. For when the Egyptians were being smitten in the anger of God with hail and storms,
it was only to be expected that certain parts of the earth should suffer with them; and, in
especial, it was but to be expected that the Athenians should participate in such calamity
with the Egyptians, since they were supposed to be a colony from them, as Theopompus
alleges in his Tricarenus, and others besides him. The intervening period has been passed
by, as no remarkable event is recorded during it among the Greeks. But after 94 years Prometheus
arose, according to some, who was fabulously reported to have formed men; for
being a wise man, he transformed them from the state of extreme rudeness to culture.</p>

<p>On the Seventy Weeks of Daniel.</p>
<p>1. This passage, therefore, as it stands thus, touches on many marvellous things. At
present, however, I shall speak only of those things in it which bear upon chronology, and
matters connected therewith. That the passage speaks then of the advent of Christ, who was
to manifest Himself after seventy weeks, is evident. For in the Saviour’s time, or from Him,
are transgressions abrogated, and sins brought to an end. And through remission, moreover,
are iniquities, along with offences, blotted out by expiation; and an everlasting righteousness
is preached, different from that which is by the law, and visions and prophecies (are) until
John, and the Most Holy is anointed. For before the advent of the Saviour these things were
not yet, and were therefore only looked for. And the beginning of the numbers, that is, of
the seventy weeks which make up 490 years, the angel instructs us to take from the going
forth of the commandment to answer and to build Jerusalem. And this happened in the
twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia. For Nehemiah his cup-bearer besought
him, and received the answer that Jerusalem should be built. And the word went
forth commanding these things; for up to that time the city was desolate. For when Cyrus,
after the seventy years’ captivity, gave free permission to all to return who desired it, some
of them under the leadership of Jesus the high priest and Zorobabel, and others after these
under the leadership of Esdra, returned, but were prevented at first from building the temple,
and from surrounding the city with a wall, on the plea that that had not been commanded.</p>
<p>2. It remained in this position, accordingly, until Nehemiah and the reign of Artaxerxes,
and the 115th year of the sovereignty of the Persians. And from the capture of Jerusalem
that makes 185 years. And at that time King Artaxerxes gave order that the city should be
built; and Nehemiah being despatched, superintended the work, and the street and the
surrounding wall were built, as had been prophesied. And reckoning from that point, we
make up seventy weeks to the time of Christ. For if we begin to reckon from any other point,
and not from this, the periods will not correspond, and very many odd results will meet us.
For if we begin the calculation of the seventy weeks from Cyrus and the first restoration,
there will be upwards of one hundred years too many, and there will be a larger number if
we begin from the day on which the angel gave the prophecy to Daniel, and a much larger
number still if we begin from the commencement of the captivity. For we find the sovereignty
of the Persians comprising a period of 230 years, and that of the Macedonians extending

<pb n="327"/>
over 370 years, and from that to the 16th1115 year of Tiberius Cæsar is a period of about 60
years.</p>
<p>3. It is by calculating from Artaxerxes, therefore, up to the time of Christ that the seventy
weeks are made up, according to the numeration of the Jews. For from Nehemiah, who was
despatched by Artaxerxes to build Jerusalem in the 115th year of the Persian empire, and
the 4th year of the 83d Olympiad, and the 20th year of the reign of Artaxerxes himself, up
to this date, which was the second year of the 202d Olympiad, and the 16th year of the reign
of Tiberius Cæsar, there are reckoned 475 years, which make 490 according to the Hebrew
numeration, as they measure the years by the course of the moon; so that, as is easy to show,
their year consists of 354 days, while the solar year has 365¼ days. For the latter exceeds the
period of twelve months, according to the moon’s course, by 11¼ days. Hence the Greeks
and the Jews insert three intercalary months every 8 years. For 8 times 11¼ days makes up
3 months. Therefore 475 years make 59 periods of 8 years each, and 3 months besides. But
since thus there are 3 intercalary months every 8 years, we get thus 15 years minus a few
days; and these being added to the 475 years, make up in all the 70 weeks.</p>

<p>On the Fortunes of Hyrcanus and Antigonus, and on Herod, Augustus, Antony,
and Cleopatra, in Abstract.</p>
<p>1. Octavius Sebastus, or, as the Romans call him, Augustus, the adopted son of Caius,
on returning to Rome from Apollonias in Epirus, where he was educated, possessed himself
of the first place in the government. And Antony afterwards obtained the rule of Asia and
the districts beyond. In his time the Jews accused Herod; but he put the deputies to death,
and restored Herod to his government. Afterwards, however, along with Hyrcanus and
Phasælus his brother, he was driven out, and betook himself in flight to Antony. And as the
Jews would not receive him, an obstinate battle took place; and in a short time after, as he
had conquered in battle, he also drove out Antigonus, who had returned. And Antigonus
fled to Herod the Parthian king, and was restored by the help of his son Pacorus, which help
was given on his promising to pay 1000 talents of gold. And Herod then in his turn had to
flee, while Phasælus was slain in battle, and Hyrcanus was surrendered alive to Antigonus.
And after cutting off his ears, that he might be disqualified for the priesthood, he gave him
to the Parthians to lead into captivity; for he scrupled to put him to death, as he was a relation
of his own. And Herod, on his expulsion, betook himself first to Malichus king of the Arabians;
and when he did not receive him, through fear of the Parthians, he went away to Alexandria
to Cleopatra. That was the 185th Olympiad. Cleopatra having put to death her
brother, who was her consort in the government, and being then summoned by Antony to
Cilicia to make her defence, committed the care of the sovereignty to Herod; and as he requested
that he should not be entrusted with anything until he was restored to his own
government,1117 she took him with her and went to Antony. And as he was smitten with
love for the princess, they despatched Herod to Rome to Octavius Augustus, who, on behalf
of Antipater, Herod’s father, and on behalf of Herod himself, and also because Antigonus
was established as king by the help of the Parthians, gave a commission to the generals in
Palestine and Syria to restore him to his government. And in concert with Sosius he waged
war against Antigonus for a long time, and in manifold engagements. At that time also,
Josephus, Herod’s brother, died in his command. And Herod coming to Antony1118 …</p>

Antony himself also proclaimed Herod as king, and gave him, in addition, the cities Hippus,

and Gaulanitis;1119 and besides these, also the procuratorship of Syria. Herod was declared

king of the Jews by the senate and Octavius Augustus, and reigned 34 years. Antony, when
about to go on an expedition against the Parthians, slew Antigonus the king of the Jews,
and gave Arabia to Cleopatra; and passing over into the territory of the Parthians, sustained
a severe defeat, losing the greater part of his army. That was in the 186th Olympiad.
Octavius Augustus led the forces of Italy and all the West against Antony, who refused to
return to Rome through fear, on account of his failure in Parthia, and through his love for
Cleopatra. And Antony met him with the forces of Asia. Herod, however, like a shrewd
fellow, and one who waits upon the powerful, sent a double set of letters, and despatched
his army to sea, charging his generals to watch the issue of events. And when the victory
was decided, and when Antony, after sustaining two naval defeats, had fled to Egypt along
with Cleopatra, they who bore the letters delivered to Augustus those which they had been
keeping secretly for Antony. And on Herod falls1120…</p>

the wild asp as the instrument of death. At that time Augustus captured Cleopatra’s sons,
Helios and Selene,1122 on their flight to the Thebaid. Nicopolis was founded opposite Actium,
and the games called Actia were instituted. On the capture of Alexandria, Cornelius Gallus
was sent as first governor of Egypt, and he destroyed the cities of the Egyptians that refused
obedience. Up to this time the Lagidæ ruled; and the whole duration of the Macedonian
empire after the subversion of the Persian power was 298 years. Thus is made up the whole
period from the foundation of the Macedonian empire to its subversion in the time of the
Ptolemies, and under Cleopatra, the last of these, the date of which event is the 11th year of
the monarchy and empire of the Romans, and the 4th year of the 187th Olympiad. Altogether,
from Adam 5472 years are reckoned.</p>
<p>4. After the taking of Alexandria the 188th Olympiad began. Herod founded anew the
city of the Gabinii,1123 the ancient Samaria, and called it Sebaste; and having erected its
seaport, the tower of Strato, into a city, he named it Cæsarea after the same, and raised in
each a temple in honour of Octavius. And afterwards he founded Antipatris in the Lydian
plain, so naming it after his father, and settled in it the people about Sebaste, whom he had

<head>XVIII.1125</head>
<p>On the Circumstances Connected with Our Saviour’s Passion and His Life-Giving
Resurrection.</p>
<p>1. As to His works severally, and His cures effected upon body and soul, and the mysteries
of His doctrine, and the resurrection from the dead, these have been most authoritatively
set forth by His disciples and apostles before us. On the whole world there pressed a
most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea
and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History,
calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the
passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the
day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes
under the sun. And it cannot happen at any other time but in the interval between the first
day of the new moon and the last of the old, that is, at their junction: how then should an
eclipse be supposed to happen when the moon is almost diametrically opposite the sun? Let
that opinion pass however; let it carry the majority with it; and let this portent of the world
be deemed an eclipse of the sun, like others a portent only to the eye.1126 Phlegon records
that, in the time of Tiberius Cæsar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the
sixth hour to the ninth—manifestly that one of which we speak. But what has an eclipse in
common with an earthquake, the rending rocks, and the resurrection of the dead, and so
great a perturbation throughout the universe? Surely no such event as this is recorded for
a long period. But it was a darkness induced by God, because the Lord happened then to
suffer. And calculation makes out that the period of 70 weeks, as noted in Daniel, is completed
at this time.</p>
<p>2. From Artaxerxes, moreover, 70 weeks are reckoned up to the time of Christ, according
to the numeration of the Jews. For from Nehemiah, who was sent by Artaxerxes to people
Jerusalem, about the 120th year of the Persian empire, and in the 20th year of Artaxerxes
himself, and the 4th year of the 83d Olympiad, up to this time, which was the 2d year of the
102d Olympiad, and the 16th year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, there are given 475 years,
which make 490 Hebrew years, since they measure the years by the lunar month of 29½
days, as may easily be explained, the annual period according to the sun consisting of 365¼
days, while the lunar period of 12 months has 11¼ days less. For which reason the Greeks
and the Jews insert three intercalary months every eight years. For 8 times 11¼ days make
3 months. The 475 years, therefore, contain 59 periods of 8 years and three months over:
thus, the three intercalary months for every 8 years being added, we get 15 years, and these

together with the 475 years make 70 weeks. Let no one now think us unskilled in the calculations
of astronomy, when we fix without further ado the number of days at 365¼. For it
is not in ignorance of the truth, but rather by reason of exact study,1127 that we have stated
our opinion so shortly. But let what follows also be presented as in outline1128 to those who
endeavour to inquire minutely into all things.</p>
<p>3. Each year in the general consists of 365 days; and the space of a day and night being
divided into nineteen parts, we have also five of these. And in saying that the year consists
of 365¼ days, and there being the five nineteenth parts…to the 475 there are 6¼ days. Furthermore,
we find, according to exact computation, that the lunar month has 29½ days.…1129
And these come to1130 a little time. Now it happens that from the 20th year of the reign of
Artaxerxes (as it is given in Ezra among the Hebrews), which, according to the Greeks, was
the 4th year of the 80th Olympiad, to the 16th year of Tiberius Cæsar, which was the second
year of the 102d Olympiad, there are in all the 475 years already noted, which in the Hebrew
system make 490 years, as has been previously stated, that is, 70 weeks, by which period the
time of Christ’s advent was measured in the announcement made to Daniel by Gabriel. And
if any one thinks that the 15 Hebrew years added to the others involve us in an error of 10,
nothing at least which cannot be accounted for has been introduced. And the 1½ week
which we suppose must be added to make the whole number, meets the question about the
15 years, and removes the difficulty about the time; and that the prophecies are usually put
forth in a somewhat symbolic form, is quite evident.</p>
<p>4. As far, then, as is in our power, we have taken the Scripture, I think, correctly; especially
seeing that the preceding section about the vision seems to state the whole matter
shortly, its first words being, “In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar,”1131 where he
prophesies of the subversion of the Persian power by the Greeks, which empires are symbolized
in the prophecy under the figures of the ram and the goat respectively.1132 “The sacrifice,”
he says, “shall be abolished, and the holy places shall be made desolate, so as to be

trodden under foot; which things shall be determined within 2300 days.”1133 For if we take
the day as a month, just as elsewhere in prophecy days are taken as years, and in different
places are used in different ways, reducing the period in the same way as has been done
above to Hebrew months, we shall find the period fully made out to the 20th year of the
reign of Artaxerxes, from the capture of Jerusalem. For there are given thus 185 years, and
one year falls to be added to these—the year in which Nehemiah built the wall of the city.
In 186 years, therefore, we find 2300 Hebrew months, as 8 years have in addition 3 intercalary
months. From Artaxerxes, again, in whose time the command went forth that Jerusalem
should be built, there are 70 weeks. These matters, however, we have discussed by themselves,
and with greater exactness, in our book On the Weeks and this Prophecy. But I am amazed
that the Jews deny that the Lord has yet come, and that the followers of Marcion refuse to
admit that His coming was predicted in the prophecies when the Scriptures display the
matter so openly to our view. And after something else: The period, then, to the advent of
the Lord from Adam and the creation is 5531 years, from which epoch to the 250th
Olympiad there are 192 years, as has been shown above.</p>

<head>IV.—The Passion of St. Symphorosa and Her Seven Sons.1138</head>
<p>The text is given from the edition of Ruinart. His preface, which Migne also cites, is as
follows: “The narrative of the martyrdom of St. Symphorosa and her seven sons, which we
here publish, is ascribed in the mss. to Julius Africanus, a writer of the highest repute. And
it may perhaps have been inserted in his books on Chronography,—a work which Eusebius
(Hist. Eccles., vi. 31) testifies to have been written with the greatest care, since in these he
detailed the chief events in history from the foundation of the world to the times of the
Emperor Heliogabalus. As that work, however, is lost, that this narrative is really to be
ascribed to Africanus, I would not venture positively to assert, although at the same time
there seems no ground for doubting its genuineness. We print it, moreover, from the editions
of Mombritius, Surius, and Cardulus, collated with two Colbert mss. and one in the library
of the Sorbonne. The occasion for the death of these saints was found in the vicinity of that
most famous palace which was built by Adrian at his country seat at Tiber, according to
Spartianus. For when the emperor gave orders that this palace, which he had built for his
pleasure, should be purified by some piacular ceremonies, the priests seized this opportunity
for accusing Symphorosa, alleging that the gods would not be satisfied until Symphorosa
should either sacrifice to them or be herself sacrificed; which last thing was done by Hadrian,
whom, from many others of his deeds, we know to have been exceedingly superstitious,
about the year of Christ 120, that is, about the beginning of his reign, at which period indeed,
as Dio Cassius observes, that emperor put a great number to death. The memory of these
martyrs, moreover, is celebrated in all the most ancient martyrologies, although they assign
different days for it. The Roman, along with Notker, fixes their festival for the 18th July,
Rabanus for the 21st of the same month, Usuardus and Ado for the 21st June. In the Tiburtine
road there still exists the rubbish of an old church, as Aringhi states (Rom. Subter., iv. 17),
which was consecrated to God under their name, and which still retains the title, To the
Seven Brothers. I have no doubt that it was built in that place to which the pontiffs in the
Acta, sec. iv., gave the name, To the Seven Biothanati, i.e., those cut off by a violent death,
as Baronius remarks, at the year 138.” So far Ruinart: see also Tillemont, Mém. Eccles., ii.
pp. 241 and 595; and the Bollandists, Act. S.S. Junii, vol. iv. p. 350.</p>
<p>1. When Adrian had built a palace, and wished to dedicate it by that wicked ceremonial,
and began to seek responses by sacrifices to idols, and to the demons that dwell in idols,
they replied,1139 and said: “The widow Symphorosa, with her seven sons, wounds us day
by day in invoking her God. If she therefore, together with her sons, shall offer sacrifice, we

<pb n="336"/>
promise to make good all that you ask.” Then Adrian ordered her to be seized, along with
her sons, and advised them in courteous terms to consent to offer sacrifice to the idols. To
him, however, the blessed Symphorosa answered: “My husband Getulius,1140 together with
his brother Amantius, when they were tribunes in thy service, suffered different punishments
for the name of Christ, rather than consent to sacrifice to idols, and, like good athletes, they
overcame thy demons in death. For, rather than be prevailed on, they chose to be beheaded,
and suffered death: which death, being endured for the name of Christ, gained them tem-
poral ignominy indeed among men of this earth, but everlasting honour and glory among
the angels; and moving now among them, and exhibiting1141 trophies of their sufferings,
they enjoy eternal life with the King eternal in the heavens.”</p>
<p>2. The Emperor Adrian said to the holy Symphorosa: “Either sacrifice thou along with
thy sons to the omnipotent gods, or else I shall cause thee to be sacrificed thyself, together
with thy sons.” The blessed Symphorosa answered: “And whence is this great good to me,
that I should be deemed worthy along with my sons to be offered as an oblation to God?”1142
The Emperor Adrian said: “I shall cause thee to be sacrificed to my gods.” The blessed
Symphorosa replied: “Thy gods cannot take me in sacrifice; but if I am burned for the name
of Christ, my God, I shall rather consume those demons of thine.” The Emperor Adrian
said: “Choose thou one of these alternatives: either sacrifice to my gods, or perish by an evil
death.” The blessed Symphorosa replied: “Thou thinkest that my mind can be altered by
some kind of terror; whereas I long to rest with my husband Getulius,1143 whom thou didst
put to death for Christ’s name.” Then the Emperor Adrian ordered her to be led away to
the temple of Hercules, and there first to be beaten with blows on the cheek, and afterwards
to be suspended by the hair. But when by no argument and by no terror could he divert her
from her good resolution, he ordered her to be thrown into the river with a large stone
fastened to her neck. And her brother Eugenius, principal of the district of Tiber, picked up
her body, and buried it in a suburb of the same city.</p>
<p>3. Then, on another day, the Emperor Adrian ordered all her seven sons to be brought
before him in company; and when he had challenged them to sacrifice to idols, and perceived
that they yielded by no means to his threats and terrors, he ordered seven stakes to be fixed
around the temple of Hercules, and commanded them to be stretched on the blocks there.
And he ordered Crescens, the first, to be transfixed in the throat; and Julian, the second, to
be stabbed in the breast; and Nemesius, the third, to be struck through the heart; and

Primitivus, the fourth, to be wounded in the navel; and Justin, the fifth, to be struck through
in the back with a sword; and Stracteus,1144 the sixth, to be wounded in the side; and Eugenius,
the seventh, to be cleft in twain from the head downwards.</p>
<p>4. The next day again the Emperor Adrian came to the temple of Hercules, and ordered
their bodies to be carried off together, and cast into a deep pit; and the pontiffs gave to that
place the name, To the Seven Biothanati.1145 After these things the persecution ceased for
a year and a half, in which period the holy bodies of all the martyrs were honoured, and
consigned with all care to tumuli erected for that purpose, and their names are written in
the book of life. The natal day, moreover, of the holy martyrs of Christ, the blessed Symphorosa
and her seven sons, Crescens, Julian, Nemesius, Primitivus, Justin, Stracteus, and
Eugenius, is held on the 18th July. Their bodies rest on the Tiburtine road, at the eighth
mile-stone from the city, under the kingship of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour
and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

(Joseph the son of both, p. 127.)</p>
<p>The opinion that Luke’s genealogy is that of Mary was unknown to Christian antiquity.
In the fifteenth century it was first propounded by Latin divines to do honour (as they supposed)
to the Blessed Virgin. It was first broached by Annius of Viterbo, a.d. 1502. Christian
antiquity is agreed that:—</p>
<p>1. Both genealogies are those of Joseph.</p>
<p>2. That Joseph was the son of Jacob or of Heli, either by adoption, or because Jacob and
Heli were either own brothers or half-brothers; so that,—</p>
<p>3. On the death of one of the brothers, without issue, the surviving brother married his
widow, who became the mother of Joseph by this marriage; so that Joseph was reckoned
the son of Jacob and the son of Heli.1146</p>
<p>4. Joseph and Mary were of the same lineage, but the Hebrews did not reckon descent
from the side of the woman. For them St. Luke’s genealogy is the sufficient register of Christ’s
royal descent and official claim. St. Luke gives his personal pedigree, ascending to Adam,
and identifying Him with the whole human race.</p>

Anatolius and Minor Writers.</head>
<p>Instead of reprinting a disjointed mass of “Fragments,” I have thought it desirable to
present them in a group, illustrative of the Alexandrian school. I give to Anatolius the deserved
place of prominence, marking him as the meet successor of Africanus in ability if
not in the nature of his pursuits. His writing and the testimony of Eusebius prove him to
have been a star of no inferior magnitude, even in the brilliant constellation of faith and
genius of which he is part.</p>
<p>These minor writers I have arranged, not with exclusive reference to minute chronology,
but with some respect to their material, as follows:—</p>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 230–270–280.</del> From Jerome1151 we learn that Anatolius flourished in the reign
of Probus and Carus, that he was a native of Alexandria, and that he became bishop of
Laodicea. Eusebius gives a somewhat lengthened account of him,1152 and speaks of him in
terms of the strongest laudation, as one surpassing all the men of his time in learning and
science. He tells us that he attained the highest eminence in arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy,
besides being a great proficient also in dialectics, physics, and rhetoric. His reputation
was so great among the Alexandrians that they are said to have requested him to open a
school for teaching the Aristotelian philosophy in their city.1153 He did great service to his
fellow-citizens in Alexandria on their being besieged by the Romans in a.d. 262, and was
the means of saving the lives of numbers of them. After this he is said to have passed into
Syria, where Theotecnus, the bishop of Cæsareia, ordained him, destining him to be his
own successor in the bishopric. After this, however, having occasion to travel to Antioch to
attend the synod convened to deal with the case of Paul of Samosata, as he passed through
the city of Laodicea, he was detained by the people and made bishop of the place, in succession
to Eusebius.1154 This must have been about the year 270 a.d. How long he held that
dignity, however, we do not know. Eusebius tells us that he did not write many books, but
yet enough to show us at once his eloquence and his erudition. Among these was a treatise
on the Chronology of Easter; of which a considerable extract is preserved in Eusebius. The
book itself exists now only in a Latin version, which is generally ascribed to Rufinus, and
which was published by Ægidius Bucherius in his Doctrina Temporum, which was issued
at Antwerp in 1634. Another work of his was the Institutes of Arithmetic, of which we have
some fragments in the θεολογούμενα τῆς ἀριθμητικῆς, which was published in Paris in

<p>As we are about to speak on the subject of the order of the times and alternations of the
world, we shall first dispose of the positions of diverse calculators; who, by reckoning only
by the course of the moon, and leaving out of account the ascent and descent of the sun,
with the addition of certain problems, have constructed diverse periods,1156 self-contradictory,
and such as are never found in the reckoning of a true computation; since it is certain
that no mode of computation is to be approved, in which these two measures are not found
together. For even in the ancient exemplars, that is, in the books of the Hebrews and Greeks,
we find not only the course of the moon, but also that of the sun, and, indeed, not simply
its course in the general,1157 but even the separate and minutest moments of its hours all
calculated, as we shall show at the proper time, when the matter in hand demands it. Of
these Hippolytus made up a period of sixteen years with certain unknown courses of the
moon. Others have reckoned by a period of twenty-five years, others by thirty, and some
by eighty-four years, without, however, teaching thereby an exact method of calculating
Easter. But our predecessors, men most learned in the books of the Hebrews and Greeks,—I
mean Isidore and Jerome and Clement,—although they have noted similar beginnings for
the months just as they differ also in language, have, nevertheless, come harmoniously to
one and the same most exact reckoning of Easter, day and month and season meeting in
accord with the highest honour for the Lord’s resurrection.1158 But Origen also, the most
erudite of all, and the acutest in making calculations,—a man, too, to whom the epithet
χαλκευτής1159 is given,—has published in a very elegant manner a little book on Easter.
And in this book, while declaring, with respect to the day of Easter, that attention must be
given not only to the course of the moon and the transit of the equinox, but also to the
passage (transcensum) of the sun, which removes every foul ambush and offence of all
darkness, and brings on the advent of light and the power and inspiration of the elements
of the whole world, he speaks thus: In the (matter of the) day of Easter, he remarks, I do not

the moon which are to elapse, but that the sun should pass that division, to wit, between
light and darkness, constituted in an equality by the dispensation of the Lord at the beginning

<p>There is, then, in the first year, the new moon of the first month, which is the beginning
of every cycle of nineteen years, on the six and twentieth day of the month called by the
Egyptians Phamenoth.1163 But, according to the months of the Macedonians, it is on the
two-and-twentieth day of Dystrus. And, as the Romans would say, it is on the eleventh day
before the Kalends of April. Now the sun is found on the said six-and-twentieth day of
Phamenoth, not only as having mounted to the first segment, but as already passing the
fourth day in it. And this segment they are accustomed to call the first dodecatemorion
(twelfth part), and the equinox, and the beginning of months, and the head of the cycle, and
the starting-point1164 of the course of the planets. And the segment before this they call the
last of the months, and the twelfth segment, and the last dodecatemorion, and the end of
the circuit1165 of the planets. And for this reason, also, we maintain that those who place
the first month in it, and who determine the fourteenth day of the Paschal season by it, make
no trivial or common blunder.</p>

<p>Nor is this an opinion confined to ourselves alone. For it was also known to the Jews of
old and before Christ, and it was most carefully observed by them.1166 And this may be
learned from what Philo, and Josephus, and Musæus have written; and not only from these,
but indeed from others still more ancient, namely, the two Agathobuli,1167 who were surnamed
the Masters, and the eminent Aristobulus,1168 who was one of the Seventy who
translated the sacred and holy Scriptures of the Hebrews for Ptolemy Philadelphus and his
father, and dedicated his exegetical books on the law of Moses to the same kings. These
writers, in solving some questions which are raised with respect to Exodus, say that all alike
ought to sacrifice the Passover1169 after the vernal equinox in the middle of the first month.
And that is found to be when the sun passes through the first segment of the solar, or, as
some among them have named it, the zodiacal circle.</p>
<note type="footnote">1166 πρὸς αὐτῶν—others read πρό, before them.</note>
<note type="footnote">1167 Anatolius writes that there were two Agathobuli with the surname Masters; but I fear that he is wrong
in his opinion that they were more ancient than Philo and Josephus. For Agathobulus, the philosopher, flourished
in the times of Adrian, as Eusebius writes in his Chronicon, and after him Georgius Syncellus.—Vales.</note>
<note type="footnote">1168 ᾽Αριστοβούλου τοῦ πάνυ—Rufinus erroneously renders it Aristobulum ex Paneade, Aristobulus of
Paneas. Scaliger also, in his Animadversiones Eusebianæ, p. 130, strangely thinks that the text should be corrected
from the version of Rufinus. And Bede, in his De Ratione Computi, also follows the faulty rendering of Rufinus,
and writes Aristobulus et Paniada, as though the latter word were the proper name of a Jewish writer, finding
probably in the Codex of Rufinus, which he possessed, the reading Aristobulus et Paneada, which indeed is found
in a very ancient Paris manuscript, and also in the Codex Corbeiensis. But that that Aristobulus was not one of
the seventy translators, as Anatolius writes, is proved by Scaliger in the work cited above. This Aristobulus was
also surnamed διδάσκαλος, or Master, as we see from the Maccabees ii. 1. For I do not agree with Scaliger in
distinguishing this Aristobulus, of whom mention is made in the Maccabees, from the Peripatetic philosopher
who dedicated his Commentaries on the Law of Moses to Ptolemy Philometor—Vales. [See vol. ii. p. 487, and

<p>But this Aristobulus also adds, that for the feast of the Passover it was necessary not
only that the sun should pass the equinoctial segment, but the moon also. For as there are
two equinoctial segments, the vernal and the autumnal, and these diametrically opposite to
each other, and since the day of the Passover is fixed for the fourteenth day of the month,
in the evening, the moon will have the position diametrically opposite the sun; as is to be
seen in full moons. And the sun will thus be in the segment of the vernal equinox, and the
moon necessarily will be at the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>I am aware that very many other matters were discussed by them, some of them with
considerable probability, and others of them as matters of the clearest demonstration,1170
by which they endeavour to prove that the festival of the Passover and unleavened bread
ought by all means to be kept after the equinox. But I shall pass on without demanding such
copious demonstrations (on subjects1171) from which the veil of the Mosaic law has been
removed; for now it remains for us with unveiled face to behold ever as in a glass Christ
Himself and the doctrines and sufferings of Christ. But that the first month among the
Hebrews is about the equinox, is clearly shown also by what is taught in the book of
Enoch.1172</p>

<p>And, therefore, in this concurrence of the sun and moon, the Paschal festival is not to
be celebrated, because as long as they are found in this course the power of darkness is not
overcome; and as long as equality between light and darkness endures, and is not diminished
by the light, it is shown that the Paschal festival is not to be celebrated. Accordingly, it is
enjoined that that festival be kept after the equinox, because the moon of the fourteenth,1173
if before the equinox or at the equinox, does not fill the whole night. But after the equinox,
the moon of the fourteenth, with one day being added because of the passing of the equinox,
although it does not extend to the true light, that is, the rising of the sun and the beginning
of day, will nevertheless leave no darkness behind it. And, in accordance with this, Moses
is charged by the Lord to keep seven days of unleavened bread for the celebration of the
Passover, that in them no power of darkness should be found to surpass the light. And although
the outset of four nights begins to be dark, that is, the 17th and 18th and 19th and
20th, yet the moon of the 20th, which rises before that, does not permit the darkness to extend
on even to midnight.</p>

<p>To us, however, with whom it is impossible for all these things to come aptly at one and
the same time, namely, the moon’s fourteenth, and the Lord’s day, and the passing of the
equinox, and whom the obligation of the Lord’s resurrection binds to keep the Paschal
festival on the Lord’s day, it is granted that we may extend the beginning of our celebration
even to the moon’s twentieth. For although the moon of the 20th does not fill the whole
night, yet, rising as it does in the second watch, it illumines the greater part of the night.
Certainly if the rising of the moon should be delayed on to the end of two watches, that is
to say, to midnight, the light would not then exceed the darkness, but the darkness the light.
But it is clear that in the Paschal feast it is not possible that any part of the darkness should
surpass the light; for the festival of the Lord’s resurrection is one of light, and there is no
fellowship between light and darkness. And if the moon should rise in the third watch, it is
clear that the 22d or 23d of the moon would then be reached, in which it is not possible that
there can be a true celebration of Easter. For those who determine that the festival may be
kept at this age of the moon, are not only unable to make that good by the authority of
Scripture, but turn also into the crime of sacrilege and contumacy, and incur the peril of
their souls; inasmuch as they affirm that the true light may be celebrated along with something
of that power of darkness which dominates all.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it is not the case, as certain calculators of Gaul allege, that this assertion
is opposed by that passage in Exodus,1174 where we read: “In the first month, on the fourteenth
day of the first month, at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one-andtwentieth
day of the month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your
houses.” From this they maintain that it is quite permissible to celebrate the Passover on
the twenty-first day of the moon; understanding that if the twenty-second day were added,
there would be found eight days of unleavened bread. A thing which cannot be found with
any probability, indeed, in the Old Testament, as the Lord, through Moses, gives this charge:
“Seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.”1175 Unless perchance the fourteenth day is not
reckoned by them among the days of unleavened bread with the celebration of the feast;
which, however, is contrary to the Word of the Gospel which says: “Moreover, on the first
day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus.”1176 And there is no doubt as to its
being the fourteenth day on which the disciples asked the Lord, in accordance with the
custom established for them of old, “Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the
Passover?” But they who are deceived with this error maintain this addition, because they
do not know that the 13th and 14th, the 14th and 15th, the 15th and 16th, the 16th and 17th,
the 17th and 18th, the 18th and 19th, the 19th and 20th, the 20th and 21st days of the moon
are each found, as may be most surely proved, within a single day. For every day in the
reckoning of the moon does not end in the evening as the same day in respect of number,
as it is at its beginning in the morning. For the day which in the morning, that is up to the
sixth hour and half, is numbered the 13th day of the month, is found at even to be the 14th.
Wherefore, also, the Passover is enjoined to be extended on to the 21st day at even; which
day, without doubt, in the morning, that is, up to that term of hours which we have mentioned,
was reckoned the 20th. Calculate, then, from the end of the 13th1177 day of the moon,
which marks the beginning of the 14th, on to the end of the 20th, at which the 21st day also
begins, and you will have only seven days of unleavened bread, in which, by the guidance
of the Lord, it has been determined before that the most true feast of the Passover ought to
be celebrated.</p>

<p>But what wonder is it that they should have erred in the matter of the 21st day of the
moon who have added three days before the equinox, in which they hold that the Passover
may be celebrated? An assertion which certainly must be considered altogether absurd,
since, by the best-known historiographers of the Jews, and by the Seventy Elders, it has been
clearly determined that the Paschal festival cannot be celebrated at the equinox.</p>

<p>But nothing was difficult to them with whom it was lawful to celebrate the Passover on
any day when the fourteenth of the moon happened after the equinox. Following their example
up to the present time all the bishops of Asia—as themselves also receiving the rule
from an unimpeachable authority, to wit, the evangelist John, who leant on the Lord’s breast,
and drank in instructions spiritual without doubt—were in the way of celebrating the Paschal
feast, without question, every year, whenever the fourteenth day of the moon had come,
and the lamb was sacrificed by the Jews after the equinox was past; not acquiescing, so far
as regards this matter, with the authority of some, namely, the successors of Peter and Paul,
who have taught all the churches in which they sowed the spiritual seeds of the Gospel, that
the solemn festival of the resurrection of the Lord can be celebrated only on the Lord’s day.
Whence, also, a certain contention broke out between the successors of these, namely, Victor,
at that time bishop of the city of Rome, and Polycrates, who then appeared to hold the
primacy among the bishops of Asia. And this contention was adjusted most rightfully by
Irenæus,1178 at that time president of a part of Gaul, so that both parties kept by their own
order, and did not decline from the original custom of antiquity. The one party, indeed,
kept the Paschal day on the fourteenth day of the first month, according to the Gospel, as
they thought, adding nothing of an extraneous kind, but keeping through all things the rule
of faith. And the other party, passing the day of the Lord’s Passion as one replete with sadness
and grief, hold that it should not be lawful to celebrate the Lord’s mystery of the Passover
at any other time but on the Lord’s day, on which the resurrection of the Lord from death
took place, and on which rose also for us the cause of everlasting joy. For it is one thing to
act in accordance with the precept given by the apostle, yea, by the Lord Himself, and be
sad with the sad, and suffer with him that suffers by the cross, His own word being: “My
soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;”1179 and it is another thing to rejoice with the
victor as he triumphs over an ancient enemy, and exults with the highest triumph over a
conquered adversary, as He Himself also says: “Rejoice with Me; for I have found the sheep
which I had lost.”1180</p>

<p>Moreover, the allegation which they sometimes make against us, that if we pass the
moon’s fourteenth we cannot celebrate the beginning of the Paschal feast in light,1181 neither
moves nor disturbs us. For, although they lay it down as a thing unlawful, that the beginning
of the Paschal festival should be extended so far as to the moon’s twentieth; yet they cannot
deny that it ought to be extended to the sixteenth and seventeenth, which coincide with the
day on which the Lord rose from the dead. But we decide that it is better that it should be
extended even on to the twentieth day, on account of the Lord’s day, than that we should
anticipate the Lord’s day on account of the fourteenth day; for on the Lord’s day was it that
light was shown to us in the beginning, and now also in the end, the comforts of all present
and the tokens of all future blessings. For the Lord ascribes no less praise to the twentieth
day than to the fourteenth. For in the book of Leviticus1182 the injunction is expressed thus:
“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of this month, at even, is the Lord’s Passover.
And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord. Seven
days ye shall eat unleavened bread. The first day shall be to you one most diligently attended1183
and holy. Ye shall do no servile work thereon. And the seventh day shall be to you
more diligently attended1184 and holier; ye shall do no servile work thereon.” And hence
we maintain that those have contracted no guilt1185 before the tribunal of Christ, who have
held that the beginning of the Paschal festival ought to be extended to this day. And this,
too, the most especially, as we are pressed by three difficulties, namely, that we should keep
the solemn festival of the Passover on the Lord’s day, and after the equinox, and yet not
beyond the limit of the moon’s twentieth day.</p>

<p>This cycle of nineteen years is not approved of by certain African investigators who
have drawn up larger cycles, because it seems to be somewhat opposed to their surmises
and opinions. For these make up the best proved accounts according to their calculation,
and determine a certain beginning or certain end for the Easter season, so as that the Paschal
festival shall not be celebrated before the eleventh day before the Kalends of April, i.e., 24th
March, nor after the moon’s twenty-first, and the eleventh day before the Kalends of May,
i.e., 21st April. But we hold that these are limits not only not to be followed, but to be detested
and overturned. For even in the ancient law it is laid down that this is to be seen to, viz.,
that the Passover be not celebrated before the transit of the vernal equinox, at which the last
of the autumnal term is overtaken,1189 on the fourteenth day of the first month, which is
one calculated not by the beginnings of the day, but by those of the moon.1190 And as this
has been sanctioned by the charge of the Lord, and is in all things accordant with the Catholic
faith, it cannot be doubtful to any wise man that to anticipate it must be a thing unlawful
and perilous. And, accordingly, this only is it sufficient for all the saints and Catholics to
observe, namely, that giving no heed to the diverse opinions of very many, they should keep
the solemn festival of the Lord’s resurrection within the limits which we have set forth.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as to the proposal subjoined to your epistle, that I should attempt to introduce
into this little book some notice of the ascent and descent of the sun, which is made
out in the distribution of days and nights. The matter proceeds thus: In fifteen days and half
an hour, the sun ascending by so many minutes, that is, by four in one day, from the eighth
day before the Kalends of January, i.e., 25th December, to the eighth before the Kalends of
April, i.e., 25th March, an hour is taken up;1191 at which date there are twelve hours and a
twelfth. On this day, towards evening, if it happen also to be the moon’s fourteenth, the
lamb was sacrificed among the Jews. But if the number went beyond that, so that it was the
moon’s fifteenth or sixteenth on the evening of the same day, on the fourteenth day of the
second moon, in the same month, the Passover was celebrated; and the people ate unleavened
bread for seven days, up to the twenty-first day at evening. Hence, if it happens in like
manner to us, that the seventh day before the Kalends of April, 26th March, proves to be
both the Lord’s day and the moon’s fourteenth, Easter is to be celebrated on the fourteenth.
But if it proves to be the moon’s fifteenth or sixteenth, or any day up to the twentieth, then
our regard for the Lord’s resurrection, which took place on the Lord’s day, will lead us to
celebrate it on the same principle; yet this should be done so as that the beginning of Easter
may not pass beyond the close of their festival, that is to say, the moon’s twentieth. And
therefore we have said that those parties have committed no trivial offence who have ventured
either on anticipating or on going beyond this number, which is given us in the divine
Scriptures themselves. And from the eighth day before the Kalends of April, 25th March,
to the eighth before the Kalends of July, 24th June, in fifteen days an hour is taken up: the
sun ascending every day by two minutes and a half, and the sixth part of a minute. And
from the eighth day before the Kalends of July, 24th June, to the eighth before the Kalends
of October, 24th September, in like manner, in fifteen days and four hours, an hour is taken
up: the sun descending every day by the same number of minutes. And the space remaining
on to the eighth day before the Kalends of January, 25th December, is determined in a
similar number of hours and minutes. So that thus on the eighth day before the Kalends of
January, for the hour there is the hour and half. For up to that day and night are distributed.
And the twelve hours which were established at the vernal equinox in the beginning by the
Lord’s dispensation, being distributed over the night on the eighth before the Kalends of
July, the sun ascending through those eighteen several degrees which we have noted, shall
be found conjoined with the longer space in the twelfth. And, again, the twelve hours which
should be fulfilled at the autumnal equinox in the sun’s descent, should be found disjoined
on the sixth before the Kalends of January as six hours divided into twelve, the night holding

it held six divided into twelve.</p>

<p>Be not ignorant of this, however, that those four determining periods,1192 which we
have mentioned, although they are approximated to the Kalends of the following months,
yet hold each the middle of a season, viz., of spring and summer, and autumn and winter.
And the beginnings of the seasons are not to be fixed at that point at which the Kalends of
the month begin. But each season is to be begun in such way that the equinox divides the
season of spring from its first day; and the season of summer is divided by the eighth day
before the Kalends of July, and that of autumn by the eighth before the Kalends of October,
and that of winter by the eighth before the Kalends of January in like manner.1193</p>

<head>Fragments of the Books on Arithmetic.1194</head>
<p>What is mathematics?</p>
<p>Aristotle thinks that all philosophy consisted of theory and practice,1195 and divides
the practical into ethical and political, and the theoretic again into the theological, the
physical, and the mathematical. And thus very clearly and skilfully he shows that mathematics
is (a branch of) philosophy.</p>
<p>The Chaldæans were the originators of astronomy, and the Egyptians of geometry and
arithmetic.…</p>
<p>And whence did mathematics derive its name?</p>
<p>Those of the Peripatetic school affirmed that in rhetoric and poetry, and in the popular
music, any one may be an adept though he has gone through no process of study; but that
in those pursuits properly called studies,1196 none can have any real knowledge unless he
has first become a student of them. Hence they supposed that the theory of these things was
called Mathematics, from μάθημα, study, science. And the followers of Pythagoras are said
to have given this more distinctive name of mathematics to geometry, and arithmetic alone.
For of old these had each its own separate name; and they had up till then no name common
to both. And he (Archytas) gave them this name, because he found science1197 in them, and
that in a manner suitable to man’s study.1198 For they (the Pythagoreans) perceived that
these studies dealt with things eternal and immutable and perfect,1199 in which things alone
they considered that science consisted. But the more recent philosophers have given a more
extensive application to this name, so that, in their opinion, the mathematician deals not
only with substances1200 incorporeal, and falling simply within the province of the understanding,
1201 but also with that which touches upon corporeal and sensible matter. For he
ought to be cognisant of1202 the course of the stars, and their velocity, and their magnitudes,
and forms, and distances. And, besides, he ought to investigate their dispositions to vision,
examining into the causes, why they are not seen as of the same form and of the same size

from every distance, retaining, indeed, as we know them to do, their dispositions relative
to each other,1203 but producing, at the same time, deceptive appearances, both in respect
of order and position. And these are so, either as determined by the state of the heavens and
the air, or as seen in reflecting and all polished surfaces and in transparent bodies, and in
all similar kinds. In addition to this, they thought that the man ought to be versed in
mechanics and geometry and dialectics. And still further, that he should engage himself
with the causes of the harmonious combination of sounds, and with the composition of
music; which things are bodies,1204 or at least are to be ultimately referred to sensible matter.</p>
<p>What is mathematics?</p>
<p>Mathematics is a theoretic science1205 of things apprehensible by perception and sensation
for communication to others.1206 And before this a certain person indulging in a joke,
while hitting his mark, said that mathematics is that science to which Homer’s description
of Discord may be applied.—</p>
<p>“Small at her birth, but rising every hour,</p>
<p>While scarce the skies her horrid (mighty) head can bound,</p>
<p>She stalks on earth and shakes the world around.”1207</p>
<p>For it begins with a point and a line,1208 and forthwith it takes heaven itself and all
things within its compass.</p>
<p>How many divisions are there of mathematics?</p>
<p>Of the more notable and the earliest mathematics there are two principal divisions, viz.,
arithmetic and geometry. And of the mathematics which deals with things sensible there
are six divisions, viz., computation (practical arithmetic), geodesy, optics, theoretical music,
mechanics, and astronomy. But that neither the so-called tactics nor architecture,1209 nor
the popular music, nor physics, nor the art which is called equivocally the mechanical,
constitutes, as some think, a branch of mathematics, we shall prove, as the discourse proceeds,
clearly and systematically.</p>
<p>As to the circle having eight solids and six superficies and four angles.…What branches
of arithmetic have closest affinity with each other? Computation and theoretical music have

<pb n="366"/>
a closer affinity than others with arithmetic; for this department, being one also of quantity
and ratio, approaches it in number and proportion.1210 Optics and geodesy, again, are more
in affinity with geometry. And mechanics and astrology are in general affinity with both.</p>
<p>As to mathematics having its principles1211 in hypothesis and about hypothesis. Now,
the term hypothesis is used in three ways, or indeed in many ways. For according to one
usage of the term we have the dramatic revolution;1212 and in this sense there are said to
be hypotheses in the dramas of Euripides. According to a second meaning, we have the investigation
of matters in the special in rhetoric; and in this sense the Sophists say that a hypothesis
must be proposed. And, according to a third signification, the beginning of a proof
is called a hypothesis, as being the begging of certain matters with a view to the establishment
of another in question. Thus it is said that Democritus1213 used a hypothesis, namely, that
of atoms and a vacuum; and Asclepiades1214 that of atoms1215 and pores. Now, when applied
to mathematics, the term hypothesis is to be taken in the third sense.</p>
<p>That Pythagoras was not the only one who duly honoured arithmetic, but that his best
known disciples did so too, being wont to say that “all things fit number.”1216</p>
<p>That arithmetic has as its immediate end chiefly the theory of science,1217 than which
there is no end either greater or nobler. And its second end is to bring together in one all
that is found in determinate substance.1218</p>

discovered that the moon has her light from the sun, and found out also the way
in which she suffers eclipse. And the rest of the mathematicians have also made additions
to these discoveries. We may instance the facts—that the fixed stars move round the axis
passing through the poles, while the planets remove from each other1226 round the perpendicular

<head>Theognostus of Alexandria.</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 260.</del> I can add nothing but conjectures to the following:] Of this Theognostus we
have no account by either Eusebius or Jerome. Athanasius, however, mentions him more
than once with honour. Thus he speaks of him as ἀνὴρ λόγιος, an eloquent or learned
man.1242 And again as Θεόγνωστος ὁ θαυμάσιος καὶ σπουδαῖος, the admirable and zealous
Theognostus.1243 He seems to have belonged to the Catechetical school of Alexandria, and
to have flourished there in the latter half of the third century, probably about a.d. 260. That
he was a disciple of Origen, or at least a devoted student of his works, is clear from Photius.
1244 He wrote a work in seven books, the title of which is thus given by Photius:1245 The
Outlines of the blessed Theognostus, the exegete of Alexandria. Dodwell and others are of
opinion that by this term exegete,1246 is meant the presidency of the Catechetical school
and the privilege of public teaching; and that the title, Outlines,1247 was taken from Clement,
his predecessor in office. According to Photius, the work was on this plan. The first book
treated of God the Father, as the maker of the universe; the second, of the necessary existence
of the Son; the third, of the Holy Spirit; the fourth, of angels and demons; the fifth and sixth,
of the incarnation of God; while the seventh bore the title, On God’s Creation.1248 Photius
has much to say in condemnation of Thegnostus, who, however, has been vindicated by
Bull1249 and Prudentius Maranus.1250 Gregory of Nyssa has also charged him with holding
the same error as Eunomius on the subject of the Son’s relation to the work of creation.1251
He is adduced, however, by Athanasius as a defender of the Homoüsian doctrine.</p>

<p>The substance1253 of the Son is not a substance devised extraneously,1254 nor is it one
introduced out of nothing;1255 but it was born of the substance of the Father, as the reflection
of light or as the steam of water. For the reflection is not the sun itself, and the steam is not
the water itself, nor yet again is it anything alien; neither is He Himself the Father, nor is He
alien, but He is1256 an emanation1257 from the substance of the Father, this substance of
the Father suffering the while no partition. For as the sun remains the same and suffers no
diminution from the rays that are poured out by it, so neither did the substance of the
Father undergo any change in having the Son as an image of itself.</p>

<p>Theognostus, moreover, himself adds words to this effect: He who has offended against
the first term1259 and the second, may be judged to deserve smaller punishment; but he who
has also despised the third, can no longer find pardon. For by the first term and the second,
he says, is meant the teaching concerning the Father and the Son; but by the third is meant
the doctrine committed to us with respect to the perfection1260 and the partaking of the
Spirit. And with the view of confirming this, he adduces the word spoken by the Saviour to
the disciples: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. But
when the Holy Spirit is come, He will teach you.”1261</p>

<p>Then he says again: As the Saviour converses with those not yet able to receive what is
perfect,1263 condescending to their littleness, while the Holy Spirit communes with the
perfected, and yet we could never say on that account that the teaching of the Spirit is superior
to the teaching of the Son, but only that the Son condescends to the imperfect, while the
Spirit is the seal of the perfected; even so it is not on account of the superiority of the Spirit
over the Son that the blasphemy against the Spirit is a sin excluding impunity and pardon,
but because for the imperfect there is pardon, while for those who have tasted the heavenly
gift,1264 and been made perfect, there remains no plea or prayer for pardon.</p>

<head>Pierus of Alexandria.1265</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 275.</del> Among the very eminent men who flourished near his own time, Eusebius
mentions Pierius, a presbyter of Alexandria, and speaks of him as greatly renowned for his
voluntary poverty, his philosophical erudition and his skill in the exposition of Scripture
and in discoursing to the public assemblies of the Church.1266 He lived in the latter part of
the third century, and seems to have been for a considerable period president of the Catechetical
school at Alexandria. Jerome says that he was called Origenes, junior; and according
to Photius, he shared in some of the errors of Origen, on such subjects especially as the
doctrine of the Holy Ghost and the pre-existence of souls.1267 In his manner of life he was
an ascetic. After the persecution under Galerius or Maximus he lived at Rome. He appears
to have devoted himself largely to sacred criticism and the study of the text of Scripture;
and among several treatises written by him, and extant in the time of Photius, we find
mention made of one on the prophet Hosea. And, in addition to the Commentary on the
First Epistle to the Corinthians,1268 Photius notices twelve books of his, and praises both
their composition and their matter.1269</p>

<head>II.—A Section on the Writings of Pierius.1274</head>
<p>Different Discourses of the Presbyter Pierius.</p>
<p>There was read a book by Pierius the presbyter, who, they say, endured the conflict1275
for Christ, along with his brother Isidorus. And he is reputed to have been the teacher of
the martyr Pamphilus in ecclesiastical studies, and to have been president of the school at
Alexandria. The work contained twelve books.1276 And in style he is perspicuous and clear,
with the easy flow, as it were, of a spoken address, displaying no signs of laboured art,1277
but bearing us quietly along, smoothly and gently, like off-hand speaking. And in argument
he is most fertile, if any one is so. And he expresses his opinion on many things outside
what is now established in the Church, perhaps in an antique manner;1278 but with respect
to the Father and the Son, he sets forth his sentiments piously, except that he speaks of two
substances and two natures; using, however, the terms substance and nature, as is apparent
from what follows, and from what precedes this passage, in the sense of person1279 and not
in the sense put on it by the adherents of Arius. With respect to the Spirit, however, he lays
down his opinion in a very dangerous and far from pious manner. For he affirms that He
is inferior to the Father and the Son in glory.1280 He has a passage also in the book1281 entitled,
On the Gospel according to Luke, from which it is possible to show that the honour
or dishonour of the image is also the honour or dishonour of the original. And, again, he
indulges in some obscure speculations, after the manner of the nonsense of Origen, on the
subject of the “pre-existence of souls.” And also in the book on the Passover (Easter) and
on Hosea, he treats both of the cherubim made by Moses, and of the pillar of Jacob, in which
passages he admits the actual construction of those things, but propounds the foolish theory
that they were given economically, and that they were in no respect like other things which
are made; inasmuch as they bore the likeness of no other form, but had only, as he foolishly
says, the appearance of wings.1282</p>

<head>Theonas of Alexandria.</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 300.</del> Of this Theonas we know extremely little. Eusebius1283 tells us that Maximus,
who had held the episcopal office at Alexandria for eighteen years after the death of Dionysius,
was succeeded by Theonas. That bishopric, we also learn, he held for nineteen years. His
date is fixed as from about 282 to 300 a.d. The only thing of his that has come down to our
time is his letter to Lucianus, the chief chamberlain,1284 and a person in high favour with
the emperor. This epistle, which is a letter of advice to that individual on the duties of his
office, was first published in the Spicilegium of Dacherius, and again in Gallandi’s Bibliotheca.
The name of the emperor is not given, neither does the letter itself tell us who the Bishop
Theonas was who wrote it. Hence some have, without much reason, supposed another
Theonas, bishop of Cyzicus, as the author. And some, such as Cave, have thought the emperor
in question was Constantius Chlorus. But the whole circumstances suit Diocletian
best.1285 Some infer from the diction of the epistle, as we have it, that it is a translation from
a Greek original.</p>

<p>Bishop Theonas to Lucianus, the Chief Chamberlain of Our Most Invincible Emperor.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>I.</head>
<p>I give thanks to Almighty God and our Lord Jesus Christ, who has not given over the
manifesting of His faith throughout the whole world, as the sole specific for our salvation,1287
and the extending of it even in the course of the persecutions of despots. Yea, like gold reduced
in the furnace, it has only been made to shine the more under the storms of persecution,
and its truth and grandeur have only become always the more and more illustrious,
so that now, peace being granted to the churches by our gracious prince, the works of
Christians are shining even in sight of the unbelieving, and God your Father, who is in
heaven, is glorified thereby;1288 a thing which, if we desire to be Christians in deed rather
than in word, we ought to seek and aspire after as our first object on account of our salvation.
For if we seek our own glory, we set our desire upon a vain and perishing object, and one
which leads ourselves on to death. But the glory of the Father and of the Son, who for our
salvation was nailed to the cross, makes us safe for the everlasting redemption; and that is
the greatest hope of Christians.</p>
<p>Wherefore, my Lucianus, I neither suppose nor desire that you should make it a matter
of boasting, that by your means many persons belonging to the palace of the emperor have
been brought to the knowledge of the truth; but rather does it become us to give the thanks
to our God who has made thee a good instrument for a good work, and has raised thee to
great honour with the emperor, that you might diffuse the sweet savour of the Christian
name to His own glory and to the salvation of many. For just the more completely that the
emperor himself, though not yet attached1289 to the Christian religion, has entrusted the
care of his life and person to these same Christians as his more faithful servants, so much
the more careful ought ye to be, and the more diligent and watchful in seeing to his safety
and in attending upon him, so that the name of Christ may be greatly glorified thereby, and

His faith extended daily through you who wait upon the emperor. For in old times some
former princes thought us malevolent and filled with all manner of crime; but now, seeing
your good works, they should not be able to avoid glorifying Christ Himself.1290</p>

<p>Therefore you ought to strive to the utmost of your power not to fall into a base or dishonourable,
not to say an absolutely flagitious way of thinking, lest the name of Christ be
thus blasphemed even by you. Be it far from you that you should sell the privilege of access
to the emperor to any one for money, or that you should by any means place a dishonest
account of any affair before your prince, won over either by prayers or by bribes. Let all the
lust of avarice be put from you, which serves the cause of idolatry rather than the religion
of Christ.1291 No filthy lucre, no duplicity, can befit the Christian who embraces the simple
and unadorned1292 Christ. Let no scurrilous or base talk have place among you. Let all
things be done with modesty, courteousness, affability, and uprightness, so that the name
of our God and Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in all.</p>
<p>Discharge the official duties to which you are severally appointed with the utmost fear
of God and affection to your prince, and perfect carefulness. Consider that every command
of the emperor which does not offend God has proceeded from God Himself;1293 and execute
it in love as well as in fear, and with all cheerfulness. For there is nothing which so well refreshes
a man who is wearied out with weighty cares as the seasonable cheerfulness and
benign patience of an intimate servant; nor, again, on the other hand, does anything so
much annoy and vex him as the moroseness and impatience and grumbling of his servant.
Be such things far from you Christians, whose walk is in zeal for the faith.1294 But in order
that God may be honoured1295 in yourselves, suppress ye and tread down all your vices of
mind and body. Be clothed with patience and courtesy; be replenished with the virtues and
the hope of Christ. Bear all things for the sake of your Creator Himself; endure all things;
overcome and get above all things, that ye may win Christ the Lord. Great are these duties,
and full of painstaking. But he that striveth for the mastery1296 is temperate in all things;
and they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</p>

<p>But because, as I apprehend it, ye are assigned to different offices, and you, Lucianus,
are styled the head of them all, whom, also, by the grace of Christ given you, you are able
to direct and dispose in their different spheres, I am certain that it will not displease you if
I also bring before your notice, in a particular and summary manner, some of my sentiments
on the subject of these offices. For I hear that one of you keeps the private moneys of the
emperor; another the imperial robes and ornaments; another the precious vessels; another
the books, who, I understand, does not as yet belong to the believers; and others the different
parts of the household goods. And in what manner, therefore, these charges ought, in my
judgment, to be executed, I shall indicate in a few words.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="387"/>
<head>IV.</head>
<p>He who has charge of the private moneys of the emperor ought to keep every thing in
an exact reckoning. He should be ready at any time to give an accurate account of all things.
He should note down every thing in writing, if it is at all possible, before giving money to
another. He should never trust such things to his memory, which, being drawn off day by
day to other matters, readily fails us, so that, without writing, we sometimes honestly certify
things which have never existed; neither should this kind of writing be of a commonplace
order, but such as easily and clearly unfolds all things, and leaves the mind of the inquirer
without any scruple or doubt on the subject; a thing which will easily be effected if a distinct
and separate account is kept in writing of all receipts, and of the time when, and the person
by whom, and the place at which they were made.1297 And, in like manner, all that is paid
out to others, or expended by order of the emperor, should be entered in its own place by
itself in the reckoning; and that servant should be faithful and prudent, so that his lord may
rejoice that he has set him over his goods,1298 and may glorify Christ in him.</p>

<p>Nor will the diligence and care of that servant be less who has the custody of the robes
and imperial ornaments. All these he should enter in a most exact catalogue, and he should
keep a note of what they are and of what sort, and in what places stored, and when he received
them, and from whom, and whether they are soiled or unsoiled. All these things he should
keep in his diligence; he should often review again, and he should often go over them that
they may be the more readily known again. All these he should have at hand, and all in
readiness; and he should always give the clearest information on every matter on which it
is sought, to his prince or his superior, whenever they ask about any thing; and all this at
the same time in such wise that every thing may be done in humility and cheerful patience,
and that the name of Christ may be praised even in a small matter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="389"/>
<head>VI.</head>
<p>In a similar manner should he conduct himself to whose fidelity are entrusted the vessels
of silver and gold, and crystal or murrha,1299 for eating or for drinking. All these he should
arrange suitably, of them all he should keep an account, and with all diligence he should
make an inventory of how many and which sort of precious stones are in them. He should
examine them all with great prudence; he should produce them in their proper places and
on their proper occasions. And he should observe most carefully to whom he gives them,
and at what time, and from whom he receives them again, lest there should occur any mistake
or injurious suspicion, or perhaps some considerable loss in things of value.
1299 Murrhine vessels were first introduced into Rome by Pompey. They were valued chiefly for their variegated
colours, and were extremely costly. Some think they were made of onyx stone, others of variegated glass: but
most modern writers suppose that what is meant was some sort of porcelain.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="390"/>
<head>VII.</head>
<p>The most responsible person, however, among you, and also the most careful, will be
he who may be entrusted by the emperor with the custody of his library. He will himself
select for this office a person of proved knowledge, a man grave and adapted to great affairs,
and ready to reply to all applications for information, such a one as Philadelphus chose for
this charge, and appointed to the superintendence of his most noble library—I mean Aristeus,
his confidential chamberlain, whom he sent also as his legate to Eleazar, with most magnificent
gifts, in recognition of the translation of the Sacred Scriptures; and this person also
wrote the full history of the Seventy Interpreters. If, therefore, it should happen that a believer
in Christ is called to this same office, he should not despise that secular literature and those
Gentile intellects which please the emperor.1300 To be praised are the poets for the greatness
of their genius, the acuteness of their inventions, the aptness and lofty eloquence of their
style. To be praised are the orators; to be praised also are the philosophers in their own class.
To be praised, too, are the historians, who unfold to us the order of exploits, and the manners
and institutions of our ancestors, and show us the rule of life from the proceedings of the
ancients. On occasion also he will endeavour to laud the divine Scriptures, which, with
marvellous care and most liberal expenditure, Ptolemy Philadelphus caused to be translated
into our language;1301 and sometimes, too, the Gospel and the Apostle will be lauded for
their divine oracles; and there will be an opportunity for introducing the mention of Christ;
and, little by little, His exclusive divinity will be explained; and all these things may happily
come to pass by the help of Christ.</p>
<p>He ought, therefore, to know all the books which the emperor possesses; he should often
turn them over, and arrange them neatly in their proper order by catalogue; if, however, he
shall have to get new books, or old ones transcribed, he should be careful to obtain the most
accurate copyists; and if that cannot be done, he should appoint learned men to the work
of correction, and recompense them justly for their labours. He should also cause all manuscripts
to be restored according to their need, and should embellish them, not so much with
mere superstitious extravagance, as with useful adornment; and therefore he should not
aim at having the whole manuscripts written on purple skins and in letters of gold, unless
the emperor has specially required that. With the utmost submission, however, he should
do every thing that is agreeable to Cæsar. As he is able, he should, with all modesty, suggest
to the emperor that he should read, or hear read, those books which suit his rank and honour,
and minister to good use rather than to mere pleasure. He should himself first be thoroughly
familiar with those books, and he should often commend them in presence of the emperor,
<note type="footnote">1300 [A lofty spirit of liberal love for literature is here exemplified.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1301 It is from these words that the inference is drawn that this epistle was written by a Greek.</note>

and set forth, in an appropriate fashion, the testimony and the weight of those who approve
them, that he may not seem to lean to his own understanding only.</p>

<head>VIII.</head>
<p>Those, moreover, who have the care of the emperor’s person should be in all things as
prompt as possible; always, as we have said, cheerful in countenance, sometimes merry, but
ever with such perfect modesty as that he may commend it above all else in you all, and
perceive that it is the true product of the religion of Christ. You should also all be elegant
and tidy in person and attire, yet, at the same time, not in such wise as to attract notice by
extravagance or affectation, lest Christian modesty be scandalised.1302 Let every thing be
ready at its proper time, and disposed as well as possible in its own order. There should also
be due arrangement among you, and carefulness that no confusion appear in your work,
nor any loss of property in any way; and appropriate places should be settled and suitably
prepared, in accordance with the capacity (captu) and importance of the places.</p>
<p>Besides this, your servants should be the most thoroughly honest, and circumspect, and
modest, and as serviceable to you as possible. And see that you instruct and teach them in
true doctrine with all the patience and charity of Christ; but if they despise and lightly esteem
your instructions, then dismiss them, lest their wickedness by any hap recoil upon yourselves.
For sometimes we have seen, and often we have heard, how masters have been held in illrepute
in consequence of the wickedness of their servants.</p>
<p>If the emperor visits her imperial majesty, or she him, then should ye also be most circumspect
in eye and demeanour, and in all your words. Let her mark your mastery of
yourselves and your modesty;1303 and let her followers and attendants mark your demeanour;
let them mark it and admire it, and by reason thereof praise Jesus Christ our Lord in you.
Let your conversation always be temperate and modest, and seasoned with religion as with
salt.1304 And, further, let there be no jealousy among you or contentiousness, which might
bring you into all manner of confusion and division, and thus also make you objects of
aversion to Christ and to the emperor, and lead you into the deepest abomination, so that
not one stone of your building could stand upon another.</p>

<p>And do thou, my dearest Lucianus, since thou art wise, bear with good-will the unwise;
1305 and they too may perchance become wise. Do no one an injury at any time, and
provoke no one to anger. If an injury is done to you, look to Jesus Christ; and even as ye
desire that He may remit your transgressions, do ye also forgive them theirs;1306 and then
also shall ye do away with all ill-will, and bruise the head of that ancient serpent,1307 who
is ever on the watch with all subtlety to undo your good works and your prosperous attainments.
Let no day pass by without reading some portion of the Sacred Scriptures, at such
convenient hour as offers, and giving some space to meditation.1308 And never cast off the
habit of reading in the Holy Scriptures; for nothing feeds the soul and enriches the mind so
well as those sacred studies do. But look to this as the chief gain you are to make by them,
that, in all due patience, ye may discharge the duties of your office religiously and piously—
that is, in the love of Christ—and despise all transitory objects for the sake of His
eternal promises, which in truth surpass all human comprehension and understanding,1309
and shall conduct you into everlasting felicity.</p>
<p>A happy adieu to you in Christ, my Lord Lucianus.</p>

<head>Phileas.</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p><del>a.d. 307.</del> From Jerome1310 we learn that this Phileas belonged to Thmuis, a town of
Lower Egypt, the modern Tmai, which was situated between the Tanite and Mendesian
branches of the Nile, an episcopal seat, and in the time of Valentinian and Theodosius the
Great a place of considerable consequence, enjoying a separate government of its own. Eusebius1311
speaks of him as a man not less distinguished for his services to his country than
for his eminence in philosophical studies and his proficiency in foreign literature and science.
He tells us further, that, along with another person of considerable importance, by name
Philoromus, being brought to trial for his faith, he withstood the threats and insults of the
judge, and all the entreaties of relatives and friends, to compromise his Christian belief, and
was condemned to lose his head. Jerome also, in the passage already referred to, names him
a true philosopher, and, at the same time, a godly martyr; and states, that on assuming the
bishopric of his native district, he wrote a very, elegant book in praise of the martyrs. Of this
book certain fragments are preserved for us in Eusebius. In addition to these we have also
an epistle which the same Phileas seems to have written in the name of three other bishops,
as well as himself, to Meletius, the bishop of Lycopolis, and founder of the Meletian schism.
This epistle appears to have been written in Greek; but we possess only a Latin version,
which, however, from its abrupt style, is believed to be very ancient. The four bishops whose
names stand at the head of the Epistle—viz., Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas,
are also mentioned by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., viii. 13) as distinguished martyrs. This epistle
was written evidently when those bishops were in prison, and its date is determined by the
mention of Peter as the then bishop of Alexandria. The martyrdom of Phileas is fixed with
much probability as happening at Alexandria, under Maximus, about the year 307 a.d.1312

<head>I.</head>
<p>Having before them all these examples and signs and illustrious tokens which are given
us in the divine and holy Scriptures, the blessed martyrs who lived with us did not hesitate,
but, directing the eye of their soul in sincerity to that God who is over all, and embracing
with willing mind the death which their piety cost them, they adhered steadfastly to their
vocation. For they learned that our Lord Jesus Christ endured man’s estate on our behalf,
that He might destroy all sin, and furnish us with the provision needful for our entrance
into eternal life. “For He thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of
no reputation, taking upon Him the form of a servant: and being found in fashion as a man,
He humbled Himself unto death, even the death of the cross.”1314 For which reason also
these Christ-bearing1315 martyrs sought zealously the greater gifts, and endured, some of
them, every kind of pain and all the varied contrivances of torture not merely once, but once
and again; and though the guards showed their fury against them not only by threatenings
in word, but also by deeds of violence, they did not swerve from their resolution, because
perfect love casteth out fear.1316</p>

<p>And to narrate their virtue and their manly endurance under every torment, what language
would suffice? For as every one who chose was at liberty to abuse them, some beat
them with wooden clubs,1317 and others with rods, and others with scourges, and others
again with thongs, and others with ropes. And the spectacle of these modes of torture had
great variety in it, and exhibited vast malignity. For some had their hands bound behind
them, and were suspended on the rack and had every limb in their body stretched with a
certain kind of pulleys.1318 Then after all this the torturers, according to their orders, lacerated
with the sharp iron claws1319 the whole body, not merely, as in the case of murderers, the
sides only, but also the stomach and the knees and the cheeks. And others were hung up in
mid-air, suspended by one hand from the portico, and their sufferings were fiercer than any
other kind of agony by reason of the distention of their joints and limbs. And others were
bound to pillars, face to face, not touching the ground with their feet, but hanging with all
the weight of the body, so that their chains were drawn all the more tightly by reason of the
tension. And this they endured not simply as long as the governor1320 spoke with them, or
had leisure to hear them, but well-nigh through the whole day. For when he passed on to
others he left some of those under his authority to keep watch over these former, and to
observe whether any of them, being overcome by the torture, seemed likely to yield. But he
gave them orders at the same time to cast them into chains without sparing, and thereafter,
when they were expiring, to throw them on the ground and drag them along. For they said
that they would not give themselves the slightest concern about us, but would look upon us
and deal with us as if we were nothing at all. This second mode of torture our enemies devised
then over and above the scourging.</p>

<p>And there were also some who, after the tortures, were placed upon the stocks and had
both their feet stretched through all the four holes, so that they were compelled to lie on
their back on the stocks, as they were unable (to stand) in consequence of the fresh wounds
they had over the whole body from the scourging. And others being thrown upon the ground
lay prostrated there by the excessively frequent application of the tortures; in which condition
they exhibited to the onlookers a still more dreadful spectacle than they did when actually
undergoing their torments, bearing, as they did, on their bodies the varied and manifold
tokens of the cruel ingenuity of their tortures. While this state of matters went on, some
died under their tortures, putting the adversary to shame by their constancy. And others
were thrust half-dead into the prison, where in a few days, worn out with their agonies, they
met their end. But the rest, getting sure recovery under the application of remedies, through
time and their lengthened detention in prison, became more confident. And thus then,
when they were commanded to make their choice between these alternatives, namely, either
to put their hand to the unholy sacrifice and thus secure exemption from further trouble,
and obtain from them their abominable sentence of absolution and liberation,1321 or else
to refuse to sacrifice, and thus expect the judgment of death to be executed on them, they
never hesitated, but went cheerfully to death.1322 For they knew the sentence declared for
us of old by the Holy Scriptures: “He that sacrificeth to other gods,” it is said, “shall be utterly
destroyed.”1323 And again1324 “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”1325</p>

<head>The Epistle of the Same Phileas of Thmuis to Meletius, Bishop of Lycopolis.</head>
<p>The Beginning of the Epistle of the Bishops.1326</p>
<p>Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas, to Meletius, our friend and fellowminister
in the Lord, greeting. Some reports having reached us concerning thee, which, on
the testimony of certain individuals who came to us, spake of certain things foreign to divine
order and ecclesiastical rule which are being attempted, yea, rather which are being done
by thee, we, in an ingenuous manner held them to be untrustworthy, regarding them to be
such as we would not willingly credit, when we thought of the audacity implied in their
magnitude and their uncertain attempts. But since many who are visiting us at the present
time have lent some credibility to these reports, and have not hesitated to attest them as
facts, we, to our exceeding surprise, have been compelled to indite this letter to thee. And
what agitation and sadness have been caused to us all in common and to each of us individually
by (the report of) the ordination carried through by thee in parishes having no manner
of connection with thee, we are unable sufficiently to express. We have not delayed, however,
by a short statement to prove your practice wrong. There is the law of our fathers and forefathers,
of which neither art thou thyself ignorant, established according to divine and ecclesiastical
order; for it is all for the good pleasure of God and the zealous regard of better
things.1327 By them it has been established and settled that it is not lawful for any bishop
to celebrate ordinations in other parishes1328 than his own; a law which is exceedingly important1329
and wisely devised. For, in the first place, it is but right that the conversation
and life of those who are ordained should be examined with great care; and in the second
place, that all confusion and turbulence should be done away with. For every one shall have
enough to do in managing his own parish, and in finding with great care and many anxieties
suitable subordinates among these with whom he has passed his whole life, and who have
been trained under his hands. But thou, neither making any account of these things, nor
regarding the future, nor considering the law of our sainted fathers and those who have

Peter,1331 on whom we all depend in the hope which we have in the Lord Jesus Christ, nor
softened by our imprisonments and trials, and daily and multiplied reproach, hast ventured
on subverting all things at once. And what means will be left thee for justifying thyself with
respect to these things? But perhaps thou wilt say: I did this to prevent many being drawn
away with the unbelief of many, because the flocks were in need and forsaken, there being
no pastor with them. Well, but it is most certain that they are not in such destitution: in the
first place, because there are many going about them and in a position to act as visitors; and
in the second place, even if there was some measure of neglect on their side, then the proper
way would have been for the representation to be made promptly by the people, and for us
to take account of them according to their desert.1332 But they knew that they were in no
want of ministers, and therefore they did not come to seek them. They knew that we were
wont to discharge them with an admonition from such inquisition for matter of complaint,
or that everything was done with all carefulness which seemed to be for their profit; for all
was done under correction,1333 and all was considered with well-approved honesty. Thou,
however, giving such strenuous attention to the deceits of certain parties and their vain
words, hast made a stealthy leap to the celebrating of ordinations. For if, indeed, those with
thee were constraining thee to this, and in their ignorance were doing violence to ecclesiastical
order, thou oughtest to have followed the common rule and have informed us by letter;
and in that way what seemed expedient would have been done. And if perchance some
persuaded you to credit their story that it was all over with us,—a thing of which thou
couldest not have been ignorant, because there were many passing and repassing by us who
might visit you,—even although, I say, this had been the case, yet thou oughtest to have
waited for the judgment of the superior father and for his allowance of this practice. But
without giving any heed to these matters, but indulging a different expectation, yea rather,
indeed, denying all respect to us, thou hast provided certain rulers for the people. For now
we have learned, too, that there were also divisions,1334 because thy unwarrantable exercise
of the right of ordination displeased many. And thou wert not persuaded to delay such
procedure or restrain thy purpose readily even by the word of the Apostle Paul, the most

<p>The Conclusion of the Epistle of the Bishops.</p>
<p>After receiving and perusing this epistle, he neither wrote any reply nor repaired to
them in the prison, nor went to the blessed Peter. But when all these bishops and presbyters
and deacons had suffered martyrdom in the prison at Alexandria, he at once entered Alexandria.
Now in that city there was a certain person, by name Isidorus, turbulent in character,
and possessed with the ambition of being a teacher. And there was also a certain Arius, who
wore the habit of piety, and was in like manner possessed with the ambition to be a teacher.
And when they discovered the object of Meletius’s passion1340 and what it was that he
sought, hastening to him, and looking with an evil eye on the episcopal authority of the
blessed Peter, that the aim and desire of Meletius might be made patent,1341 they discovered
to Meletius certain presbyters, then in hiding, to whom the blessed Peter had given power
to act as parish-visitors. And Meletius recommending them to improve the opportunity
given them for rectifying their error, suspended them for the time, and by his own authority
ordained two persons in their place,1342 namely, one in prison and another in the mines.
On learning these things the blessed Peter, with much endurance, wrote to the people of
Alexandria an epistle in the following terms.1343</p>

<head>Pamphilus.</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p>[a.d. 309.] According to the common account Pamphilus was a native of Berytus, the
modern Beirût, and a member of a distinguished Phoenician family. Leaving Berytus, however,
at an early period, he repaired to Alexandria and studied under Pierius, the well-known
head of the Catechetical school there. At a subsequent period he went to the Palestinian
Cæsareia, and was made a presbyter of the Church there under Bishop Agapius. In course
of the persecutions of Diocletian he was thrown into prison by Urbanus, the governor of
Palestine. This took place towards the end of the year 307 a.d., and his confinement lasted
till the beginning of the year 309, when he suffered martyrdom by order of Firmilianus, who
had succeeded Urbanus in the governorship of the country. During his imprisonment he
enjoyed the affectionate attendance of Eusebius, the Church historian, and the tender
friendship which subsisted long between the two is well known. It was as a memorial of that
intimacy that Eusebius took the surname of Pamphili. Pamphilus appears to have given
himself up with great enthusiasm to the promotion of Biblical studies, and is spoken of as
the founder of a theological school in which special importance was attached to exposition.
He busied himself also with the transcription and dissemination of the Scriptures and other
writings, such as those of Origen, of whom he was a devoted follower. At Cæsareia he established
a great public library,1344 consisting mainly of ecclesiastical writers; and among the
treasures of that library are mentioned the Tetrapla and Hexapla of Origen, from which,
with the help of Eusebius, he produced a new and revised edition of the Septuagint. There
is a statement in Jerome1345 to the effect that, though he was so great a student of the writings
of others, Pamphilus, through an excess of modesty, wrote no work of his own, with exception
of some letters to his friends.1346 But there is a work bearing the title of An Exposition of
the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles, which is attributed by many to him, although others
ascribe it to Euthalius, bishop of Sulce. And besides this there is also the Apology for Origen,
of which, according to the statement of Photius,1347 the first five books were compiled by
Pamphilus, in conjunction with Eusebius, during the period of his imprisonment, the sixth
book being added by Eusebius after his friend’s martyrdom. Of this Apology we possess now

man, and that philosopher truly such in his life;1349 and again, as that most admirable man
of our times, that glory of the church of Cæsareia.1350 He devotes the eleventh chapter of the
eighth book also to a notice of Pamphilus and other martyrs. And besides all this he wrote
a separate life of his friend, in three books, of which, however, all has perished, with exception
of a few disputed fragments.1351</p>

<head>Malchion.</head>

<head>Translator’s Biographical Notice.</head>
<p>[a.d. 270.] Eusebius1388 speaks of Malchion as a man accomplished in other branches
of learning1389 and well-versed in Greek letters in particular, and as holding the presidency
of the Sophists’ school at Antioch. Jerome1390 says that he taught rhetoric most successfully
in the same city. Nor was it only that he excelled in secular erudition; but for the earnest
sincerity of his Christian faith he obtained the dignity of presbyter in the church of that
place, as Eusebius also tells us. He took part in the Synod of Antioch, which Eusebius calls
the final council, and which Gallandi and others call the second, in opposition to Pearson,
who holds that there was but one council at Antioch. This synod met apparently about a.d.
269, and dealt with Paul of Samosata, who had introduced the heresy of Artemon into the
church of Antioch; and Eusebius says that Malchion was the only one who, in the discussion
which took place there with the arch-heretic, and which was taken down by stenographers
who were present, was able to detect the subtle and crafty sentiments of the man. Paul’s real
opinions being thus unveiled, after he had baffled the acuteness of his ecclesiastical judges
for some time, he was at length convicted; and the discussion was published, and a synodical
epistle was sent on the subject to Dionysius, bishop of Rome, and to Maximus of Alexandria,
and to all the provinces, which, according to Jerome (De vir. illustr., ch. 71), was written by
Malchion, and of which we have extracts in Eusebius.1391</p>

<head>I.—The Epistle Written by Malchion,
In Name of the Synod of Antioch, Against Paul of Samosata.</head>
<p>To Dionysius and Maximus, and to all our fellows in the ministry throughout the world,
both bishops and presbyters and deacons, and to the whole Catholic Church under heaven,
Helenus and Hymenæus and Theophilus and Theotecnus and Maximus, Proclus, Nicomas,
and Ælianus, and Paul and Bolanus and Protogenes and Hierax and Eutychius and
Theodorus and Malchion and Lucius, and all the others who are with us, dwelling in the
neighbouring cities and nations, both bishops and presbyters and deacons, together with
the churches of God, send greeting to our brethren beloved in the Lord.</p>
<p>1. After some few introductory words, they proceed thus:—We wrote to many of the
bishops, even those who live at a distance, and exhorted them to give their help in relieving
us from this deadly doctrine; among these, we addressed, for instance, Dionysius, the bishop
of Alexandria, and Firmilian of Cappadocia, those men of blessed name. Of these, the one
wrote to Antioch without even deigning to honour the leader in this error by addressing
him; nor did he write to him in his own name, but to the whole district,1392 of which letter
we have also subjoined a copy. And Firmilian, who came twice in person, condemned the
innovations in doctrine, as we who were present know and bear witness, and as many others
know as well as we. But when he (Paul) promised to give up these opinions, he believed
him; and hoping that, without any reproach to the Word, the matter would be rightly settled,
he postponed his decision; in which action, however, he was deceived by that denier of his
God and Lord, and betrayer of the faith which he formerly held. And now Firmilian was
minded to cross to Antioch; and he came as far as Tarsus, as having already made trial of
the man’s infidel1393 iniquity. But when we had just assembled, and were calling for him
and waiting for his arrival, his end came upon him.</p>
<p>2. After other matters again, they tell us in the following terms of what manner of life
he was:—But there is no need of judging his actions when he was outside (the Church),
when he revolted from the faith and turned aside to spurious and illegitimate doctrines.
Nor need we say any thing of such matters as this, that, whereas he was formerly poor and
beggarly, having neither inherited a single possession from his fathers, nor acquired any
property by art or by any trade, he has now come to have excessive wealth by his deeds of
iniquity and sacrilege, and by those means by which he despoils and concusses the brethren,
casting the injured unfairly in their suit,1394 and promising to help them for a price, yet

deceiving them all the while and to their loss, taking advantage of the readiness of those in
difficulties to give in order to get deliverance from what troubled them, and thus supposing
that gain is godliness.1395 Neither need I say any thing about his pride and the haughtiness
with which he assumed worldly dignities, and his wishing to be styled procurator1396 rather
than bishop, and his strutting through the market-places, and reading letters and reciting
them1397 as he walked in public, and his being escorted by multitudes of people going before
him and following him; so that he brought ill-will and hatred on the faith by his haughty
demeanour and by the arrogance of his heart. Nor shall I say any thing of the quackery
which he practises in the ecclesiastical assemblies, in the way of courting popularity and
making a great parade, and astounding by such arts the minds of the less sophisticated; nor
of his setting up for himself a lofty tribunal and throne, so unlike a disciple of Christ; nor
of his having a secretum1398 and calling it by that name, after the manner of the rulers of
this world; nor of his striking his thigh with his hand and beating the tribunal with his feet;
nor of his censuring and insulting those who did not applaud him nor shake their
handkerchiefs,1399 as is done in the theatres, nor bawl out and leap about after the manner
of his partisans, both male and female, who were such disorderly listeners to him, but chose
to hear reverently and modestly as in the house of God; nor of his unseemly and violent attacks
in the congregation upon the expounders of the Word who have already departed this
life, and his magnifying of himself, not like a bishop, but like a sophist and juggler; nor of
his putting a stop to the psalms sung in honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the recent
compositions of recent men, and preparing women to sing psalms in honour of himself in
the midst of the Church. in the great day of the Paschal festival, which choristers one might
shudder to hear. And besides, he acted on those bishops and presbyters, who fawned upon
him in the neighbouring districts and cities, to advance the like opinions in their discourses
to their people.</p>
<p>3. For we may say, to anticipate a little what we intend to write below, that he does not
wish to acknowledge that the Son of God came down from heaven. And this is a statement
which shall not be made to depend on simple assertion; for it is proved abundantly by those
memoranda which we sent you, and not least by that passage in which he says that Jesus

Christ is from below. And they who sing his praise and eulogise him among the people,
declare that their impious teacher has come down as an angel from heaven. And such utterances
the haughty man does not check, but is present even when they are made. And then
again there are these women—these adopted sisters,1400 as the people of Antioch call
them—who are kept by him and by the presbyters and deacons with him, whose incurable
sins in this and other matters, though he is cognisant of them, and has convicted them, he
connives at concealing, with the view of keeping the men subservient to himself, and preventing
them, by fear for their own position, from daring to accuse him in the matter of his
impious words and deeds. Besides this, he has made his followers rich, and for that he is
loved and admired by those who set their hearts on these things. But why should we write
of these things? For, beloved, we know that the bishop and all the clergy1401 ought to be an
example in all good works to the people. Nor are we ignorant of the fact that many have
fallen away through introducing these women into their houses, while others have fallen
under suspicion. So that, even although one should admit that he has been doing nothing
disgraceful in this matter, yet he ought at least to have avoided the suspicion that springs
out of such a course of conduct, lest perchance some might be offended, or find inducement
to imitate him. For how, then, should any one censure another, or warn him to beware of
yielding to greater familiarity with a woman, lest perchance he might slip, as it is written:1402
if, although he has dismissed one, he has still retained two with him, and these in the bloom
of their youth, and of fair countenance; and if when he goes away he takes them with him;
and all this, too, while he indulges in luxury and surfeiting?</p>
<p>4. And on account of these things all are groaning and lamenting with themselves; yet
they have such a dread of his tyranny and power that they cannot venture on accusing him.
And of these things, as we have said already, one might take account in the case of a man
who held Catholic sentiments and belonged to our own number; but as to one who has betrayed1403
the mystery (of the faith), and who swaggers1404 with the abominable heresy of
Artemas,—for why should we hesitate to disclose his father?—we consider it unnecessary
to exact of him an account for these things.</p>

<p>5. Then at the close of the epistle they add the following words:—We have been compelled,
therefore, to excommunicate this man, who thus opposeth God Himself, and refuses submission,
and to appoint in his place another bishop for the Church Catholic, and that, as
we trust, by the providence of God—namely, the son of Demetrianus, a man of blessed
memory, and one who presided over the same Church with distinction in former times,
Domnus by name, a man endowed with all the noble qualities which become a bishop. And
this fact we have communicated to you in order that ye may write him, and receive letters
of communion1405 from him. And that other may write to Artemas, if it please him; and
those who think with Artemas may hold communion with him, if they are so minded.</p>
<note type="footnote">1405 κοινωνικὰ γράμματα. On this Valesius gives the following note:—The Latins call these litteræ communicatoriæ,
the use of which is of very ancient date in the Church. They called the same also formatæ, as Augustine
witnesses in Epistle 163. There were, moreover, two kinds of them. For there were some which were given to
the clergy and laity when about to travel, that they might be admitted to communion by foreign bishops. And
there were others which bishops were in the way of sending to other bishops, and which they in turn received
from others, for the purpose of attesting their inter-communion; of which sort the Synod speaks here. These
were usually sent by recently-ordained bishops soon after their ordination. Augustine, Epistle 162; Cyprian, in
the Epistle to Cornelius, p. 320; and the Synodical Epistle of the Council of Sardica, appear to refer to these,
though they may refer also to the formatæ. [Vol. i. p. 12, n. 9.]</note>

<p>He says, therefore, in the commentaries (they speak of Paul), that he maintains the
dignity of wisdom.</p>
<p>And thereafter:</p>
<p>If, however, he had been united1407 according to formation and generation, this is what
befalls the man. And again: For that wisdom, as we believe, was not congenerate1408 with
humanity substantially, but qualitatively.1409</p>
<p>And thereafter:</p>
<p>In what respect, moreover, does he mean to allege that the formation1410 of Christ is
different and diverse from ours, when we hold that, in this one thing of prime consequence,
His constitution differs from ours, to wit, that what in us is the interior man, is in Him the
Word.1411</p>
<p>And thereafter:</p>
<p>If he means to allege that Wisdom dwells in Him as in no other, this expresses indeed
the same mode of inhabitation, though it makes it excel in respect of measure and multitude;
He being supposed to derive a superior knowledge from the Wisdom, say for example, twice
as large as others, or any other number of times as large; or, again, it may be less than twice
as large a knowledge as others have. This, however, the catholic and ecclesiastical canons
disallow, and hold rather that other men indeed received of Wisdom as an inspiration from
without, which, though with them, is distinct from them;1412 but that Wisdom in verity
came of itself substantially into His body by Mary.</p>

<p>And after other matters:</p>
<p>And they hold that there are not two Sons. But if Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and if
Wisdom also is the Son of God; and if the Wisdom is one thing and Jesus Christ another,
there are two Sons.</p>
<p>And thereafter:</p>
<p>Moreover understand (Paul would say) the union with Wisdom in a different sense,
namely as being one according to instruction and participation;1413 but not as if it were
formed according to the substance in the body.</p>
<p>And after other matters:</p>
<p>Neither was the God who bore the human body and had assumed it, without knowledge1414
of human affections1415 in the first instance;1416 nor was the human body without
knowledge, in the first instance, of divine operations in him in whom He (the God) was,
and by whom He wrought these operations. He was formed, in the first instance, as man in
the womb; and, in the second instance,1417 the God also was in the womb, united essentially
with the human,1418 that is to say, His substance being wedded with the man.</p>

Jesus Christ, who was made one (person), constituted by God the Word, and a human body
which is of the seed of David, and who subsists without having any manner of division
between the two, but in unity. You, however, appear to me to decline to admit a constitution1421
after this fashion: to the effect that there is not in this person, the Son of God according
to substance, but only the Wisdom according to participation. For you made this
assertion, that the Wisdom bears dispensing, and therefore cannot be compounded;1422
and you do not consider that the divine Wisdom remained undiminished, even as it was
before it evacuated itself;1423 and thus in this self-evacuation, which it took upon itself in
compassion (for us), it continued undiminished and unchangeable. And this assertion you
also make, that the Wisdom dwelt in Him, just as we also dwell in houses, the one in the
other,1424 and yet not as if we formed a part of the house, or the house a part of us.</p>

<p>Malchion, though a presbyter of Antioch, reflects the teaching of Alexandria, and illustrates
its far-reaching influence. Firmilian, presiding at the Council of Antioch, was a pupil
of Origen; and Dionysius was felt in the council, though unable to be present. Malchion
and Firmilian, therefore, vindicate the real mind of Origen, though speaking in language
matured and guarded. This council was, providentially, a rehearsal for Nicæa.</p>

His Godhead.’”</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Archelaus.</head>
<p>[a.d. 277.] The Manichæan heresy, which was destined to operate so terribly against the
Church and the purity of the Gospel, encountered its earliest successful antagonism in the
Thebaid; and I have not doubted the wisdom of prefixing this Disputation to the veritable
name and work of Alexander of Lycopolis, as important to the complete history of the great
Alexandrian school. The Edinburgh translator of this work regards it as an “authentic relic
of antiquity,” in spite of Beausobre, who treats it as a romance. I have forced myself, in this
republication, to reject no theory of the Edinburgh collaborators to which I have not been
able to give as much critical attention, at least, as they have evidently bestowed upon their
work. It seems to me a well-sustained presumption that the work is fundamentally real, and
Dr. Neander admits its base of fact. It is useful, at any rate, in its form and place, as here
presented, and so much may be inferred from the following:—
<lg>
<l>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>A certain memorable Disputation, which was conducted by a bishop of the name of
Archelaus with the heretic Manes, is mentioned by various writers of an early date.1430
What professes to be an account of that Disputation has come down to us in a form mainly
Latin, but with parts in Greek. A considerable portion of this Latin version was published
by Valesius in his edition of Socrates and Sozomen, and subsequently by others in greater
<note type="footnote">1430 Thus Cyril of Jerusalem, in the sixth book of his Catecheses, §§ 27 and 30, tells us how Manes fled into
Mesopotamia, and was met there by that shield of righteousness (ὅπλον δικαιοσύνης) Bishop Archelaus, and
was refuted by him in the presence of a number of Greek philosophers, who had been brought together as judges
of the discussion. Epiphanius, in his Heresies, lxvi., and again in his work De Mensuris et Poderibus, § 20, makes
reference to the same occasion, and gives some excerpts from the Acts of the Disputation. And there are also
passages of greater or less importance in Jerome (De vir. illustr., ch. 72), Socrates (Hist. Eccles., i. 22), Heraclianus
bishop of Chalcedon (as found in Photius, Bibliotheca, Cod. xcv.), Petrus Siculus (Historia Manichæorum, pp.
25, 35, 37), Photius (Adversus Manichæos, book i., edited in the Biblioth. Coislin., Montfaucon, pp. 356, 358),
and the anonymous authors of the Libellus Synodicus, ch. 27, and the Historia Hæreseos Manichæorum in the
Codex Regius of Turin. [See Cyril’s text in Routh, R. S., vol. v. pp. 198–205.]</note>

<pb n="422"/>
completeness, and with the addition of the Greek fragments.1431 There seems to be a difference
among the ancient authorities cited above as to the person who committed these Acts
to writing. Epiphanius and Jerome take it to have been Archelaus himself, while Heraclianus,
bishop of Chalcedon, represents it to have been a certain person named Hegemonius. In
Photius1432 there is a statement to the effect that this Heraclianus, in confuting the errors
of the Manichæans, made use of certain Acts of the Disputation of Bishop Archelaus with
Manes which were written by Hegemonius. And there are various passages in the Acts
themselves which appear to confirm the opinion of Heraclianus.1433 Zacagnius, however,
thinks that this is but an apparent discrepancy, which is easily reconciled on the supposition
that the book was first composed by Archelaus himself in Syriac, and afterwards edited,
with certain amendments and additions, by Hegemonius. That the work was written originally
in Syriac is clear, not only from the express testimony of Jerome,1434 but also from internal
evidence, and specially from the explanations offered now and again of the use of Greek
equivalents. It is uncertain who was the author of the Greek version; and we can only conjecture
that Hegemonius, in publishing a new edition, may also have undertaken a translation
into the tongue which would secure a much larger audience than the original Syriac. But
that this Greek version, by whomsoever accomplished, dates from the very earliest period,
is proved by the excerpts given in Epiphanius. As to the Latin interpretation itself, all that
we can allege is, that it must in all probability have been published after Jerome’s time, who
might reasonably be expected to have made some allusion to it if it was extant in his day;
and before the seventh century, because, in quoting the Scriptures, it does not follow the
Vulgate edition, which was received generally throughout the West by that period. That the
Latin translator must have had before him, not the Syriac, but the Greek copy, is also
manifest, not only from the general idiomatic character of the rendering, but also from
many nicer indications.1435</p>
<p>The precise designation of the seat of the bishopric of Archelaus has been the subject
of considerable diversity of opinion. Socrates1436 and Epiphanius1437 record that Archelaus

was bishop of Caschar, or Caschara.1438 Epiphanius, however, does not keep consistently
by that scription.1439 In the opening sentence of the Acts themselves it appears as Carchar.1440
Now we know that there were at least two towns of the name of Carcha: for the anonymous
Ravenna geographer1441 tells us that there was a place of that name in Arabia Felix; and
Ammianus Marcellinus1442 mentions another beyond the Tigris, within the Persian
dominion. The clear statements, however, to the effect that the locality of the bishopric of
Archelaus was in Mesopotamia, make it impossible that either of these two towns could
have been the seat of his rule. Besides this, in the third chapter of the Acts themselves we
find the name Charra occurring; and hence Zacagnius and others have concluded that the
place actually intended is the scriptural Charran, or Haran, in Mesopotamia, which is also
written Charra in Paulus Diaconus,1443 and that the form Carchar or Carchara was either
a mere error of the transcribers, or the vulgar provincial designation. It must be added,
however, that Neander1444 allows this to be only a very uncertain conjecture, while others
hold that Caschar is the most probable scription, and that the town is one altogether different
from the ancient Haran.</p>
<p>The date of the Disputation itself admits of tolerably exact settlement. Epiphanius, indeed,
1445 says that Manes fled into Mesopotamia in the ninth year of the reign of Valerianus
and Gallienus, and that the discussion with Archelaus took place about the same time. This
would carry the date back to about 262 a.d. But this statement, although he is followed in
it by Petrus Siculus and Photius, is inconsistent with the specification of times which he
makes in dealing with the error of the Manichæans in his book On the Heresies. From the
37th chapter of the Acts, however, we find that the Disputation took place, not when Gal-
lienus, but when Probus held the empire, and that is confirmed by Cyril of Jerusalem.1446
The exact year becomes also clearer from Eusebius, who1447 seems to indicate the second
year of the reign of Probus as the time when the Manichæan heresy attained general publi-

city—Secundo anno Probi…insana Manichæorum hæresis in commune humani generis
malum exorta; and from Leo Magnus, who in his second Discourse on Pentecost also avers
that Manichæus became notorious in the consulship of Probus and Paulinus. And as this
consulship embraced part of the first and part of the second years of the empire of Probus,
the Disputation itself would thus be fixed as occurring in the end of a.d. 277 or the beginning
of 278, or, according to the precise calculation of Zacagnius, between July and December
of the year 277.</p>
<p>That the Acts of this Disputation constitute an authentic relic of antiquity, seems well
established by a variety of considerations. Epiphanius, for instance, writing about the year
a.d. 376, makes certain excerpts from them which correspond satisfactorily with the extant
Latin version. Socrates, again, whose Ecclesiastical History dates about 439, mentions these
Acts, and acknowledges that he drew the materials for his account of the Manichæan heresy
from them. The book itself, too, offers not a few evidences of its own antiquity and authenticity.
The enumeration given of the various heretics who had appeared up to the time of
Archelaus, the mention of his presence at the siege of the city,1448 and the allusions to
various customs, have all been pressed into that service, as may be seen in detail in the
elaborate dissertation prefixed by Zacagnius in his Collectanea Monumentorum Ecclesiæ
Græcæ. At the same time, it is very evident that the work has come down to us in a decidedly
imperfect form. There are, for example, arguments by Manes and answers by Archelaus
recorded in Cyril1449 which are not contained in our Latin version at all. And there are not
a few notes of discrepancy and broken connections in the composition itself,1450 which
show that the manuscripts must have been defective, or that the Latin translator took great
liberties with the Greek text, or that the Greek version itself did not faithfully reproduce the
original Syriac. On the historical character of the work Neander1451 expresses himself
thus:1452 “These Acts manifestly contain an ill-connected narrative, savouring in no small
degree of the romantic. Although there is some truth at the bottom of it—as, for instance,
in the statement of doctrine there is much that wears the appearance of truth, and is confirmed
also by its agreement with other representations: still the Greek author seems, from
ignorance of Eastern languages and customs, to have introduced a good deal that is untrue,
by bringing in and confounding together discordant stories through an uncritical judgment
and exaggeration.”</p>

<p>1. The true Thesaurus;1454 to wit, the Disputation conducted in Carchar, a city of
Mesopotamia, before Manippus1455 and Ægialeus and Claudius and Cleobolus, who acted
as judges. In this city of Mesopotamia there was a certain man, Marcellus by name, who
was esteemed as a person worthy of the highest honour for his manner of life, his pursuits,
and his lineage, and not less so for his discretion and his nobility of character: he was possessed
also of abundant means; and, what is most important of all, he feared God with the
deepest piety, and gave ear always with due reverence to the things which were spoken of
Christ. In short, there was no good quality lacking in that man, and hence it came to pass
that he was held in the greatest regard by the whole city; while, on the other hand, he also
made an ample return for the good-will of his city by his munificent and oft-repeated acts
of liberality in bestowing on the poor, relieving the afflicted, and giving help to the distressed.
But let it suffice us to have said thus much, lest by the weakness of our words we rather take
from the man’s virtues than adduce what is worthy of their splendour. I shall come, therefore,
to the task which forms my subject. On a certain occasion, when a large body of captives
were offered to the bishop Archelaus by the soldiers who held the camp in that place, their
numbers being some seven thousand seven hundred, he was harassed with the keenest
anxiety on account of the large sum of money which was demanded by the soldiers as the
price of the prisoners’ deliverance. And as he could not conceal his solicitude, all aflame for
the religion and the fear of God, he at length hastened to Marcellus, and explained to him
the importance and difficulty of the case. And when that pattern of piety, Marcellus, heard
his narration, without the least delay he went into his house, and provided the price demanded
for the prisoners, according to the value set upon them by those who had led them
captive; and unlocking the treasures of his goods, he at once distributed the gifts of piety1456
among the soldiers, without any severe consideration of number or distinction,1457 so that
they seemed to be presents rather than purchase-moneys. And those soldiers were filled
with wonder and admiration at the grandeur of the man’s piety and munificence, and were
struck with amazement, and felt the force1458 of this example of pity; so that very many of

them were added to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and threw off the belt of military

<p>2. Marcellus, as might well be expected, was exceedingly gratified by these incidents;
and summoning one of the prisoners, by name Cortynius, he inquired of him the cause of
the war, and by what chance it was that they were overcome and bound with the chains of
captivity. And the person addressed, on obtaining liberty to speak, began to express himself
in these terms: “My lord Marcellus, we believe in the living God alone. And we have a custom
of such a nature as I shall now describe, which has descended to us by the tradition of our
brethren in the faith, and has been regularly observed by us up to the present day. The
practice is, that every year we go out beyond the bounds of the city, in company with our
wives and children, and offer up supplications to the only and invisible God, praying Him
to send us rains for our fields and crops.1460 Now, when we were celebrating this observance
at the usual time and in the wonted manner, evening surprised us as we lingered there, and
were still fasting. Thus we were feeling the pressure of two of the most trying things men
have to endure,—namely, fasting and want of sleep. But about midnight sleep enviously
and inopportunely crept upon us, and with necks drooping and unstrung, and heads hanging
down, it made our faces strike against our knees.1461 Now this took place because the time
was at hand when by the judgment of God we were to pay the penalty proper to our deserts,
whether it might be that we were offenders in ignorance, or whether it might be that with
the consciousness of wrong we nevertheless had not given up our sin. Accordingly at that
hour a multitude of soldiers suddenly surrounded us, supposing us, as I judge, to have lodged
ourselves in ambush there, and to be persons with full experience and skill in fighting battles;
and without making any exact inquiry into the cause of our gathering there, they threatened
us with war, not in word, but at once by the sword. And though we were men who had
never learned to do injury to any one, they wounded us pitilessly with their missiles, and
thrust us through with their spears, and cut our throats with their swords. Thus they slew,
indeed, about one thousand and three hundred men of our number, and wounded other
five hundred. And when the day broke clearly, they carried off the survivors amongst us as
prisoners here, and that, too, in a way showing their utter want of pity for us. For they drove
us before their horses, spurring us on by blows from their spears, and impelling us forward
by making the horses’ heads press upon us. And those who had sufficient powers of endurance
did indeed hold out; but very many fell down before the face of their cruel masters,
and breathed out their life there; and mothers, with arms wearied, and utterly powerless
with their burdens, and distracted by the threats of those behind them, suffered the little
ones that were hanging on their breasts to fall to the ground; while all those on whom old
age had come were sinking, one after the other, to the earth, overcome with their toils, and

exhausted by want of food. The proud soldiers nevertheless enjoyed this bloody spectacle
of men continually perishing, as if it had been a kind of entertainment, while they saw some
stretched on the soil in hopeless prostration, and beheld others, worn out by the fierce fires
of thirst and with the bands of their tongues utterly parched, lose the power of speech, and
beheld others with eyes ever glancing backwards, groaning over the fate of their dying little
ones, while these, again, were constantly appealing to their most unhappy mothers with
their cries, and the mothers themselves, driven frantic by the severities of the robbers, responded
with their lamentations, which indeed was the only thing they could do freely. And
those of them whose hearts were most tenderly bound up with their offspring chose voluntarily
to meet the same premature fate of death with their children; while those, on the
other hand, who had some capacity of endurance were carried off prisoners here with us.
Thus, after the lapse of three days, during which time we had never been allowed to take
any rest, even in the night, we were conveyed to this place, in which what has now taken
place after these occurrences is better known to yourself.”</p>
</div>

 <p>3. When Marcellus, the man of consummate piety, had heard this recital, he burst into
a flood of tears, touched with pity for misfortunes so great and so various. But making no
delay, he at once prepared victuals for the sufferers, and did service with his own hand for
the wearied; in this imitating our father Abraham the patriarch, who, when he entertained
the angels hospitably on a certain occasion, did not content himself with merely giving the
order to his slaves to bring a calf from the herd, but did himself, though advanced in years,
go and place it on his shoulders and fetch it in, and did with his own hand prepare food,
and set it before the angels. So Marcellus, in discharge of a similar office, directed them to
be seated as his guests in companies of ten; and when the seven hundred tables were all
provided, he refreshed the whole body of the captives with great delight, so that those who
had strength to survive what they had been called to endure, forgot their toils, and became
oblivious of all their ills. When, however, they had reached the fifteenth day, and while
Marcellus was still liberally supplying all things needful for the prisoners, it seemed good
to him that they should all be put in possession of the means of returning to their own parts,
with the exception of those who were detained by the attention which their wounds demanded;
and providing the proper remedies for these, he instructed the rest to depart to their
own country and friends. And even to all these charities Marcellus added yet larger deeds
of piety. For with a numerous band of his own dependants he went to look after the burying
of the bodies of those who had perished on the march; and for as many of these as he could
discover, of whatsoever condition, he secured the sepulture which was meet for them. And
when this service was completed he returned to Charra, and gave permission to the wounded
to return thence to their native country when their health was sufficiently restored, providing
also most liberal supplies for their use on their journey. And truly the estimate of this deed
made a magnificent addition to the repute of the other noble actions of Marcellus; for through
that whole territory the fame of the piety of Marcellus spread so grandly, that large numbers
of men belonging to various cities were inflamed with the intensest desire to see and become
acquainted with the man, and most especially those persons who had not had occasion to
bear penury before,—to all of whom this remarkable man, following the example of a Marcellus
of old, furnished aid most indulgently, so that they all declared that there was no one
of more illustrious piety than this man. Yea, all the widows, too, who were believers in the
Lord had recourse to him, while the imbecile also could reckon on obtaining at his hand
most certain help to meet their circumstances; and the orphaned, in like manner, were all
supported by him, so that his house was declared to be the hospice for the stranger and the
indigent. And above all this, he retained in a remarkable and singular measure his devotion
to the faith, building up his own heart upon the rock that shall not be moved.</p>

<p>4. Accordingly,1462 as this man’s fame was becoming always the more extensively diffused
throughout different localities, and when it had now penetrated even beyond the river
Stranga, the honourable report of his name was carried into the territory of Persia. In this
country dwelt a person called Manes, who, when this man’s repute had reached him, deliberated
largely with himself as to how he might entangle him in the snares of his doctrine,
hoping that Marcellus might be made an upholder of his dogma. For he reckoned that he
might make himself master of the whole province, if he could only first attach such a man
to himself. In this project, however, his mind was agitated with the doubt whether he should
at once repair in person to the man, or first attempt to get at him by letter; for he was afraid
lest, by any sudden and unexpected introduction of himself upon the scene some mischance
might possibly befall him. At last, in obedience to a subtler policy, he resolved to write; and
calling to him one of his disciples, by name Turbo,1463 who had been instructed by Addas,
he handed to him an epistle, and bade him depart and convey it to Marcellus. This adherent
accordingly received the letter, and carried it to the person to whom he had been commissioned
by Manes to deliver it, overtaking the whole journey within five days. The abovementioned
Turbo, indeed, used great expedition on this journey, in the course of which he
also underwent very considerable exertion and trouble. For whenever he arrived,1464 as1465
a traveller in foreign parts, at a hospice,—and these were inns which Marcellus himself had
supplied in his large hospitality,1466—on his being asked by the keepers of these hostels
whence he came, and who he was, or by whom he had been sent, he used to reply: “I belong
to the district of Mesopotamia, but I come at present from Persis, having been sent by
Manichæus, a master among the Christians.” But they were by no means ready to welcome
a name unknown1467 to them, and were wont sometimes to thrust Turbo out of their inns,
refusing him even the means of getting water for drinking purposes. And as he had to bear
daily things like these, and things even worse than these, at the hands of those persons in
the several localities who had charge of the mansions and hospices, unless he had at last

Archelaus, the bishop of the place. And the following is a copy of what it contained:1468—</p>
<p>Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints who are with me, and the virgins,
to Marcellus, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father,
and from our Lord Jesus Christ; and may the right hand of light preserve you safe from this
present evil world, and from its calamities, and from the snares of the wicked one. Amen.</p>
<p>I was exceedingly delighted to observe the love cherished by you, which truly is of the
largest measure. But I was distressed at your faith, which is not in accordance with the right
standard. Wherefore, deputed as I am to seek the elevation of the race of men, and sparing,
1469 as I do, those who have given themselves over to deceit and error, I have considered
it needful to despatch this letter to you, with a view, in the first place, to the salvation of
your own soul, and in the second place also to that of the souls of those who are with you,
so as to secure you against1470 dubious opinions, and specially against notions like those in
which the guides of the simpler class of minds indoctrinate their subjects, when they allege
that good and evil have the same original subsistence,1471 and when they posit the same
beginning for them, without making any distinction or discrimination between light and
darkness, and between the good and the evil or worthless, and between the inner man and
the outer, as we have stated before, and without ceasing to mix up and confound together
the one with the other. But, O my son, refuse thou thus thoughtlessly to identify these two
things in the irrational and foolish fashion common to the mass of men, and ascribe no
such confusion to the God of goodness. For these men refer the beginning and the end and
the paternity of these ills to God Himself,—“whose end is near a curse.”1472 For they do not
believe the word spoken by our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ Himself in the Gospels,1473
namely, that “a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
good fruit.”1474 And how they can be bold enough to call God the maker and contriver of
Satan and his wicked deeds, is a matter of great amazement to me. Yea, would that even this
had been all the length to which they had gone with their silly efforts, and that they had not

<p>6. On reading this epistle, Marcellus, with the kindest consideration, attended hospitably
to the needs of the bearer of the letter. Archelaus, on the other hand, did not receive very
pleasantly the matters which were read, but “gnashed1479 with his teeth like a chained lion,”
impatient to have the author of the epistle given over to him. Marcellus, however, counselled
him to be at peace; promising that he would himself take care to secure the man’s presence.
And accordingly Marcellus resolved to send an answer to what had been written to him,
and indited an epistle containing the following statements:—</p>
<p>Marcellus, a man of distinction, to Manichæus, who has made himself known to me by
his epistle, greeting.</p>
<p>An epistle written by you has come to my hand, and I have received Turbo with my
wonted kindness; but the meaning of your letter I have by no means apprehended, and may
not do so unless you give us your presence, and explain its contents in detail in the way of
conversation, as you have offered to do in the epistle itself. Farewell.</p>
<p>This letter he sealed and handed to Turbo, with instructions to deliver it to the person
from whom he had already conveyed a similar document. The messenger, however, was
extremely reluctant to return to his master, being mindful of what he had to endure on the
journey, and begged that another person should be despatched in his stead, refusing to go
back to Manes, or to have any intercourse whatever with him again. But Marcellus summoned
one of his young men,1480 Callistus by name, and directed him to proceed to the place.
Without any loss of time this young man set out promptly on his journey thither; and after
the lapse of three days he came to Manes, whom he found in a certain fort, that of Arabion1481
to wit, and to whom he presented the epistle. On perusing it, he was glad to see that he had
been invited by Marcellus; and without delay he undertook the journey; yet he had a
presentiment that Turbo’s failure to return boded no good, and proceeded on his way to
Marcellus, not, as it were, without serious reflections. Turbo, for his part, was not at all
thinking of leaving the house of Marcellus; neither did he omit any opportunity of conversing
with Archelaus the bishop. For both these parties were very diligently engaged in investigating
the practices of Manichæus, being desirous of knowing who he was and whence he came,
and what was his manner of discourse. And he, Turbo, accordingly gave a lucid account of
the whole position, narrating and expounding the terms of his faith in the following manner:
1482—</p>
<note type="footnote">1479 The text gives infrendebat; the Codex Bobiensis has infringebat.[It seems to be a proverb, and I have so

<pb n="435"/>
<p>If you are desirous of being instructed in the faith of Manes by me, attend to me for a
short space. That man worships two deities, unoriginated, self-existent, eternal, opposed
the one to the other. Of these he represents the one as good, and the other as evil, and assigns
the name of Light to the former, and that of Darkness to the latter. He alleges also that the
soul in men is a portion of the light, but that the body and the formation of matter are parts
of the darkness. He maintains, further, that a certain commingling or blending1483 has been
effected between the two in the manner about to be stated, the following analogy being used
as an illustration of the same; to wit, that their relations may be likened to those of two kings
in conflict with each other, who are antagonists from the beginning, and have their own
positions, each in his due order. And so he holds that the darkness passed without its own
boundaries, and engaged in a similar contention with the light; but that the good Father
then, perceiving that the darkness had come to sojourn on His earth, put forth from Himself
a power1484 which is called the Mother of Life; and that this power thereupon put forth
from itself the first man, and the five elements.1485 And these five elements are wind,1486
light, water, fire, and matter. Now this primitive man, being endued with these, and thereby
equipped, as it were, for war, descended to these lower parts, and made war against the
darkness. But the princes of the darkness, waging war in turn against him, consumed that
portion of his panoply which is the soul. Then was that first man grievously injured there
underneath by the darkness; and had it not been that the Father heard his prayers, and sent
a second power, which was also put forth from Himself and was called the living Spirit, and
came down and gave him the right hand, and brought him up again out of the grasp of the
darkness, that first man would, in those ancient times, have been in peril of absolute overthrow.
From that time, consequently, he left the soul beneath. And for this reason the
<note type="footnote">1483 μιξιν δὲ ητοι σύγκρασιν.</note>

<note type="footnote">1485 The text is simply καὶ αὐτὴν προβεβληκέναι τὸν πρῶτον ἄνθρωπον, τὰ πέντε στοιχεια. The Latin, with
emendations from the Codex Bobiensis and Epiphanius, gives quâ virtute circumdedit primum hominem, quæ
sunt quinque elementa, etc., = with which power He begirt the first man, which is the same as the five elements,
etc. With slight differences the Codex Bobiensis reads quâ circumdedit, and the Codex Casinensis, quæ virtute.
Petavius pointed out that there is probably an omission in the text here. And from a passage in Epiphanius,
Hær., lxvi. n. 45, it has been proposed to fill out the sentence thus: προβάλλειν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ δύναμιν μητέρα τῆς
ζωῆς, καὶ αὐτὴν προβεβληκέναι τὸν πρῶτον ἄνθρωπον, αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν μητέρα τῆς ζωῆς τόν τε πρῶτον ἄνθρωπον
τὰ πέντε στοιχεῖα. The sense might then be that the good Father put forth from Himself a power called the
Mother of Life, that this Mother of Life put forth the first man, and that the said Mother of Life and the first man
put forth (or constituted) the five elements. See the note in Routh’s Reliquiæ Sacræ, v. p. 49.</note>

Manichæans, if they meet each other, give the right hand, in token of their having been
saved from darkness; for he holds that the heresies have their seat all in the darkness. Then
the living Spirit created the world; and bearing in himself three other powers, he came down
and brought off the princes, and settled1487 them in the firmament, which is their body,
(though it is called) the sphere. Then, again, the living Spirit created the luminaries, which
are fragments of the soul, and he made them thus to move round and round the firmament;
and again he created the earth in its eight species.1488 And the Omophorus1489 sustains the
burden thereof beneath; and when he is wearied with bearing it he trembles, and in that
manner becomes the cause of a quaking of the earth in contravention of its determinate
times. On account of this the good Father sent His Son forth from His own bosom1490 into
the heart of the earth, and into these lowest parts of it, in order to secure for him the correction
befitting him.1491 And whenever an earthquake occurs, he is either trembling under
his weariness, or is shifting his burden from one shoulder to the other. Thereafter, again,
the matter also of itself produced growths;1492 and when these were carried off as spoil on
the part of some of the princes, he summoned together all the foremost of the princes, and
took from all of them individually power after power, and made up the man who is after
the image of that first man, and united1493 the soul (with these powers) in him. This is the
account of the manner in which his constitution was planned.</p>

<p>8. But when the living Father perceived that the soul was in tribulation in the body, being
full of mercy and compassion, He sent His own beloved Son for the salvation of the soul.
For this, together with the matter of Omophorus, was the reason of His sending Him. And
the Son came and transformed Himself into the likeness of man, and manifested1494 Himself
to men as a man, while yet He was not a man, and men supposed that He was begotten.
Thus He came and prepared the work which was to effect the salvation of the souls, and
with that object constructed an instrument with twelve urns,1495 which is made to revolve
by the sphere, and draws up with it the souls of the dying. And the greater luminary receives
these souls, and purifies them with its rays, and then passes them over to the moon; and in
this manner the moon’s disc, as it is designated by us, is filled up. For he says that these two
luminaries are ships or passage-boats.1496 Then, if the moon becomes full, it ferries its passengers
across toward the east wind, and thereby effects its own waning1497 in getting itself
delivered of its freight. And in this manner it goes on making the passage across, and again
discharging its freight of souls drawn up by the urns, until it saves its own proper portion
of the souls.1498 Moreover, he maintains that every soul, yea, every living creature that
moves, partakes of the substance of the good Father. And accordingly, when the moon delivers
over its freight of souls to the æons of the Father, they abide there in that pillar of
glory, which is called the perfect air.1499 And this air is a pillar of light, for it is filled with
the souls that are being purified. Such, moreover, is the agency by which the souls are saved.
But the following, again, is the cause of men’s dying: A certain virgin, fair in person, and
beautiful in attire, and of most persuasive address, aims at making spoil of the princes that
have been borne up and crucified on the firmament by the living Spirit; and she appears as
a comely female to the princes, but as a handsome and attractive young man to the princesses.
And the princes, when they look on her in her splendid figure, are smitten with love’s sting;
and as they are unable to get possession of her, they burn fiercely with the flame of amorous
desire, and lose all power of reason. While they thus pursue the virgin, she disappears from
view. Then the great prince sends forth from himself the clouds, with the purpose of
bringing darkness on the whole world, in his anger. And then, if he feels grievously oppressed,
his exhaustion expresses itself in perspiration, just as a man sweats under toil; and this sweat

of his forms the rain. At the same time also the harvest-prince,1500 if he too chances to be
captivated by the virgin, scatters pestilence1501 on the whole earth, with the view of putting
men to death. Now this body (of man) is also called a cosmos, i.e., a microcosm, in relation
to the great cosmos, i.e., the macrocosm of the universe; and all men have roots which are
linked beneath with those above. Accordingly, when this prince is captivated by the virgin’s
charms, he then begins to cut the roots of men; and when their roots are cut, then pestilence
commences to break forth, and in that manner they die. And if he shakes the upper parts
of the root mightily,1502 an earthquake bursts, and follows as the consequence of the commotion
to which the Omophorus is subjected. This is the explanation of (the phenomenon
of) death.</p>

<p>9. I shall explain to you also how it is that the soul is transfused into five bodies.1503
First of all, in this process some small portion of it is purified; and then it is transfused into
the body of a dog, or a camel, or some other animal. But if the soul has been guilty of homicide,
it is translated into the body of the celephi;1504 and if it has been found to have engaged
in cutting;1505 it is made to pass into the body of the dumb. Now these are the designations
of the soul,—namely, intelligence, reflection, prudence, consideration, reasoning.1506
Moreover, the reapers who reap are likened to the princes who have been in darkness from
the beginning,1507 since they consumed somewhat of the panoply of the first man. On this
account there is a necessity for these to be translated into hay, or beans, or barley, or corn,
or vegetables, in order that in these forms they, in like manner, may be reaped and cut. And
again, if any one eats bread, he must needs also become bread and be eaten. If one kills a
chicken,1508 he will be a chicken himself. If one kills a mouse, he will also become a mouse
himself. If, again, one is wealthy in this world, it is necessary that, on quitting the tabernacle
of his body, he should be made to pass into the body of a beggar, so as to go about asking
alms, and thereafter he shall depart into everlasting punishment. Moreover, as this body
pertains to the princes and to matter, it is necessary that he who plants a persea1509 should
pass though many bodies until that persea is prostrated. And if one builds a house for himself,
he will be divided and scattered among all the bodies.1510 If one bathes in water, he freezes1511
his soul; and if one refuses to give pious regard1512 to his elect, he will be punished through

many tributes of piety; and for this reason they offer to the elect whatever is best in their
meats. And when they are about to eat bread, they offer up prayer first of all, addressing
themselves in these terms to the bread: “I have neither reaped thee, nor ground thee, nor
pressed thee, nor cast thee into the baking-vessel; but another has done these things, and
brought thee to me, and I have eaten thee without fault.” And when he has uttered these
things to himself, he says to the catechumen,1514 “I have prayed for thee;” and in this manner
that person then takes his departure. For, as I remarked to you a little before, if any one
reaps, he will be reaped; and so, too, if one casts grain into the mill, he will be cast in himself
in like manner, or if he kneads he will be kneaded, or if he bakes he will be baked; and for
this reason they are interdicted from doing any such work. Moreover, there are certain
other worlds on which the luminaries rise when they have set on our world.1515 And if a
person walks upon the ground here, he injures the earth; and if he moves his hand, he injures

are lust and other seductions, which corrupt the rational powers of those men. And that
tree in paradise, by which men know the good, is Jesus Himself, or1518 the knowledge of
Him in the world. He who partakes thereof discerns the good and the evil. The world itself,
however, is not God’s work; but it was the structure of a portion of matter, and consequently
all things perish in it. And what the princes took as spoil from the first man, that is what
makes the moon full, and what is being purged day by day of the world. And if the soul
makes its exit without having gained the knowledge of the truth, it is given over to the
demons, in order that they may subdue it in the Gehennas of fire; and after that discipline
it is made to pass into bodies with the purpose of being brought into subjection, and in this
manner it is cast into the mighty fire until the consummation. Again, regarding the prophets
amongst you,1519 he speaks thus: Their spirit is one of impiety, or of the lawlessness of the
darkness which arose at the beginning. And being deceived by this spirit, they have not
spoken truth; for the prince blinded their mind. And if any one follows their words, he dies
for ever, bound to the clods of earth, because he has not learned the knowledge of the
Paraclete. He also gave injunctions to his elect alone, who are not more than seven in
number. And the charge was this: “When ye cease eating, pray, and put upon your head an
olive, sworn with the invocation of many names for the confirmation of this faith.” The
names, however, were not made known to me; for only these seven make use of them. And
again, the name Sabaoth, which is honourable and mighty with you, he declares to be the
nature of man, and the parent of desire; for which reason the simple1520 worship desire,
and hold it to be a deity. Furthermore, as regards the manner of the creation of Adam, he
tells us that he who said, “Come and let us make man in our image, after our likeness,” or
“after the form which we have seen,” is the prince who addressed the other princes in terms
which may be thus interpreted: “Come, give me of the light which we have received, and let
us make man after the form of us princes, even after that form which we have seen, that is
to say,1521 the first man.” And in that manner he1522 created the man. They created Eve

<p>11. He holds also that God has no part with the world itself, and finds no pleasure in it,
by reason of its having been made a spoil of from the first by the princes, and on account
of the ill that rose on it. Wherefore He sends and takes away from them day by day the soul
belonging to Him, through the medium of these luminaries, the sun and the moon, by which
the whole world and all creation are dominated. Him, again, who spake with Moses, and
the Jews, and the priests, he declares to be the prince of the darkness; so that the Christians,
and the Jews, and the Gentiles are one and the same body, worshipping the same God: for
He seduces them in His own passions, being no God of truth. For this reason all those who
hope in that God who spake with Moses and the prophets have to be bound together with
the said deity,1523 because they have not hoped in the God of truth; for that deity spake with
him in accordance with their own passions. Moreover, after all these things, he speaks in
the following terms with regard to the end,1524 as he has also written: When the elder has
displayed his image,1525 the Omophorus then lets the earth go from him, and so the mighty
fire gets free, and consumes the whole world. Then, again, he lets the soil go with the new
æon,1526 in order that all the souls of sinners may be bound for ever. These things will take
place at the time when the man’s image1527 has come.1528 And all these powers put forth
by God,1529—namely, Jesus, who is in the smaller ship,1530 and the Mother of Life, and the
twelve helmsmen,1531 and the virgin of the light, and the third elder, who is in the greater
ship, and the living spirit, and the wall1532 of the mighty fire, and the wall of the wind, and
the air, and the water, and the interior living fire,—have their seat in the lesser luminary,
until the fire shall have consumed the whole world: and that is to happen within so many
years, the exact number of which, however, I have not ascertained. And after these things

<p>12. When Turbo had made this statement, Archelaus was intensely excited; but Marcellus
remained unmoved, for he expected that God would come to the help of His truth. Archelaus,
however, had additional cares in his anxiety about the people, like the shepherd who becomes
concerned for his sheep when secret perils threaten them from the wolves. Accordingly
Marcellus loaded Turbo with the most liberal gifts, and instructed him to remain in the
house of Archelaus the bishop.1537 But on that selfsame day Manes arrived, bringing along
with him certain chosen youths and virgins to the number of twenty-two.1538 And first of
all he sought for Turbo at the door of the house of Marcellus; and on failing to find him
there, he went in to salute Marcellus. On seeing him, Marcellus at first was struck with astonishment
at the costume in which he presented himself. For he wore a kind of shoe which
is usually called in common speech the quadrisole;1539 he had also a party-coloured cloak,
of a somewhat airy1540 appearance; in his hand he grasped a very sturdy staff of ebonywood;
1541 he carried a Babylonian book under his left arm; his legs were swathed in trousers
of different colours, the one being red, and the other green as a leek; and his whole mien
was like that of some old Persian master and commandant.1542 Thereupon Marcellus sent
forthwith for Archelaus, who arrived so quickly as almost to outstrip the word, and on entering
was greatly tempted at once to break out against him, being provoked to that instantly
by the very sight of his costume and his appearance, though more especially also by the fact
that he had himself been turning over in his mind in his retirement1543 the various matters
which he had learned from the recital of Turbo, and had thus come carefully prepared. But
Marcellus, in his great thoughtfulness, repressed all zeal for mere wrangling, and decided
to hear both parties. With that view he invited the leading men of the city; and from among
them he selected as judges of the discussion certain adherents of the Gentile religion, four

that the house of Marcellus, which was of immense size, was filled with those who
had been called to be hearers. And when the parties who proposed to speak in opposition
to each other had taken their places in view of all, then those who had been elected as judges

<p>13. My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus;
and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the
view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion,
so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered
himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archelaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which
are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of
his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about
the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus
is once set right,1549 it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected;
for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected
by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real
love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of
heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus,
and who was to come to “convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.”1550 And even as
Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that “he knew in part, and prophesied in
part,”1551 so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is
in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and
if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will
have you to consume you. For as Hymenæus and Alexander were “delivered unto Satan,
that they might learn not to blaspheme,”1552 so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince
of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare
Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all
iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet
water and bitter,—a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For
who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the
flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ,
who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, “A good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,”1553 and who in another place assures
us that the “father of the devil1554 is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,”1555 and

tells us again that men’s desire was for the darkness,1556 so that they would not follow that
Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,1557 and (once more shows
us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,1558 and the god and prince
of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the
truth in the Gospel of Christ?1559 Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are
his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much
time, I may defer1560 till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking
it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the
matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity
of these men’s teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God
and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our
ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by
him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less
to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their
minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too,
set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these
things properly pertain which he wished to transfer1561 to the Father of Christ, prepared as
he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain
credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive
nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed
to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since
his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things
ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but
not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption
of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed,
there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right,
that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with
and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,1562 which

also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.1563 It is a thing not
without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law
and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour
renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost
into utter destruction.1564 And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising
discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases
to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer
mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from
these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease
by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law
without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For “the
law and the prophets were until John;”1565 but since John the law of truth, the law of the
promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth,
as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus,
ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,
1566 in order that ye may keep1567 that law which has been destroyed and abandoned.
And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the
same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: “For if I build again the things which I destroyed,
I make myself a prevaricator.”1568 And in saying this he pronounces on them as
Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,1569 before the fulness of faith
came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.</p>

<p>14. The judges said: If you have any clearer statement yet to make, give us some explanation
of the nature1570 of your doctrine and the designation1571 of your faith. Manes replied:
I hold that there are two natures, one good and another evil; and that the one which is good
dwells indeed in certain parts proper to it, but that the evil one is this world, as well as all
things in it, which are placed there like objects imprisoned1572 in the portion of the wicked
one, as John says, that “the whole world lieth in wickedness,”1573 and not in God. Wherefore
we have maintained that there are two localities,—one good, and another which lies outside
of this,1574 so that, having space therein in his, it might be capable of receiving into itself
the creature, i.e., creation, of the world. For if we say that there is but a monarchy of one
nature, and that God fills all things, and that there is no location outside of Him, what will
be the sustainer of the creature, i.e., creation? where will be the Gehenna of fire? where the
outer darkness? where the weeping? Shall I say in Himself? God forbid; else He Himself will
also be made to suffer in and with these. Entertain no such fancies, whosoever of you have
any care for your salvation; for I shall give you an example, in order that you may have fuller
understanding of the truth. The world is one vessel;1575 and if1576 the substance of God has
already filled this entire vessel, how is it possible now that anything more can be placed in
this same vessel? If it is full, how shall it receive what is placed in it, unless a certain portion
of the vessel is emptied? Or whither shall that which is to be emptied out make its way,
seeing that there is no locality for it? Where then is the earth? where the heavens? where the
abyss? where the stars? where the settlements?1577 where the powers? where the princes?
where the outer darkness? Who is he that has laid the foundations of these, and where? No
one is able to tell us that without stumbling on blasphemy. And in what way, again, has He
been able to make the creatures, if there is no subsistent matter? For if He has made them
out of the non-existent, it will follow that these visible creatures should be superior, and full
of all virtues. But if in these there are wickedness, and death, and corruption, and whatever
is opposed to the good, how say we that they owe their formation to a nature different from
themselves? Howbeit if you consider the way in which the sons of men are begotten, you

will find that the creator of man is not the Lord, but another being, who is also himself of
an unbegotten1578 nature, who has neither founder, nor creator, nor maker, but who, such
as he is, has been produced by his own malice alone. In accordance with this, you men have
a commerce with your wives, which comes to you by an occasion of the following nature.
When any one of you has satiated himself with carnal meats, and meats of other kinds, then
the impulse of concupiscence rises in him, and in this way the enjoyment1579 of begetting
a son is increased; and this happens not as if that had its spring in any virtue, or in philosophy,
or in any other gift of mind, but in fulness of meats only, and in lust and fornication. And
how shall any one tell me that our father Adam was made after the image of God, and in
His likeness, and that he is like Him who made him? How can it be said that all of us who
have been begotten of him are like him? Yea, rather, on the contrary, have we not a great
variety of forms, and do we not bear the impress of different countenances? And how true
this is, I shall exhibit to you in parables. Look, for instance, at a person who wishes to seal
up a treasure, or some other object, and you will observe how, when he has got a little wax
or clay, he seeks to stamp it with an impression of his own countenance from the ring which
he wears;1580 but if another countenance also stamps the figure of itself on the object in a
similar manner, will the impression seem like? By no means, although you may be reluctant
to acknowledge what is true. But if we are not like in the common impression, and if, instead
of that, there are differences in us, how can it fail to be proved thereby that we are the
workmanship of the princes, and of matter? For in due accordance with their form, and
likeness, and image, we also exist as diverse forms. But if you wish to be fully instructed as
to that commerce which took place at the beginning, and as to the manner in which it occurred,
I shall explain the matter to you.</p>

commerce took place until we have first seen it proved that there are two natural principles.
For when once it is made clear that there are two unbegotten natures, then others of your
averments may also gain our assent, even although something in them may not seem to fit
in very readily with what is credible. For as the power of pronouncing judgment has been
committed to us, we shall declare what may make itself clear to our mind. We may, however,

full of madness rather than of prudence, who would stir up a controversy with me to-day
because I chance to speak of the adversary. But this objection of yours may be removed with

shall allow that there are these two natures.1582 You have come forward with a most extravagant1583
doctrine; for neither of the assertions made by you holds good. For it is quite
possible that one who is an adversary, not by nature, but by determination, may be made a
friend, and cease to be an adversary; and thus, when the one of us has come to acquiesce
with the other, we twain shall appear to be, as it were, one and the same object. This account
also indicates that rational creatures have been entrusted with free-will,1584 in virtue of
which they also admit of conversions. And consequently there cannot be two unbegotten
natures.1585 What do you say, then? Are these two natures inconvertible? or are they convertible?
or is one of them converted? Manes, however, held back, because he did not find
a suitable reply; for he was pondering the conclusion which might be drawn from either of
two answers which he might make, turning the matter over thus in his thoughts: If I say
that they are converted, he will meet me with that statement which is recorded in the Gospel
about the trees;1586 but if I say that they are not convertible, he will necessarily ask me to
explain the condition and cause of their intermingling. In the meantime, after a little delay,

Manes replied: They are indeed both inconvertible in so far as contraries are concerned; but
they are convertible as far as properties1587 are concerned. Archelaus then said: You seem
to me to be out of your mind, and oblivious of your own propositions; yea, you do not appear
even to recognise the powers or qualities of the very words which you have been learning.1588
For you do not understand either what conversion is, or what is meant by unbegotten, or
what duality implies, or what is past, or what is present, or what is future, as I have gathered
from the opinions to which you have just now given expression. For you have affirmed, indeed,
that each of these two natures is inconvertible so far as regards contraries, but convertible
so far as regards properties. But I maintain that one who moves in properties does not
pass out of himself, but subsists in these same properties, in which he is ever inconvertible;
while in the case of one who is susceptible of conversion, the effect is that he is placed outside
the pale of properties, and passes within the sphere of accidents.1589</p>

<p>16. The judges said: Convertibility translates the person whom it befalls into another;
as, for example, we might say that if a Jew were to make up his mind to become a Christian,
or, on the other hand, if a Christian were to decide to be a Gentile, this would be a species
of convertibility, and a cause of the same.1590 But, again, if we suppose a Gentile to keep by
all his own heathen properties, and to offer sacrifices to his gods, and to do service to the
temples as usual, surely you would not be of opinion that he could be said to be converted,
while he yet holds by his properties, and goes on in them? What, then, do you say? Do they
sustain convertibility or not? And as Manes hesitated, Archelaus proceeded thus: If, indeed,
he says that both natures are convertible,1591 what is there to prevent our thinking them to
be one and the same object? For if they are inconvertible, then surely in natures which are
similarly inconvertible and similarly unbegotten there is no distinction, neither can the one
of them be recognised as good or as evil. But if they are both convertible, then, forsooth, the
possible result may be both that the good is made evil, and that the evil is made good. If,
however, this is the possible result, why should we not speak of one only as unbegotten,1592
which would be a conception in worthier accordance with the reckoning of truth? For we
have to consider how that evil one became so at first, or against what objects he exercised
his wickedness before the formation of the world. When the heavens had not yet appeared,
when the earth did not yet subsist, and when there was neither man nor animal, against
whom did he put his wickedness in operation? whom did he oppress unjustly? whom did
he rob and kill? But if you say that he first appeared in his evil nature to his own kin,1593
then without doubt you give the proof that he comes of a good nature. And if, again, all
these are also evil, how can Satan then cast out Satan?1594 But while thus reduced to a dilemma
on this point, you may change your position in the discussion, and say that the good
suffered violence from the evil. But none the more is it without peril for you to make such
a statement, to the effect of affirming the vanquishing of the light; for what is vanquished
has destruction near it.1595 For what says the divine word? “Who can enter into a strong
man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he be stronger than he?”1596 But if you allege that

he first appeared in his evil nature to men, and only from that time showed openly the marks
of his wickedness, then it follows that before this time he was good, and that he took on this
quality of conversion because the creation of man1597 was found to have emerged as the
cause of his wickedness. But, in fine, let him tell us what he understands by evil, lest perchance
he may be defending or setting up a mere name. And if it is not the name but the substance
of evil that he speaks of, then let him set before us the fruits of this wickedness and iniquity,

<p>17. Manes said: Let it first be allowed on your side that there is an alien root of wickedness,
which God has not planted, and then I shall tell you its fruits. Archelaus said: Truth’s
reckoning does not make any such requirement; and I shall not admit to you that there is
a root of any such evil tree, of the fruit whereof no one has ever tasted. But just as, when a
man desires to make any purchase, he does not produce the money unless he first ascertains
by tasting the object whether it is of a dry or a moist species, so I shall not admit to you that
the tree is evil and utterly corrupt, unless the quality of its fruit is first exhibited; for it is
written, that “the tree is known by its fruits.”1598 Tell us, therefore, O Manes, what fruit is
yielded by that tree which is called evil, or of what nature it is, and what virtue it is, that we
may also believe with you that the root of that same tree is of that character which you
ascribe to it. Manes said: The root indeed is evil, and the tree is most corrupt, but the increase
is not from God. Moreover, fornications, adulteries, murders, avarice, and all evil deeds,
are the fruits of that evil root. Archelaus said: That we may credit you when you say that
these are the fruits of that evil root, give us a taste of these things; for you have pronounced
the substance of this tree to be ungenerate,1599 the fruits of which are produced after its
own likeness. Manes said: The very unrighteousness which subsists in men offers the proof
itself, and in avarice too you may taste that evil root. Archelaus said: Well, then, as you have
stated the question, those iniquities which prevail among men are fruits of this tree. Manes
said: Quite so. Archelaus proceeded: If these, then, are the fruits, that is to say, the wicked
deeds of men, it will follow that the men themselves will hold the place of the root and of
the tree; for you have declared that they produce fruits of this nature. Manes said: That is
my statement. Archelaus answered: Not well say you, That is my statement: for surely that
cannot be your statement; otherwise, when men cease from sinning, this tree of wickedness
will appear to be unfruitful. Manes said: What you say is an impossibility; for even though
one or another, or several, were to cease sinning, there would yet be others doing evil still.
Archelaus said: If it is at all possible for one or another, or several, as you admit, not to sin,
it is also possible for all to do the same; for they are all of one parent, and are all men of one
lump. And, not to follow at my ease those affirmations which you have so confusedly made
through all their absurdities, I shall conclude their refutation by certain unmistakeable
counter-arguments. Do you allege that the fruits of the evil root and the evil tree are the
deeds of men, that is to say, fornications, adulteries, perjuries, murders, and other similar
things? Manes said: I do. Archelaus said: Well, then, if it happened that the race of men was
to die off the face of the earth, so that they should not be able to sin any more, the substance
of that tree would then perish, and it would bear fruit no more. Manes said: And when will

that take place of which you speak? Archelaus said: What1600 is in the future I know not,
for I am but a man; nevertheless I shall not leave these words of yours unexamined. What
say you of the race of men? Is it unbegotten, or is it a production? Manes said: It is a production.
Archelaus said: If man is a production, who is the parent of adultery and fornication,
and such other things? Whose fruit is this? Before man was made, who was there to be a
fornicator, or an adulterer, or a murderer? Manes said: But if the man is fashioned of the
evil nature, it is manifest that he is such a fruit,1601 albeit he may sin, albeit he may not sin;
whence also the name and race of men are once for all and absolutely of this character,
whether they may do what is righteous or what is unrighteous. Archelaus said: Well, we may
also take notice of that matter. If, as you aver, the wicked one himself made man, why is it
that he practises his malignity on him?</p>

<p>18. The judges said: We desire to have information from you on this point, Manichæus,
to wit, to what effect you have affirmed him to be evil. Do you mean that he has been so
from the time when men were made, or before that period? For it is necessary that you
should give some proof of his wickedness from the very time from which you declare him
to have been evil. Be assured1602 that the quality of a wine cannot be ascertained unless one
first tastes it; and understand that, in like manner, every tree is known by its fruit. What say
you, then? From what time has this personality been evil? For an explanation of this problem
seems to us to be necessary. Manes said: He has always been so. Archelaus said: Well, then,
I shall also show from this, most excellent friends, and most judicious auditors, that his
statement is by no means correct. For iron, to take an example, has not been an evil thing
always, but only from the period of man’s existence, and since his art turned it to evil by
applying it to false uses; and every sin has come into existence since the period of man’s
being. Even that great serpent himself was not evil previous to man, but only after man, in
whom he displayed the fruit of his wickedness, because he willed it himself. If, then, the
father of wickedness makes his appearance to us after man has come into being, according
to the Scriptures, how can he be unbegotten who has thus been constituted evil subsequently
to man, who is himself a production? But, again, why should he exhibit himself as evil just
from the period when, on your supposition, he did himself create man?1603 What did he
desire in him? If man’s whole body was his own workmanship, what did he ardently affect
in him? For one who ardently affects or desires, desires something which is different and
better. If, indeed, man takes his origin from him in respect of the evil nature, we see how
man was his own, as I have frequently shown.1604 For if man was his own, he was also evil
himself, just as it holds with our illustration of the like tree and the like fruit; for an evil tree,
as you say, produces evil fruit. And seeing that all were evil, what did he desiderate, or in
what could he show the beginning of his wickedness, if from the time of man’s formation
man was the cause of his wickedness? Moreover, the law and precept having been given to
the man himself, the man had not by any means the power to yield obedience to the serpent,
and to the statements which were made by him; and had the man then yielded no obedience
to him, what occasion would there have been for him to be evil? But, again, if evil is unbe-

gotten, how does it happen that man is sometimes found to be stronger than it? For, by
obeying the law of God, he will often overcome every root of wickedness; and it would be
a ridiculous thing if he, who is but the production, should be found to be stronger than the
unbegotten. Moreover, whose is that law with its commandment—that commandment, I
mean, which has been given to man? Without doubt it will be acknowledged to be God’s.
And how, then, can the law be given to an alien? or who can give his commandment to an
enemy? Or, to speak of him who receives the commandment, how can he contend against
the devil? that is to say, on this supposition, how can he contend against his own creator,
as if the son, while he is a debtor to him for deeds of kindness, were to choose to inflict injuries
on the father? Thus you but mark out the profitlessness1605 of man on this side, if
you suppose him to be contradicting by the law and commandment him who has made
him, and to be making the effort to get the better of him. Yea, we shall have to fancy the
devil himself to have gone to such an excess of folly, as not to have perceived that in making
man he made an adversary for himself, and neither to have considered what might be his
future, nor to have foreseen the actual consequence of his act; whereas even in ourselves.
who are but productions, there are at least some small gifts of knowledge, and a measure of
prudence, and a moderate degree of consideration, which is sometimes of a very trustworthy
nature. And how, then, can we believe that in the unbegotten there is not some little portion
of prudence, or consideration, or intelligence? Or how can we make the contrary supposition,
according to your assertion, namely, that he is discovered to be of the most senseless apprehension,
and the dullest heart and in short rather like the brutes in his natural constitution?
But if the case stands thus, again, how is it that man, who is possessed of no insignificant
power in mental capacity and knowledge, could have received his substance from one who
thus is, of all beings, the most ignorant and the bluntest in apprehension? How shall any
one be rash enough to profess that man is the workmanship of an author of this character?
But, again, if man consists both of soul and of body, and not merely of body without soul,
and if the one cannot subsist apart from the other, why will you assert that these two are
antagonistic and contrary to each other? For our Lord Jesus Christ, indeed, seems to me to
have spoken of these in His parables, when He said: “No man can put new wine into old
bottles, else the bottles will break, and the wine run out.”1606 But new wine is to be put into
new bottles, as there is indeed one and the same Lord for the bottle and for the wine. For
although the substance may be different, yet by these two substances, in their due powers,
and in the maintenance of their proper mutual relations,1607 the one person of man subsists.

We do not say, indeed, that the soul is of one substance with the body, but we aver that they
have each their own characteristic qualities; and as the bottle and the wine are applied in
the similitude to one race and one species of men, so truth’s reckoning requires us to grant
that man was produced complete by the one God: for the soul rejoices in the body, and loves
and cherishes it; and none the less does the body rejoice that it is quickened by the soul. But
if, on the other hand, a person maintains that the body is the work of the wicked one, inasmuch
as it is so corruptible, and antiquated, and worthless, it would follow then that it is
incapable of sustaining the virtue of the spirit or the movement of the soul, and the most
splendid creation of the same. For just as, when a person puts a piece of new cloth into an
old garment, the rent is made worse;1608 so also the body would perish if it were to be associated,
under such conditions, with that most brilliant production the soul. Or, to use another
illustration: just as, when a man carries the light of a lamp into a dark place the darkness is
forthwith put to flight and makes no appearance; so we ought to understand that, on the
soul’s introduction into the body the darkness is straightway banished, and one nature at
once effected, and one man constituted in one species. And thus, agreeably therewith, it will
be allowed that the new wine is put into new bottles, and that the piece of new cloth is not
put into the old garment. But from this we are able to show that there is a unison of powers
in these two substances, that is to say, in that of the body and in that of the soul; of which
unison that greatest teacher in the Scriptures, Paul, speaks, when he tells us, that “God hath
set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased Him.”1609</p>

<p>19. But if it seems difficult for you to understand this, and if you do not acquiesce in
these statements, I may at all events try to make them good by adducing illustrations. Contemplate
man as a kind of temple, according to the similitude of Scripture:1610 the spirit
that is in man may thus be likened to the image that dwells in the temple. Well, then, a
temple cannot be constituted unless first an occupant is acknowledged for the temple; and,
on the other hand, an occupant cannot be settled in the temple unless the structure has been
erected. Now, since these two objects, the occupant and the structure, are both consecrated
together, how can any antagonism or contrariety be found between them, and how should
it not rather appear that they have both been the products of subjects that are in amity and
of one mind? And that you may know that this is the case, and that these subjects are truly
at one both in fellowship and in lineage, He who knows and hears1611 all has made this response,
“Let us make man,” and so forth. For he who constructs1612 the temple interrogates
him who fashions the image, and inquires carefully about the measurements of magnitude,
and breadth, and bulk, in order that he may mark off the space for the foundations in accordance
with these dimensions; and no one sets about the vain task of building a temple
without first making himself acquainted with the measurement needed for the placing of
the image. In like manner, therefore, the mode and the measure of the body are made the
subject of inquiry, in order that the soul may be appropriately lodged in it by God, the Artificer
of all things. But if any one say that he who has moulded the body is an enemy to the
God who is the Creator of my soul,1613 then how is it that, while regarding each other with
a hostile eye, these two parties have not brought disrepute upon the work, by bringing it
about either that he who constructs the temple should make it of such narrow dimensions
as to render it incapable of accommodating what is placed within it, or that he who fashions
the image should come with something so massive and ponderous, that, on its introduction
into the temple, the edifice would at once collapse? If such is not the case, then, with these
things, let us contemplate them in the light of what we know to be the objects and intents
of antagonists. But if it is right for all to be disposed with the same measures and the same
equity, and to be displayed with like glory, what doubt should we still entertain on this
subject? We add, if it please you, this one illustration more. Man appears to resemble a ship
which has been constructed by the builder and launched into the deep, which, however, it

is impossible to navigate without the rudder, by which it can be kept under command, and
turned in whatsoever direction its steersman may wish to sail. Also, that the rudder and the
whole body of the ship require the same artificer, is a matter admitting no doubt; for without
the rudder the whole structure of the ship, that huge body, will be an inert mass. And thus,
then, we say that the soul is the rudder of the body; that both these, moreover, are ruled by
that liberty of judgment and sentiment which we possess, and which corresponds to the
steersman; and that when these two are made one by union,1614 and thus possess a unison
of function applicable to all kinds of work, whatever may be the products of their own operation,
they bear a testimony to the fact that they have both one and the same author and
maker.</p>

<p>20. On hearing these argumentations, the multitudes who were present were exceedingly
delighted; so much so, indeed, that they were almost laying hands on Manes; and it was
with difficulty that Archelaus restrained them, and kept them back, and made them quiet
again. The judges said: Archelaus has given us proof sufficient of the fact that the body and
soul of man are the works of one hand; because an object cannot subsist in any proper
consonance and unison as the work of one hand, if there is any want of harmony in the
design and plan. But if it is alleged that one could not possibly have sufficed to develop both
these objects, namely, body and soul, this is simply to exhibit the incapacity of the artificer.
For thus, even though one should grant that the soul is the creation of a good deity, it will
be found to be but an idle work so far as the man is concerned, unless it also takes to itself
the body. And if, again, the body is held to be the formation of an evil deity, the work will
also none the less be idle unless it receives the soul; and, in truth, unless the soul be in unison
with the body by commixture and due introduction, so that the two are in mutual connections,
the man will not exist, neither can we speak of him. Hence we are of opinion that
Archelaus has proved by a variety of illustrations that there is but one and the same maker
for the whole man. Archelaus said: I doubt not, Manes, that you understand this, namely,
that one who is born and created1615 is called the son of him who begets or creates. But if
the wicked one made man, then he ought to be his father, according to nature. And to whom,
then, did the Lord Jesus address Himself, when in these terms He taught men to pray: “When
ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven;”1616 and again, “Pray to your Father which is
in secret?”1617 But it was of Satan that He spoke when He said, that He “beheld him as
lightning fall from heaven;”1618 so that no one dare say that He taught us to pray to him.
And surely Jesus did not come down from heaven with the purpose of bringing men together,
and reconciling them to Satan; but, on the contrary, He gave him over to be bruised beneath
the feet of His faithful ones. However, for my part, I would say that those Gentiles are the
more blessed who do indeed bring in a multitude of deities, but at least hold them all to be
of one mind, and in amity with each other; whereas this man, though he brings in but two
gods, does not blush to posit enmities and discordant sentiments between them. And, in
sooth, if these Gentiles were to bring in1619 their counterfeit deities under conditions of that
kind, we would verily have it in our power to witness something like a gladiatorial contest
proceeding between them, with their innumerable natures and diverse sentiments.</p>

man, may be expressed in the words of the Saviour to those who swallow a camel, and wear
the outward garb of the hypocrite, begirt with blandishments and flatteries. It is to them
that Jesus addresses Himself when He says: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of uncleanness.
Or know you not, that He that made that which is without, made that which is within
also?”1620 Now why did He speak of the cup and of the platter? Was He who uttered these
words a glassworker, or a potter who made vessels of clay? Did He not speak most manifestly
of the body and the soul? For the Pharisees truly looked to the “tithing of anise and cummin,
and left undone the weightier matters of the law;”1621 and while devoting great care to the
things which were external, they overlooked those which bore upon the salvation of the
soul. For they also had respect to “greetings in the market-place,”1622 and “to the uppermost
seats at feasts:”1623 and to them the Lord Jesus, knowing their perdition, made this declaration,
that they attended to those things only which were without, and despised as strange
things those which were within, and understood not that He who made the body made also
the soul. And who is so unimpressible and stolid in intellect, as not to see that those sayings
of our Lord may suffice him for all cases? Moreover, it is in perfect harmony with these
sayings that Paul speaks, when he interprets to the following intent certain things written
in the law: “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth
God take care for oxen? Or saith He it altogether for our sakes?”1624 But why should we
waste further time upon this subject? Nevertheless I shall add a few things out of many that
might be offered. Suppose now that there are two unbegotten principles, and that we determine
fixed localities for these: it follows then that God is separated,1625 if He is supposed to
be within a certain location, and not diffused everywhere; and He will consequently be represented
as much inferior to the locality in which He is understood to be for the object which
contains is always greater1626than the object which is contained in it: and thus God is made
to be of that magnitude which corresponds with the magnitude of the locality in which He
is contained, just as is the case with a man in a house.1627 Then, further, reason asks who it

Lysimachus and Alexander held the empire of the whole world, and were able to subdue all
foreign nations, and the whole race of men; so that throughout that period there was no
other in possession of empire besides themselves under heaven. And how will any one be
rash enough to say that God, who is the true light that never suffers eclipse, and whose is
also the kingdom that is holy and everlasting, is not everywhere present, as1629 is the way
with this most depraved man, who, in his impiety, refuses to ascribe to the Omnipotent God

<p>22. The judges said: We know that a light shines through the whole house, and not in
some single part of it; as Jesus also intimates when He says, that “no man lighting a candle
puts it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light unto all that are in the
house.”1631 If, then, God is a light, it must needs be that light (if Jesus is to be credited) shall
shine on the whole world, and not on any portions of it merely. And if,1632 then, that light
holds possession of the whole world, where now can there be any ungenerated darkness?
or how can darkness be understood to exist at all, unless it is something simply accidental?
Archelaus said: Forasmuch, indeed, as the word of the Gospel is understood much better
by you than by this person who puts himself forward as the Paraclete, although I could call
him rather parasite than paraclete, I shall tell you how it has happened that there is darkness.
When the light had been diffused everywhere, God began to constitute the universe, and
commenced with the heaven and the earth; in which process this issue appeared, to wit, that
the midst,1633 which is the locality of earth covered with shadow, as a consequence of the
interposition1634 of the creatures which were called into being, was found to be obscure, in
such wise that circumstances required light to be introduced into that place, which was thus
situated in the midst. Hence in Genesis, where Moses gives an account of the construction
of the world, he makes no mention of the darkness either as made or as not made. But he
keeps silence on that subject, and leaves the explanation of it to be discovered by those who
may be able to give proper attention to it. Neither, indeed, is that a very arduous and difficult
task. For to whom may it not be made plain that this sun of ours is visible, when it has risen
in the east, and taken its course toward the west, but that when it has gone beneath the earth,
and been carried farther within that formation which among the Greeks is called the sphere,
it then ceases to appear, being overshadowed in darkness in consequence of the interposition
of the bodies?1635 When it is thus covered, and when the body of the earth stands opposite
it, a shadow is superinduced, which produces from itself the darkness; and it continues so
until again, after the course of the inferior space has been traversed in the night, it rolls towards
the east, and is seen to rise once more in its wonted seats. Thus, then, the cause of
the shadow and the night is discovered in the solidity of the body of the earth,—a thing,

effectus fuerit ea quæ apud Græcos sphæra vocatur, quod tunc objectu corporum obumbratus non appareat?”
The Codex Casinensis reads quod nunc oblectu, etc. We should add that it was held by Anaximander and others
that there was a species of globe or sphere (σφαῖρα) which surrounded the universe. [Vol. ii. p. 136. n. 2.]</note>

<pb n="467"/>
indeed, which a man may understand from the fact of the shadow cast by his own body.1636
For before the heaven and the earth and all those corporeal creatures appeared, the light
remained always constant, without waning or eclipse, as there existed no body which might
produce shadow by its opposition or intervention; and consequently one must say that
nowhere was there darkness then, and nowhere night. For if, to take an illustration, it should
please Him who has the power of all things to do away with the quarter1637 which lies to
the west, then, as the sun would not direct its course toward that region, there would nowhere
emerge either evening or darkness, but the sun would be on its course always, and would
never set, but would almost always hold the centre tract of heaven, and would never cease
to appear; and by this the whole world would be illumined with the clearest light, in virtue
of which no part of it would suffer obscuration, but the equal power of one light would remain
everywhere. But on the other hand, while the western quarter keeps its position, and the
sun executes1638 its course in three parts of the world, then those who are under the sun
will be seen to be illuminated more brightly; so that I might almost say, that while the people
who belong to the diverse tract are still asleep, those former are in possession of the day’s
beginning. But just1639 as those Orientals have the light rising on them earlier than the
people who live in the west, so they have it also more quickly obscured, and they only who
are settled in the middle of the globe see always an equality of light. For when the sun occupies
the middle of the heavens, there is no place that can appear to be either brighter or darker
(than another), but all parts of the world are illuminated equally and impartially by the sun’s
effulgence.1640 If, then, as we have said above, that portion of the western tract were done
away with, the part which is adjacent to it would now no more suffer obscuration. And these
things I could indeed set forth somewhat more simply, as I might also describe the zodiacal
circle; but I have not thought of looking into these matters at present.1641 I shall therefore
say nothing of these, but shall revert to that capital objection urged by my adversary, in his
affirming so strenuously1642 that the darkness is ungenerated; which position, however, has
also been confuted already, as far as that could have been done by us.</p>

<p>23. The judges said: If we consider that the light existed before the estate of the creatures
was introduced, and that there was no object in an opposite position which might generate
shadow, it must follow that the light was then diffused everywhere, and that all places were
illuminated with its effulgence, as has been shown by what you have stated just now; and
as we perceive that the true explanation is given in that, we assign the palm to the affirmations
of Archelaus. For if the universe is clearly divided, as if some wall had been drawn through
the centre of it, and if on the one side the light dwells, and on the other side the darkness,
it is yet to be understood that this darkness has been brought accidentally about through
the shadow generated in consequence of the objects which have been set up in the world;
and hence again we must ask who it is that has built this wall between the two divisions,
provided you indeed admit the existence of such a construction, O Manichæus. But if we
have to take account of this matter on the supposition that no such wall has been built, then
again it comes to be understood that the universe forms but one locality, without any exception,
and is placed under one power; and if so, then the darkness can in no way have an
ungenerated nature. Archelaus said: Let him also explain the following subject with a view
to what has been propounded. If God is seated in His kingdom, and if the wicked one in
like manner is seated in his kingdom, who can have constructed the wall between them?
For no object can divide two substances except one that is greater than either,1643 even as
it is said1644 in the book of Genesis, that “God divided the light from the darkness.”1645
Consequently the constructor of this wall must also be some one of a capacity like that: for
the wall marks the boundaries of these two parties, just as among people who dwell in the
rural parts a stone is usually taken to mark off the portion of each several party; which custom,
however, would afford a better apprehension of the case were we to take the division to refer
specially to the marking out of an inheritance falling to brothers. But for the present I have
not to speak of matters like these, however essential they may appear. For what we are in
quest of is an answer to the question, Who can have constructed the wall required for the
designation of the limits of the kingdom of each of these twain? No answer has been given.
Let not this perfidious fellow hesitate, but let him now acknowledge that the substance of
his duality has been reduced again to a unity. Let him mention any one who can have constructed
that middle wall. What could the one of these two parties have been engaged in
when the other was building? Was he asleep? or was he ignorant of the fact? or was he unable
to withstand the attempt? or was he bought over with a price? Tell us what he was about,
or tell us who in all the universe was the person that raised the construction. I address my
appeal to you, O judges, whom God has sent to us with the fullest plenitude of intelligence;

<p>24. The judges said: Tell us, O Manes, who designated the boundaries for the kingdom
of each, and who made the middle wall? For Archelaus begs that due importance be attached
to the practice of interrogation in this discussion. Manes said: The God who is good, and
who has nothing in common with evil, placed the firmament in the midst, in order to make
it plain1646 that the wicked one is an alien to Him. Archelaus said: How fearfully you belie
the dignity of that name! You do indeed call Him God, but you do so in name only, and
you make His deity resemble man’s infirmities. At one time out of the non-existent, and at
another time out of underlying matter, which indeed thus existed before Himself, you assert
that He did build the structure, as builders among men are wont to do. Sometimes also you
speak of Him as apprehensive, and sometimes as variable. It is, however, the part of God to
do what is proper to God, and it is the part of man to do what is proper to man. If, then,
God, as you say, has constructed a wall, this is a God who marks Himself out as apprehensive,
and as possessed of no fortitude. For we know that it is always the case that those who are
suspicious of the preparation of secret perils against them by strangers, and who are afraid
of the plots of enemies, are accustomed to surround their cities with walls, by which procedure
they at once secure themselves in their ignorance, and display their feeble capacity. But
here, too, we have something which ought not to be passed over by us in silence, but rather
brought prominently forward; so that even by the great abundance of our declarations on
the subject our adversary’s manifold craftiness may be brought to nought, with the help of
the truth on our side. We may grant, then, that the structure of the wall has been made with
the purpose of serving to distinguish between the two kingdoms; for without this one division1647
it is impossible for either of them to have his own proper kingdom. But granting
this, then it follows further that in the same manner it will also be impossible for the wicked
one to pass without his own proper limits and invade the territories of the good King, inasmuch
as the wall stands there as an obstacle, unless it should chance first to be cast down,
for we have heard that such things have been done by enemies, and indeed with our own
eyes we have quite recently seen an achievement of that nature successfully carried out.1648
And when a king attacks a citadel surrounded by a strong wall, he uses first of all the ballista1649
and projectiles; then he endeavours to cut through the gates with axes, and to demolish
the walls by the battering-rams; and when he at last obtains an entrance, and gains

possession of the place, he does whatever he listeth, whether it be his pleasure to carry off
the citizens into captivity, or to make a complete destruction of the fortress and its contents,
or whether, on the other hand, it may be his will to grant indulgence to the captured
stronghold on the humble suit of the conquered. What, then, does my opponent here say
to this analogy? Did no adversary substantially—which is as much as to say, designedly—overthrow
the muniment cast up between the two?1650 For in his former statements he has
avouched that the darkness passed without its own limits, and supervened upon the kingdom
of the good God. Who, then, overthrew that munition before the one could thus have crossed
over to the other? For it was impossible for the evil one to find any entrance while the munition
stood fast. Why are you silent? Why do you hesitate, Manichæus? Yet, although you
may hold back, I shall proceed with the task of my own accord. For if we suppose you to
say that God destroyed it, then I have to ask what moved Him in this way to demolish the
very thing which He had Himself previously constructed on account of the importunity of
the wicked one, and for the purpose of preserving the separation between them? In what fit
of passion, or under what sense of injury, did He thus set about contending against Himself?
Or was it that He lusted after some of the possessions of the wicked one? But if none of these
things formed the real cause that led God to destroy those very things which He had constructed
a long time before with the view of estranging and separating the wicked one from
Him, then it must needs be considered no matter of surprise if God should also have become
delighted with his society;1651 for, on your supposition, the munition which had been set
up with the purpose of securing God against trouble from him, will appear to have been
removed just because now he is to be regarded no more as an enemy, but as a friend. And,
on the other hand, if you aver that the wall was destroyed by the wicked one, tell us then
how it can be possible for the works of the good God to be mastered by the wicked one. For
if that is possible, then the evil nature will be proved to be stronger than God. Furthermore,
how can that being, seeing that he is pure and total darkness, surprise the light and apprehend
it, while the evangelist gives us the testimony that “the light shineth in darkness, and the
darkness comprehended it not?”1652 How is this blind one armed? How does the darkness
fight against the kingdom of light? For even as the creatures of God1653 here cannot take in

<p>25. Manes said: Not all receive the word of God, but only those to whom it is given to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.1655 And even now1656 I know who are ours;
for “my sheep,” He says, “hear my voice.”1657 For the sake of those who belong to us, and
to whom is given the understanding of the truth, I shall speak in similitudes. The wicked
one is like a lion that sought to steal upon the flock of the good shepherd; and when the
shepherd saw this, he dug a huge pit, and took one kid out of the flock and cast it into the
pit. Then the lion, hungering to get at it, and bursting with passion to devour it, ran up to
the pit and fell in, and discovered no strength sufficient to bring him out again. And
thereupon the shepherd seized him and shut him up carefully in a den, and at the same time
secured the safety of the kid which had been with him in the pit. And it is in this way that
the wicked one has been enfeebled,—the lion, so to speak, possessing no more capacity for
doing aught injurious; and so all the race of souls will be saved, and what once perished will
yet be restored to its proper flock. Archelaus said: If you compare the wicked one to the lion,
and God to the true shepherd, tell us, whereunto shall we liken the sheep and the kid? Manes
said: The sheep and the kid seem to me to be of one nature: and they are taken as figures of
souls. Archelaus said: Well, then, God gave a soul over to perdition when He set it before
the lion in the pit. Manes said: By no means; far from it. But He was moved by a particular
disposition,1658 and in the future He will save that other, the soul. Archelaus said: Now,
surely it would be an absurd procedure, my hearers, if a shepherd who dreaded the inroad
of a lion were to expose to the beast’s devouring fury a lamb that he was wont to carry in
his bosom, and if it were then to be said that he meant to save the creature hereafter. Is not
this something supremely ridiculous? Yea, there is no kind of sense in this. For on the supposition
implied in your similitude God thus handed over to Satan a soul that he might seize
and ruin. But when did the shepherd ever do anything like that?1659 Did not David deliver
a sheep out of the mouth of a lion or of a bear? And we mention this on account of the expression,
out of the mouth of the lion; for, on your theory, this would imply that the shepherd
can bring forth out of the mouth of the lion, or out of the belly of the same, the very object
which it has devoured.1660 But you will perhaps make this answer, that it is of God we speak,

and that He is able to do all things. Hear, however, what I have to say to that: Why then do
you not rather assert His real capacity, and affirm simply His ability to overcome the lion
in His own might, or with the pure power of God, and without the help of any sort of cunning
devices, or by consigning a kid or a lamb to a pit?1661 Tell me this, too, if the lion were to
be supposed to come upon the shepherd at a time when he has no sheep, what would the
consequence be? For he who is here called the shepherd is supposed to be unbegotten, and
he who is here the lion is also unbegotten. Wherefore, when man did not yet exist—in other
words, before the shepherd had a flock—if the lion had then come upon the shepherd, what
would have followed, seeing that there could have been nothing for the lion to eat before
the kid was in existence? Manes said: The lion certainly had nothing to devour, but yet he
exercised his wickedness on whatever he was able to light upon as he coursed over the peaks
of the mountains; and if at any time food was a matter of necessity with him, he seized some
of the beasts which were under his own kingdom. Archelaus said: Are these two objects,
then, of one substance—the beasts which are under the kingdom of the wicked one, and the
kids which are in the kingdom of the good God?1662 Manes said: Far from it; not at all: they
have nothing in common either between themselves or between the properties which pertain
to them severally. Archelaus said: There is but one and the same use made of the food in
the lion’s eating. And though he sometimes got that food from the beasts belonging to
himself, and sometimes from those belonging to the good God, there is still no difference
between them as far as regards the meats furnished; and from this it is apparent that those
are of but one substance. On the other hand, if we say that there is a great difference between
the two, we do but ascribe ignorance to the shepherd,1663 in so far as he did not present or
set before the lion food adapted to his use, but rather alien meats. Or perchance again, in
your desire to dissemble your real position, you will say to me that lion ate nothing. Well,
supposing that to be the case, did God then in this way challenge that being to devour a soul
while he knew not how to devour aught? and was the pit not the only thing which God
sought to employ with the view of cheating him?—if indeed it is at all worthy of God to do
that sort of thing, or to contrive deceitful schemes. And that would be to act like a king who,
when war is made upon him, puts no kind of confidence in his own strength, but gets
paralyzed with the fears of his own feebleness, and shuts himself up within the walls of his
city, and erects around him a rampart and other fortifications, and gets them all equipped,
<note type="footnote">1661 This seems to be the sense intended. The text in the Codex Casinensis runs thus: “Cur igitur quod possit

and trusts nothing to his own hand and prowess; whereas, if he is a brave man, the king so
placed will march a great distance from his own territories to meet the enemy there, and
will put forth every possible exertion until he conquers and brings his adversary into his
power.</p>

<p>26. The judges said: If you allege that the shepherd exposed the kid or the lamb to the
lion, when the said lion was meditating an assault1664 on the unbegotten, the case is closed.
For seeing that the shepherd of the kids and lambs is himself proved to be in fault to them,
on what creature can he pronounce judgment, if it happens that the lamb which has been
given up1665 through the shepherd’s weakness has proved unable to withstand the lion, and
if the consequence is that the lamb has had to do whatever has been the lion’s pleasure? Or,
to take another instance, that would be just as if a master were to drive out of his house, or
deliver over in terror to his adversary, one of his slaves, whom he is unable afterwards to
recover by his own strength. Or supposing that by any chance it were to come about that
the slave was recovered, on what reasonable ground could the master inflict the torture on
him, if it should turn out that the man yielded obedience to all that the enemy laid upon
him, seeing that it was the master himself1666 who gave him up to the enemy, just as the kid
was given up to the lion? You affirm, too, that the shepherd understood the whole case beforehand.
Surely, then, the lamb, when under the lash, and interrogated by the shepherd as
to the reason why it had submitted to the lion in these matters, would make some such answer
as this: “Thou didst thyself deliver me over to the lion, and thou didst offer no resistance to
him, although thou didst know and foresee what would be my lot, when it was necessary
for me to yield myself to his commandments.” And, not to dilate on this at greater length,
we may say that by such an illustration neither is God exhibited as a perfect shepherd, nor
is the lion shown to have tasted alien meats; and consequently, under the instruction of the
truth itself, it has been made clear that we ought to give the palm to the reasonings adduced
by Archelaus. Archelaus said: Considering that, on all the points which we have hitherto
discussed, the thoughtfulness of the judges has assigned us the amplest scope, it will be well
for us to pass over other subjects in silence, and reserve them for another period. For just
as, if1667 a person once crushes the head of a serpent, he will not need to lop off any of the
other members of its body; so, if we once dispose1668 of this question of the duality, as we
have endeavoured to do to the best of our ability, other matters which have been maintained
in connection with it may be held to be exploded along with it. Nevertheless I shall yet address
myself, at least in a few sentences, to the assertor of these opinions himself, who is now in
our presence; so that it may be thoroughly understood by all who he is, and whence he

comes, and what manner of person he proves himself to be. For he has given out that he is
that Paraclete whom Jesus on His departure promised to send to the race of man for the
salvation of the souls of the faithful; and this profession he makes as if he were somewhat
superior even to Paul,1669 who was an elect vessel and a called apostle, and who on that
ground, while preaching the true doctrine, said:1670 “Or seek ye a proof of that Christ who
speaks in me?”1671 What I have to say, however, may become clearer by such an illustration
as the following:1672—A certain man gathered into his store a very large quantity of corn,
so that the place was perfectly full. This place he shut and sealed in a thoroughly satisfactory
fashion, and gave directions to keep careful watch over it. And the master himself then departed.
However, after a lengthened lapse of time another person came to the store, and affirmed
that he had been despatched by the individual who had locked up and sealed the
place with a commission also to collect and lay up a quantity of wheat in the same. And
when the keepers of the store saw him, they demanded of him his credentials, in the production
of the signet, in order that they might assure themselves of their liberty to open the
store to him and to render their obedience to him as to one sent by the person who had
sealed the place. And when he could1673 neither exhibit the keys nor produce the credentials
of the signet, for indeed he had no right, he was thrust out by the keepers, and compelled to
flee. For instead of being what he professed to be, he was detected to be a thief and a robber
by them, and was convicted and found out1674 through the circumstance that, although, as
it seemed, he had taken it into his head to make his appearance a long time after the period
that had been determined on beforehand, he yet could neither produce keys, or signet, or
any token whatsoever to the keepers, nor display any knowledge of the quantity of corn that

that another idea of the passage is thrown out in Routh. According to this the ei refers to Jesus, and the text being
emended thus, etsi non longe post sit ei, the sense would be: although not long after His departure He had Paul
as an elect vessel, etc. The allusion thus would be to the circumstance that Manes made such a claim as he did,
in spite of the fact that after Christ’s departure Paul was gifted with the Spirit in so eminent a measure for the
building up of the faithful.</note>

<p>27. We may give yet another illustration, if it seems good to you. A certain man, the
head of a household, and possessed of great riches, was minded to journey abroad for a
time, and promised to his sons that he would send them some one who would take his place,
and divide among them equally the substance falling to them. And, in truth, not long after
that, he did despatch to them a certain trustworthy and righteous and true man. And on
his arrival, this man took charge of the whole substance, and first of all exerted himself to
arrange it and administer it, giving himself great labour in journeying, and even1676 working
diligently with his own hands, and toiling like a servant for the good of the estate. Afterwards
feeling that his end was at hand,1677 the man wrote out a will, demitting the inheritance to
the relations and all the next of kin; and he gave them his seals, and called them together
one by one by name, and charged them to preserve the inheritance, and to take care of the
substance, and to administer it rightly, even as they had received it, and to take their use of
its goods and fruits, as they were themselves left its owners and heirs. If, moreover, any
person were to ask to be allowed to benefit by the fruits of this field, they were to show
themselves indulgent to such. But if, on the other hand, any one were to declare himself
partner in the heirship with them, and were to make his demands on that ground,1678 they
were to keep aloof from him, and pronounce him an alien; and further, they were to hold
that the individual who desired to be received among them ought all the more on that account
to do work.1679 Well, then, granting that all these things have been well and rightly disposed
of and settled, and that they have continued in that condition for a very long time, how shall
we deal with one who presents himself well-nigh three hundred years after, and sets up his
claim to the heirship? Shall we not cast him off from us? Shall we not justly pronounce such
a one an alien—one who cannot prove himself to have belonged to those related to our
Master, who never was with our departed Lord in the hour of His sickness, who never walked
in the funeral procession of the Crucified, who never stood by the sepulchre, who has no
knowledge whatsoever of the manner or the character of His departure, and who, in fine,
is now desirous of getting access to the storehouse of corn without presenting any token
from him who placed it under lock and seal? Shall we not cast him off from us like a robber
and a thief, and thrust him out of our number by all possible means? Yet this man is now
in our presence, and fails to produce any of the credentials which we have summarized in

what we have already said, and declares that he is the Paraclete whose mission was presignified
by Jesus. And by this assertion, in his ignorance perchance, he will make out Jesus
Himself to be a liar;1680 for thus He who once said that He would send the Paraclete no long
time after, will be proved only to have sent this person, if we accept the testimony which he
bears to himself, after an interval of three hundred years and more.1681 In the day of judgment,
then, what will those say to Jesus who have departed this life from that time on to the
present period? Will they not meet Him with words like these: “Do not punish us rigorously
if we have failed to do Thy works. For why, when Thou didst promise to send the Paraclete
under Tiberius Cæsar, to convince us of sin and of righteousness,1682 didst Thou send Him
only under Probus the Roman emperor, and didst leave us orphaned, not withstanding that
Thou didst say, ‘I will not leave you comfortless (orphaned),’1683 and after Thou hadst also
assured us that Thou wouldest send the Paraclete presently after Thy departure? What could
we orphans do, having no guardian? We have committed no fault; it is Thou that hast deceived
us.” But away with such a supposition in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour
of every soul.1684 For He did not confine Himself to mere promises;1685 but when He had
once said, “I go to my Father, and I send the Paraclete to you,”1686 straightway He sent (that
gift of the Paraclete), dividing and imparting the same to His disciples,—bestowing it,
however, in greater fulness upon Paul.1687</p>

<p>28. Manes said:1688 You are caught in the charge you yourself bring forward. For you
have been speaking now against yourself, and have not perceived that, in trying to cast reproaches
in my teeth, you lay yourself under the greater fault. Tell me this now, I pray you:
if, as you allege, those who have died from the time of Tiberius on to the days of Probus are
to say to Jesus, “Do not judge us if we have failed to do Thy works, for Thou didst not send
the Paraclete to us, although Thou didst promise to send Him;”1689 will not those much
more use such an address who have departed this life from the time of Moses on to the advent
of Christ Himself? And will not those with still greater right express themselves in terms
like these: “Do not deliver us over to torments,1690 seeing that we had no knowledge of Thee
imparted to us?” And will it only be those that have died thus far previously to His advent
who may be seen making such a charge with right? Will not those also do the same who
have passed away from Adam’s time on to Christ’s advent? For none of these either obtained
any knowledge of the Paraclete, or received instruction in the doctrine of Jesus. But only
this latest generation of men, which has run its course from Tiberius onward, as you make
it out,1691 is to be saved: for it is Christ Himself that “has re-deemed them from the curse
of the law;”1692 as Paul, too, has given these further testimonies, that “the letter killeth, and
quickeneth no man,”1693 and that “the law is the ministration of death,”1694 and “the strength
of sin.”1695 Archelaus said: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the power of God.1696
For many have also perished after the period of Christ’s advent on to this present period,
and many are still perishing,—those, to wit, who have not chosen to devote themselves to
works of righteousness; whereas only those who have received Him, and yet receive Him,
“have obtained power to become the sons of God.”1697 For the evangelist has not said all

have obtained that power; neither, on the other hand, however, has he put any limit on the
time. But this is his expression: “As many as received Him.” Moreover, from the creation
of the world He has ever been with righteous men, and has never ceased to require their
blood at the hands of the wicked, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias.
1698 And whence, then, did righteous Abel and all those succeeding worthies,1699 who
are enrolled among the righteous, derive their righteousness when as yet there was no law
of Moses, and when as yet the prophets had not arisen and discharged the functions of
prophecy? Were they not constituted righteous in virtue of their fulfilling the law, “every
one of them showing the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also
bearing them witness?”1700 For when a man “who has not the law does naturally the things
contained in the law, he, not having the law, is a law unto himself.”1701 And consider now
the multitude of laws thus existing among the several righteous men who lived a life of uprightness,
at one time discovering for themselves the law of God implanted in their hearts,
at another learning of it from their parents, and yet again being instructed in it further by
the ancients and the elders. But inasmuch as only few were able to rise by this medium1702
to the height of righteousness, that is to say, by means of the traditions of parents, when as
yet there was no law embodied in writing, God had compassion on the race of man. and
was pleased to give through Moses a written law to men, since verily the equity of the natural
law failed to be retained in all its perfection in their hearts. In consonance, therefore, with
man’s first creation, a written legislation was prepared which was given through Moses in
behoof of the salvation of very many. For if we reckon that man is justified without the
works of the law, and if Abraham was counted righteous, how much more shall those obtain
righteousness who have fulfilled the law which contains the things that are expedient for
men? And seeing that you have made mention only of three several scriptures, in terms of
which the apostle has declared that “the law is a ministration of death,”1703 and that “Christ
has redeemed us from the curse of the law,”1704 and that “the law is the strength of sin,”1705
you may now advance others of like tenor, and bring forward any passages which may seem
to you to be written against the law, to any extent you please.</p>

<p>29. Manes said: Is not that word also to the same effect which Jesus spake to the disciples,
when He was demonstrating those men to be unbelieving: “Ye are of your father the devil,
and the lusts of your father ye will do?”1706 By this He means, in sooth, that whatever the
wicked prince of this world desired, and whatever he lusted after, he committed to writing
through Moses, and by that medium gave it to men for their doing. For “he was a murderer
from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”1707 Archelaus
said: Are you satisfied1708 with what you have already adduced, or have you other statements
still to make? Manes said: I have, indeed, many things to say, and things of greater weight
even than these. But with these I shall content myself. Archelaus said: By all means. Now let
us select some instance from among those statements which you allege to be on your side;
so that if these be once found to have been properly dealt with, other questions may also be
held to rank with them; and if the case goes otherwise, I shall come under the condemnation
of the judges, that is to say, I shall have to bear the shame of defeat.1709 You say, then, that
the law is a ministration of death, and you admit that “death, the prince of this world, reigned
from Adam even to Moses;”1710 for the word of Scripture is this: “even over them that did
not sin.”1711 Manes said: Without doubt death did reign thus, for there is a duality, and
these two antagonistic powers were nothing else than both unbegotten.1712 Archelaus said:
Tell me this then,—how can an unbegotten death take a beginning at a certain time? For
“from Adam” is the word of Scripture, and not “before Adam.” Manes said: But tell me, I
ask you in turn, how it obtained its kingdom over both the righteous and the sinful. Archelaus
said: When you have first admitted that it has had that kingdom from a determinate time
and not from eternity, I shall tell you that. Manes said: It is written, that “death reigned from
Adam to Moses.” Archelaus said: And consequently it has an end, because it has had a beginning
in time.1713 And this saying is also true, that “death is swallowed up in victory.”1714

beginning and an end. Manes said: But in that way it would also follow that God was its
maker. Archelaus said: By no means; away with such a supposition! “For God made not
death; neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living.”1715 Manes said: God made
it not; nevertheless it was made, as you admit. Tell us, therefore, from whom it received its
empire, or by whom it was created. Archelaus said: If I give the most ample proof of the fact
that death cannot have the substance of an unbegotten nature, will you not confess that
there is but one God, and that an unbegotten God? Manes said: Continue your discourse,
for your aim is to speak1716 with subtlety. Archelaus said: Nay, but you have put forward
those allegations in such a manner, as if they were to serve you for a demonstration of an
unbegotten root. Nevertheless the positions which we have discussed above may suffice us,
for by these we have shown most fully that it is impossible for the substances of two unbegotten
natures to exist together.</p>

<p>30. The judges said: Speak to those points, Archelaus, which he has just now propounded.
Archelaus said: By the prince of the world, and the wicked one, and darkness, and death, he
means one and the same thing, and alleges that the law has been given by that being, on the
ground of the scriptural statement that it is “the ministration of death,” as well as on the
ground of other things which he has urged against it. Well, then, I say1717 that since, as we
have explained above, the law which was written naturally on men’s hearts did not keep
carefully by the memory of evil things, and since there was not a sufficiently established
tradition among the elders, inasmuch as hostile oblivion always attached itself to the
memory,1718 and one man was instructed in the knowledge of that law by master, and another
by himself, it easily came about that transgressions of the law engraved by nature did
take place, and that through the violation of the commandments death obtained its kingship
among men. For the race of men is of such a nature, that it needs to be ruled by God with
a rod of iron. And so death triumphed and reigned with all its power on to Moses, even over
those who had not sinned, in the way which we have explained: over sinners indeed, as these
were its proper objects, and under subjection to it,—men after the type of Cain and Judas;1719
but also over the righteous, because they refused to consent to it, and rather withstood it,
by putting away from themselves the vices and concupiscence of lusts,—men like those who
have arisen at times from Abel on to Zacharias;1720—death thus always passing, up to the
time of Moses, upon those after that similitude.1721</p>
<p>But after Moses had made his appearance, and had given the law to the children of Israel,
and had brought into their memory all the requirements of the law, and all that it behoved
men to observe and do under it, and when he delivered over to death only those who should
transgress the law, then death was cut off from reigning over all men; for it reigned then
over sinners alone, as the law said to it, “Touch not those that keep my precepts.”1722 Moses
therefore served the ministration of this word upon death, while he delivered up to destruction1723
all others who were transgressors of the law; for it was not with the intent that death
might not reign in any territory at all that Moses came, inasmuch as multitudes were assuredly

held under the power of death even after Moses. And the law was called a “ministration of
death” from the fact that then only transgressors of the law were punished, and not those
who kept it, and who obeyed and observed the things which are in the law, as Abel did,
whom Cain, who was made a vessel of the wicked one, slew. However, even after these things
death wished to break the covenant which had been made by the instrumentality of Moses,
and to reign again over the righteous; and with this object it did indeed assail the prophets,
killing and stoning those who had been sent by God, on to Zacharias. But my Lord Jesus,
as maintaining the righteousness of the law of Moses, was wroth with death for its transgression
of the covenant1724 and of that whole ministration, and condescended to appear in the
body of man, with the view of avenging not Himself, but Moses, and those who in a continuous
succession after him had been oppressed by the violence of death. That wicked one,
however, in ignorance of the meaning of a dispensation of this kind, entered into Judas,
thinking to slay Him by that man’s means, as before he had put righteous Abel to death.
But when he had entered into Judas, he was overcome with penitence, and hanged himself;
for which reason also the divine word says: “O death, where is thy victory? O death,1725
where is thy sting?” And again: “Death is swallowed up of victory.”1726 It is for this reason,
therefore, that the law is called a “ministration of death” because it delivered sinners and
transgressors over to death; but those who observed it, it defended from death; and these it
also established in glory, by the help and aid of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

viz., “Christ, who redeemed us from the curse of the law.”1727 My view of this passage is
that Moses, that illustrious servant of God, committed to those who wished to have the right
vision,1728 an emblematic1729 law, and also a real law. Thus, to take an example, after God
had made the world, and all things that are in it, in the space of six days, He rested on the
seventh day from all His works; by which statement I do not mean to affirm that He rested
because He was fatigued, but that He did so as having brought to its perfection every creature
which He had resolved to introduce. And yet in the sequel it, the new law, says: “My Father
worketh hitherto, and I work.”1730 Does that mean, then, that He is still making heaven, or
sun, or man, or animals, or trees, or any such thing? Nay; but the meaning is, that when
these visible objects were perfectly finished, He rested from that kind of work; while, however,
He still continues to work at objects invisible with an inward mode of action,1731 and saves
men. In like manner, then, the legislator desires also that every individual amongst us should
be devoted unceasingly to this kind of work, even as God Himself is; and he enjoins us
consequently to rest continuously from secular things, and to engage in no worldly sort of
work whatsoever; and this is called our Sabbath. This also he added in the law, that nothing
senseless1732 should be done but that we should be careful and direct our life in accordance
with what is just and righteous. Now this law was suspended over men, discharging most
sharply its curse against those who might transgress it. But because its subjects, too, were
but men, and because, as happens also frequently with us, controversies arose and injuries
were inflicted, the law likewise at once, and with the severest equity, made any wrong that

<note type="footnote">1729 The phrase is imaginariam legem.On this expression there is a note in Migne, which is worth quoting,
to this effect: Archelaus calls the Old Testament an emblematic or imaginary law, because it was the type or
image of a future new law. So, too, Petrus de Vineis, more than once in his Epistles, calls a messenger or legate
a homo imaginarius, as Du Cange observes in his Glossary, because he represents the person by whom he is sent,
and, as it were, reflects his image. This word is also used in a similar manner by the old interpreter of Evagrius
the monk, in the Disputation between Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, and Simon the Jew, ch. 13, where the
Sabbath is called the requies imaginaria of that seventh day on which God rested. Hence Archelaus, in his answer
to the presbyter Diodorus, ch xli. beneath, devotes himself to proving that the Old Testament is not to he rejected,
because, like a mirror, it gives us a true image of the new law.</note>

was done return upon the head of the wrong-doer;1733 so that, for instance, if a poor man
was minded to gather a bundle of wood upon the Sabbath, he was placed under the curse
of the law, and exposed to the penalty of instant death.1734 The men, therefore, who had
been brought up with the Egyptians were thus severely pressed by the restrictive power of
the law, and they were unable to bear the penalties and the curses of the law. But, again, He
who is ever the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, came and delivered those men from these
pains and curses of the law, forgiving them their offences. And He indeed did not deal with
them as Moses did, putting the severities of the law in force, and granting indulgence to no
man for any offence; but He declared that if any man suffered an injury at the hands of his
neighbour, he was to forgive him not once only, nor even twice or thrice, nor only seven
times, but even unto seventy times seven;1735 but that, on the other hand, if after all this the
offender still continued to do such wrong, he ought then, as the last resource, to be brought
under the law of Moses, and that no further pardon should be granted to the man who
would thus persist in wrong-doing, even after having been forgiven unto seventy times
seven. And He bestowed His forgiveness not only on a transgressor of such a character as
that, but even on one who did offence to the Son of man. But if a man dealt thus with the
Holy Spirit, He made him subject to two curses,—namely, to that of the law of Moses, and
to that of His own law; to the law of Moses in truth in this present life, but to His own law
at the time of the judgment: for His word is this: “It shall not be forgiven him, neither in
this world, neither in the world to come.”1736 There is the law of Moses, thus, that in this
world gives pardon to no such person; and there is the law of Christ that punishes in the
future world. From this, therefore, mark how He confirms the law, not only not destroying
it, but fulfilling it. Thus, then, He redeemed them from that curse of the law which belongs
to the present life; and from this fact has come the appellation “the curse of the law.” This
is the whole account which needs be given of that mode of speech. But, again, why the law
is called the “strength of sin,” we shall at once explain in brief to the best of our ability. Now
it is written that “the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient,
for the ungodly and for sinners.”1737 In these times, then, before Moses, there was no written
law for transgressors; whence also Pharaoh, not knowing the strength of sin, transgressed
in the way of afflicting the children of Israel with unrighteous burdens, and despised the
Godhead, not only himself, but also all who were with him. But, not to make any round-

about statement, I shall explain the matter briefly as follows. There were certain persons of
the Egyptian race mingling with the people of Moses, when that people was under his rule
in the desert; and when Moses had taken his position on the mount, with the purpose of
receiving the law, the impatient people, I do not mean those who were the true Israel, but
those who had been intermixed with the Egyptians,1738 set up a calf as their god, in accordance
with their ancient custom of worshipping idols, with the notion that by such means
they might secure themselves against ever having to pay the proper penalties for their
iniquities.1739 Thus were they altogether ignorant of the strength of their sin. But when
Moses returned (from the mount) and found that out, he issued orders that those men
should be put to death with the sword. From that occasion a beginning was made in the
correct perception of the strength of sin on the part of these persons through the instrumentality
of the law of Moses, and for that reason the law has been called the “strength of sin.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1738 This is one of those passages in which we detect the tendency of many of the early fathers to adopt the
peculiar opinions of the Jewish rabbis on difficult points of Scripture. See also the Disputation between Theophilus
of Alexandria and the Jew Simon, ch. 13. In accordance with the opinion propounded here by Archelaus, we
find, for instance, in the Scemoth Rabba, p. 157, col. 1, that the making of the golden calf is ascribed to the
Egyptian proselytes. See the note in Migne. [The passage is a note of antiquity and in so far of authenticity.]</note>

<p>32. Moreover, as to this word which is written in the Gospel, “Ye are of your father the
devil,”1740 and so forth, we say in brief that there is a devil working in us, whose aim it has
been, in the strength of his own will, to make us like himself. For all the creatures that God
made, He made very good; and He gave to every individual the sense of free-will, in accordance
with which standard He also instituted the law of judgment. To sin is ours, and that
we sin not is God’s gift, as our will is constituted to choose either to sin or not to sin. And
this you doubtless understand well enough yourself, Manes; for you know that, although
you were to bring together all your disciples and admonish1741 them not to commit any
transgression or do any unrighteousness, every one of them might still pass by the law of
judgment. And certainly whosoever will, may keep the commandments; and whosoever
shall despise them, and turn aside to what is contrary to them, shall yet without doubt have
to face this law of judgment. Hence also certain of the angels, refusing to submit themselves
to the commandment of God, resisted His will; and one of them indeed fell like a flash of
lightning1742 upon the earth, while others,1743 harassed by the dragon, sought their felicity
in intercourse with the daughters of men,1744 and thus brought on themselves the merited
award of the punishment of eternal fire. And that angel who was cast down to earth, finding
no further admittance into any of the regions of heaven, now flaunts about among men,
deceiving them, and luring them to become transgressors like himself, and even to this day
he is an adversary to the commandments of God. The example of his fall and ruin, however,
will not be followed by all, inasmuch as to each is given liberty of will. For this reason also
has he obtained the name of devil, because he has passed over from the heavenly places, and
appeared on earth as the disparager of God’s commandment.1745 But because it was God
who first gave the commandment, the Lord Jesus Himself said to the devil, “Get thee behind

<note type="footnote">1743 We have another instance here of a characteristic opinion of the Jewish rabbis adopted by a Christian
father. This notion as to the intercourse of the angels with the daughters of men was a current interpretation
among the Jews from the times of Philo and Josephus, and was followed in whole or in part by Tertullian, Justin,
Irenæus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Athenagoras, Methodius, Cyprian, Lactantius, etc. Consult the note in Migne;

me, Satan;”1746 and, without doubt, to go behind God is the sign of being His servant. And
again He says, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”1747
Wherefore, as certain men were inclined to yield obedience to his wishes, they were addressed
in these terms by the Saviour: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
ye will do.”1748 And, in fine, when they are found to be actually doing his will, they are thus
addressed: “O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.”1749 From all this, then, you ought to see
how weighty a matter it is for man to have freedom of will. However, let my antagonist here
say whether there is a judgment for the godly and the ungodly, or not. Manes said: There
is a judgment. Archelaus said: I think that what we1750 have said concerning the devil contains
no small measure of reason as well as of piety. For every creature, moreover, has its own
order; and there is one order for the human race, and another for animals, and another for
angels. Furthermore, there is but one only inconvertible substance, the divine substance,
eternal and invisible, as is known to all, and as is also borne out by this scripture: “No man
hath seen God at any time, save the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.”
1751 All the other creatures, consequently, are of necessity visible,—such as heaven, earth,
sea, men, angels, archangels. But if God has not been seen by any man at any time, what
consubstantiality can there be between Him and those creatures? Hence we hold that all
things whatsoever have, in their several positions, their own proper substances, according
to their proper order. You, on the other hand, allege that every living thing which moves is
made of one,1752 and you say that every object has received like substance from God, and
that this substance is capable of sinning and of being brought under the judgment; and you
are unwilling to accept the word which declares that the devil was an angel, and that he fell
in transgression, and that he is not of the same substance with God. Logically, you ought to
do away with any allowance of the doctrine of a judgment, and that would make it clear
which of us is in error.1753 If, indeed, the angel that has been created by God is incapable

angels are not reconcilable with such a belief.—If this can be accepted as the probable meaning, then it would
seem that the use of the verb interimere may be due to the fact that the Greek text gave ἀνᾶιρεῖν, between the</note>

again, if you say that there is a judgment for sinning souls, and if you hold also that these
are of one substance with God; and if still, even although you maintain that they are of the
divine nature, you affirm that, notwithstanding that fact, they do not keep1754 the commandments
of God, then, even on such grounds, my argument will pass very well,1755 which avers
that the devil fell first, on account of his failure to keep the commandments of God. He was
not indeed of the substance of God. And he fell, not so much to do hurt to the race of man,
as rather to be set at nought1756 by the same. For He “gave unto us power to tread on serpents
and scorpions, and over all the strength of the enemy.”1757</p>

<p>33. The judges said: He has given demonstration enough of the origin of the devil. And
as both sides admit that there will be a judgment, it is necessarily involved in that admission
that every individual is shown to have free-will; and since this is brought clearly out, there
can be no doubt that every individual, in the exercise of his own proper power of will, may
shape his course in whatever direction he pleases.1758 Manes said: If (only) the good is from
(your) God, as you allege, then you make Jesus Himself a liar.1759 Archelaus said: In the first
place, admit that the account of what we have adduced is true, and then I will give you proof
about the “father of him.”1760 Manes said: If you prove to me that his father is a liar, and
yet show me that for all that you ascribe no such (evil) notion to God, then credit will be
given you on all points. Archelaus said: Surely when a full account of the devil has once been
presented, and the dispensation set forth, any one now, with an ordinarily vigorous understanding,
might simply, by turning the matter carefully over in his own mind, get an idea
of who this is that is here called the father of the devil. But though you give yourself out to
be the Paraclete, you come very far short of the ordinary sagacity of men. Wherefore, as you
have betrayed your ignorance, I shall tell you what is meant by this expression, the “father
of the devil.” Manes said: I say so1761…; and he added: Every one who is the founder or
maker of anything may be called the father, parent, of that which he has made. Archelaus
said: Well, I am verily astonished that you have made so correct an admission in reply to
what I have said, and have not concealed either your intelligent apprehension of the affirmation,
or the real nature of the same. Now, from this learn who is this father of the devil.
<note type="footnote">1758 This appears to be general sense of the very corrupt passage, “Quo videntur ostenso nulli dubium est
unusquisque in quamcunque elegerit partem propria usus arbitrii potestate.” In Migne it is amended thus: “Quo

a Deo diabolus” = if the devil is from God.</note>
<note type="footnote">1760 The argumentation throughout this passage seems to rest on the fact that, in support of the dogma of
the evil deity, Manes perverted, among other passages, our Lord’s words in John viii. 44, as if they were not only
“Ye are of your father the devil” but possibly also, “Ye are of the father of the devil;” and again, “He is a liar, and
the father of him is the same.” Thus what Manes urges against Archelaus is this: If only what is good proceeds
from the Deity, and if He is the Supreme Good Himself, you make out Jesus to have spoken falsely, when in
John’s Gospel He uses expressions which imply that the devil’s father is a liar, and also the Creator of the lying

When he fell from the kingdom of heaven, he came to dwell upon earth, and there he remained,
ever watching and seeking out some one to whom he might attach himself, and
whom, through an alliance with himself, he might also make a partner in his own wickedness.
Now as long, indeed, as man was not yet existent, the devil was never called either a murderer
or a liar together with his father. But subsequently, when man had once been made, and
when further he had been deceived by the devil’s lies and craftiness, and when the devil had
also introduced himself into the body of the serpent, which was the most sagacious of all
the beasts, then from that time the devil was called a liar together with his father, and then1762
also the curse was made to rest not only on himself, but also on his father. Accordingly,
when the serpent had received him, and had indeed admitted him wholly into its own being,
it was, as it were, rendered pregnant, for it bore the burden of the devil’s vast wickedness;
and it was like one with child, and under the strain of parturition, as it sought to eject the
agitations1763 of his malignant suggestions. For the serpent, grudging the glory of the first
man, made its way into paradise; and harbouring these pains of parturition in itself,1764 it
began to produce mendacious addresses, and to generate death for the men who had been
fashioned by God, and who had received the gift of life. The devil, however, was not able to
manifest himself completely through the serpent; but he reserved his perfection for a time,
in order that he might demonstrate it through Cain, by whom he was generated completely.
And thus through the serpent, on the one hand, he displayed his hypocrisies and deceits to
Eve; while through Cain, on the other hand, he effected the beginning of murder, introducing
himself into the firstlings of the “fruits,” which that man administered so badly. From this
the devil has been called a murderer from the beginning, and also a liar, because he deceived
the parties to whom he said, “Ye shall be as gods;”1765 for those very persons whom he
falsely declared destined to be gods were afterwards cast out of paradise. Wherefore the
serpent which conceived him in its womb, and bore him, and brought him forth to the light
of day, is constituted the devil’s first father; and Cain is made his second father, who through
the conception of iniquities produced pains and parricide: for truly the taking of life was
the perpetrating of iniquity, unrighteousness, and impiety all together. Furthermore, all
who receive him, and do his lusts, are constituted his brothers. Pharaoh is his father in
perfection. Every impious man is made his father. Judas became his father, since he conceived
him indeed, though he miscarried: for he did not present a perfect parturition there, since

it was really a greater person who was assailed through Judas; and consequently, as I say, it
proved an abortion. For just as the woman receives the man’s seed, and thereby also becomes
sensible of a daily growth within her, so also did Judas make daily advances in evil, the occasions
for that being furnished him like seed by the wicked one. And the first seed of evil
in him, indeed, was the lust of money; and its increment was theft, for he purloined the
moneys which were deposited in the bag. Its offspring, moreover, consisted of less vexations,
and compacts with the Pharisees, and the scandalous bargain for a price; yet it was the
abortion, and not the birth, that was witnessed in the horrid noose by which he met his
death. And exactly in the same way shall it stand also with you: if you bring the wicked one
to light in your own deeds, and do his lusts, you have conceived him, and will be called his
father; but, on the other hand, if you cherish penitence, and deliver yourself of your burden,
you will be like one that brings to the birth.1766 For, as in school exercises, if one gets the
subject-matter from the master, and then creates and produces the whole body of an oration
by himself, he is said to be the author of the compositions to which he has thus given
birth;1767 so he who has taken in any little leaven of evil from the prime evil, is of necessity
called the father and procreator of that wicked one, who from the beginning has resisted
the truth. The case may be the same, indeed, with those who devote themselves to virtue;
for I have heard the most valiant men say to God, “For Thy fear, O Lord, we have conceived
in the womb, and we have been in pain, and have brought forth the spirit of salvation.”1768
And so those, too, who conceive in respect of the fear of the wicked one, and bring forth
the spirit of iniquity, must needs be called the fathers of the same. Thus, on the one hand,
they are called sons of that wicked one, so long as they are still yielding obedience to his
service; but, on the other hand, they are called fathers if they have attained to the perfection
of iniquity. For it is with this view that our Lord says to the Pharisees, “Ye are of your father
the devil,”1769 thereby making them his sons, as long as they appeared still to be perturbed1770
by him, and meditated in their hearts evil for good toward the righteous. Accordingly, while
they deliberated in such a spirit with their own hearts, and while their wicked devices were
made chargeable upon1771 themselves, Judas, as the head of all the evil, and as the person
who carried out their iniquitous counsels to their consummation, was constituted the father
of the crime, having received at their hands the recompense of thirty pieces of silver for his

said, when his womb was enlarged, and the time of his travail came on, he delivered himself
only of an abortive burden in the conception of unrighteousness, and consequently he could
not be called the father in perfection, except only at that very time when the conception was
still in the womb; and afterwards, when he betook himself to the hangman’s rope, he showed
that he had not brought it to a complete birth, because remorse1773 followed.</p>

<p>34. I think that you cannot fail to understand this too, that the word “father” is but a
single term indeed, and yet one admitting of being understood in various ways. For one is
called father, as being the parent of those children whom he has begotten in a natural way;
another is called father, as being the guardian of children whom he has but brought up; and
some, again, are called fathers in respect of the privileged standing accruing through time
or age. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is said to have a variety of fathers: for David
was called His father, and Joseph was reckoned to be His father, while neither of these two
was His father in respect of the actuality of nature. For David is called His father as touching
the prerogative of time and age,1774 and Joseph is designated His father as concerning the
law of upbringing; but God Himself is His only Father by nature, who was pleased to make
all things manifest in short space1775 to us by His word. And our Lord Jesus Christ, making
no tarrying,1776 in the space of one year1777 restored multitudes of the sick to health, and
gave back the dead to the light of life; and He did indeed embrace all things in the power of
His own word.1778 And wherein, forsooth, did He make any tarrying, so that we should
have to believe Him to have waited so long, even to these days, before He actually sent the
Paraclete?1779 Nay, rather, as has been already said above, He gave proof of His presence
with us forthwith, and did most abundantly impart Himself to Paul, whose testimony we
also believe when he says, “Unto me only is this grace given.”1780 For this is he who formerly
was a persecutor of the Church of God, but who afterwards appeared openly before all men
as a faithful minister of the Paraclete; by whose instrumentality His singular clemency was
made known to all men, in such wise that even to us who some time were without hope the
largess of His gifts has come. For which of us could have hoped that Paul, the persecutor
and enemy of the Church, would prove its defender and guardian? Yea, and not that alone,
but that he would become also its ruler, the founder and architect of the churches? Wherefore
after him, and after those who were with Himself—that is, the disciples—we are not to look
for the advent of any other (such), according to the Scriptures; for our Lord Jesus Christ
says of this Paraclete, “He shall receive of mine.”1781 Him therefore He selected as an accept-

able vessel; and He sent this Paul to us in the Spirit. Into him the Spirit was poured;1782 and
as that Spirit could not abide upon all men, but only on Him who was born of Mary the
mother of God, so that Spirit, the Paraclete, could not come into any other, but could only
come upon the apostles and the sainted Paul. “For he is a chosen vessel,” He says, “unto me,
to bear my name before kings and the Gentiles.”1783 The apostle himself, too, states the
same thing in his first epistle, where he says: “According to the grace that is given to me of
God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering1784 the Gospel
of God.”1785 “I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in
the Holy Ghost.”1786 And again: “For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
Christ hath not wrought by me by word and deed.”1787 “I am the last of all the apostles, that
am not meet to be called an apostle. But by the grace of God I am what I am.”1788 And it,
is his wish to have to deal with1789 those who sought the proof of that Christ who spake in
him, for this reason, that the Paraclete was in him: and as having obtained His gift of grace,
and as being enriched with magnificent, honour,1790 he says: “For this thing I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for
thee; for strength is made perfect in weakness.”1791 Again, that it was the Paraclete Himself
who was in Paul, is indicated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, when He says: “If ye
love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray my Father, and He shall give you another
Comforter.”1792 In these words He points to the Paraclete Himself, for He speaks of “another”
Comforter. And hence we have given credit to Paul, and have hearkened to him when he
says, “Or1793 seek ye a proof of Christ speaking in me?”1794 and when he expresses himself

in similar terms, of which we have already spoken above. Thus, too, he seals his testament
for us as for his faithful heirs, and like a father he addresses us in these words in his Epistle
to the Corinthians: “I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that
Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He
rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then
of the eleven apostles:1795 after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of
whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that He
was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one
born out of due time. For I am the last of the apostles.”1796 “Therefore, whether it were I or
they, so we preach, and so ye believed.”1797 And again, in delivering over to his heirs that
inheritance which he gained first himself, he says: “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity
that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ,1798 whom we have not
preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which we have not received, or another gospel,
which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. For I suppose that I did nothing
less for you than the other apostles.”1799</p>

<p>35. These things, moreover, he has said with the view of showing us that all others who
may come after him will be false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into
the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed, like an angel of
light. What great thing therefore is it, if his ministers also be transformed into the ministers
of righteousness?—whose end shall be according to their works.1800 He indicates, further,
what manner of men these were, and points out by whom they were being circumvented.
And when the Galatians are minded to turn away from the Gospel, he says to them: “I
marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you unto another gospel: which
is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would turn you away1801 from the
Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
you than that which has been delivered to you, let him be accursed.”1802 And again he says:
“To me, who am the least of all the apostles,1803 is this grace given;”1804 and,” I fill up that
which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.”1805 And once more, in another
place, he declares of himself that he was a minister of Christ more than all others,1806 as
though after him none other was to be looked for at all; for he enjoins that not even an angel
from heaven is thus to be received. And how, then, shall we credit the professions of this
Manes, who comes from Persis,1807 and declares himself to be the Paraclete? By this very
thing, indeed, I rather recognise in him one of those men who transform themselves, and
of whom the Apostle Paul, that elect vessel, has given us very clear indication when he says:
“Now in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot
iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created
to be received1808 with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.”1809

Jesus Christ: “Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying,
I am Christ; and shall deceive many. But if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ,
or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false apostles,1810 and false
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they
shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. If they shall say unto you, Behold,
he is in the desert; go not forth: if they shall say, Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe
it not.”1811 And yet, after all these directions, this man, who has neither sign nor portent of
any kind to show, who has no affinity to exhibit, who never even had a place among the
number of the disciples, who never was a follower of our departed Lord, in whose inheritance
we rejoice,—this man, I say, although he never stood by our Lord in His weakness, and although
he never came forward as a witness of His testament, yea rather, although he never
came even within the acquaintance of those who ministered to Him in His sickness, and,
in fine, although he obtains the testimony of no person whatsoever, desires us to believe
this profession which he makes of being the Paraclete; whereas, even were you to do signs
and wonders, we would still have to reckon you a false Christ, and a false prophet, according
to the Scriptures. And therefore it is well for us to act with the greater caution, in accordance
with the warning which the sainted apostle gives us, when, in the epistle which he wrote to
the Colossians, he speaks in the following terms: “Continue in the faith grounded and
rooted,1812 and not to be moved away1813 from the hope of the Gospel, which we have
heard,1814 and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.”1815 And again:
“As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built
up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with
thanksgiving. Beware lest any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead.”1816 And after all these matters have been thus carefully set forth, the blessed
apostle, like a father speaking to his children, adds the following words, which serve as a
sort of seal to his testament: “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,1817 I
have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the

<p>36. None of your party,1819 O Manes, will you make a Galatian; neither will you in this
fashion divert us1820 from the faith of Christ. Yea, even although you were to work signs
and wonders, although you were to raise the dead, although you were to present to us the
very image of Paul himself, you would remain accursed still.1821 For we have been instructed
beforehand with regard to you: we have been both warned and armed against you by the
Holy Scriptures. You are a vessel of Antichrist; and no vessel of honour, in sooth, but a mean
and base one, used by him as any barbarian or tyrant may do, who, in attempting to make
an inroad on a people living under the righteousness of the laws,1822 sends some select
vessel on beforehand, as it were destined to death, with the view of finding out the exact
magnitude and character of the strength possessed by the legitimate king and his nation:
for the man is too much afraid to make the inroad himself wholly at unawares, and he also
lacks the daring to despatch any person belonging to his own immediate circle on such a
task, through fear that he may sustain some harm. And so it is that your king, Antichrist,
has despatched you in a similar character, and as it were destined to death, to us who are a
people placed under the administration of the good and holy King. And this I do not say
inconsiderately or without due inquiry; but from the fact that I see you perform no miracle,
I hold myself entitled to entertain such sentiments concerning you. For we are given to understand
beforehand that the devil himself is to be transformed into an angel of light, and
that his servants are to make their appearance in similar guise, and that they are to work
signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, the very elect should be deceived.1823
But who, pray, are you then, to whose lot no such position of kinship has been assigned by
your father Satan?1824 For whom have you raised from the dead? What issue of blood do
you ever staunch? What1825 eyes of the blind do you ever anoint with clay, and thus cause
them to have vision? When do you ever refresh a hungering multitude with a few loaves?
Where do you ever walk upon the water, or who of those who dwell in Jerusalem has ever
seen you? O Persian barbarian, you have never been able to have a knowledge of the language
of the Greeks, or of the Egyptians, or of the Romans, or of any other nation; but the Chaldean

tongue alone has been known to you, which verily is not a language prevalent among any
great number of people,1826 and you are not capable of understanding any one of another
nationality when he speaks. Not thus is it with the Holy Spirit: God forbid; but He divides
to all, and knows all kinds of tongues, and has understanding of all things, and is made all
things to all men, so that the very thoughts of the heart cannot escape His cognizance. For
what says the Scripture? “That every man heard the apostles speak in his own language
through the Spirit, the Paraclete.”1827 But why should I say more on this subject?1828 Barbarian1829
priest and crafty coadjutor of Mithras, you will only be a worshipper of the sungod
Mithras, who is the illuminator of places of mystic import, as you opine, and the selfconscious
deity;1830 that is, you will sport as his worshippers do, and you will celebrate,
though with less elegance as it were, his mysteries.1831 But why should I take all this so indignantly?
Is it not accordant with all that is fitting, that you should multiply yourself like
the tares, until that same mighty father of yours comes, raising the dead, as he will profess
to do, and persecuting almost to hell itself all those who refuse to yield to his bidding,
keeping multitudes in check by that terror of arrogance in which he entrenches himself,
and employing threatenings against others, and making sport of them by the changing of
his countenance and his deceitful dealing?1832 And yet beyond that he shall proceed no
further; for his folly shall be made manifest to all men, as was the case with Jamnes and
Mambres.1833 The judges said: As we have heard now from you, as Paul himself also seems

in this life at least, held out on the same terms to any person in times subsequent to the

be a false prophet or a false Christ. Now, since you have alleged that the Paraclete was in
Paul, and that He attested all things in him, how is it that Paul himself said, “We know in
part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away?”1835 What other one did he look for, when he uttered these words?
For if he professes himself to be looking for some perfect one, and if some one must needs
come, show us who it is of whom he speaks; lest that word of his perchance appear to carry
us back to this man, Manes, or to him who has sent him, that is to say, Satan, according to

<p>37. Archelaus said: Those sayings which are put forth by the blessed Paul were not
uttered without the direction of God, and therefore it is certain that what he has declared
to us is that we are to look for our Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect one, who1836 is the only
one that knows the Father, with the sole exception of him to whom He has chosen also to
reveal Him,1837 as I am able to demonstrate from His own words. But let it be observed,
that it is said that when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done
away. Now this man (Manes) asserts that he is the perfect one. Let him show us, then, what
he has done away with; for what is to be done away with is the ignorance which is in us. Let
him therefore tell us what he has done away with, and what he has brought into the sphere
of our knowledge. If he is able to do anything of this nature, let him do it now, in order that
he may be believed. These very words of Paul’s, if one can but understand them in the full
power of their meaning, will only secure entire credit to the statements made by me. For in
that first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul speaks in the following terms of the perfection that
is to come: “Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they
shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed: for we know in part, and we
prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
done away.”1838 Observe now what virtue that which is perfect possesses in itself, and of
what order that perfection is. And let this man, then, tell us what prophecy of the Jews or
Hebrews he has done away with; or what tongues he has caused to cease, whether of the
Greeks or of others who worship idols; or what alien dogmas he has destroyed, whether of
a Valentinian, or a Marcion, or a Tatian, or a Sabellius, or any others of those who have
constructed for themselves their peculiar systems of knowledge. Let him tell us which of all
these he has already done away with, or when he is yet to do away with any one of them, in
this character of the perfect one. Perchance he seeks some sort of truce—does he?1839 But
not thus inconsiderable, not thus obscure1840 and ignoble, will be the manner of the advent
of Him who is the truly perfect one, that is to say, our Lord Jesus Christ. Nay, but as a king,
when he draws near to his city, does first of all send on before him his life-guardsmen,1841
his ensigns and standards and banners,1842 his generals and chiefs and prefects, and then
forthwith all objects are roused and excited in different fashions, while some become inspired
with terror and others with exultation at the prospect of the king’s advent; so also my Lord

Jesus Christ, who is the truly perfect one, at His coming will first send on before Him His
glory, and the consecrated heralds of an unstained and untainted kingdom: and then the
universal creation will be moved and perturbed, uttering prayers and supplications, until
He delivers it from its bondage.1843 And it must needs be that the race of man shall then be
in fear and in vehement agitation on account of the many offences it has committed. Then
the righteous alone will rejoice, as they look for the things which have been promised them;
and the subsistence of the affairs of this world will no longer be maintained, but all things
shall be destroyed: and whether they be prophecies or the books of prophets, they shall fail;
whether they be the tongues of the whole race, they shall cease; for men will no longer need
to feel anxiety or to think solicitously about those things which are necessary for life;
whether it be knowledge, by what teachers soever it be possessed, it shall also be destroyed:
for none of all these things will be able to endure the advent of that mighty King. For just
as a little spark, if1844 taken and put up against the splendour of the sun, at once perishes
from the view, so the whole creation, all prophecy, all knowledge, all tongues, as we have
said above, shall be destroyed. But since the capacities of common human nature are all
insufficient to set forth in a few words, and these so weak and so extremely poor, the coming
of this heavenly King,—so much so, indeed, that perchance it should be the privilege only
of the saintly and the highly worthy to attempt any statement on such a subject,—it may
yet be enough for me to be able to say that I have advanced what I have now advanced on

<p>38. And, in good truth, I hold Marcion, and Valentinian, and Basilides, and other
heretics, to be sainted men when compared1845 with this person. For they did display a
certain kind of intellect, and they did, indeed, think themselves capable of understanding
all Scripture, and did thus constitute themselves leaders1846 for those who were willing to
listen to them. But notwithstanding this, not one of these dared to proclaim himself to be
either God, or Christ, or the Paraclete, as this fellow has done, who is ever disputing, on
some occasions about the ages,1847 and on others about the sun, and how these objects were
made, as though he were superior to them himself; for every person who offers an exposition
of the method in which any object has been made, puts himself forward as superior to and
older than the subject of his discussion. But who may venture to speak of the substance of
God, unless, it may be, our Lord Jesus Christ alone? And, indeed, I do not make this statement
on the bare authority of my own words, but I confirm it by the authority of that Scripture
which has been our instructor. For the apostle addresses the following words to us: “That
ye may be lights in this world, holding1848 the word of life for my glory against the day of
Christ, seeing that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.”1849 We ought to understand
what is the force and meaning of this saying; for the word may suit the leader, but the
effectual work suits the king.1850 And accordingly, as one who looks for the arrival of his
king, strives to be able to present all who are under his charge as obedient, and ready, and
estimable, and lovely, and faithful, and not less also as blameless, and abounding in all that
is good, so that he may himself get commendation from the king, and be deemed by him
to be worthy of greater honours, as having rightly governed the province which was entrusted
to his administration; so also does the blessed Paul give us to understand our position when
he uses these words: “That ye may be as lights in this world, holding the word of life for my
glory against the day of Christ.” For the meaning of this saying is, that our Lord Jesus Christ,
when He comes, will see that his doctrine has proved profitable in us, and that, finding that
he, the apostle, has not run in vain, neither laboured in vain, He will bestow on him the
crown of recompense. And again, in the same epistle, he also warns us not to mind earthly
things, and tells us that we ought to have our conversation in heaven; from which also we

look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ.1851 And as the knowledge of the date of the last
day is no secure position for us, he has given us, to that effect, a declaration on the subject
in the epistle which he wrote to the Thessalonians, thus: “But of the times and the seasons,
brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you; for yourselves know perfectly that the day
of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.”1852 How, then, does this man stand up and
try to persuade us to emigrate his opinions, importuning every individual whom he meets
to become a Manichæan, and going about and creeping into houses, and endeavouring to
deceive minds laden with sins?1853 But we do not hold such sentiments. Nay, rather, we
should be disposed to present the things themselves before you all, and bring them into
comparison, if it please you, with what we know of the perfect Paraclete. For you observe
that1854 sometimes he uses the interrogative style, and sometimes the deprecatory. But in
the Gospel of our Saviour it is written that those who stand on the left hand of the King will
say: “Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or athirst, or naked, or a stranger, or in prison,
and did not minister unto Thee?”1855 Thus they will implore Him to be indulgent with
them. But what reply is that righteous Judge and King represented as making to them?
“Depart from me into everlasting fire, ye workers of iniquity.”1856 He casts them into everlasting
fire, although they cease not to direct their entreaties to Him. Do you see, then, O
Manes, what manner of event that advent of the perfect King is destined to be? Do you not
perceive that it will not be such a perfection, or consummation, as you allege? But if the great
day of judgment is to be looked for after that King, surely this man is greatly inferior to
Him. But if he is inferior, he cannot be perfect. And if he is not to be perfect, it is not of him
that the apostle speaks. But if it is not of him that the apostle speaks, while he still makes
the mendacious statement that it is of himself that the said word of the apostle was spoken,
then surely he is to be judged a false prophet. Much more, too, might be said to the same
effect. But if we were to think of going over in detail all that might thus be adduced, time
would fail us for the accomplishment of so large a task. Hence I have deemed it abundantly
sufficient thus to have brought under your notice only a few things out of many, leaving the
yet remaining portions of such a discussion to those who have the inclination to go through
with them.</p>

<p>39. On hearing these matters, those who were present gave great glory to God, and
ascribed to Him such praise as it is meet for Him to receive. And on Archelaus himself they
bestowed many tokens of honour. Then Marcellus rose up; and casting off his cloak,1857 he
threw his arms round Archelaus, and kissed him, and embraced him, and clung to him.
Then, too, the children who had chanced to gather about the place began and set the example
of pelting Manes and driving him off;1858 and the rest of the crowd followed them, and
moved excitedly about, with the intention of compelling Manes to take to flight. But when
Archelaus observed this, he raised his voice like a trumpet above the din, in his anxiety to
restrain the multitude, and addressed them thus: “Stop, my beloved brethren, lest mayhap
we be found to have the guilt of blood on us at the day of judgment; for it is written of men
like this, that ‘there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be
made manifest among you.’”1859 And when he had uttered these words, the crowds of people
were quieted again.1860—Now, because it was the pleasure of Marcellus that this disputation
should have a place given it,1861 and that it should also be described, I could not gainsay his
wish, but trusted to the kind consideration of the readers, believing that they would pardon
me if my discourse should sound somewhat inartistic or boorish: for the great thing which
we have had in view has been, that the means of knowing what took place on this occasion
should not fail to be brought within the reach of all who desired to understand the subject.
Thereafter, it must be added, when Manes had once taken to flight, he made his appearance
nowhere there again. His attendant Turbo, however, was handed over by Marcellus to
Archelaus; and on Archelaus ordaining him as a deacon, he remained in the suite of Marcellus.
But Manes in his flight came to a certain village which was at a considerable distance
from the city, and bore the name of Diodorus. Now in that place there was also a presbyter
whose name likewise was Diodorus,1862 a man of quiet and gentle disposition, and well reputed
both for his faith and for the excellence of his general character. Now when, on a
certain day, Manes had gathered a crowd of auditors around him, and was haranguing1863
them, and putting before the people who were present certain outlandish assertions altogether
foreign to the tradition of the fathers, and in no way apprehending any opposition that
might be made to him on the part of any of these, Diodorus perceived that he was producing

<p>40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our
parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of
the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things,
indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations
of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our
fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain
notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the
faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you,
knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured
that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the
confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge1865 from explaining these
matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any
novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word
with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary
force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also
bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I
have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by
him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand,
no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting
into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the
Scriptures.1866 In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus:
“If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be
accursed.”1867 And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by
the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.1868 But not to
make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then
maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God,
but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is
contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard
such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which
our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: “I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.”1869

<note type="footnote">1869 Matt. v. 17.</note>

<pb n="513"/>
The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we
find that He did abrogate1870 that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other
considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of
passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which
have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with
perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that
serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God
said, “I make the rich man and the poor man;”1871 while here in the Gospel Jesus called the
poor blessed,1872 and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that
he had.1873 Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians
when the people1874 fled out of Egypt;1875 whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should
lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided
in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;1876 but
that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.1877 He told us,
too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work
on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,1878 as
in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on
the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also
to take up his bed.1879 And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears
of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,1880 which yet was a thing
which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances?
For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded
with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle,
he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that
the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage
which runs thus: “In which also may God make us1881 able ministers of the New Testament;

not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the
ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,1882 was made in glory, so that the
children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance;
which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather
glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration
of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in
this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is
glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.”1883 And this passage, as you are
also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this
another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples
of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and
blood could not possess the kingdom of God.1884 He also maintained that Paul himself
spoke in his own proper person when he said: “If I build again the things which I destroyed,
I make myself a transgressor.”1885 Further, he averred that the same apostle made this
statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh, when he also said
that “he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in
the flesh,”1886 and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.1887 And again
he adduced the statement, that “Abraham has glory, but not before God;”1888 and that “by
the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.”1889 And many other things did he introduce,
with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is
sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to
bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation,
that “the law and the prophets were until John.”1890 He declared, however, that John preached
the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified
that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off,
and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these
things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have
heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which

<p>41. On receiving this epistle, Archelaus was astonished at the man’s boldness. But in
the meantime, as the case called for the transmission of a speedy reply, he immediately sent
off a letter with reference to the statements made by Diodorus. That epistle ran in the following
terms:1892—</p>
<p>Archelaus sends greeting to the presbyter Diodorus, his honourable son.</p>
<p>The receipt of your letter has rejoiced me exceedingly, my dearly beloved friend. I have
been given to understand, moreover, that this man, who made his way to me before these
days, and sought to introduce a novel kind of knowledge here, different from what is
apostolic and ecclesiastical, has also come to you. To that person, indeed, I gave no place:
for presently, when we held a disputation together, he was confuted. And I could wish now
to transcribe for your behoof all the arguments of which I made use on that occasion, so
that by means of these you might get an idea of what that man’s faith is. But as that could
be done only with leisure at my disposal, I have deemed it requisite, in view of the immediate
exigency, to write a short reply to you with reference to what you have written me on the
subject of the statements advanced by him. I understand, then, that his chief1893 effort was
directed to prove that the law of Moses is not consonant with the law of Christ; and this
position he attempted to found on the authority of our Scriptures. Well, on the other hand,
not only did we establish the law of Moses, and all things which are written in it, by the same
Scripture; but we also proved that the whole Old Testament agrees with the New Testament,
and is in perfect harmony with the same, and that they form really one texture, just as a
person may see one and the same robe made up of weft and warp together.1894 For the truth
is simply this, that just as we trace the purple in a robe, so, if we may thus express it, we can
discern the New Testament in the texture of the Old Testament; for we see the glory of the
Lord mirrored in the same.1895 We are not therefore to cast aside the mirror,1896 seeing
that it shows us the genuine image of the things themselves, faithfully and truly; but, on the
contrary, we ought to honour it all the more. Think you, indeed, that the boy who is brought

by his pædagogue to the teachers of learning1897 when he is yet a very little fellow, ought to
hold that pædagogue in no honour1898 after he has grown up to manhood, simply because
he needs his services1899 no longer, but can make his course without any assistance from
that attendant to the schools, and quickly find his way to the lecture-rooms? Or, to take
another instance, would it be right for the child who has been nourished on milk at first,
after he has grown to be capable of receiving stronger meats, then injuriously to spurn the
breasts of his nurse, and conceive a horror of them? Nay, rather he should honour and
cherish them, and confess himself a debtor to their good services. We may also make use,
if it please you, of another illustration. A certain man on one occasion having noticed an
infant exposed on the ground and already suffering excessively, picked it up, and undertook
to rear it in his own house until it should reach the age of youth, and sustained all the toils
and anxieties which are wont to fall to the lot of those who have to bring up children. After
a time, however, it happened that he who was the child’s natural father came seeking the
boy, and found him with this person who had brought him up.1900 What ought this boy to
do on learning that this is his real father? For I speak, of course, of a boy of the right type.
Would he not see to it, that he who had brought him up should be recompensed with liberal
gifts; and would he not then follow his natural father, having his proper inheritance in
view1901 Even so, then, I think we must suppose that that distinguished servant of God,
Moses, in a manner something like this, found1902 a people afflicted by the Egyptians; and
he took this people to himself, and nurtured them in the desert like a father, and instructed
them like a teacher, and ruled them as a magistrate. This people he also preserved against
the coming of him whose people they were. And after a considerable period the father1903
did come, and did receive, his sheep. Now will not that guardian be honoured in all things
by him to whom he delivered that flock; and will he not be glorified by those who have been
preserved by him? Who, then, can be so senseless, my dearly beloved Diodorus, as to say
that those are aliens to each other who have been allied with each other, who have prophesied
in turn for each other, and who have shown signs and wonders which are equal and similar,
the one to the other, and of like nature with each other;1904 or rather, to speak in truth,

which belong wholly to the same stock the one with the other? For, indeed, Moses first said
to the people: “A Prophet will the Lord our God raise up unto you, like unto me.”1905 And
Jesus afterwards said: “For Moses spake of me.”1906 You see1907 how these twain give the
right hand to each other, although1908 the one was the prophet and the other was the beloved
Son,1909 and although in the one we are to recognise the faithful servant, but in the other
the Lord Himself. Now, on the other hand, I might refer to the fact, that one who of old was
minded to make his way to the schools without the pædagogue was not taken in by the
master. For the master said: “I will not receive him unless he accepts the pædagogue.” And
who the person is, who is spoken of under that figure, I shall briefly explain. There was a
certain rich man,1910 who lived after the manner of the Gentiles, and passed his time in
great luxury every day; and there was also another man, a poor man, who was his neighbour,
and who was unable to procure even his daily bread. It happened that both these men departed
this life, that they both descended into the grave,1911 and that the poor man was
conveyed into the place of rest, and so forth, as is known to you. But, furthermore, that rich
man had also five brothers, living as he too had lived, and disturbed by no doubt as to lessons
which they had learned at home from such a master. The rich man then entreated that these
should be instructed in the superior doctrine together and at once.1912 But Abraham,
knowing that they still stood in need of the pædagogue, said to him: “They have Moses and
the prophets.” For if they received not these, so as to have their course directed by him, i.e.,
Moses, as by a pædagogue, they would not be capable of accepting the doctrine of the superior
master.</p>

<p>42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words
referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary
to Moses. And first, as to the word, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,”1913—that
is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one
cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice
and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from
simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, “The workman is worthy
of his hire.”1914 But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just1915
that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when
the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by
the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required
and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then,
to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence1916 of goodness, indeed, when
one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond
that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, “I make the
rich man and the poor man,”1917 whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.1918 Well, in that
saying Jesus did not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those
who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed1919 with pride, but have the gentle
and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to
think.1920 This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly.
For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they
are put into the treasury.1921 All too little, at the same time, is it1922 if gifts are cast into1923
the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are

also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes
beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts
from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man
says, further, that it is written, that “except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot
be my disciple.”1924 Well, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy
and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;1925
so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by
this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently,
to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable
of it; but, at the same time, to employ1926 riches for the work of righteousness and mercy,
is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the
assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;1927
for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.1928 And this, the law’s relation to the Sabbath,
was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom’s chamber, and who prepares the
same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger,
but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom’s arrival; so that when he is come, the
same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has
bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what
we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, “Can ye make the children of the bridechamber
fast so long as the bridegroom is with them?”1929 And again, He did not actually
reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead
the cause of circumcision,1930 relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting
us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.1931 For what, indeed, can it profit a man to
circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour?
He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,1932

lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our
day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear
splendid to men’s view, we should inwardly be comparable only to ravening wolves,1933 or
be likened to whited sepulchres.1934 For far above any person of that type of character is to
be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil
hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that
brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless
they happen also to be fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture
has to say on this subject: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”1935 What
need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted
with the compendious way of life,1936 and know that it shall be mine if only I can be pure
in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit,
that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and
the prophets.1937 Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us
yet clearer instruction on the subject, when he says, “Or seek ye a proof of that Christ who
speaketh in me?”1938 What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified
in uncircumcision? For it is written: “Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is
anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.”1939 Consequently, as circumcision
is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that
if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made
forthwith a transgressor1940 of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments
of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised,
and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life.
For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in
the mere ink,1941 in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.1942 Wherefore

let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses
great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses
of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthenware
in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the
productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,1943 are to be held in abhorrence
by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained
the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means1944 stand in need of that most profitless
fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be
it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on
these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle’s first
epistle.1945</p>

<p>43. I shall speak now with the utmost brevity of the veil of Moses and the ministration
of death. For I do not think that these things at least can introduce very much to the disparagement
of the law. The text in question,1946 then, proceeds thus: “But if the ministration
of death, engraven1947 in letters on the stones, was made in glory, so that the children of
Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which
glory was to be done away;”1948 and so on. Well, this passage at any rate acknowledges the
existence of a glory on the countenance of Moses, and that surely is a fact favourable to our
position. And even although it is to be done away, and although there is a veil in the reading
of the same, that does not annoy me or disturb me, provided there be glory in it still. Neither
is it the case, that whatever is to be done away is reduced thereby under all manner of circumstances
to a condition of dishonour.1949 For when the Scripture speaks of glory, it shows
us also that it had cognizance1950 of differences in glory. Thus it says: “There is one glory
of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth
from another star in glory.”1951 Although, then, the sun has a greater glory than the moon,
it does not follow that the moon is thereby reduced to a condition of dishonour. And even
thus, too, although my Lord Jesus Christ excelleth Moses in glory, as the lord excelleth the
servant, it does not follow from this that the glory of Moses is to be scorned. For in this way,
too, we are able to satisfy our hearers, as the nature of the word itself carries the conviction1952
with it in that we affirm what we allege on the authority of the Scriptures themselves,
or verily make the proof of our statements all the clearer also by illustrations taken from
them. Thus, although a person kindles a lamp in the night-time, after the sun has once risen
he has no further need of the paltry light of his lamp, on account of that effulgence of the
sun which sends forth its rays all the world over; and yet, for all that, the man does not throw
his lamp contemptuously away, as if it were something absolutely antagonistic to the sun;
but rather, when he has once found out its use, he will keep it with all the greater carefulness.
Precisely in this way, then, the law of Moses served as a sort of guardian to the people, like
the lamp, until the true Sun, who is our Saviour, should arise, even as the apostle also says

to us: “And Christ shall give thee light.”1953 We must look, however, to what is said further
on: “Their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil in the reading of
the Old Testament; it is untaken away, because it is done away in Christ.1954 For even unto
this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn
to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.”1955 What, then, is
meant by this? Is Moses present with us even unto this day? Is it the case that he has never
slept, that he has never gone to his rest, that he has never departed this life? How is it that
this phrase “unto this day” is used here? Well, only mark the veil, which is placed, where he
says it is placed, on their hearts in their reading. This, therefore, is the word of censure upon
the children of Israel, because they read Moses and yet do not understand him, and refuse
to turn to the Lord; for it is He that was prophesied of by Moses as about to come. This,
then, is the veil which was placed upon the face of Moses,1956 and this also is his testament;
1957 for he says in the law:1958 “A prince shall not be wanting from Judah, nor a leader
from his thighs,1959 until He come whose he is;1960 and He will be the expectation of the
nations: who shall bind1961 His foal unto the vine, and His ass’s colt unto the choice vine;
He shall wash His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes; His eyes shall
be suffused1962 with wine, and His teeth white with milk;” and so on. Moreover, he indicated
who He was, and whence He was to come. For he said: “The Lord God will raise up unto
you a Prophet from among your brethren, like unto me: unto Him hearken ye.”1963 Now

it is plain that this cannot be understood to have been said of Jesus the son of Nun.1964 For
there is nothing of this circumcision1965 found in him. After him, too, there have still been
kings from Judah; and consequently this prophecy is far from being applicable to him. And
this is the veil which is on Moses; for it was not, as some among the unlearned perhaps
fancy, any piece of linen cloth, or any skin that covered his face. But the apostle also takes
care to make this plain to us, when he tells us that the veil is put on in the reading of the
Old Testament, inasmuch as they who are called Israel from olden time still look for the
coming of Christ, and perceive not that the princes have been wanting from Judah, and the
leaders from his thighs; as even at present we see them in subjection to kings and princes,
and paying tribute to these, without having any power left to them either of judgment or of
punishment, such as Judah certainly had, for after he had condemned Thamar, he was able
also to justify her.1966 “But you will also see your life hang (in doubt) before your eyes.”1967</p>

<p>44. Now this word also has the veil. For up to the time of Herod they did appear to retain
a kingdom in some sort; and it was by Augustus that the first enrolment took place among
them, and that they began to pay tribute, and to be rated.1968 Now it was also from the time
when our Lord Jesus Christ began to be prophesied of and looked for that there began to
be princes from Judah and leaders of the people; and these, again, failed just at the approach
of His advent. If, then, the veil is taken away which is put on in that reading of theirs, they
will understand the true virtue of the circumcision; and they will also discover that the
generation of Him whom we preach, and His cross, and all the things that have happened
in the history of our Lord, are those very matters which had been predicted of that Prophet.
And I could wish, indeed, to examine every such passage of Scripture by itself, and to point
out its import, as it is meet that it should be understood.1969 But as it is another subject that
is now urgent, these passages shall be discussed by us at some season of leisure. For at present,
what I have already said may be sufficient for the purpose of showing, that it is not without
reason that the veil is (said to be) put upon the heart of certain persons in the reading of the
Old Testament. But those who turn to the Lord shall have the veil taken away from them.
What precise force all these things, however, may possess, I leave to the apprehension of
those who have sound intelligence. Let us come now again to that word of Moses, in which
he says: “The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet unto you, of your brethren, like unto
me.” In this saying I perceive a great prophecy delivered by the servant Moses, as by one
cognizant1970 that He who is to come is indeed to be possessed of greater authority than
himself, and nevertheless is to suffer like things with him, and to show like signs and wonders.
For there, Moses after his birth was placed by his mother in an ark, and exposed beside the
banks of the river;1971 here, our Lord Jesus Christ, after His birth by Mary His mother, was
sent off in flight into Egypt through the instrumentality of an angel.1972 There, Moses led
forth his people from the midst of the Egyptians, and saved them;1973 and here, Jesus,
leading forth His people from the midst of the Pharisees, transferred them to an eternal
salvation.1974 There, Moses sought bread by prayer, and received it from heaven, in order
that he might feed the people with it in the wilderness;1975 here, my Lord Jesus by His own

birth of Jesus, every male among the Jews suddenly perished by reason of the treachery of
Herod.1981 There, Moses prayed that Pharaoh and his people might be spared the plagues;1982
and here, our Lord Jesus prayed that the Pharisees might be pardoned, when He said,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”1983 There, the countenance of
Moses shone with the glory of the Lord, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly

entered the lists against Manes. This he did too with such spirit, that he was commended
greatly by all for the careful and satisfactory demonstration which he gave of the fact that
there is a mutual relationship between the two testaments, and also between the two laws.1996
Discovering also more arguments for himself he was able to bring forward many points of
great pertinency and power against the man, and in defence of the truth. He also reasoned
in a conclusive manner against his opponent on verbal grounds.1997 For example, he argued
with him in the following manner:—Did you say that the testaments are two? Well, then,
say either that there are two old testaments, or that there are two new testaments. For you
assert that there are two unbegottens1998 belonging to the same time, or rather eternity: and
if there are in this way two, there should be either two old testaments or two new testaments.
If, however, you do not allow this, but affirm, on the contrary, that there is one old testament
and that there is also another new testament, that will only prove again that there is but one
author for both; and the very sequence will show that the Old Testament belongs to Him
to whom also the New Testament pertains. We may illustrate this by the case of a man who
says to some other individual,1999 Lease me your old house. For by such a mode of address
does he not pronounce the man to be also the owner of a new house? Or, on the other hand,
if he says to him, Show me2000 your new house; does he not by that very word designate
him also as the possessor of an old house? Then, again, this also is to be considered, that
since there are two beings, having an unbegotten nature, it is also necessary from that to
suppose each of them to have (what must be called) an old testament, and thus there will
appear to be two old testaments; if indeed you affirm that both these beings are ancient, and
both indeed without a beginning.2001 But I have not learned doctrine like that; neither do
the Scriptures contain it. You, however, who allege that the law of Moses comes from the
prince of evil, and not from the good God, tell me who those were who withstood Moses to
the face—I mean Jamnes and Mambres?2002 For, every object that withstands, withstands

not itself, but some other one, either better or worse; as Paul also gives us to understand
when he writes in the following terms in his second Epistle to Timothy: “As Jamnes and
Mambres withstood Moses, so have these also resisted the truth: men of corrupt mind,
reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly is manifest
unto all men, as theirs also was.”2003 Do you observe how he compares Jamnes and Mambres
to men of corrupt mind, and reprobate concerning the faith; while he likens Moses, on the
other hand, to the truth? But the holy John, the greatest of the evangelists, also tells us of
the giving and diffusing of grace for grace;2004 for he indicates, indeed, that we have received
the law of Moses out of the fulness of Christ, and he means that for that one grace this other
grace has been made perfect in us through Jesus Christ. It was also to show this to be the
case that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself spake in these terms: “Do not think that I will accuse
you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye hope. For had ye
believed Moses, ye would indeed have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not
his writings, how shall ye believe my words?”2005 And besides all these words, there are still
many other passages that might be adduced both from the Apostle Paul and from the Gospels,
by which we are able to prove that the old law belongs to no other one than that Lord to
whom also the new testament appertains, and which it would suit us very well to set forth,
and to make use of in a satisfactory manner.2006 Now, however, the evening prevents us
from doing so; for the day is drawing to its close, and it is right that we should now bring
our disputation to an end. But an opportunity will be given you to-morrow to put questions
to us on any points you are pleased to take up. And after these words they went their way.2007</p>

<p>46. Next morning, however, Archelaus suddenly made his appearance at this residence2008
in which Diodorus was staying, before any one was yet stirring abroad. Manes accordingly,
all unconscious of the fact that Archelaus was now on the spot again, challenged
Diodorus publicly to engage in a disputation with him; his intention being to crush him
with a verbal display, because he perceived that he was a man of a simple nature, and not
very deeply learned in questions concerning the Scriptures. For he had now had a taste of
the doctrine of Archelaus. When, therefore, the multitudes had again collected in the place
usually set apart for the disputation, and when Manes had just begun to reason, all on a
sudden Archelaus appeared among them, and embraced Diodorus, and saluted him with
an holy kiss. Then truly were Diodorus, and all those who were present, filled with wonder
at the dispensation of divine providence which thus provided that Archelaus should arrive
among them at the very time when the question was just raised; for in reality, as must be
confessed, Diodorus, with all his religiousness, had been somewhat afraid of the conflict.
But when Manes caught sight of Archelaus, he at once drew back from his insulting attitude;
and with his pride cast down not a little, he made it quite plain that he would gladly flee
from the contest. The multitude of hearers, however, looked upon the arrival of Archelaus
as something like the advent of an apostle, because he had shown himself so thoroughly
furnished, and so prompt and ready for a defence of the truth by speech. Accordingly, after
demanding silence from the people by a wave of his right hand,—for no inconsiderable tumult
had arisen,—Archelaus began an address in the following terms:—Although some amongst
us have gained the honour of wisdom and the meed of glory, yet this I beg of you, that you
retain in your minds the testimony of those things which have been said before my arrival.2009
For I know and am certain, brethren, that I now take the place of Diodorus, not on account
of any impossibilities attaching to him,2010 but because I came to know this person here at
a previous time, when he made his way with his wicked designs into the parts where I reside,
by the favour of Marcellus,2011 that man of illustrious name, whom he endeavoured to turn
aside from our doctrine and faith, with the object, to wit, of making him an effective supporter
of this impious teaching. Nevertheless, in spite of all his plausible addresses, he failed
to move him or turn him aside from the faith in any one particular. For this most devout
Marcellus was only found to be like the rock on which the house was built with the most

solid foundations; and when the rain descended, and the floods and the winds burst in and
beat upon that house, it stood firm: for it had been built on the most solid and immoveable
foundations.2012 And the attempt thus made by this person who is now before you, brought
dishonour rather than glory upon himself. Moreover, it does not seem to me that he can be
very excusable if he proves to be ignorant of what is in the future; for surely he ought to
know beforehand those who are on his own side: certainly he should have this measure of
knowledge, if it be true indeed that the Spirit of the Paraclete dwells in him. But inasmuch
as he is really a person blinded with the darkness of ignorance, he ran in vain when he
journeyed to Marcellus, and he did but show himself to be like the stargazer,2013 who busies
himself with describing things celestial, while all the time he is ignorant of what is passing
in his own home. But lest it should appear as if I were setting aside the question in hand by
speaking in this strain, I shall now refrain from such discourse. And I shall also give this
man the privilege of taking up any point which may suit him best as a commencement to
any treatment of the subject and the question. And to you, as I have said already, I only address
the request that ye be impartial judges, so as to give to him who speaks the truth the
proper honour and the palm.</p>

<p>47. Then Manes, after silence had been secured among all, thus began his address: Like
others, Archelaus, you too smite me with the most injurious words, notwithstanding that
my sentiments on the subject of God are correct, and that I hold also a proper conception
of Christ; and yet the family of the apostles is rather of the character that bears all things
and endures all things, even although a man may assail them with revilings and curses. If it
is your intention to persecute me, I am prepared for it: and if you wish to involve me in
punishment, I shall not shrink from it; yea, if you mean even to put me to death, I am not
afraid: “For we ought to fear Him only who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”2014
Archelaus said: Far be that from me! Not such is my intention. For what have you ever had
to suffer at my hands, or at the hands of those who think with us, even when you were disparaging
us and doing us injury, and when you were speaking in detraction of the traditions
of our fathers, and when it was your aim to work the death of the souls of men that were
well established in the truth, and that were kept with the most conscientious carefulness;
for which, in truth, the whole wealth of the world would not sere as a sufficient compensation?
2015 Nevertheless, what ground have you for assuming this position? What have you
to show? Tell us this,—what signs of salvation have you to bring before us? For the bare
bravado of words will not avail to satisfy the multitude here present, neither will it be enough
to qualify them for recognising which of us holds the knowledge of the truth the more correctly.
Wherefore, as you have got the opportunity of speaking first, tell us first to what
particular head of the subject you wish us to direct the disputation. Manes said: If you do
not offer a second time an unfair resistance to the positions which shall be stated with all
due propriety by us, I shall speak with you; but if you mean to show yourself still in the
character which on a former occasion I perceived you to take up, I shall address myself to
Diodorus, and shall keep clear of your turbulence. Archelaus said: I have already expressed
my opinion that we shall be simply abusing the occasion by the mere bandying of empty
words. If any one on one side is found to offer an unfair resistance, leave that to the decision
of the judges. But now, tell us what you have got to advance. Manes said: If you do not mean
a second time merely to gainsay the positions which are stated with all due correctness by
me, I shall begin. Archelaus said: “If not this,” and “if not that,” are ways of speaking which
mark out an ignorant man. You are ignorant, therefore, of what is in the future. But as to
this particular thing which you do declare to be still future, to gainsay or not to gainsay is
a matter in my own power. How, then, will that argument about the two trees stand, in
which you place your trust as in a buckler of the most approved strength? For if I am of the
<note type="footnote">2014 Matt. x. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">2015 The text is, “quibus utique repensari non possunt,” etc. Routh proposes repensare.</note>

<pb n="534"/>
contrary side, how do you require my obedience? And if, on the other hand, there is in me
the disposition of obedience, how are you so greatly alarmed lest I should gainsay you? For
you maintain that evil remains evil always, and that good remains good always, in utter ignorance
of the force of your words. Manes said: Have I employed you as the advocate of my
words, so that you may determine also the intelligence that may suit my knowledge? And
how will you be able to explain what belongs to another person, when you cannot make
what pertains to yourself clear? But if Diodorus now admits himself to be vanquished, my
reasonings will then be addressed to you. If, however, he still stands out, and is prepared to
speak, I beg you to give over and cease from interfering with the substantiating of the truth.
For you are a strange sheep; nevertheless hereafter you will be introduced into the number
of the same flock, as the voice of Jesus2016 also intimates,—that Jesus, namely, who appeared
in the form of man indeed, and yet was not a man. Archelaus said: Are you not, then, of
opinion that He was born of the Virgin Mary? Manes said: God forbid that I should admit
that our Lord Jesus Christ came down to us through the natural womb of a woman! For He
gives us His own testimony that He came down from the Father’s bosom;2017 and again He
says, “He that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me;”2018 and, “I came not to do mine
own will, but the will of Him that sent me;”2019 and once more, “I am not sent but unto the
lost sheep of the house of Israel.”2020 And there are also innumerable other passages of a
similar import, which point Him out as one that came, and not as one that was born. But if
you are greater than He, and if you know better than He what is true, how do we yet believe
Him? Archelaus said: Neither am I greater than He, for I am His servant nor can I be even
the equal of my Lord, for I am His unprofitable servant; I am a disciple of His words, and I
believe those things which have been spoken by Him, and I affirm that they are unchangeable.
Manes said: A certain person somewhat like you once said to Him, “Mary Thy mother, and
Thy brethren, stand without;”2021 and He took not the word kindly, but rebuked the person
who had uttered it, saying, “Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?” And He showed
that those who did His will were both His mothers and His brethren. If you, however, mean
to say that Mary was actually His mother, you place yourself in a position of considerable
peril. For, without any doubt, it would be proved on the same principles that He had brethren
also by her. Now tell me whether these brethren were begotten by Joseph or by the same
Holy Spirit. For if you say that they were begotten by the same Holy Spirit, it will follow that

we have had many Christs. And if you say that these were not begotten by the same Holy
Spirit, and yet aver that He had brethren, then without doubt we shall be under the necessity
of understanding that, in succession to the Spirit and after Gabriel, the most pure and
spotless virgin2022 formed an actual marriage connection with Joseph. But if this is also a
thing altogether absurd—I mean the supposition that she had any manner of intercourse
with Joseph—tell me whether then He had brethren. Are you thus to fix the crime of adultery
also on her, most sagacious Marcellus?2023 But if none of these suppositions suits the position
of the Virgin undefiled, how will you make it out that He had brothers? And if you are unable
to prove clearly to us that He had brethren, will it be any the easier for you to prove Mary
to be His mother, in accordance with the saying of him who ventured to write,2024 “Behold,
Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without?” Yet, although that man was bold enough to
address Him thus, no one can be mightier or greater than this same person Himself who
shows us His mother or His brethren. Nay, He does not deign even to hear it said that He
is David’s son.2025 The Apostle Peter, however, the most eminent of all the disciples, was
able to acknowledge Him on that occasion, when all were putting forth the several opinions
which they entertained respecting Him: for he said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God;”2026 and immediately He names him blessed, addressing him thus: “For my
heavenly Father hath revealed it unto thee.” Observe what a difference there is between
these two words which were spoken by Jesus. For to him who had said, “Behold, Thy
mother stands without,” He replied, “Who is my mother, or who are my brethren?” But to
him who said, “Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God,” He makes the return of a
beatitude and benediction. Consequently, if you will have it that He was born of Mary, then
it follows that no less than Peter, He is Himself thus proved to have spoken falsely. But if,
on the other hand, Peter states what is true, then without doubt that former person was in

<p>48. On hearing these statements, the multitudes assembled were greatly moved, as if
they felt that these reasonings gave the correct account of the truth, and that Archelaus
could have nothing to urge against them; for this was indicated by the commotion which
arose among them. But when the crowd of auditors became quiet again, Archelaus made
answer in the following manner: No one, truly, shall ever be able to prove himself mightier
than the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ, neither is there found any name equal to His, as it
is written: “Wherefore God hath exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every
name.”2029 Nor, again, in the matter of testimony can any one ever be equal to Him; and
accordingly I shall simply adduce the testimonies of His own voice in answer to you,—first
of all, indeed, with the view of solving those difficulties which have been enunciated by you,
so that you may not say, as is your wont to do, that these are matters which are not in harmony
with the Person Himself.2030 Now, you maintain that the man who brought the word
to Jesus about His mother and His brethren was rebuked by Him as if he was in error, as
the writer was in error.2031 Well, I affirm that neither was this person rebuked who brought
Him the message about His mother and His brethren, nor was Peter only named blessed
above him; but each of these two parties received from Him the answer that was properly
called forth by their several utterances, as the discourse will demonstrate in what follows.
When one is a child, he thinks as a child, he speaks as a child; but when he becomes a mature
man, those things are to be done away which are proper for a child:2032 in other words,
when one reaches forth unto those things which are before, he will forget those which are
behind.2033 Hence, when our Lord Jesus Christ was engaged in teaching and healing the
race of men, so that all pertaining to it might not utterly perish together, and when the minds
of all those who were listening to Him were intently occupied with these interests, it made
an interruption altogether inopportune when this messenger came in and put Him in mind
of His mother and His brethren. What then? Ought He, now,2034 yourself being judge,2035
to have left those whom He was healing and instructing, and gone to speak with His mother
and His brethren? Would you not by such a supposition at once lower the character of the
Person Himself? When, again, He chose certain men who were laden and burdened with

sins for the honour of discipleship,2036 to the number of twelve, whom He also named His
apostles, He gave them this injunction, Leave father and mother, that you may be made
worthy of me;2037 intending by this that thence forward the memory of father or mother
should no more impair the stedfastness of their heart. And on another occasion, when a
different individual chose to say to Him, “I will go and bury my father,” He answered, “Let
the dead bury their dead.”2038 Behold, then, how my Lord Jesus Christ edifies His disciples
unto all things necessary, and delivers His sacred words to every one, in due accordance
with what is meet for him. And just in the same way, too, on this other occasion, when a
certain person came in with the inconsiderate message about His mother, He did not embrace
the occurrence as an opportunity for leaving His Father’s commission unattended to even
for the sake of having His mother with Him. But in order to show you still more clearly that
this is the real account of the matter, let me remind you that Peter, on a certain season,
subsequent to the time of his receiving that declaration of blessedness from Him, said to
Jesus, “Be it far from Thee, Lord:2039 this shall not be unto Thee.”2040 This he said after Jesus
had announced to him that the Son of man must go up to Jerusalem, and be killed, and rise
again the third day.2041 And in answer then to Peter He said: “Get thee behind me, Satan;
for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.”2042 Now, since
it is your opinion that the man who brought the message about His mother and His brethren
was rebuked by Jesus, and that he who said a little before, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the living God,” obtained the word of blessing, mark you that Jesus (may be said to have)
rather preferred that person to whom He condescended to give the more gracious and indulgent
answer; whereas Peter, even after that benediction, now got no appellation expressive
of indulgence addressed to him, by reason of his having failed carefully to observe the nature
of the announcement that was made to him. For the error of that messenger was at once
corrected by the tenor of the reply; but the dulness of this apostle’s apprehension was condemned
with a severer rebuke. And from this you may perceive that the Lord Jesus, observing
what was proper and opportune with regard to the interrogations thus addressed to Him,
gave to each the reply that was worthy of it, and suited to it. But supposing that, as you say,

Peter was pronounced blessed on the ground of his having said what was true, and that that
messenger was reproved on account of the error he committed, tell me then why it is, that
when the devils confessed Him, and said, “We know Thee, who Thou art, the holy God,”2043
He rebuked them, and commanded them to be silent?2044 Why was it not the case, if He
does indeed take pleasure in the testimonies borne to Him by those who confess Him, that
He recompensed them also with benedictions, as He did to Peter when he gave utterance
to the truth? But if that would be an absurd supposition, it only remains that we must understand
the words spoken by Him always in accordance with the place, the time, the persons,
the subjects, and the due consideration of the circumstances.2045 For only this method will
save us from falling into the error of pronouncing rashly on His sayings, and thus making
ourselves liable to merited chastisement: and this will also help me to make it more and
more intelligible to you, that the man who brought the tidings of His mother was much
rather the person honoured.2046 However, in forgetfulness of the subject which was proposed
to us for discussion, you have turned off to a different theme. Nevertheless listen to me for
a brief space. For if you choose, indeed, to consider those words somewhat more carefully,
we shall find that the Lord Jesus displayed great clemency in the case of the former of these
two parties; and this I shall prove to you by illustrations suited to your capacity. A certain
king who had taken up arms, and gone forth to meet an enemy, was earnestly considering
and planning how he might subdue those hostile and foreign forces. And when his mind
was occupied with many cares and anxieties, after he had forced his way among his adversaries,
and when, further, as he began afterwards to make captives of them, the anxious thought
was now also pressing upon him as to how he might secure the safety and interests of those
who had toiled with him, and borne the burden of the war,2047 a certain messenger broke
inopportunely in upon him, and began to remind him of domestic matters. But he was astonished
at the man’s boldness, and at his unseasonable suggestions, and thought of delivering
such a fellow over to death. And had that messenger not been one who was able to
appeal to his tenderest affections in bringing the news that it was well with those at home,
and that all went on prosperously and successfully there, that punishment might have been
his instant and well-merited doom. For what else should be a king’s care, so long as the time
of war endures, than to provide for the safety of the people of his province, and to look after

military matters? And even thus it also was that that messenger came inopportunely in upon
my Lord Jesus Christ, and brought the report about His mother and His brethren unseasonably,
just when He was fighting against ills which had assailed the very citadel of the heart,
and when He was healing those who for a long time had been under the power of diverse
infirmities, and when He had now put forth His utmost effort to secure the salvation of all.
And truly that man might have met with a sentence like that pronounced on Peter, or even
one severer still. But the hearing of the name of His mother and His brethren drew forth
His clemency.</p>

<p>49. But in addition to all that has been said already, I wish to adduce still further proof,
so that all may understand what impiety is contained in this assertion of yours. For if your
allegation is true, that He was not born, then it will follow undoubtedly that He did not
suffer; for it is not possible for one to suffer who was not also born. But if He did not suffer,
then the name of the cross is done away with. And if the cross was not endured, then Jesus
did not rise from the dead. And if Jesus rose not from the dead, then no other person will
rise again. And if no one shall rise again, then there will be no judgment. For it is certain
that, if I am not to rise again, I cannot be judged. But if there is to be no judgment, then the
keeping of God’s commandments will be to no purpose, and there will be no occasion for
abstinence: nay, we may say, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.”2048 For all
these consequences follow when you deny that He was born of Mary. But if you acknowledge
that He was born of Mary, then His passion will necessarily follow, and His resurrection
will be consequent on His passion, and the judgment on His resurrection: and thus the injunctions
of Scripture will have their proper value2049 for us. This is not therefore an idle
question, but there are the mightiest issues involved in this word. For just as all the law and
the prophets are summed up in two words, so also all our hope is made to depend on the
birth by the blessed Mary. Give me therefore an answer to these several questions which I
shall address to you. How shall we get rid of these many words of the apostle, so important
and so precise, which are expressed in terms like the following: “But when the good pleasure
of God was with us, He sent His Son, made of a woman;”2050 and again, “Christ our passover
is sacrificed for us;”2051 and once more, “God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise
up us together with Him by His own power?”2052 And there are many other passages of a
similar import; as, for example, this which follows: “How say some among you,2053 that
there is no resurrection of the dead? For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not
Christ risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. Yea, and we shall be
found false witnesses of God; who have testified against God that He raised up Christ: whom
He raised not up. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not raised,

your2054 faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ
are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men.
But now is Christ risen from the dead, the beginning2055 of them that sleep;”2056 and so on.
Who, then, I ask, can be found so rash and audacious as not to make his faith fit in with
these sacred words, in which there is no qualification2057 nor any dubiety? Who, I ask you,
O foolish Galatian, has bewitched you, as those were bewitched “before whose eyes Jesus
Christ was evidently set forth, crucified?”2058 From all this I think that these testimonies
should suffice in proof of the judgment, and the resurrection, and the passion; and the birth
by Mary is also shown to be involved naturally and at once in these facts. And what matters
it though you refuse to acquiesce in this, when the Scripture proclaims the fact most unmistakeably?
Nevertheless I shall again put a question to you, and let it please you to give me
an answer. When Jesus gave His testimony concerning John, and said, “Among them that
are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding,
he that is less2059 in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,”2060 tell me what is meant
by there being a greater than he in the kingdom of heaven. Was Jesus less in the kingdom
of heaven than John? I say, God forbid! Tell me, then, how this is to be explained, and you
will certainly surpass yourself. Without doubt the meaning is, that Jesus was less than John
among those that are born of woman; but in the kingdom of heaven He is greater than
he.2061 Wherefore tell me this too, O Manichæus: If you say that Christ was not born of
Mary, but that He only appeared like a man, while yet He was not really a man, the appearance
being effected and produced by the power that is in Him, tell me, I repeat, on whom
then was it that the Spirit descended like a dove? Who is this that was baptized by John? If
He was perfect, if He was the Son, if He was the Power, the Spirit could not have entered
into Him;2062 just as a kingdom cannot enter within a kingdom. And whose, too, was that

<p>50. Manes said: No one, certainly, who may be able to give a reply to what has just been
alleged by you need fear incurring the guilt of blasphemy, but should rather be deemed
thoroughly worthy of all commendation. For a true master of his art,2066 when any matters
are brought under his notice, ought to prepare his reply with due care, and make all clearly
to understand the points that are in question or under doubt; and most especially ought he
to do so to uninstructed persons. Now since the account of our doctrine does not satisfy
you, be pleased, like a thorough master of your art, to solve this question also for me in a
reasonable manner. For to me it seems but pious to say that the Son of God stood in need
of nothing whatsoever in the way of making good His advent upon earth; and that He in
no sense required either the dove, or baptism, or mother, or brethren, or even mayhap a
father,—which father, however, according to your view, was Joseph; but that He descended
altogether by Himself alone, and transformed Himself, according to His own good pleasure,
into the semblance of a man, in accordance with that word of Paul which tells us that “He
was found in fashion as a man.”2067 Show me, therefore, what thing He could possibly need
who was able to transform Himself into all manner of appearances. For when He chose to
do so, He again transformed this human fashion2068 and mien into the likeness of the sun.
But if you gainsay me once more, and decline to acknowledge that I state the faith correctly,
listen to my definition of the position in which you stand. For if you say that He was only
man as born of Mary,2069 and that He received the Spirit at His baptism, it will follow that
He will be made out to be Son by increase2070 and not by nature. If, however, I grant you
to say that He is Son according to increase,2071 and that He was made as a man, your opinion
is that He is really a man, that is to say, one who is flesh and blood.2072 But then it will necessarily
follow that the Spirit also who appeared like a dove was nothing else than a natural
dove. For the two expressions are the same,—namely, “as a man” and “like2073 a dove;” and
consequently whatever may be the view you take of the one passage which uses the phrase
“as a man,” you ought to hold that same view2074 also of this other passage in which the
expression “like a dove” is used. It is a clear matter of necessity to take these things in the

same way, for only thus can we find out the real sense of what is written concerning Him
in the Scriptures. Archelaus said: As you cannot do so much for yourself, like a thorough
master of your art, so neither should I care to put this question right and with all patience
to make it clear, and to give the evident solution of the difficulty,2075 were it not for the sake
of those who are present with us, and who listen to us. For this reason, therefore, I shall also
explain the answer that ought to be given to this question as it may be done most appropriately.
It does not seem to you, then, to be a pious thing to say that Jesus had a mother in
Mary; and you hold a similar view on certain other positions which you have now been
discussing in terms which I, for my part, altogether shrink from repeating.2076 Now,
sometimes a master of any art happens to be compelled by the ignorance of an opponent
both to say and to do things which time would make him decline;2077 and accordingly, because
the necessity is laid upon me, by consideration for the multitude present, I may give
a brief answer to those statements which have been made so erroneously by you. Let us
suppose, now, your allegation to be that if we understand Jesus to be a man made of Mary
after the course of nature, and regard him consequently as having flesh and blood, it will
be necessary also to hold that the Holy Spirit was a real dove, and not a spirit. Well, then,
how can a real dove enter into a real man, and abide in him? For flesh cannot enter into
flesh. Nay rather, it is only when we acknowledge Jesus to be a true man, and also hold him
who is there said to be like a dove to be the Holy Spirit, that we shall give the correct account
according to reason on both sides. For, according to right reason, it may be said that the
Spirit dwells in a man, and descends upon him, and abides in him; and these, indeed, are
things which have happened already in all due competence, and the occurrence of which is
always possible still, as even you yourself admit, inasmuch as you did aforetime profess to
be the Paraclete of God, you flint,2078 as I may call you, and no man, so often forgetful of
the very things which you assert. For you declared that the Spirit whom Jesus promised to
send has come upon you; and whence can He come but by descending from Heaven? And
if the Spirit descends thus on the man worthy of Him, then verily must we fancy that real
doves descended upon you? Then truly should we rather discover in you the thieving dove-

merchant,2079 who lays snares and lines for the birds. For surely you well deserve to be made
a jest of with words of ridicule. However, I spare you, lest perchance I appear to offend the
auditors by such expressions, and also most especially because it is beside my purpose to
throw out against you all that you deserve to hear said about you. But let me return to the
proper subject. For I am mindful of that transformation of thine,2080 in virtue of which you
say that God has transformed Himself into the fashion of a man or into that of the sun, by
which position you think to prove that our Jesus was made man only in fashion and in appearance;
which assertion may God save any of the faithful from making. Now, for the rest,
that opinion of yours would reduce the whole matter to a dream, so far as we are concerned,
and to mere figures; and not that only,2081 but the very name of an advent would be done
away: for He might have done what He desired to do, though still seated in heaven, if He is,
as you say, a spirit, and not a true man. But it is not thus that “He humbled Himself, and
took the form of a servant;”2082 and I say this of Him who was made man of Mary. For
what? Might not we, too, have set forth things like those with which you have been dealing,
and that, too, all the more easily and the more broadly? But far be it from us to swerve one
jot or one tittle from the truth. For He who was born of Mary is the Son, who chose of His
own accord to sustain this2083 mighty conflict,—namely, Jesus. This is the Christ of God,
who descended upon him who is of Mary. If, however, you refuse to believe even the voice
that was heard from heaven, all that you can bring forward in place of the same is but some
rashness of your own; and though you were to declare yourself on that, no one would believe
you. For forthwith Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil;
and as the devil had no correct knowledge of Him, he said to Him, “If thou be the Son of
God.”2084 Besides, he did not understand the reason of this bearing of the Son of God by
Mary, who preached the kingdom of heaven, whose was also indeed a great tabernacle,2085
and one that could not have been prepared by any other:2086 whence, too, He who was

nailed to the cross, on rising again from the dead, was taken up thither where Christ the
Son of God reigned; so that when He begins to conduct His judgment, those who have been
ignorant of Him shall look on Him whom they pierced.2087 But in order to secure your
credence, I propose this question to you: Why was it, that although His disciples sojourned
a whole year with Him, not one of them fell prostrate on his face before Him, as you were
saying a little ago, save only in that one hour when His countenance shone like the sun?
Was it not by reason of that tabernacle which had been made for Him of Mary? For just as
no other had the capacity sufficient for sustaining the burden of the Paraclete except only
the disciples and the blessed Paul, so also no other was able to bear the Spirit who descended
from heaven, and through whom that voice of the Father gave its testimony in these terms,
“This is my beloved Son,”2088 save only He who was born of Mary, and who is above all the
saints,—namely, Jesus. But now give us your answer to those matters which I bring forward
against you. If you hold that He is man only in mien and form, how could He have been
laid hold of and dragged off to judgment by those who were born of man and woman—to
wit, the Pharisees—seeing that a spiritual body cannot be grasped by bodies of grosser capacities?
But if you, who as yet have made no reply to the arguments brought before you, have
now any kind of answer to offer to the word and proposition I have adduced, proceed, I
pray you, and fetch me at least a handful or some fair modicum of your sunlight.2089 But
that very sun, indeed, inasmuch as it is possessed of a more subtle body, is capable of covering
and enveloping you; while you, on the other hand, can do it no injury, even although you
were to trample it under foot. My Lord Jesus, however, if He was laid hold of, was laid hold
of as a man by men. If He is not a man, neither was He laid hold of. If He was not laid hold
of, neither did He suffer, nor was He baptized. If He was not baptized, neither is any of us
baptized. But if there is no baptism, neither will there be any remission of sins, but every
man will die in his own sins. Manes said: Is baptism, then, given on account of the remission
of sins? Archelaus said: Certainly. Manes said: Does it not follow, then, that Christ has sinned,
seeing that He has been baptized? Archelaus said: God forbid! Nay, rather, He was made
sin for us, taking on Him our sins.2090 For this reason He was born of a woman, and for
this reason also He approached the rite of baptism, in order that He might receive the
purification of this part,2091 and that thus the body which He had taken to Himself might
be capable of bearing the Spirit, who had descended in the form of a dove.</p>

<p>51. When Archelaus had finished this speech, the crowds of people marvelled at the
truth of his doctrine, and expressed their vehement commendations of the man with loud
outcries, so that they exerted themselves most energetically, and would have kept him from
his return.2092 Thereafter, however, they withdrew. After some time, again, when they were
gathered together, Archelaus persuaded them to accede to his desire, and listen quietly to
the word. And among his auditors were not only those who were with Diodorus, but also
all who were present from his province and from the neighbouring districts. When silence,
then, was secured, Archelaus proceeded to speak to them of Manes in the following manner:
You have heard, indeed, what is the character of the doctrine which we teach, and you have
got some proof of our faith; for I have expounded the Scriptures before you all, precisely in
accordance with the views which I myself have been able to reach in studying them. But I
entreat you now to listen to me in all silence, while I speak with the utmost possible brevity,
with the view of giving you to understand who this person is who has made his appearance
among us, and whence he comes, and what character he has, exactly as a certain man of the
name of Sisinius, one2093 of his comrades, has indicated the facts to me; which individual2094
I am also prepared, if it please you, to summon in evidence of the statements I am about to
make. And, in truth, this person did not decline to affirm the very same facts which we now
adduce,2095 even when Manes was present; for the above-mentioned individual became a
believer of our doctrine, as did also another person who was with me, named Turbo. Accordingly,
all that these parties have conveyed in their testimony to me, and also all that we
ourselves have discovered in the man, I shall not suffer to be kept back from your cognizance.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, the multitudes became all the more excited, and crowded together to
listen to Archelaus; for, in good sooth, the statements which were made by him offered them
the greatest enjoyment. Accordingly, they earnestly urged him to tell them all that he pleased,
and all that he had on his mind; and they declared themselves ready to listen to him there
and then, and engaged to stay on even to the evening, and until the lights should be lit.</p>
<p>Stimulated therefore by their heartiness, Archelaus began his address with all confidence
in the following terms:—My brethren, you have heard, indeed, the primary causes2096 relating
to my Lord Jesus,—I mean those which are decided out of the law and the prophets; and of
the subsidiary causes also relating to my Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, you are not ignorant.

Christians, as the whole world itself attests, and as the apostles also plainly declare. Yea,
further, that best master-builder of His, Paul himself,2097 has laid our foundation,2098 that
is, the foundation of the Church and has put us in trust of the law, ordaining ministers, and
presbyters,2099 and bishops in the same, and describing in the places severally assigned to
that purpose, in what manner and with what character the ministers of God ought to conduct
themselves, of what repute the presbyters ought to be possessed, and how they should be
constituted, and what manner of persons those also ought to be who desire the office of
bishop.2100 And all these institutions, which were once settled well and rightly for us, preserve
their proper standing and order with us to this day, and the regular administration of these
rules abides amongst us still. But as to this fellow, Manes by name, who has at present burst
boastfully forth upon us from the province of Persia, and between whom and me disputation
has now for the second time been stirred, I shall tell you about his lineage, and that, too, in
all fulness; and I shall also show you most lucidly the source from which his doctrine has
descended. This man is neither the first nor the only originator of this type of doctrine. But
a certain person belonging to Scythia, bearing the name Scythianus,2101 and living in the
time of the apostles, was the founder and leader of this sect, just as many other apostates
have constituted themselves founders and leaders, who from time to time, through the
ambitious desire of arrogating positions of superior importance to themselves, have given
out falsehoods for the truth, and have perverted the simpler class of people to their own
lustful appetencies, on whose names and treacheries, however, time does not permit us at
present to descant. This Scythianus, then, was the person who introduced this self-contradictory
dualism; and for that, too, he was himself indebted to Pythagoras, as also all the
other followers of this dogma have been, who all uphold the notion of a dualism, and turn
aside from the direct course of Scripture: but they shall not gain any further success therein.</p>

of these tenets as this Scythianus. For he introduced the notion of a feud between the two
unbegottens, and all those other fancies which are the consequences of a position of that

certain captive from the Upper Thebaid, who persuaded him to dwell in Egypt rather than
in the deserts. And would that he had never been received by that province, in which, as he
dwelt in it for a period, he found the opportunity for learning the wisdom of the Egyptians!
2102 for, to speak truth, he was a person of very decided talent, and also of very liberal
means, as those who knew him have likewise testified in accounts transmitted to us.
Moreover, he had a certain disciple named Terebinthus,2103 who wrote four books for him.
To the first of these books he gave the title of the Mysteries, to the second that of the
Heads,2104 to the third that of the Gospel, and to the last of all that of the Treasury.2105 He
had these four books, and this one disciple whose name was Terebinthus. As, then, these
two persons had determined to reside alone by themselves for a considerable period,
Scythianus thought of making an excursion into Judea, with the purpose of meeting with
all those who had a reputation there as teachers; but it came to pass that he suddenly departed
this life soon after that, without having been able to accomplish anything. That disciple,
moreover, who had sojourned with him had to flee,2106 and made his way toward Babylonia,
a province which at present is held2107 by the Persians, and which is distant now a journey
of about six days and nights from our parts. On arriving there, Terebinthus succeeded in

made here as to these books being written by Terebinthus is not in accordance with statements made by Cyril

in his Die Stupa’s, etc., p. 29 thinks that it is a Græcized form of a predicate of Buddha, viz., Tere-hintu, Lord of
the Hindoos. Others take it simply to be a translation of the Hebrew הלָא ”, the terebinth.See a note on this

giving currency to a wonderful account of himself, declaring that he was replete with all the
wisdom of the Egyptians, and that he was really named now, not Terebinthus, but another
Buddas,2108 and that this designation had been put upon him. He asserted further that he
was the son of a certain virgin, and that he had been brought up by an angel2109 on the
mountains. A certain prophet, however, of the name of Parcus, and Labdacus the son of
Mithras,2110 charged2111 him with falsehood, and day after day unceasingly they had keen
and elevated contentions2112 on this subject. But why should I speak of that at length? Although
he was often reproved, he continued, nevertheless, to make declarations to them on
matters which were antecedent to the world,2113 and on the sphere, and the two luminaries;
and also on the question whither and in what manner the souls depart, and in what mode
they return again into the bodies; and he made many other assertions of this nature, and
others even worse than these,—as, for instance, that war was raised with God among the
elements,2114 that the prophet himself might be believed. However, as he was hard pressed
for assertions like these, he betook himself to a certain widow, along with his four books:
for he had attached to himself no disciple in that same locality, with the single exception of
an old woman who became an intimate of his.2115 Then,2116 on a subsequent occasion, at
the earliest dawn one morning, he went up to the top2117 of a certain house, and there began
to invoke certain names, which Turbo has told us only the seven elect have learned. He ascended
to the housetop, then, with the purpose of engaging in some religious ceremony, or
some art of his own; and he went up alone, so as not to be detected by any one:2118 for he

considered that, if he was convicted of playing false with, or holding of little account, the
religious beliefs of the people, he would be liable to be punished by the real princes of the
country. And as he was revolving these things then in his mind, God in His perfect justice
decreed that he should be thrust beneath earth by a spirit;2119 and forthwith he was cast
down from the roof of the house; and his body, being precipitated lifeless to the ground,
was taken up in pity by the old woman mentioned above, and was buried in the wonted

<p>53. After this event all the effects which he had brought with him from Egypt remained
in her possession. And she rejoiced greatly over his death, and that for two reasons: first,
because she did not regard his arts with satisfaction; and secondly, because she had obtained
such an inheritance, for it was one of great value.2120 But as she was all alone, she bethought
herself of having some one to attend her; and she got for that purpose a boy of about seven
years of age, named Corbicius,2121 to whom she at once gave his freedom, and whom she
also instructed in letters. When this boy had reached his twelfth year the old woman died,
and left to him all her possessions, and among other things those four books which Scythianus
had written, each of them consisting of a moderate number of lines.2122 When his mistress
was once buried, Corbicius began to make his own use of all the property that had been left
him. Abandoning the old locality, he took up his abode in the middle of the city, where the
king of Persia had his residence; and there altering his name, he called himself Manes instead
of Corbicius, or, to speak more correctly, not Manes, but Mani:2123 for that is the kind of
inflection employed in the Persian language. Now, when this boy had grown to be a man
of well-nigh sixty years of age,2124 he had acquired great erudition in all the branches of
learning taught in those parts, and I might almost say that in these he surpassed all others.
Nevertheless he had been a still more diligent student of the doctrines contained in these
four books; and he had also gained three disciples, whose names were Thomas, Addas, and
Hermas. Then, too, he took these books, and transcribed2125 them in such wise that he introduced
into them much new matter which was simply his own, and which can be likened
only to old wives’ fables. Those three disciples, then, he thus had attached to him as conscious
participants in his evil counsels; and he gave, moreover, his own name to the books, and
deleted the name of their former owner, as if he had composed them all by himself. Then
it seemed good to him to send his disciples, with the doctrines which he had committed to
writing in the books, into the upper districts of that province, and through various cities
and villages, with the view of securing followers. Thomas accordingly determined to take
possession of the regions of Egypt, and Addas those of Scythia, while Hermas alone chose
to remain with the man himself. When these, then, had set out on their course, the king’s
son was seized with a certain sickness; and as the king was very anxious to see him cured,
he published a decree offering a large reward, and engaging to bestow it upon any one who

should prove himself capable of restoring the prince.2126 On the report of this, all at
haphazard, like the men who are accustomed to play the game of cubes, which is another
name for the dice,2127 Manes presented himself before the king, declaring that he would
cure the boy. And when the king heard that, he received him courteously, and welcomed
him heartily. But not utterly to weary my hearers with the recital of the many things which
he did, let me simply say that the boy died, or rather was bereft of life, in his hands. Then
the king ordered Manes to be thrust into prison, and to be loaded with chains of iron
weighing half a hundredweight.2128 Moreover, those two disciples of his who had been sent
to inculcate his doctrine among the different cities were also sought for with a view to
punishment. But they took to flight, without ever ceasing,2129 however, to introduce into
the various localities which they visited that teaching of theirs which is so alien to the faith,
and which has been inspired only by Antichrist.</p>

<p>54. But after these events they returned to their master, and reported what had befallen
them; and at the same thee they got an account of the numerous ills which had overtaken
him. When, therefore, they got access to him, as I was saying,2130 they called his attention
to all the sufferings they had had to endure in each several region; and as for the rest, they
urged it upon him that regard ought now to be had to the question of safety;2131 for they
had been in great terror lest any of the miseries which were inflicted on him should fall to
their own lot. But he counselled them to fear nothing, and rose to harangue them. And then,
while he lay in prison, he ordered them to procure copies of the books of the law of the
Christians; for these disciples who had been despatched by him through the different communities
were held in execration by all men, and most of all by those with whom the name
of Christians was an object of honour. Accordingly, on receiving a small supply of money,
they took their departure for those districts in which the books of the Christians were published;
2132 and pretending that they were Christian messengers,2133 they requested that the
books might be shown them, with a view to their acquiring copies. And, not to make a
lengthened narrative of this, they thus got possession of all the books of our Scriptures, and
brought them back with them to their master, who was still in prison. On receiving these
copies, that astute personage set himself to seek out all the statements in our books that
seemed to favour his notion of a dualism; which, however, was not really his notion, but
rather that of Scythianus, who had promulgated it a long time before him. And just as he
did in disputing with me, so then too, by rejecting some things and altering others in our
Scriptures, he tried to make out that they advanced his own doctrines, only that the name
of Christ was attached to them there. That name, therefore, he pretended on this account
to assume to himself, in order that the people in the various communities, hearing the holy
and divine name of Christ, might have no temptation to execrate and harass2134 those disciples
of his. Moreover, when they2135 came upon the word which is given us in our Scriptures
touching the Paraclete, he took it into his head that he himself might be that Paraclete;
for he had not read with sufficient care to observe that the Paraclete had come
already,—namely, at the time when the apostles were still upon earth. Accordingly, when
he had made up these impious inventions, he sent his disciples also to proclaim these fictions

But when the king of Persia learned this fact, he prepared to inflict condign punishment
upon him. Manes, however, received information of the king’s intention, having been warned
of it in sleep, and made his escape out of prison, and succeeding in taking to flight, for he
had bribed his keepers with a very large sum of money. Afterwards he took up his residence
in the castle of Arabion; and from that place he sent by the hand of Turbo the letter which
he wrote to our Marcellus, in which letter he intimated his intention of visiting him. On his
arrival there, a contest took place between him and me, resembling the disputation which
you have observed and listened to here; in which discussion we sought to show, as far as it
was in our power, that he was a false prophet. I may add, that the keeper of the prison who
had let him escape was punished, and that the king gave orders that the man should be
sought for and apprehended wherever he might be found. And as these things have come
under my own cognizance, it was needful that I should also make the fact known to you,
that search is being made for this fellow even to the present day by the king of Persia.</p>

<p>55. On hearing this, the multitude wished to seize Manes and hand him over to the
power of those foreigners who were their neighbours, and who dwelt beyond the river
Stranga,2136 especially as also some time before this certain parties had come to seek him
out; who, however, had to take their leave again without finding any trace of him, for at that
time he was in flight. However, when Archelaus made this declaration, Manes at once took
to flight, and succeeded in making his escape good before any one followed in pursuit of
him. For the people were detained by the narrative which was given by Archelaus, whom
they heard with great pleasure;2137 nevertheless some of them did follow in close pursuit
after him. But he made again for the roads by which he had come, and crossed the river,
and effected his return to the castle of Arabion.2138 There, however, he was afterwards apprehended
and brought before the king, who, being inflamed with the strongest indignation
against him, and fired with the desire of avenging two deaths upon him,—namely, the death
of his own son, and the death of the keeper of the prison,—gave orders that he should be
flayed and hung before the gate of the city, and that his skin should be dipped in certain
medicaments and inflated; his flesh, too, he commanded to be given as a prey to the birds.2139
When these things came under the knowledge of Archelaus at a later period, he added an
account of them to the former discussion, so that all the facts might be made known to all,
even as I, who have written2140 narrative of2141 these matters, have explained the circumstances
in what precedes. And all the Christians, therefore, having assembled, resolved that
the decision should be given against him transmitting that as a sort of epilogue to his death
which would be in proper consonance with the other circumstances of his life. Besides that,
Archelaus added words to the following effect:—My brethren, let none of you be incredulous
in regard to the statements made by me: I refer to the assertion that Manes was not himself
the first author of this impious dogma, but that it was only made public by him in certain
regions of the earth. For assuredly that man is not at once to be reckoned the author of
anything who has simply been the bearer of it to some quarter or other, but only he has a

right to that credit who has been the discoverer of it. For as the helmsman who receives the
ship which another has built, may convey it to any countries he pleases, and yet he remains
one who has had nothing to do with the construction of the vessel, so also is this man’s position
to be understood. For he did not impart its origin to this matter really from the beginning;
but he was only the means of transmitting to men what had been discovered by another,
as we know on the evidence of trustworthy testimonies, on the ground of which it has been
our purpose to prove to you that the invention of this wickedness did not come from
Manes,2142 but that it originated with another, and that other indeed a foreigner, who appeared
a long time before him. And further, that the dogma remained unpublished for a
time, until at length the doctrines which had thus been lying in obscurity for a certain period
were brought forward publicly by him as if they were his own, the title of the writer having
been deleted, as I have shown above. Among the Persians there was also a certain promulgator
of similar tenets, one Basilides,2143 of more ancient date, who lived no long time after
the period of our apostles. This man was of a shrewd disposition himself, and as he observed
that at that time all other subjects were preoccupied, he determined to affirm that same
dualism which was maintained also by Scythianus. And as, in fine, he had nothing to advance
which was properly his own, he brought the sayings of others before his adversaries.2144
And all his books contain some matters at once difficult and extremely harsh. The thirteenth
book of his Tractates, however, is still extant, which begins in the following manner: “In
<note type="footnote">2142 Codex Casinensis reads, “non ex Manen originem mali hujus Manes esse.” We adopt the conjecture,
“non ex Mane originem mali hujus manasse.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2143 The following note on this Basilides may be given from Migne:—“Although Eusebius (Hist. Eccles., iv.
7) tells us that the Basilides who taught heresy shortly after the times of the apostles was an Alexandrian, and
opened schools of error in Egypt, the Basilides mentioned here by Archelaus may still be one and the same
person with that Alexandrian, notwithstanding that it is said that he taught his heresy among the Persians. For
it may very well be the case that Basilides left Alexandria, and made an attempt to infect the Persians also with
his heretical dogmas. At the same time, there is no mention among ancient authorities, so far as I know, of a
Persian Basilides. The Alexandrian Basilides also wrote twenty-four books on the Gospel, as the same Eusebius
testifies; and these do not appear to be different from those books of Tractates which Archelaus cites, and from
the Exegetics, from the twenty-third book of which certain passages are given by Clement of Alexandria in the
fourth book of his Stromateis.It is not clear however, whether that Gospel on which Basilides wrote was the
Gospel of the Apostles, or another which he made up for himself, and of which mention is made in Origen’s
first Homily on Luke, in Jerome’s prologue to his Commentary on Matthew, and in Ambrose’s prologue to the
Gospel of Luke.” We may add that Gieseler (Studien und Kritiken, i. 1830, p. 397) denies that the person meant
here is Basilides the Gnostic, specially on account of the peculiar designation, Basilides quidam antiquior.But
his objections are combated by Baur and Neander. See the Church History of the latter, ii. p. 50, ed. Bohn.</note>

writing the thirteenth book of our Tractates, the wholesome word furnished us with the
necessary and fruitful word.”2145 Then he illustrates how it, the antagonism between good
and evil, is produced under the figures of a rich principle and a poor principle, of which the
latter is by nature without root and without place, and only supervenes upon things.2146
This is the only topic2147 which the book contains. Does it not then contain a strange2148
word;2149 and, as certain parties have been thus minded, will ye not also all be offended
with the book itself, which has such a beginning as this?—But Basilides, returning to the
subject after an introduction of same five hundred lines,2150 more or less, proceeds thus:
“Give up this vain and curious variation,2151 and let us rather find out what inquiries the
foreigners2152 have instituted on the subject of good and evil, and what opinions they have
been led to adopt on all these subjects. For certain among them have maintained that there
are for all things two beginnings,2153 to which they have referred good and evil, holding
that these beginnings are without beginning and ungenerate; that is to say, that in the origins
of things there were light and darkness, which existed of themselves, and which were not
merely declared to exist.2154 While these subsisted by themselves, they led each its own
proper mode of life, such as it was its will to lead, and such as was competent to it; for in
the case of all things, what is proper to any one is also in amity with the same, and nothing

fragmentary sentence appears to be as given above. So Neander understands it as conveying a figurative description
of the two principles of light and darkness, expressed in the Zoroastrian doctrine immediately cited,—the rich
being the good principle, and the poor the evil. He also supposes the phrase “without root and without place”
to indicate the “absoluteness of the principle, that springs up all at once, and mixes itself up with the development
of existence.”—See Church History, ii. 51 (Bohn). Routh confesses his inability to understand what can be meant

<p>1. Archelaus said to Manes: Give us a statement now of the doctrines you promulgate.—
Thereupon the man, whose mouth was like an open sepulchre,2157 began at once
with a word of blasphemy against the Maker of all things, saying: The God of the Old Testament
is the inventor of evil, who speaks thus of Himself: “I am a consuming fire.”2158—But
the sagacious Archelaus completely undid this blasphemy. For he said: If the God of the
Old Testament, according to your allegation, calls Himself a fire, whose son is He who says,
“I am come to send fire upon the earth?”2159 If you find fault with one who says, “The Lord
killeth and maketh alive,”2160 why do you honour Peter, who raised Tabitha to life,2161 but
also put Sapphira to death?2162 And if again, you find fault with the one because He has

into everlasting fire?”2164 If you find fault with Him who says, “I, God, make peace, and
create evil,”2165 explain to us how Jesus says, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”2166
Since both persons speak in the same terms, one or other of these two things must follow:
namely, either they are both good2167 because they use the same language; or, if Jesus passes
without censure though He speaks in such terms, you must tell us why you reprehend Him
who employs a similar mode of address in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>2. Then Manes made the following reply to him: And what manner of God now is it
that blinds one? For it is Paul who uses these words: “In whom the God of this world hath
blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the Gospel should shine in
them.”2168 But Archelaus broke in and refuted this very well, saying: Read, however, a word
or two of what precedes that sentence, namely, “But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid in them
that are lost.” You see that it is hid in them that are lost. “For it is not meet to give the holy
things to dogs.”2169 And furthermore, is it only the God of the Old Testament that has
blinded the minds of them who believe not? Nay, has not Jesus Himself also said: “Therefore
speak I to them in parables: that seeing, they may not see?”2170 Is it then because He hated
them that He desired them not to see? Or is it not on account of their unworthiness, since
they closed their own eyes? For wherever wickedness is a matter self-chosen, there too there
is the absence of grace. “For unto him that hath shall be given, but from him that hath not
shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.”2171</p>

<p>3. But even although2172 we should be under the necessity of accepting the exegesis
advocated by some,—for the subject is not altogether unworthy of notice,—and of saying
thus, that He hath actually blinded the minds2173 of them that believe not, we should still
have to affirm that He hath blinded them for good, in order that they may recover their
sight to behold things that are holy. For it is not said that He hath blinded their soul,2174
but only that He hath blinded the minds of them that believe not. And that mode of expression
means something like this: Blind the whorish mind of the whore-monger, and the man
is saved; blind the rapacious and thievish mind of the thief and the man is saved. But do
you decline to understand the sentence thus? Well, there is still another interpretation. For
the sun blinds those who have bad sight; and those who have watery eyes are also blinded
when they are smitten by the light: not, however, because it is of the nature of the sun to
blind, but because the eye’s own constitution2175 is not one of correct vision. And in like
manner, those whose hearts are afflicted with the ailment of unbelief are not capable of
looking upon the rays of the glory of the Godhead. And again, it is not said, “He hath blinded
their minds lest they should hear the Gospel,” but rather “lest the light of the glory of the
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ should shine unto them.” For to hear the Gospel is a thing
committed2176 to all; but the glory of the Gospel of Christ is imparted only to the sincere
and genuine. For this reason the Lord spake in parables to those who were incapable of
hearing, but to His disciples He explained these parables in private. For the illumination of
the glory is for those who have been enlightened, while the blinding is for them who believe
not. These mysteries, which the Church now declares to you who are transferred from the
lists of the catechumens, it is not her custom to declare to the Gentiles. For we do not declare
the mysteries touching the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit to a Gentile; neither do
we speak of the mysteries plainly in presence of the catechumens; but many a time we express
ourselves in an occult manner, so that the faithful who have intelligence may apprehend
the truths referred to, while those who have not that intelligence may receive no hurt.</p>

<p>Oh that “foolish and unlearned questions” had been avoided, as the Scripture2177 bids!
Surely, we should be as decent about the conjugal relations of the Blessed Virgin as we are
socially in all such matters. Pearson, as in the note, says all that should be said on such a

<p>I adopt the views of those who reverently suppose that when it was said, “Let us make
man,” etc., Lucifer conceived rebellion, and said, “This be far from Thee, Lord;” fearing the
creature made in God’s own image might outshine himself. Hence our Lord applies the
epithet “Satan” to Peter when he ventures to use similar language. Possibly there lurks a
reference to this in such language as Job iv. 18. I have previously referred to the Messias and
Anti-Messias of the Rev. Charles Ingham Black (London, 1854), in which this view is singularly
well argued. It is well to halt, however, with a confession, that, while it seems intimated
in Holy Scripture, it cannot be proved as revealed. Hence let us reverently say what is said
by the Psalmist in Psa. cxxxi. 1, and confess what is written in Deut. xxix. 29. I go so far,
only because the words on which this note is a comment seem to authorize inquiry as to
the force of “Satan” just there. I state what seems the reference, but go no farther. Compare

and taught “as they were able to hear it.” But the disciplina arcani was designed chiefly to
protect the Church from the profaneness of the heathen, and it fell into desuetude after the

<head>General Note.</head>
<p>As I have not infrequently treated the rise of the great Alexandrian school as an outcrop
from the learning and piety of Apollos, I take this space to record my reasons: 1. Apart from
the question in formal shape, I hold that the character and influence of this brilliant Alexandrian
must have operated upon Alexandrian converts. 2. But the frequent employment by
the Alexandrians of the expressions (Acts xviii. 24) used concerning him by St. Luke, almost
textually, confirms my suspicion that they had his high example always before them. 3. The
catechetical school was certainly established in Alexandria from apostolic times.2181 By
whom more probably than by Apollos? 4. St. Mark’s connection with Alexandria rests on
no scriptural evidence, yet it is credited. 5. That of Apollos is narrated in Scripture, and I
can conceive of nothing so probable as that, remembering his own instruction by Aquila
and Priscilla (Acts xviii. 26), he should have founded catechetical schools for others. 6. All
this is conjectural, indeed, but it agrees with known facts. 7. The silence of Clement and the
rest is an objection quite as fatal to the claims of St. Mark. 8. The unanimity of the Alexandrians,
from Pantænus downward, in assigning to St. Paul the authorship of the Epistle to
the Hebrews, while it was so much debated elsewhere, suggests that they had early evidence
on this point. 9. Clement’s testimony about St. Luke convinces me that Apollos had no claim
to it, but had testified to the Alexandrians that the Apostle was the author, and St. Luke his
inspired amanuensis by whom the words were not servilely taken down, but reported in
idioms of his own: whether out of St. Paul’s “Hebrew” or not, is another question. 10.
Apollos disappears from history about a.d. 64, on his way homeward,2182 bearing the Epistle
to Titus, and (who can doubt?) a copy of that to the Hebrews, written the previous year. All
these facts agree with my conjectures that Apollos closed his labours in his native city.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Alexander, Bishop of Lycopolis.2183</head>
<p>[a.d. 301.] To the following account, translated from Galland, I prefix only the general
date of Alexander’s episcopate. He was succeeded in the bishopric of Lycopolis by the turbulent
Meletius, of whose schism we need not say anything here. But his early relations with
the heresy of Manes, and his subsequent orthodoxy (in all which he was a foreshadowing
of Augustine), render his treatise on the Manichæan opinions especially valuable.</p>
<p>Combefis conjectured that Alexander was called Λυκοπολίτης , as having been born at
Lycus, a city of the Thebaid, and so by race an Egyptian, and to his opinion both Cave and
Fabricius are inclined. But this conjecture is plainly uncertain, if we are to trust Photius, in
his Epitome De Manichæis, which Montfaucon has edited.2184 For in this work Photius,
whilst speaking of the authors who wrote against those heretics, makes mention also of Alexander
as bishop of the city of Lycus, ὅτε τῆς πόλεως Λύκων ᾽Αλέξανδρος τοὺς
ἀρχιερατικοὺς νόμους ἐγκεχειρισμένος .2185 So that it is no easy matter to state whether
our author was called Λυκοπολίτης, because he was born either at Lycopolis in the Thebaid,
or at another Lycopolis in Lower Egypt, which Stephanus places close to the sea in the
Sebennytic nome, or whether he was not rather called Λυκοπολίτης , as having held the
bishopric of Lycopolis. The unwonted manner of speaking employed by Photius need not
delay the attention of anyone, when he makes Alexander to have been Archbishop of Lycopolis;
for it is established that the Bishop of Alexandria alone was Archbishop and Patriarch
of the whole Egyptian diocese. Epiphanius2186 certainly says, when speaking of Meletius,2187

Meletius, who was Bishop of Lycopolis in Upper Egypt at the time of the persecution under Diocletian and his
successors, yielded to fear and sacrificed to idols: and being subsequently deposed, on this and other charges,
in a Synod over which Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, presided, determined to separate from the Church, and to
constitute with his followers a separate community. Epiphanius, on the other hand, relates that both Peter and</note>

καὶ δευτερεύων τῷ Πετρῳ τῷ τῆς ᾽Αλεξανδρείας κατὰ τὴν ἀρχιεπισκοπήν. And to the same
purpose he says elsewhere, Μελήτιος, ὁ τῆς Αἰγύπτου ἀπὸ Θηβαΐδος δοκῶν εἶναι καὶ αὐτὸς
ἀρχιεπίσκοπος. But however these matters are understood, it is admitted that Alexander
came just before Meletius in the See of Lycopolis, and we know that he occupied the episcopal
chair of that city in the beginning of the fourth century, in which order Le Quien places him
among the Lycopolitan prelates, on the authority of Photius.</p>
<p>In the time of Constantine, the Eastern and Western Empire were each divided into
seven districts, called dioceses,2188 which comprised about one hundred and eighteen
provinces;2189 each province contained several cities, each of which had a district2190 attached
to it. The ecclesiastical rulers of the dioceses were called patriarchs, exarchs, or archbishops,
of whom there were fourteen; the rulers of the provinces were styled metropolitans, i.e.,
governors of the μητρόπολις or mother city, and those of each city and its districts were
called bishops. So that the division which we now call a diocese, was in ancient times a
union of dioceses, and a parish was a combination of modern parishes.2191</p>
<p>But however it be, whether Alexander was called Λυκοπολίτης from his birthplace, or
from his episcopal See, this is certain and acknowledged, that he of good right claims for
himself a place among ecclesiastical writers, for he has given us an elaborate treatise against
the Manichæan tenets; and he is therefore styled by Allatius auctor eruditissimus et
φιλοσοφικώτατος, and his work libellus aureus. Allatius wrote out and brought to light two
passages from it, while as yet it was lying hid in the libraries. From the inscription of the
work, we learn that Alexander was first a pagan; and afterwards, having given up the religion
of the Greeks, became an adherent of the Manichæan doctrines, which he says that he learnt
from those who were on terms of familiar intercourse with the heresiarch, ἀπὸ τῶν γνωρίμων
τοῦ ἀνδρός;2192 so that he would seem to be not far wrong in his conjecture who would

of this sect he was divinely reclaimed, and, taking refuge in the Church, he exposed the
scandals attaching to the heresiarch, and solidly refuted his unwholesome dogmas. From
having been an adherent of the sect himself, he has given us more information concerning
their tenets than it was in the power of others to give, and on that account his treatise seems
to be held in much estimation.2193</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The Excellence of the Christian Philosophy; The Origin of Heresies
Amongst Christians.</head>
<p>The philosophy of the Christians is termed simple. But it bestows very great attention
to the formation of manners, enigmatically insinuating words of more certain truth respecting
God; the principal of which, so far as any earnest serious purpose in those matters is concerned,
all will have received when they assume an efficient cause, very noble and very ancient,
as the originator of all things that have existence. For Christians leaving to ethical
students matters more toilsome and difficult, as, for instance, what is virtue, moral and intellectual;
and to those who employ their time in forming hypotheses respecting morals,
and the passions and affections, without marking out any element by which each virtue is
to be attained, and heaping up, as it were, at random precepts less subtle—the common
people, hearing these, even as we learn by experience, make great progress in modesty, and
a character of piety is imprinted on their manners, quickening the moral disposition which
from such usages is formed, and leading them by degrees to the desire of what is honourable
and good.2195</p>
<p>But this being divided into many questions by the number of those who come after,
there arise many, just as is the case with those who are devoted to dialectics,2196 some more
skilful than others, and, so to speak, more sagacious in handling nice and subtle questions;
so that now they come forward as parents and originators of sects and heresies. And by
these the formation of morals is hindered and rendered obscure; for those do not attain
unto certain verity of discourse who wish to become the heads of the sects, and the common
people is to a greater degree excited to strife and contention. And there being no rule nor
law by which a solution may be obtained of the things which are called in question, but, as
in other matters, this ambitious rivalry running out into excess, there is nothing to which
it does not cause damage and injury.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Age of Manichæus, or Manes; His First Disciples; The Two Principles;
Manichæan Matter.</head>
<p>So in these matters also, whilst in novelty of opinion each endeavours to show himself
first and superior, they brought this philosophy, which is simple, almost to a nullity. Such
was he whom they call Manichæus,2197 a Persian by race, my instructor in whose doctrine
was one Papus by name, and after him Thomas, and some others followed them. They say
that the man lived when Valerian was emperor, and that he served under Sapor, the king
of the Persians, and having offended him in some way, was put to death. Some such report
of his character and reputation has come to me from those who were intimately acquainted
with him. He laid down two principles, God and Matter. God he called good, and matter
he affirmed to be evil. But God excelled more in good than matter in evil. But he calls matter
not that which Plato calls it,2198 which becomes everything when it has received quality and
figure, whence he terms it all-embracing—the mother and nurse of all things; nor what
Aristotle2199 calls an element, with which form and privation have to do, but something
beside these. For the motion which in individual things is incomposite, this he calls matter.
On the side of God are ranged powers, like handmaids, all good; and likewise, on the side
of matter are ranged other powers, all evil. Moreover, the bright shining, the light, and the
superior, all these are with God; while the obscure, and the darkness, and the inferior are
with matter. God, too, has desires, but they are all good; and matter, likewise, which are all
evil.</p>
<note type="footnote">2197 Manes, or Manichæus, lived about a.d. 240. He was a Persian by birth, and this accounts for the
Parseeism which can be detected in his teaching. He was probably ordained a priest, but was afterwards expelled
from the Christian community, and put to death by the Persian government. His tenets spread considerably,
and were in early youth embraced by St. Augustine. [See Confess., iii. 6.]</note>

<head>Chapter III.—The Fancies of Manichæus Concerning Matter.</head>
<p>It came to pass on a time that matter conceived a desire to attain to the superior region;
and when it had arrived there, it admired the brightness and the light which was with God.
And, indeed, it wished to seize on for itself the place of pre-eminence, and to remove God
from His position. God, moreover, deliberated how to avenge Himself upon matter, but
was destitute of the evil necessary to do so, for evil does not exist in the house and abode of
God. He sent, therefore, the power which we call the soul into matter, to permeate it entirely.
For it will be the death of matter, when at length hereafter this power is separated from it.
So, therefore, by the providence of God, the soul was commingled with matter, an unlike
thing with an unlike. Now by this commingling the soul has contracted evil, and labours
under the same infirmity as matter. For, just as in a corrupted vessel, the contents are oftentimes
vitiated in quality, so, also the soul that is in matter suffers some such change, and is
deteriorated from its own nature so as to participate in the evil of matter. But God had
compassion upon the soul, and sent forth another power, which we call Demiurge,2200 that
is, the Creator of all things; and when this power had arrived, and taken in hand the creation
of the world, it separated from matter as much power as from the commingling had contracted
no vice and stain, and hence the sun and moon were first formed; but that which had
contracted some slight and moderate stain, this became the stars and the expanse of heaven.
Of the matter from which the sun and the moon was separated, part was cast entirely out
of the world, and is that fire in which, indeed, there is the power of burning, although in itself
it is dark and void of light, being closely similar to night. But in the rest of the elements,
both animal and vegetable, in those the divine power is unequally mingled. And therefore
the world was made, and in it the sun and moon who preside over the birth and death of
things, by separating the divine virtue from matter, and transmitting it to God.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Moon’s Increase and Wane; The Manichæan Trifling Respecting
It; Their Dreams About Man and Christ; Their Foolish System of Abstinence.</head>
<p>He ordained this, forsooth, to supply to the Demiurge,2201 or Creator, another power
which might attract to the splendour of the sun; and the thing is manifest, as one might say,
even to a blind person. For the moon in its increase receives the virtue which is separated
from matter, and during the time of its augmentation comes forth full of it. But when it is
full, in its wanings, it remits it to the sun, and the sun goes back to God. And when it has
done this, it waits again to receive from another full moon a migration of the soul to itself,
and receiving this in the same way, it suffers it to pass on to God. And this is its work continually,
and in every age. And in the sun some such image is seen, as is the form of man.
And matter ambitiously strove to make man from itself by mingling together all its virtue,
so that it might have some portion of soul. But his form contributed much to man’s obtaining
a greater share, and one beyond all other animals, in the divine virtue. For he is the image
of the divine virtue, but Christ is the intelligence. Who, when He had at length come from
the superior region, dismissed a very great part of this virtue to God. And at length being
crucified, in this way He furnished knowledge, and fitted the divine virtue to be crucified
in matter. Because, therefore, it is the Divine will and decree that matter should perish, they
abstain from those things which have life, and feed upon vegetables, and everything which
is void of sense. They abstain also from marriage and the rites of Venus, and the procreation
of children, that virtue may not strike its root deeper in matter by the succession of race;
nor do they go abroad, seeking to purify themselves from the stain which virtue has contracted
from its admixture with matter.</p>

<p>These things are the principal of what they say and think. And they honour very especially
the sun and moon, not as gods, but as the way by which it is possible to attain unto God.
But when the divine virtue has been entirely separated off, they say that the exterior fire will
fall, and burn up both itself and all else that is left of matter. Those of them who are better
educated, and not unacquainted with Greek literature, instruct us from their own resources.
From the ceremonies and mysteries, for instance: by Bacchus, who was cut out from the
womb, is signified that the divine virtue is divided into matter by the Titans, as they say;
from the poet’s fable of the battle with the Giants, is indicated that not even they were ignor-
ant of the rebellion of matter against God. I indeed will not deny, that these things are not
sufficient to lead away the minds of those who receive words without examining them, since
the deception caused by discourse of this sort has drawn over to itself some of those who
have pursued the study of philosophy with me; but in what manner I should approach the
thing to examine into it, I am at a loss indeed. For their hypotheses do not proceed by any
legitimate method, so that one might institute an examination in accordance with these;
neither are there any principles of demonstrations, so that we may see what follows on these;
but theirs is the rare discovery of those who are simply said to philosophize. These men,
taking to themselves the Old and New Scriptures, though they lay it down that these are
divinely inspired, draw their own opinions from thence; and then only think they are refuted,
when it happens that anything not in accordance with these is said or done by them. And
what to those who philosophize after the manner of the Greeks, as respects principles of
demonstration, are intermediate propositions; this, with them, is the voice of the prophets.
But here, all these things being eliminated, and since those matters, which I before mentioned,
are put forward without any demonstration, and since it is necessary to give an answer in
a rational way, and not to put forward other things more plausible, and which might prove
more enticing, my attempt is rather troublesome, and on this account the more arduous,
because it is necessary to bring forward arguments of a varied nature. For the more accurate
arguments will escape the observation of those who have been convinced beforehand by
these men without proof, if, when it comes to persuasion, they fall into the same hands. For
they imagine that they proceed from like sources. There is, therefore, need of much and
great diligence, and truly of God, to be the guide of our argument.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Two Principles of the Manichæans; Themselves Controverted;
The Pythagorean Opinion Respecting First Principles; Good and Evil Contrary;
The Victory on the Side of Good.</head>
<p>They lay down two principles, God and Matter. If he (Manes) separates that which
comes into being from that which really exists, the supposition is not so faulty in this, that
neither does matter create itself, nor does it admit two contrary qualities, in being both
active and passive; nor, again, are other such theories proposed concerning the creative
cause as it is not lawful to speak of. And yet God does not stand in need of matter in order
to make things, since in His mind all things substantially exist, so far as the possibility of
their coming into being is concerned. But if, as he seems rather to mean, the unordered
motion of things really existent under Him is matter, first, then, he unconsciously sets up
another creative cause (and yet an evil one), nor does he perceive what follows from this,
namely, that if it is necessary that God and matter should be supposed, some other matter
must be supposed to God; so that to each of the creative causes there should be the subject
matter. Therefore, instead of two, he will be shown to give us four first principles. Wonderful,
too, is the distinction. For if he thinks this to be God, which is good, and wishes to conceive
of something opposite to Him, why does he not, as some of the Pythagoreans, set evil over
against Him? It is more tolerable, indeed, that two principles should be spoken of by them,
the good and the evil, and that these are continually striving, but the good prevails. For if
the evil were to prevail, all things would perish. Wherefore matter, by itself, is neither body,
nor is it exactly incorporeal, nor simply any particular thing; but it is something indefinite,
which, by the addition of form, comes to be defined; as, for instance, fire is a pyramid, air
an octahedron, water an eikosahedron, and earth a cube; how, then, is matter the unordered
motion of the elements? By itself, indeed, it does not subsist, for if it is motion, it is in that
which is moved; but matter does not seem to be of such a nature, but rather the first subject,
and unorganized, from which other things proceed. Since, therefore, matter is unordered
motion, was it always conjoined with that which is moved, or was it ever separate from it?
For, if it were ever by itself, it would not be in existence; for there is no motion without
something moved. But if it was always in that which is moved, then, again, there will be two
principles—that which moves, and that which is moved. To which of these two, then, will
it be granted that it subsists as a primary cause along with God?</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Motion Vindicated from the Charge of Irregularity; Circular; Straight;
Of Generation and Corruption; Of Alteration, and Quality Affecting Sense.</head>
<p>There is added to the discourse an appendix quite foreign to it.2202 For you may reasonably
speak of motion not existing. And what, also, is the matter of motion? Is it straight or
circular? Or does it take place by a process of change, or by a process of generation and
corruption? The circular motion, indeed, is so orderly and composite, that it is ascribed to
the order of all created things; nor does this, in the Manichæan system, appear worthy to
be impugned, in which move the sun and the moon, whom alone, of the gods, they say that
they venerate. But as regards that which is straight: to this, also, there is a bound when it
reaches its own place. For that which is earthly ceases entirely from motion, as soon as it
has touched the earth. And every animal and vegetable makes an end of increasing when it
has reached its limit. Therefore the stoppage of these things would be more properly the
death of matter, than that endless death, which is, as it were, woven for it by them. But the
motion which arises by a process of generation and corruption it is impossible to think of
as in harmony with this hypothesis, for, according to them, matter is unbegotten. But if they
ascribe to it the motion of alteration, as they term it, and that by which we suffer change by
a quality affecting the sense, it is worth while to consider how they come to say this. For this
seems to be the principal thing that they assert, since by matter it comes to pass, as they say,
that manners are changed, and that vice arises in the soul. For in altering, it will always begin
from the beginning; and, proceeding onwards, it will reach the middle, and thus will it attain
unto the end. But when it has reached the end, it will not stand still, at least if alteration is
its essence. But it will again, by the same route, return to the beginning, and from thence in
like manner to the end; nor will it ever cease from doing this. As, for instance, if α and γ
suffer alteration, and the middle is β, α by being changed, will arrive at β, and from thence
will go on to γ. Again returning from the extreme γ to β, it will at some time or other arrive
at α; and this goes on continuously. As in the change from black, the middle is dun, and the
extreme, white. Again, in the contrary direction, from white to dun, and in like manner to
black; and again from white the change begins, and goes the same round.</p>

<pb n="579"/>
<head>Chapter VIII.—Is Matter Wicked? Of God and Matter.</head>
<p>Is matter, in respect of alteration, an evil cause? It is thus proved that it is not more evil
than good. For let the beginning of the change be from evil. Thus the change is from this to
good through that which is indifferent. But let the alteration be from good. Again the beginning
goes on through that which is indifferent. Whether the motion be to one extreme or
to the other, the method is the same, and this is abundantly set forth. All motion has to do
with quantity; but quality is the guide in virtue and vice. Now we know that these two are
generically distinguished. But are God and matter alone principles, or does there remain
anything else which is the mean between these two? For if there is nothing, these things remain
unintermingled one with another. And it is well said that if the extremes are intermingled,
there is a necessity for some thing intermediate to connect them. But if something
else exists, it is necessary that that something be either body or incorporeal, and thus a third
adventitious principle makes its appearance. First, therefore, if we suppose God and matter
to be both entirely incorporeal, so that neither is in the other, except as the science of
grammar is in the soul; to understand this of God and matter is absurd. But if, as in a vacuum,
as some say, the vacuum is surrounded by this universe; the other, again, is without substance,
for the substance of a vacuum is nothing. But if as accidents, first, indeed, this is impossible;
for the thing that wants substance cannot be in any place; for substance is, as it were, the
vehicle underlying the accident. But if both are bodies, it is necessary for both to be either
heavy or light, or middle; or one heavy, and another light, or intermediate. If, then, both
are heavy, it is plainly necessary that these should be the same, both among light things and
those things which are of the middle sort; or if they alternate, the one will be altogether
separate from the other. For that which is heavy has one place, and that which is middle
another, and the light another. To one belongs the superior, to the other the inferior, and
to the third the middle. Now in every spherical figure the inferior part is the middle; for
from this to all the higher parts, even to the topmost superficies, the distance is every way
equal, and, again, all heavy bodies are borne from all sides to it. Wherefore, also, it occurs
to me to laugh when I hear that matter moving without order,—for this belongs to it by
nature,—came to the region of God, or to light and brightness, and such-like. But if one be
body, and the other incorporeal, first, indeed, that which is body is alone capable of motion.
And then if they are not intermingled, each is separate from the other according to its
proper nature. But if one be mixed up with the other, they will be either mind or soul or
accident. For so only it happens that things incorporeal are mixed up with bodies.</p>

Matter Towards God; God the Author of the Rebellion of Matter in the
Manichæan Sense; The Longing of Matter for Light and Brightness Good; Divine
Good None the Less for Being Communicated.</head>
<p>But in what manner, and from what cause, was matter brought to the region of God?
for to it by nature belong the lower place and darkness, as they say; and the upper region
and light are contrary to its nature. Wherefore there is then attributed to it a supernatural
motion; and something of the same sort happens to it, as if a man were to throw a stone or
a lump of earth upwards; in this way, the thing being raised a little by the force of the person
throwing, when it has reached the upper regions, falls back again into the same place. Who,
then, hath raised matter to the upper region? Of itself, indeed, and from itself, it would not
be moved by that motion which belongs to it. It is necessary, then, that some force should
be applied to it for it to be borne aloft, as with the stone and the lump of earth. But they
leave nothing else to it but God. It is manifest, therefore, what follows from their argument.
That God, according to them, by force and necessity, raised matter aloft to Himself. But if
matter be evil, its desires are altogether evil. Now the desire of evil is evil, but the desire of
good is altogether good. Since, then, matter has desired brightness and light, its desire is
not a bad one; just as it is not bad for a man living in vice, afterwards to come to desire virtue.
On the contrary, he is not guiltless who, being good, comes to desire what is evil. As if any
one should say that God desires the evils which are attaching to matter. For the good things
of God are not to be so esteemed as great wealth and large estates, and a large quantity of
gold, a lesser portion of which remain with the owner, if one effect a transfer of them to
another. But if an image of these things must be formed in the mind, I think one would
adduce as examples wisdom and the sciences. As, therefore, neither wisdom suffers diminution
nor science, and he who is endowed with these experiences no loss if another be made
partaker of them; so, in the same way, it is contrary to reason to think that God grudges
matter the desire of what is good; if, indeed, with them we allow that it desires it.</p>

Resemble This: the Homeric Allegory of the Battle of the Gods; Envy and Emulation
Existing In God According to the Manichæan Opinion; These Vices are
to Be Found in No Good Man, and are to Be Accounted Disgraceful.</head>
<p>Moreover, they far surpass the mythologists in fables, those, namely, who either make
Coelus suffer mutilation, or idly tell of the plots laid for Saturn by his son, in order that that
son might attain the sovereignty; or those again who make Saturn devour his sons and to
have been cheated of his purpose by the image of a stone that was presented to him. For
how are these things which they put forward dissimilar to those? When they speak openly
of the war between God and matter, and say not these things either in a mythological sense,
as Homer in the Iliad;2203 when he makes Jupiter to rejoice in the strife and war of the gods
with each other, thus obscurely signifying that the world is formed of unequal elements,
fitted one into another, and either conquering or submitting to a conqueror. And this has
been advanced by me, because I know that people of this sort, when they are at a loss for
demonstration, bring together from all sides passages from poems, and seek from them a
support for their own opinions. Which would not be the case with them if they had only
read what they fell in with some reflection. But, when all evil is banished from the company
of the gods, surely emulation and envy ought especially to have been got rid of. Yet these
men leave these things with God, when they say that God formed designs against matter,
because it felt a desire for good. But with which of those things which God possessed could
He have wished to take vengeance on matter? In truth, I think it to be more accurate doctrine
to say that God is of a simple nature, than what they advance. Nor, indeed, as in the other
things, is the enunciation of this fancy easy. For neither is it possible to demonstrate it simply
and with words merely, but with much instruction and labour. But we all know this, that
anger and rage, and the desire of revenge upon matter, are passions in him who is so agitated.
And of such a sort, indeed, as it could never happen to a good man to be harassed by them,
much less then can it be that they are connected with the Absolute Good.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The Transmitted Virtue of the Manichæans; The Virtues of Matter
Mixed with Equal or Less Amount of Evil.</head>
<p>To other things, therefore, our discourse has come round about again. For, because they
say that God sent virtue into matter, it is worth our while to consider whether this virtue,
so far as it pertains to good, in respect of God is less, or whether it is on equal terms with
Him. For if it is less, what is the cause? For the things which are with God admit of no fellowship
with matter. But good alone is the characteristic of God, and evil alone of matter.
But if it is on equal terms with Him, what is the reason that He, as a king, issues His commands,
and it involuntarily undertakes this labour? Moreover, with regard to matter, it shall
be inquired whether, with respect to evil, the virtues are alike or less. For if they are less,
they are altogether of less evil. By fellowship therefore with the good it is that they become
so. For there being two evils, the less has plainly by its fellowship with the good attained to
be what it is. But they leave nothing good around matter. Again, therefore, another question
arises. For if some other virtue, in respect of evil, excels the matter which is prevailing, it
becomes itself the presiding principle. For that which is more evil will hold the sway in its
own dominion.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The Destruction of Evil by the Immission of Virtue Rejected; Because
from It Arises No Diminution of Evil; Zeno’s Opinion Discarded, that the World
Will Be Burnt Up by Fire from the Sun.</head>
<p>But that God sent virtue into matter is asserted without any proof, and it altogether
wants probability. Yet it is right that this should have its own explanation. The reason of
this they assert, indeed, to be that there might be no more evil, but that all things should
become good. It was necessary for virtue to be intermingled with evil, after the manner of
the athletes, who, clasped in a firm embrace, overcome their adversaries, in order that, by
conquering evil, it might make it to cease to exist. But I think it far more dignified and
worthy of the excellence of God, at the first conception of things existent, to have abolished
matter. But I think they could not allow this, because that something evil is found existing,
which they call matter. But it is not any the more possible that things should cease to be
such as they are, in order that one should admit that some things are changed into that
which is worse. And it is necessary that there should be some perception of this, because
these present things have in some manner or other suffered diminution, in order that we
might have better hopes for the future. For well has it been answered to the opinion of Zeno
of Citium, who thus argued that the world would be destroyed by fire: “Everything which
has anything to burn will not cease from burning until it has consumed the whole; and the
sun is a fire, and will it not burn what it has?” Whence he made out, as he imagined, that
the universe would be destroyed by fire. But to him a facetious fellow is reported to have
said, “But I indeed yesterday, and the year before, and a long time ago, have seen, and now
in like manner do I see, that no injury has been experienced by the sun; and it is reasonable
that this should happen in time and by degrees, so that we may believe that at some time or
other the whole will be burnt up.” And to the doctrine of Manichæus, although it rests upon
no proof, I think that the same answer is apposite, namely, that there has been no diminution
in the present condition of things, but what was before in the time of the first man, when
brother killed brother, even now continues to be; the same wars, and more diverse desires.
Now it would be reasonable that these things, if they did not altogether cease, should at least
be diminished, if we are to imagine that they are at some time to cease. But while the same
things come from them, what is our expectation of them for the future?</p>

<p>But what things does he call evil? As for the sun and moon, indeed, there is nothing
lacking; but with respect to the heavens and the stars, whether he says that there is some
such thing, and what it is, it is right that we should next in order examine. But irregularity
is according to them evil, and unordered motion, but these things are always the same, and
in the same manner; nor will any one have to blame any of the planets for venturing to delay
at any time in the zodiac beyond the fixed period; nor again any of the fixed stars, as if it
did not abide in the same seat and position, and did not by circumvolution revolve equally
around the world, moving as it were one step backward in a hundred years. But on the earth,
if he accuses the roughness of some spots, or if pilots are offended at the storms on the sea;
first, indeed, as they think, these things have a share of good in them. For should nothing
germinate upon earth, all the animals must presently perish. But this result will send on
much of the virtue which is intermingled with matter to God, and there will be a necessity
for many moons, to accommodate the great multitude that suddenly approaches. And the
same language they hold with respect to the sea. For it is a piece of unlooked-for luck to
perish, in order that those things which perish may pursue the road which leads most quickly
to God. And the wars which are upon the earth, and the famines, and everything which
tends to the destruction of life, are held in very great honour by them. For everything which
is the cause of good is to be had in honour. But these things are the cause of good, because
of the destruction which accompanies them, if they transmit to God the virtue which is
separated from those who perish.</p>

Necessary Things in Which There is No Stain.</head>
<p>And, as it seems, we have been ignorant that the Egyptians rightly worship the crocodile
and the lion and the wolf, because these animals being stronger than the others devour their
prey, and entirely destroy it; the eagle also and the hawk, because they slaughter the weaker
animals both in the air and upon the earth. But perhaps also, according to them, man is for
this reason held in especial honour, because most of all, by his subtle inventions and arts,
he is wont to subdue most of the animals. And lest he himself should have no portion in
this good, he becomes the food of others. Again, therefore, those generations are, in their
opinion, absurd, which from a small and common seed produce what is great; and it is much
more becoming, as they think, that these should be destroyed by God, in order that the divine
virtue may be quickly liberated from the troubles incident to living in this world. But what
shall we say with respect to lust, and injustice, and things of this sort, Manichæus will ask.
Surely against these things discipline and law come to the rescue. Discipline, indeed, using
careful forethought that nothing of this sort may have place amongst men; but law inflicting
punishment upon any one who has been caught in the commission of anything unjust. But,
then, why should it be imputed to the earth as a fault, if the husbandman has neglected to
subdue it? because the sovereignty of God, which is according to right, suffers diminution,
when some parts of it are productive of fruits, and others not so; or when it has happened
that when the winds are sweeping, according to another cause, some derive benefit therefrom,
whilst others against their will have to sustain injuries? Surely they must necessarily be ignorant
of the character of the things that are contingent, and of those that are necessary.
For they would not else thus account such things as prodigies.</p>

<p>Whence, then, come pleasure and desire? For these are the principal evils that they talk
of and hate. Nor does matter appear to be anything else. That these things, indeed, only belong
to animals which are endowed with sense, and that nothing else but that which has sense
perceives desire and pleasure, is manifest. For what perception of pleasure and pain is there
in a plant? What in the earth, water, or air? And the demons, if indeed they are living beings
endowed with sense, for this reason, perhaps, are delighted with what has been instituted
in regard to sacrifices, and take it ill when these are wanting to them; but nothing of this
sort can be imagined with respect to God. Therefore those who say, “Why are animals affected
by pleasure and pain?” should first make the complaint, “Why are these animals endowed
with sense, or why do they stand in need of food?” For if animals were immortal, they would
have been set free from corruption and increase; such as the sun and moon and stars, although
they are endowed with sense. They are, however, beyond the power of these, and of
such a complaint. But man, being able to perceive and to judge, and being potentially
wise,—for he has the power to become so,—when he has received what is peculiar to himself,
treads it under foot.</p>

Virtue is to Be Acquired by Diligence and Study; By a Sounder Philosophy Men
are to Be Carried Onwards to the Good; The Common Study of Virtue Has by
Christ Been Opened Up to All.</head>
<p>In general, it is worth while to inquire of these men, “Is it possible for no man to become
good, or is it in the power of any one?” For if no man is wise, what of Manichæus himself?
I pass over the fact that he not only calls others good, but he also says that they are able to
make others such. But if one individual is entirely good, what prevents all from becoming
good? For what is possible for one is possible also for all. And by the means by which one
has become virtuous, by the same all may become so, unless they assert that the larger share
of this virtue is intercepted by such. Again, therefore, first, What necessity is there for labour
in submitting to discipline (for even whilst sleeping we may become virtuous), or what cause
is there for these men rousing their hearers to hopes of good? For even though wallowing
in the mire with harlots, they can obtain their proper good. But if discipline, and better instruction
and diligence in acquiring virtue, make a man to become virtuous, let all become
so, and that oft-repeated phrase of theirs, the unordered motion of matter, is made void.
But it would be much better for them to say that wisdom is an instrument given by God to
man, in order that by bringing round by degrees to good that which arises to them, from
the fact of their being endowed with sense, out of desire or pleasure, it might remove from
them the absurdities that flow from them. For thus they themselves who profess to be
teachers of virtue would be objects of emulation for their purpose, and for their mode of
life, and there would be great hopes that one day evils will cease, when all men have become
wise. And this it seems to me that Jesus took into consideration; and in order that husbandmen,
carpenters, builders, and other artisans, might not be driven away from good, He
convened a common council of them altogether, and by simple and easy conversations He
both raised them to a sense of God, and brought them to desire what was good.</p>

<p>Moreover, how do they say, did God send divine virtue into matter? For if it always was,
and neither is God to be understood as existing prior to it, nor matter either, then again,
according to Manichæus, there are three first principles. Perhaps also, a little further on,
there will appear to be many more. But if it be adventitious, and something which has come
into existence afterwards, how is it void of matter? And if they make it to be a part of God,
first, indeed, by this conception, they assert that God is composite and corporeal. But this
is absurd, and impossible. And if He fashioned it, and is without matter, I wonder that they
have not considered, neither the man himself, nor his disciples, that if (as the orthodox say,
the things that come next in order subsist while God remains) God created this virtue of
His own free-will, how is it that He is not the author of all other things that are made without
the necessity of any pre-existent matter? The consequences, in truth, of this opinion are
evidently absurd; but what does follow is put down next in order. Was it, then, the nature
of this virtue to diffuse itself into matter? If it was contrary to its nature, in what manner is
it intermingled with it? But if this was in accordance with its nature, it was altogether surely
and always with matter. But if this be so, how is it that they call matter evil, which, from the
beginning, was intermingled with the divine virtue? In what manner, too, will it be destroyed,
the divine virtue which was mingled with it at some time or other seceding to itself? For
that it preserves safely what is good, and likely to be productive of some other good to those
to whom it is present, is more reasonable than that it should bring destruction or some
other evil upon them.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Dissolution and Inherence According to the Manichæans; This is
Well Put, Ad Hominem, with Respect to Manes, Who is Himself in Matter.</head>
<p>This then is the wise assertion which is made by them—namely, that as we see that the
body perishes when the soul is separated from it, so also, when virtue has left matter, that
which is left, which is matter, will be dissolved and perish. First, indeed, they do not perceive
that nothing existent can be destroyed into a nonexistent. For that which is non-existent
does not exist. But when bodies are disintegrated, and experience a change, a dissolution of
them takes place; so that a part of them goes to earth, a part to air, and a part to something
else. Besides, they do not remember that their doctrine is, that matter is unordered motion.
But that which moves of itself, and of which motion is the essence, and not a thing accidentally
belonging to it—how is it reasonable to say that when virtue departs, that which was,
even before virtue descended into it, should cease to be? Nor do they see the difference, that
every body which is devoid of soul is immoveable. For plants also have a vegetable soul. But
motion itself, and yet unordered motion they assert to be the essence of matter. But it were
better, that just as in a lyre which sounds out of tune, by the addition of harmony, everything
is brought into concord; so the divine virtue when intermixed with that unordered motion,
which, according to them, is matter, should add a certain order to it in the place of its innate
disorder, and should always add it suitably to the divine time. For I ask, how was it that
Manichæus himself became fitted to treat of these matters, and when at length did he
enunciate them? For they allow that he himself was an admixture of matter, and of the virtue
received into it. Whether therefore being so, he said these things in unordered motion,
surely the opinion is faulty; or whether he said them by means of the divine virtue, the
dogma is dubious and uncertain; for on the one side, that of the divine virtue, he participates
in the truth; whilst on the side of unordered motion, he is a partaker in the other part, and
changes to falsehood.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Second Virtue of the Manichæans Beset with the Former, and
with New Absurdities; Virtue, Active and Passive, the Fashioner of Matter, and
Concrete with It; Bodies Divided by Manichæus into Three Parts.</head>
<p>But if it had been said that divine virtue both hath adorned and does adorn matter, it
would have been far more wisely said, and in a manner more conducing to conciliate faith
in the doctrine and discourses of Manichæus. But God hath sent down another virtue. What
has been already said with respect to the former virtue, may be equally said with respect to
this, and all the absurdities which follow on the teaching about their first virtue, the same
may be brought forward in the present case. But another, who will tolerate? For why did
not God send some one virtue which could effect everything? If the human mind is so
various towards all things, so that the same man is endowed with a knowledge of geometry,
of astronomy, of the carpenter’s art, and the like, is it then impossible for God to find one
such virtue which should be sufficient for him in all respects, so as not to stand in need of
a first and second? And why has one virtue the force rather of a creator, and another that
of the patient and recipient, so as to be well fitted for admixture with matter. For I do not
again see here the cause of good order, and of that excess which is contrary to it. If it was
evil, it was not in the house of God. For since God is the only good, and matter the only evil,
we must necessarily say that the other things are of a middle nature, and placed as it were
in the middle. But there is found to be a different framer of those things which are of a
middle nature, when they say that one cause is creative, and another admixed with matter?
Perhaps, therefore, it is that primary antecedent cause which more recent writers speak of
in the book περὶ τῶν διαφορῶν. But when the creative virtue took in hand the making of
the world, then they say that there was separated from matter that which, even in the admixture,
remained in its own virtue, and from this the sun and the moon had their beginning.
But that which to a moderate and slight degree had contracted vice and evil, this formed
the heaven and the constellations. Lastly came the rest encompassed within these, just as
they might happen, which are admixtures of the divine virtue and of matter.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—The Divine Virtue in the View of the Same Manichæus Corporeal
and Divisible; The Divine Virtue Itself Matter Which Becomes Everything; This
is Not Fitting.</head>
<p>I, indeed, besides all these things, wonder that they do not perceive that they are making
the divine virtue to be corporeal, and dividing it, as it were, into parts. For why, as in the
case of matter, is not the divine virtue also passible and divisible throughout, and from one
of its parts the sun made, and from another the moon? For clearly this is what they assert
to belong to the divine virtue; and this is what we said was the property of matter, which by
itself is nothing, but when it has received form and qualities, everything is made which is
divided and distinct. If, therefore, as from one subject, the divine virtue, only the sun and
the moon have their beginning, and these things are different, why was anything else made?
But if all things are made, what follows is manifest, that divine virtue is matter, and that,
too, such as is made into forms. But if nothing else but the sun and moon are what was
created by the divine virtue, then what is intermixed with all things is the sun and moon;
and each of the stars is the sun and moon, and each individual animal of. those who live on
land, and of fowls, and of creatures amphibious. But this, not even those who exhibit juggling
tricks would admit, as, I think, is evident to every one.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Some Portions of the Virtue Have Good in Them, Others More
Good; In the Sun and the Moon It is Incorrupt, in Other Things Depraved; An
Improbable Opinion.</head>
<p>But if any one were to apply his mind to what follows, the road would not appear to be
plain and straightforward, but more arduous even than that which has been passed. For
they say that the sun and moon have contracted no stain from their admixture with matter.
And now they cannot say how other things have become deteriorated contrary to their own
proper nature. For if, when it was absolute and by itself, the divine virtue was so constituted
that one portion of it was good, and another had a greater amount of goodness in it, according
to the old tale of the centaurs, who as far as the breast were men, and in the lower part horses,
which are both good animals, but the man is the better of the two; so also, in the divine
virtue, it is to be understood that the one portion of it is the better and the more excellent,
and the other will occupy the second and inferior place. And in the same way, with respect
to matter, the one portion possesses, as it were, an excess of evil; while others again are different,
and about that other the language will be different.2204 For it is possible to conceive
that from the beginning the sun and moon, by a more skilful and prudent judgment, chose
for themselves the parts of matter that were less evil for the purposes of admixture, that they
might remain in their own perfection and virtue; but in the lapse of time, when the evils
lost their force and became old, they brought out so much of the excess in the good, while
the rest of its parts fell away, not, indeed, without foresight, and yet not with the same
foresight, did each object share according to its quantity in the evil that was in matter. But
since, with respect to this virtue, nothing of a different kind is asserted by them, but it is to
be understood throughout to be alike and of the same nature, their argument is improbable;
because in the admixture part remains pure and incorrupt, while the other has contracted
some share of evil.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The Light of the Moon from the Sun; The Inconvenience of the
Opinion that Souls are Received in It; The Two Deluges of the Greeks.</head>
<p>Now, they say that the sun and the moon having by degrees separated the divine virtue
from matter, transmit it to God. But if they had only to a slight degree frequented the schools
of the astronomers, it would not have happened to them to fall into these fancies, nor would
they have been ignorant that the moon, which, according to the opinion of some, is itself
without light, receives its light from the sun, and that its configurations are just in proportion
to its distance from the sun, and that it is then full moon when it is distant from the sun one
hundred and eighty degrees. It is in conjunction when it is in the same degree with the sun.
Then, is it not wonderful how it comes to pass that there should be so many souls, and from
such diverse creatures? For there is the soul of the world itself, and of the animals, of plants,
of nymphs, and demons, and amongst these are distinguished by appearance those of fowls,
of land animals, and animals amphibious; but in the moon one like body is always seen by
us. And what of the continuity of this body? When the moon is half-full, it appears a semicircle,
and when it is in its third quarter, the same again. How then, and with what figure,
are they assumed into the moon? For if it be light as fire, it is probable that they would not
only ascend as far as the moon, but even higher, continually; but if it be heavy, it would not
be possible for them at all to reach the moon. And what is the reason that that which first
arrives at the moon is not immediately transmitted to the sun, but waits for the full moon
until the rest of the souls arrive? When then the moon, from having been full, decreases,
where does the virtue remain during that time? until the moon, which has been emptied of
the former souls, just as a desolated city, shall receive again a fresh colony. For a treasurehouse
should have been marked out in some part of the earth, or of the clouds, or in some
other place, where the congregated souls might stand ready for emigration to the moon.
But, again, a second question arises. What then is the cause that it is not full immediately?
or why does it again wait fifteen days? Nor is this less to be wondered at than that which
has been said, that never within the memory of man has the moon become full after the
fifteen days. Nay, not even—in the time of the deluge of Deucalion, nor in that of Phoroneus,
when all things, so to speak, which were upon the face of the earth perished, and it happened
that a great quantity of virtue was separated from matter. And, besides these things, one
must consider the productiveness of generations, and their barrenness, and also the destruction
of them; and since these things do not happen in order, neither ought the order of the
full moon, nor the these of the waning moon, to be so carefully observed.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Image of Matter in the Sun, After Which Man is Formed;
Trifling Fancies; It is a Mere Fancy, Too, that Man Is Formed from Matter; Man
is Either a Composite Being, or a Soul, or Mind and Understanding.</head>
<p>Neither is this to be regarded with slight attention. For if the divine virtue which is in
matter be infinite, those things cannot diminish it which the sun and moon fashion. For
that which remains from that finite thing which has been assumed is infinite. But if it is finite,
it would be perceived by the senses in intervals proportionate to the amount of its virtue
that had been subtracted from the world. But all things remain as they were. Now what
understanding do these things not transcend in their incredibleness, when they assert that
man was created and formed after the image of matter that is seen in the sun? For images
are the forms of their archetypes. But if they include man’s image in the sun, where is the
exemplar after which his image is formed? For, indeed, they are not going to say that man
is really man, or divine virtue; for this, indeed, they mix up with matter, and they say that
the image is seen in the sun, which, as they think, was formed afterwards from the secretion
of matter. Neither can they bring forward the creative cause of all things, for this they say
was sent to preserve safety to the divine virtue; so that, in their opinion, this must be altogether
ascribed to the sun; for this reason, doubtless, that it happens by his arrival and
presence that the sun and moon are separated from matter.</p>
<p>Moreover, they assert that the image is seen in the star; but they say that matter fashioned
man. In what manner, and by what means? For it is not possible that this should fashion
him. For besides that, thus according to them, man is the empty form of an empty form,
and having no real existence, it has not as yet been possible to conceive how man can be the
product of matter. For the use of reason and sense belongs not to that matter which they
assume. Now what, according to them, is man? Is he a mixture of soul and body? Or another
thing, or that which is superior to the entire soul, the mind? But if he is mind, how can the
more perfect and the better part be the product of that which is worse; or if he be soul (for
this they say is divine virtue), how can they, when they have taken away from God the divine
virtue, subject this to the creating workmanship of matter? But if they leave to him body
alone, let them remember again that it is by itself immovable, and that they say that the essence
of matter is motion. Neither do they think that anything of itself, and its own genius,
is attracted to matter. Nor is it reasonable to lay it down, that what is composed of these
things is the product of this. To think, indeed, that that which is fashioned by any one is
inferior to its fashioner seems to be beyond controversy. For thus the world is inferior to
its Creator or Fashioner, and the works of art inferior to the artificer. If then man be the
product of matter, he must surely be inferior to it. Now, men leave nothing inferior to
matter; and it is not reasonable that the divine virtue should be commingled with matter,
and with that which is inferior to it. But the things which they assert out of indulgence, as

<pb n="595"/>
it were, and by way of dispensation, these they do not seem to understand. For what is the
reason of their thinking that matter has bound the image of God to the substance of man?
Or, why is not the image sufficient, as in a mirror, that man should appear? Or, as the sun
himself is sufficient for the origination and destruction of all things that are made, hath he
imitated an image in the work of their creation? With which of those things which he possessed?
Was it with the divine virtue which was mingled with it, so that the divine virtue
should have the office of an instrument in respect of matter? Is it by unordered motion that
he will thus give matter a form? But all like things, in exquisite and accurate order, by imitating,
attain their end. For they do not suppose that a house, or a ship, or any other product
of art, is effected by disorder; nor a statue which art has fashioned to imitate man.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Christ is Mind, According to the Manichæans; What is He in the
View of the Church? Incongruity in Their Idea of Christ; That He Suffered Only
in Appearance, a Dream of the Manichæans; Nothing is Attributed to the Word
by Way of Fiction.</head>
<p>Christ, too, they do not acknowledge; yet they speak of Christ, but they take some other
element, and giving to the Word, designating His sacred person, some other signification
than that in which it is rightly received, they say that He is mind. But if, when they speak of
Him as that which is known, and that which knows, and wisdom as having the same
meaning, they are found to agree with those things which the Church doctors say of Him,
how comes it then that they reject all that is called ancient history? But let us see whether
they make Him to be something adventitious and new, and which has come on from without,
and by accident, as the opinion of some is. For they who hold this opinion say, as seems
very plausible, that the seventh year, when the powers of perception became distinct, He
made His entrance into the body. But if Christ be mind, as they imagine, then will He be
both Christ and not Christ. For before that mind and sense entered, He was not. But if
Christ, as they will have it, be mind, then into Him already existing does the mind make its
entrance, and thus, again, according to their opinion, will it be mind. Christ, therefore, is
and is not at the same time. But if, according to the more approved sect of them, mind is
all things which are, since they assume matter to be not produced, and coeval so to speak
with God, this first mind and matter they hold to be Christ; if, indeed, Christ be the mind,
which is all things, and matter is one of those things which are, and is itself not produced.</p>
<p>They say it was by way of appearance, and in this manner, that the divine virtue in
matter was affixed to the cross; and that He Himself did not undergo this punishment, since
it was impossible that He should suffer this; which assertion Manichæus himself has taken
in hand to teach in a book written upon the subject, that the divine virtue was enclosed in
matter, and again departs from it. The mode of this they invent. That it should be said, indeed,
in the doctrine of the Church, that He gave Himself up for the remission of sins, obtains
credit from the vulgar, and appears likewise in the Greek histories, which say that some
“surrendered themselves to death in order to ensure safety to their countrymen.” And of
this doctrine the Jewish history has an example, which prepares the son of Abraham as a
sacrifice to God.2205 But to subject Christ to His passion merely for the sake of display, betrays
great ignorance, for the Word is God’s representative, to teach and inform us of actual verities.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—The Manichæan Abstinence from Living Things Ridiculous; Their
Madness in Abhorring Marriage; The Mythology of the Giants; Too Allegorical
an Exposition.</head>
<p>They abstain also from living things. If, indeed, the reason of their abstinence were
other than it is, it ought not to be too curiously investigated. But if they do so for this reason,
that the divine virtue is more or less absent or present to them, this their meaning is ridiculous.
For if plants be more material, how is it in accordance with reason to use that which
is inferior for food and sustenance? or, if there be more of the divine virtue in them, how
are things of this sort useful as food, when the soul’s faculty of nourishing and making increase
is more corporeal? Now in that they abstain from marriage and the rites of Venus,
fearing lest by the succession of the race the divine virtue should dwell more in matter, I
wonder how in thinking so they allow of themselves? For if neither the providence of God
suffices, both by generations and by those things which are always and in the same manner
existent, to separate off the divine virtue from matter, what can the cunning and subtlety
of Manichæus effect for that purpose? For assuredly by no giant’s co-operation does assistance
come to God, in order by the removal of generations to make the retreat of the divine virtue
from matter quick and speedy. But what the poets say about the giants is manifestly a fable.
For those who lay it down about these, bring forward such matters in allegories, by a species
of fable hiding the majesty of their discourse; as, for instance, when the Jewish history relates
that angels came down to hold2206 intercourse with the daughters of men; for this saying
signifies that the nutritive powers of the soul descended from heaven to earth. But the poets
who say that they, when they had emerged in full armour from the earth, perished immediately
after they stirred up rebellion against the gods, in order that they might insinuate the
frail and quickly-perishing constitution of the body, adorn their poetry in this way for the
sake of refreshing the soul by the strangeness of the occurrence. But these, understanding
nothing of all this, wheresoever they can get hold of a paralogism from whatsoever quarter
it comes, greedily seize on it as a God-send, and strive with all their arts to overturn truth
by any means.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The Much-Talked-of Fire of the Manichæans; That Fire Matter
Itself.</head>
<p>That fire, endowed indeed with the power of burning, yet possessing no light, which is
outside the world, in what region has it place? For if it is in the world, why does the world
hitherto continue safe? For if at some time or other it is to destroy it, by approaching it, now
also it is conjoined with it. But if it be apart from it, as it were on high in its own region,
what will hereafter happen to make it descend upon the world? Or in what way will it leave
its own place, and by what necessity and violence? And what substance of fire can be conceived
without fuel, and how can what is moist serve as fuel to it, unless what is rather
physiologically said about this does not fall within the province of our present disquisition?
But this is quite manifest from what has been said. For the fire existing outside the world is
just that which they call matter, since the sun and the moon, being the purest of the pure,
by their divine virtue, are separate and distinct from that fire, no part of them being left in
it. This fire is matter itself, absolutely and per se, entirely removed from all admixture with
the divine virtue. Wherefore when the world has been emptied of all the divine virtue which
is opposed to it, and again a fire of this sort shall be left remaining, how then shall the fire
either destroy anything, or be consumed by it? For, from that which is like, I do not see in
what way corruption is to take place. For what matter will become when the divine virtue
has been separated from it, this it was before that the divine virtue was commingled with
it. If indeed matter is to perish when it is bereft of the divine virtue, why did it not perish
before it came in contact with the divine virtue, or any creative energy? Was it in order that
matter might successively perish, and do this ad infinitum? And what is the use of this? For
that which had not place from the first volition, how shall this have place from one following?
or what reason is there for God to put off things which, not even in the case of a man, appears
to be well? For as regards those who deliberate about what is impossible, this is said to
happen to them, that they do not wish for that which is possible. But if nothing else, they
speak of God transcending substance, and bring Him forward as some new material, and
that not such as intelligent men always think to be joined with Him, but that which investigation
discovers either to be not existing at all, or to be the extreme of all things, and which
can with difficulty be conceived of by the human mind. For this fire, devoid of light, is it of
more force than matter, which is to be left desolate by divine virtue, or is it of less? And if
it is of less, how will it overcome that which is of more? but if it is of more, it will be able to
bring it back to itself, being of the same nature; yet will it not destroy it, as neither does the
Nile swallow up the streams that are divided off from it.</p>

<head>Elucidation.</head>
<p>If anything could be more dreary than the Manichæan heresy itself, it may be questioned
whether it be not the various views that have been entertained concerning our author. I
have often remarked the condensation of valuable information given by Dr. Murdock in
his notes upon Mosheim, but he fails to get in the half that needs to be noted.2207 He tells
us that “Alexander of Lycopolis flourished probably about a.d. 350.” He adds, “Fabricius
supposes that he was first a Pagan and a Manichee, and afterwards a Catholic Christian.
Cave is of the same opinion. Beausobre thinks he was a mere pagan.2208 Lardner thinks he
was a Gentile, but well acquainted with the Manichees and other Christians,2209 and that
he had some knowledge of the Old and New Testaments, to which he occasionally refers. He
speaks with respect of Christ and the Christian philosophy, and appears to have been “a
learned and candid man.” Of an eminent Christian bishop, all this seems very puzzling; and
I feel it a sort of duty to the youthful student to give the statements of the learned Lardner
in an abridged form, with such references to the preceding pages as may serve in place of a
series of elucidations.</p>
<p>According to this invaluable critic, the learned are not able to agree concerning Alexander.
Some think he was a Christian, others believe that he was a heathen. Fabricius, who
places him in the fourth century, holds to this latter opinion;2210 all which agrees with our
Cave.2211 Photius makes him Archbishop of Nicopolis.2212 Tillemont thinks2213 he was a
pagan philosopher, who wrote to persuade his friends to prefer “the doctrine of the churches”
to that of Manes. Combefis, his editor,2214 thinks him very ancient, because he appears to
have learned the principles of this heresy from the immediate disciples of the heretic.

<pb n="600"/>
Beausobre,2215 the standard authority, is of like opinion, and Mosheim approves his reasoning.</p>
<p>Nothing in his work, according to Lardner, proves that our author wrote near the beginning
of the fourth century, and he decides upon the middle of that century as his epoch.</p>
<p>Alexander gives a very honourable character to the genuine Christian philosophy, and
asserts its adaptation to the common people, and, indeed, to all sorts of men.2216 He certainly
is not mute as to Christ. His tribute to the Saviour is, if not affectionate, yet a just award to
Him.2217 By the “council of all together,” he intends the College of the Apostles,2218 made
up of fishermen and publicans and tent-makers, in which he sees a design of the blessed
Jesus to meet this class, and, in short, all classes. It is clear enough that Alexander has some
knowledge of Christ, some knowledge of the received doctrine of the churches,2219 or orthodox
Christians; and he appears to blame the Manichees for not receiving the Scripture
of the Old Testament.2220</p>
<p>He argues against their absurd opinion that Christ was “Mind;”2221 also that, though
crucified, He did not suffer:2222 and he affirms2223 that it would be more reasonable to say,
agreeably to the ecclesiastical doctrine, that “He gave Himself for the remission of sins.” He
refers to the sacrifice of Isaac,2224 and to the story of Cain and Abel;2225 also to the mysterious
subject of the angels and the daughters of men.2226 Like an Alexandrian theologian,
he expounds this, however, against the literal sense, as an allegory.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Peter, Bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>[a.d. 2602227–300–311.] Entering upon the fourth century, we may well pause to reflect
upon what Alexandria has been to the Church of Christ,—the mother of churches, the
mother of saints, maintaining always the intellectual and even the ecclesiastical primacy of
Christendom. “Ye are the light of the world,” said the great Enlightener to the Galileans of
an obscure and despised Roman province. But who could have prophesied that Egypt should
again be the pharos of the world, as it was in Moses? Who could have foreseen the “men of
Galilee” taking possession of the Alexandrian Library, and demonstrating the ways of
Providence in creating the Bible of the Seventy, and in the formation of the Hellenistic
Greek, for their ultimate use? Who could have imagined the Evangelist Mark and the eloquent
Apollos to be the destined instruments for founding the schools of Christendom, and
shaping scientific theology? Who would not have looked for all this in some other way, and
preferably in Athens or in Rome? But who would have expected the visit of God Incarnate
to Nazareth, and not to Alexandria?</p>
<p>In Peter’s day Antioch was coming to be a school under the influence of Malchion’s
genius and that of the bishops who withstood Paulus of Samosata. Malchion had taught
there in the “School of Sciences,” and learning was once more to be made the handmaid of
true religion. But Alexandria was still the seat of Christian illumination and the fountain of
orthodoxy; its very ferment always clarifying its thought, and leaving “wine well refined,”
and pure from the lees.</p>
<p>To this subject I shall have occasion to refer again in an elucidation subjoined to the
works of Alexander (successor to Peter), in which, for a final view of the great Alexandrian
school, I shall gather up some fragments in brief outline. Here it may be enough to remark,
that, until the definite development of the school of Antioch (circa a.d. 350), I have regarded
the whole Orient as dominated and formed by the brain of the grand metropolis of Egypt
and the Pentapolis. I have considered the great Dionysius as really presiding in the Synod
of Antioch, though absent in the body, and have regarded Malchion as his voice in that
council, which we must not forget was presided over by Firmilian, a pupil of Origen, and a
true Alexandrian disciple.</p>
<note type="footnote">2227 This first date is conjectural.</note>

<pb n="604"/>
<p>Peter’s conflict with Meletius shall be noted in an elucidation. We shall see that the
heresy of Paulus as well as the Meletian schism are but chapters in one prolonged history,
of which the outcrop was Arianism. Now, as to Alexandria we owe the intrepid defenders
of truth in all these conflicts, we must not forget that they are to be judged by the product
of their united testimony, and not by their occasional individualisms and infirmities of mind
and speech while they were creating the theological dialect of Christendom and the formulas
of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Peter was able to maintain his canonical authority against the mischievous rebellion of
Meletius; and the history of this schism is forcibly illustrative of those ἀρχαῖα ἔθη which
the Nicene Synod recognized, confirming the primacy of Alexandria, and striving to suppress
Meletianism by firm but moderate measures based upon the primitive maxims. Peter left a
pure and holy memory to the Church, and sealed his testimony in martyrdom.</p>

<head>Translator’s Introductory Notice.2228</head>
<p>Eusebius alone, of the more ancient writers, speaks in terms of the highest praise of
Peter, Bishop of Alexandria. He was, says he, a divine bishop, both for the sanctity of his
life, and also for his diligent study and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures;2229 and in another
place he styles him “that excellent doctor of the Christian religion,” who, indeed, during the
whole period of his episcopate, which he held for twelve years, obtained for himself the
highest renown. He obtained the bishopric of Alexandria next in succession to Theonas.
He governed that church about three years before the persecution broke out:2230 the rest
of his time he spent in the exercise of a closer discipline over himself, yet did he not in the
meanwhile neglect to provide for the common interests of the Church. In the ninth year of
the persecution he was beheaded, and gained the crown of martyrdom. So far we have the
account of Eusebius, whom Dodwell2231 proves to have accurately distributed the years of
Peter’s episcopate. After Peter had spent twelve years as bishop, and in the ninth year of the
persecution which broke out under Maximin, he was beheaded; so that his martyrdom falls
in the year of our Lord 311—as the Egyptians reckon on the 29th day of the month Athyr,
which answers to our 25th of November, as Lequien,2232 after Renaudot,2233 has observed.</p>

<p>St. Peter wrote in the fourth year of the persecution, a.d. 306, some Canons Penitential
with reference to those who had lapsed. They are to be met with in every collection of Canons.
In the Pandecta Canonum of Bishop Beveridge,2234 they are accompanied by the notes of
Joannes Zonaras and Theodorus Balsamon. Upon these Penitential Canons, however,
Tillemont2235 should be consulted. Moreover, according to Renaudot,2236 Echmimensis,
Ebnapalus, Abulfaragius, and other Oriental Christians of every sect, make use of the testimony
of these Canons; and in the anonymous collections of them called Responsa, some
fragments of other works of Peter are extant. Some of these are praised by the Jacobites, in
the work which they call Fides patrum. In another work, entitled Unio pretiosus, occurs a
homily of Peter on the baptism of Christ.</p>
<p>The fragments of the other writings of this holy martyr, which have been preserved by
the Greeks, are here appended to the Penitential Canons. For instance: (1) An extract from
his book De Deitate, which is extant in the Acta Conciliorum Ephesini et Chalcedonensis;
(2) Another fragment from the homily De Adventu Salvatoris, cited by Leontius Byzantinus
in his first book against Nestorius and Eutyches; (3) An epistle of the same prelate to the
Alexandrine Church recently published, together with some other old ecclesiastical monuments
by Scipio Maffei.2237 Peter is said to have written this epistle after one addressed to
Meletius, Bishop of Lycopolis. In it, after interdicting the Alexandrians from communion
with Meletius, he says that he will himself come in company with some wise doctors, and
will examine into his tenets; alluding, most probably, to the synod held afterwards at Alexandria,
in which Meletius was deposed from his office. Athanasius says,2238 respecting this
synod, “Peter, who was amongst us as bishop before the persecution, and who died a martyr
in the persecution, deposed in common council of the bishops, Meletius, an Egyptian bishop,
who had been convicted of many crimes.” But with respect to the time in which the
mournful Meletian schism commenced, Maffei2239 defends the opinions of Baronius,2240
who connects it with the year a.d. 306, against Pagius and Montfaucon, both from this epistle
of Petrus Alexandrinus, and also from another of the four bishops, of which Peter makes
mention in his own; (4) A passage from the Sermo in Sanctum Pascha, or from some other
work of Peter’s on the same subject, is given in the Diatriba de Paschate, prefixed to the

<head>The Genuine Acts of Peter.2241</head>
<p>Were all the limbs of my body to be turned into tongues, and all the joints of my limbs
to utter articulate sounds, it would noways be sufficient to express who, how great and how
good, was our most blessed Father Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria. Especially incongruous
do I consider it to commit to paper what perils he underwent by tyrants, what conflicts he
endured with Gentiles and heretics, lest I should seem to make these the subjects of my
panegyric rather than that passion to which he manfully submitted to make safe the people
of God. Nevertheless, because the office of the narrator must fail in narrating his inmost
conversation and wonderful deeds, and language is noways sufficient for the task, I have
considered it convenient to describe only those exploits of his by which he is known to have
attained to the pontificate,2242 and after Arius had been cut off from the unity of the
Church,2243 to have been crowned with the martyr’s laurel. Yet this do I consider to be a
glorious end, and a spectacle of a magnificent contest, sufficient for those who do not doubt
of a truthful narration, which is unstained by falsehood. In commencing, therefore, our account
of the episcopate of this most holy man, let us call to our aid his own language, in
order that we may make it co-operate with our own style.</p>
<p>Alexandria is a city of exceeding magnitude, which holds the first place not only among
the Egyptians, but the Thebans also and the Libyans, who are at no great distance from
Egypt.2244 A cycle of two hundred and eighty-five years from the incarnation of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ had rolled round, when the venerable Theonas, the bishop of this
city, by an ethereal flight, mounted upwards to the celestial kingdoms. To him Peter, suc-
<note type="footnote">2241 As interpreted by Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Apud Maium, Spicilegii, tom. iii. p. 671. That Anastasius
Bibliothecarius translated from the Greek the Passion of St. Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, is affirmed by Anastasius
himself in his prologue, Ad Passionem Martyrum, MCCCCLXXX., published by Mabillon in the Museum
Italicum, tom. i. part ii, p. 80: “Post translatam a me ad petitionem sanctitatis tunæ (he is addressing Peter,
Bishop of Gavinum), passionem præcipui doctoris et martyris, Petri Alexandrinæ urbis episcopi.” And then an
anonymous biographer of John viii., in Muratori R. I. S., tom. iii. p. i. p. 269, confirms the same. Anastasius, the
librarian of the Roman church, translated from the Greek into Latin the Passion of St. Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria.
But it is a matter of conjecture which of the different Passions of St. Peter Anastasius translated. Of
the Acts of St. Peter, there are three different records:—(1) Acta Sincera, which, according to Baronius, are the
most genuine. (2) A shorter Latin version, by Surius. (3) A Greek version, by Combefis.</note>

ceeding at the helm of the Church, was by all the clergy and the whole Christian community
appointed bishop, the sixteenth in order from Mark the Evangelist, who was also archbishop
of the city. He in truth, like Phosphor rising among the stars, shining forth with the radiance
of his sacred virtues, most magnificently governed the citadel of the faith. Inferior to none
who had gone before him in his knowledge of Holy Scripture, he nobly applied himself to
the advantage and instruction of the Church; being of singular prudence, and in all things
perfect, a true priest and victim of God, he watchfully laboured night and day in every sacerdotal
care.</p>
<p>But because virtue is the mark of the zealot, “it is the tops of the mountains that are
struck by lightning,”2245 he hence endured multifarious conflicts with rivals. Why need I
say more? He lived in persecution almost the whole of his life. Meanwhile he ordained fiftyfive
bishops. Meletius lastly—in mind and name most black—was made the schismatical
bishop of the city of Lycopolis, doing many things against the rule of the canons, and surpassing
even the bloody soldiery in cruelty who, at the time of the Lord’s Passion, feared to
rend His coat; he was so hurried on by giving the rein to his madness, that, rending asunder
the Catholic Church not only in the cities of Egypt, but even in its villages, he ordained
bishops of his own party, nor cared he aught for Peter, nor for Christ, who was in the person
of Peter. To him Arius, who was yet a laic, and not marked with the clerical tonsure,2246
adhered, and was to him and his family most dear; and not without reason: every animal,
as says the Scripture, loves its like. But upon this coming to his knowledge, the man of God
being affected with grief, said that this persecution was worse than the former. And although
he was in hiding, yet, so far as his strength permitted, directing everywhere his exhortations,
and preaching up the unity of the Church, he strengthened men to withstand the ignorance
and nefarious temerity of Meletius. Whence it came to pass that not a few, being influenced
by his salutary admonitions, departed from the Meletian impiety.</p>
<p>Nearly about the same time Arius, armed with a viper’s craft, as if deserting the party
of Meletius, fled for refuge to Peter, who at the request of the bishops raised him to the
honours of the diaconate, being ignorant of his exceeding hypocrisy. For he was even as a
snake suffused with deadly poison. Yet neither can the imposition of hands upon this false
one be imputed as a crime to this holy man, as the simulated magic arts of Simon is not
ascribed to Philip. Meanwhile, the detestable wickedness of the Meletians increased beyond
measure; and the blessed Peter, fearing lest the plague of heresy should spread over the

<pb n="609"/>
whole flock committed to his care, and knowing that there is no fellowship with light and
darkness, and no concord betwixt Christ and Belial, by letter separated the Meletians from
the communion of the Church. And because an evil disposition cannot long be concealed,
upon that instant the wicked Arius, when he saw his aiders and abettors cast down from
the dignity of the Church, gave way to sadness and lamentation.
This did not escape the
notice of this holy man. For when his hypocrisy was laid bare, immediately using the evangelical
sword, “If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee,”2247 and cutting
off Arius from the body of the Church as a putrid limb, he expelled and banished him from
the communion of the faithful.</p>
<p>This done, the storm of persecution suddenly abating, peace, although for a short time,
smiled. Then this most choice priest of the Lord shone manifestly before the people, and
the faithful began to run in crowds to keep the memory of the martyrs, and to assemble in
congregations to the praise of Christ. Whom this priest of the divine law quickened with
his holy eloquence, and so roused and strengthened that the multitude of believers increased
continually in the Church. But the old enemy of salvation of man did not long remain quiet
and look on these things with favouring eyes. For on a sudden the storm-cloud of paganism
gave forth its hostile thunder, and like a winter shower struck against the serenity of the
Church, and chased it away in flight. But that this may be understood more clearly, we must
necessarily turn back to the atrocities of Diocletian, that impious one, and rebel against
God, and also to Maximian Galerius, who at that time, with his son Maximin, harassed the
regions of the East with his tyrannical sway.</p>
<p>For in the time of this man the fire of Christian persecution so raged, that not only in
one region of the universe, but even throughout the whole world, both by land and by sea,
the storm of impiety gave forth its thunder. The imperial edicts and most cruel decrees
running hither and thither, the worshippers of Christ were put to death now openly, and
now by clandestine snares; no day, no night, passed off free from the effusion of Christian
blood. Nor was the type of slaughter of one kind alone; some were slain with diverse and
most bitter tortures; some again, that they might want the humanity of kinsmen, and burial
in their own country, were transported to other climes, and by certain new machinations
of punishment, and as yet to the age unknown, were driven to the goal of martyrdom. Oh,
the horrible wickedness! So great was their impiety that they even upturned from their
foundations the sanctuaries of divine worship, and burned the sacred books in the fire.
Diocletian of execrable memory having died, Constantinus Major was elected to administer
the kingdom, and in the western parts began to hold the reins of government.</p>
<note type="footnote">2247 Matt. v. 29.</note>

<pb n="610"/>
<p>In these days information was brought to Maximin about the aforesaid archbishop,2248
that he was a leader and holding chief place among the Christians; and he, inflamed with
his accustomed iniquity, on the instant ordered Peter to be apprehended and cast into
prison. For which purpose he despatched to Alexandria five tribunes, accompanied with
their bands of soldiers, who, coming thither as they had been commanded, suddenly seized
the priest of Christ and committed him to the custody of a prison. Wonderful was the devotion
of the faithful! When it was known that this holy man was shut up in the dungeon of
the prison, an incredibly large number ran together, principally a band of monks and of
virgins, and with no material arms, but with rivers of tears and the affection of pious minds.
surrounded the prison’s circuit.2249 And as good sons towards a good father, nay, rather as
the Christian members of a most Christian head, adhered to him with all their bowels of
compassion, and were to him as walls, observing that no pagan might get an opportunity
of access to him. One indeed was the vow of all, one their voice, and one their compassion
and resolve to die rather than see any evil happen to this holy man. Now while the man of
God was being kept for a few days in the same stocks, with his body thrust back, the tribunes
made a suggestion to the king concerning him, but he, after his ferocious manner, gave his
sentence for capitally punishing the most blessed patriarch. And when this got to the ears
of the Christians, they all with one mind began to guard the approaches to the prison with
groaning and lamentation, and persistently prevented any Gentile from obtaining access to
him. And when the tribunes could by no means approach him to put him to death, they
held a council, and determined that the soldiers should with drawn swords break in upon
the crowd of people, and so draw him forth to behead him; and if any one opposed, he
should be put to death.</p>
<p>Arius, in the meanwhile, having as yet been endowed only with the dignity of a Levite,2250
and fearing lest, after the death of so great a father, he should noways be able to get reconciled
to the Church, came to those who held the chief place amongst the clergy, and, hypocrite
that he was, by his sorrowful entreaties and plausible discourse, endeavoured to persuade
the holy archbishop to extend to him his compassion, and to release him from the ban of
excommunication. But what is more deceptive than a feigned heart? What more simple
than a holy composure? There was no delay; those who had been requested went in to the
priest of Christ, and, after the customary oration, prostrating themselves on the ground,

and with groans and tears kissing his sacred hands, implored him, saying: “Thee, indeed,
most blessed father, for the excellence of thy faith, the Lord hath called to receive the martyr’s
crown, which we noways doubt does quickly await thee. Therefore do we think it right that,
with thy accustomed piety, thou shouldest. pardon Arius, and extend thy indulgence to his
lamentations.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this the man of God, moved with indignation, put them aside, and, raising
his hands to heaven, exclaimed: “Do ye dare to supplicate me on behalf of Arius? Arius,
both here and in the future world, will always remain banished and separate from the glory
of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord.”2251 He thus protesting, all who were present,
being struck with terror, like men dumb, kept silence. Moreover they suspected that he, not
without some divine notification,2252 gave forth such a sentence against Arius. But when
the merciful father beheld them silent and sad from compunction of heart, he would not
persist in austerity, or leave them, as if in contempt, without satisfaction; but taking Achillas
and Alexander, who amongst the priests appeared to be the elders and the most holy, having
one of them at his right hand, and the other on his left, he separated them a little from the
rest, and at the end of his discourse said to them: “Do not, my brethren, take me for a man
inhuman and stern; for indeed I too am living under the law of sin; but believe my words.
The hidden treachery of Arias surpasses all iniquity and impiety, and not asserting this of
mine own self, have I sanctioned his excommunication. For in this night, whilst I was solemnly
pouring forth my prayers to God, there stood by me a boy of about twelve years, the
brightness of whose face I could not endure, for this whole cell in which we stand was radiant
with a great light. He was clothed with a linen tunic2253 divided into two parts, from the
neck to the feet, and holding in his two hands the rents of the tunic, he applied them to his

even as he has separated the Son of God from the glory and substance of His Father. But Arius had not as yet
laid bare his heresy, but had been excluded from the Church for joining in the Meletian schism, and a suspicious
course of action.</note>

the deacon’s vestment when assisting at the holy communion; while that worn by sub-deacons, called by the
Anglo-Saxons “roc,” and “tunicle” generally after the 13th century, was of the same form, but smaller and less
ornamented (Palmer, Orig. Liturgicæ, vol. ii. p. 314). The word, in its classical use, meant an under-garment
with its sleeves curtailed (κολοβός)—i.e., reaching only half down to the elbow, or entirely without sleeves. [But

breast to cover his nudity. At this vision I was stupefied with astonishment. And when
boldness of speech was given to me, I exclaimed: Lord, who hath rent thy tunic? Then said
he, Arius hath rent it, and by all means beware of receiving him into communion; behold,
to-morrow they will come to entreat you for him. See, therefore, that thou be not persuaded
to acquiesce: nay, rather lay thy commands upon Achillas and Alexander the priests, who
after thy translation will rule my Church, not by any means to receive him. Thou shalt very
quickly fulfil the lot of the martyr. Now there was no other cause of this vision. So now I
have satisfied you, and I have declared unto you what I was ordered. But what you will do
in consequence of this, must be your own care.” Thus much concerning Arius.</p>
<p>He continued: “Ye know too, beloved, and ye know well, what has been the manner of
my conversation amongst you, and what conflicts I have endured from the idolatrous
Gentiles, who, being ignorant of the Lord and Saviour, do not cease in their madness to
spread abroad the fame of a multitude of gods who are no gods. Ye know likewise how, in
avoiding the rage of my persecutors, I wandered an exile from place to place. For long time
I lay in hiding in Mesopotamia, and also in Syria amongst the Phoenicians; in either Palestine
also I had for a long time to wander: and from thence, if I may so say, in another clement,
that is, in the islands, I tarried no short time. Yet in the midst of all these calamities I did
not cease day and night writing to the Lord’s flock committed to my poor care, and confirming
them in the unity of Christ. For an anxious solicitude for them constantly kept urging
my heart, and suffered me not to rest; then only did I think it to be more tolerable to me
when I committed them to the Power above.</p>
<p>“Likewise also, on account of those fortunate prelates, Phileus, I mean, Hesychius and
Theodorus, who of divine grace have received a worthy vocation, what great tribulation
agitated my mind. For these, as ye know, for the faith of Christ were with the rest of the
confessors wasted with diverse torments. And because in such a conflict they were not only
of the clergy but of the laity also the standard-bearers and preceptors, I on this account
greatly feared lest they should be found wanting under their long affliction, and lest their
defection, which is terrible to speak of, should be to many an occasion of stumbling and of
denying the faith, for there were more than six hundred and sixty confined along with them
within the precincts of a dungeon. Hence, although oppressed with great labour and toil, I
ceased not to write to them with reference to all those predicted passages,2254 exhorting
them to earn the martyr’s palm with the power of divine inspiration. But when I heard of
their magnificent perseverance, and the glorious end of the passion of them all, falling on
the ground I adored the majesty of Christ, who had thought fit to count them amongst the
throng of the martyrs.</p>

<p>“Why should I speak to you about Meletius of Lycopolis? What persecutions, what
treachery, he directed against me, I doubt not but that ye well know. Oh, the horrible
wickedness! he feared not to rend asunder the holy Church, which the Son of God redeemed
with His precious blood, and to deliver which from the tyranny of the devil He hesitated
not to lay down His life. This Church, as I have begin to say, the wicked Meletius rending
asunder, ceased not to imprison in dungeons, and to afflict holy bishops even, who have a
little before us by martyrdom penetrated to the heavens. Beware therefore of his insidious
devices. For I, as ye see, go bound by divine charity, preferring above all things the will of
God. I know, indeed, that under their breath the tribunes whisper of my death with eager
haste; but I will not from this circumstance open any communication with them, nor will
I count my life more precious than myself. Nay, rather, I am prepared to finish the course
which my Lord Jesus Christ hath deigned to promise to me, and faithfully render up to Him
the ministry which from Him I have received. Pray for me, my brothers; you will not see
me longer living in this life with you. Wherefore I testify before God and your brotherhood,
that before all of you have I preserved a clean conscience. For I have not shunned to declare

in the Church speaking perverse things,2255 and will again divide it, like Meletius, drawing

bowels, be watchful; for ye must undergo many tribulations. For we are no better than our
fathers. Are ye ignorant what things my father endured from the Gentiles, he who brought
me up, the most holy bishop Theonas, whose pontifical2256 chair I have under taken to fill?
Would that I had his manners also! Why too should I speak of the great Dionysius his predecessor,
who wandering from place to place sustained many calamities from the frantic
Sabellius? Nor will I omit to mention you, ye most holy fathers and high priests of the divine
law, Heraclius and Demetrius, for whom Origen, that framer of a perverse dogma, laid many
temptations, who cast upon the Church a detestable schism, which to this day is throwing
it into confusion. But the grace of God which then protected them, will, I believe, protect
you also. But why do I delay you longer, my very dear brethren, with the outpouring of my
prolix discourse. It remains, that with the last words of the Apostle2257 who thus prayed I

address you: ‘And now I commend you to God and the word of His grace, which is powerful
to direct both you and His flock.’” When he had finished, falling on his knees, he prayed
with them. And his speech ended, Achillas and Alexander kissing his hands and feet and
bursting into tears sobbed bitterly, specially grieving at those words of his which they heard
when he said that they should henceforth see him in this life no more. Then this most gentle
teacher going to the rest of the clergy, who, as I have said, had come in to him to speak in
behalf of Arius, spake to them his last consoling words, and such as were necessary; then
pouring forth his prayers to God, and bidding them adieu, he dismissed them all in peace.2258</p>
<p>These things having thus ended, it was everywhere published far and wide that Arius
had not been cut off from the Catholic unity without a divine interposition. But that contriver
of deceit, and disseminator of all wickedness, ceased not to keep hidden his viper’s poison
in the labyrinth of his bosom, hoping that he should be reconciled by Achillas and Alexander.
This is that Arius the heresiarch, the divider of the consubstantial and indivisible Trinity.
This is he who with rash and wicked mouth, was not afraid to blaspheme the Lord and Saviour,
beyond all other heretics; the Lord, I say, and Saviour, who out of pity for our human
wanderings, and being sorely grieved that the world should perish in deadly destruction
and condemnation, deigned for us all to suffer in the flesh. For it is not to be believed that
the Godhead which is impassible was subject to the passion. But because the theologians
and fathers have taken care in better style to remove from Catholic ears the blasphemies of
this nature, and another task is ours, let us return to our subject.</p>
<p>This most sagacious pontiff2259 then, perceiving the cruel device of the tribunes, who,
in order to bring about his death, were willing to put to the sword the whole Christian
multitude that was present, was unwilling that they should together with him taste the bitterness
of death, but as a faithful servant imitating his Lord and Saviour, whose acts were
even as his words, “The good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep,”2260 prompted by his
piety, called to him an elder of those who there waited on his words, and said to him: “Go
to the tribunes who seek to kill me, and say to them, Cease ye from all your anxiety, lo! I
am ready and willing of mine own accord to give myself to them.” Bid them come this night
to the rereward of the house of this prison, and in the spot in which they shall hear a signal
given on the wall from within, there let them make an excavation, and take me and do with
me as they have been commanded. The elder, obeying the commands of this most holy
man,—for so great a father could not be contradicted,—departed to the tribunes, and made
the intimation to them as he had been commanded. They, when they had received it, were

exceedingly rejoiced, and taking with them some stonemasons, came about the dawn of the
day without their soldiers to the place which had been pointed out to them. The man of
God had passed the whole night as a vigil, without sleep, in prayer and watchfulness. But
when he heard their approach, whilst all who were with him were rapt in slumber, with a
slow and gentle step he descended to the interior part of the prison, and according to the
agreement made, made a sound on the wall; and those outside hearing this, forcing an
aperture, received this athlete of Christ armed on all sides with no brazen breastplate, but
with the virtue of the cross of the Lord, and fully prepared to carry out the Lord’s words
who said, “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather
fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”2261 Wonderful was the occurrence!
Such a heavy whirlwind of wind and rain prevailed during that night, that no one of
those who kept the door of the prison could hear the sound of the excavation. This martyr
most constant too, kept urging on his murderers, saying, Do what ye are about to do, before
those are aware who are guarding me.</p>
<p>But they took him up and brought him to the place called Bucolia, where the holy St.
Mark underwent martyrdom for Christ. Astonishing is the virtue of the saints! As they
carried him along, and beheld his great constancy and strength of mind when in peril of
death, on a sudden a fear and trembling came upon them to such a degree, that none of
them could look stedfastly into his face. Moreover, the blessed martyr entreated them to
allow him to go to the tomb of St. Mark, for he desired to commend himself to his patronage.
2262 But they from confusion, looking down on the ground, said, “Do as you wish, but
make haste.” Therefore approaching the burial-place of the evangelist, he embraced it, and
speaking to him as if he were yet alive in the flesh, and able to hear him, he prayed after this
manner: “O father most honourable, thou evangelist of the only-begotten Saviour, thou
witness of His passion, thee did Christ choose, who is the Deliverer of us all, to be the first
pontiff and pillar of this See; to thee did He commit the task of proclaiming the faith
throughout the whole of Egypt and its boundaries. Thou, I say, hast watchfully fulfilled that
ministry of our human salvation which was intrusted to thee; as the reward of this labour
thou hast doubtless obtained the martyr’s palm. Hence, not without justice, art thou counted
worthy to be saluted evangelist and bishop. Thy successor was Anianus, and the rest in
descending series down to the most blessed Theonas, who disciplined my infancy, and
deigned to educate my heart. To whom I, a sinner and unworthy, have been beyond my
deservings appointed as successor by an hereditary descent. And, what is best of all, lo! the
largeness of the divine bounty has granted me to become a martyr of His precious cross and
joyful resurrection, giving to my devotion the sweet and pleasant odour of His passion, that

I should be made meet to pour out unto Him the offering of my blood. And because the
time of making this offering is now instant, pray for me that, the divine power assisting me,
I may be meet to reach the goal of this agony with a stout heart and ready faith. I commend
also to thy glorious patronage the flock of Christ’s worshippers which was committed to
my pastoral care; to thee, I say, I with prayers commend it, who are approved as the author
and guardian of all preceding and subsequent occupiers of this pontifical chair, and who,
holding its first honours, art the successor not of man, but of the God-man, Christ Jesus.”
Saying these words,2263 he went back to a little distance from the sacred tomb, and, raising
his hands to heaven, prayed with a loud voice, saying: “O thou Only-begotten, Jesus Christ,
Word of the Eternal Father, hear me invoking Thy clemency. Speak peace, I beseech Thee,
to the tempest that shakes Thy Church, and with the effusion of my blood, who am Thy
servant, make an end to the persecution of Thy people.” Then a certain virgin dedicated to
God, who had her cell adjoining to the tomb of the evangelist, as she was spending the night
in prayer, heard a voice from heaven, saying: “Peter was the first of the apostles, Peter is the
last of the martyred bishops of Alexandria.”</p>
<p>Having ended his prayer, he kissed the tomb of the blessed evangelist, and of the other
pontiffs who were buried there, and went forth to the tribunes. But they seeing his face as
it had been the face of an angel, being terror-stricken, feared to speak to him of his instant
agony. Nevertheless, because God does not desert those who trust in Him, He willed not to
leave His martyr without consolation in the moment of so great a trial. For lo! an old man
and an aged virgin, coming from the smaller towns, were hastening to the city, one of whom
was carrying four skins for sale, and the other two sheets of linen. The blessed prelate, when
he perceived them, recognised a divine dispensation with reference to himself. He inquired
of them on the instant, “Are ye Christians?” And they replied, “Yes.” Then said he,
“Whither are ye going?” And they replied, “To the market in the city to sell these things that
we are carrying.” Then the most merciful father answered, “My faithful children, God has
marked you out, persevere with me.” And they immediately recognising him, said, “Sire,
let it be as thou hast commanded.” Then turning to the tribunes, he said, “Come, do what
ye are about to do, and fulfil the king’s command; for the day is now on the point of breaking.”
2264 But they, suffering violence as it were on account of the wicked decree of the prince,
brought him to a spot opposite to the sanctuary of the evangelist, into a valley near the
tombs. Then said the holy man, “Spread out, thou aged man, the skins which thou carriest,
and thou too, O aged woman, the linen sheets.”2265 And when they had been spread out,
this most constant martyr, mounting upon them, extended both his hands to heaven, and

bending his knees on the ground, and fixing his mind upon heaven, returned his thanks to
the Almighty Judge2266 of the contest, and fortifying himself with the sign of the cross, said,
Amen. Then loosening his omophorion2267 from his neck, he stretched it forth, saying,
“What is commanded you, do speedily.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile the hands of the tribunes were paralyzed, and looking upon one another in
turn, each urged his fellow to the deed, but they were all held fast with astonishment and
fear. At length they agreed that out of their common stock a reward for the execution should
be appointed, and that the man who should venture to perpetrate the murder should enjoy
the reward. There was no delay, each of them brought forth five solidi.2268 But, as says the
heathen poet,—

one of them, after the manner of the traitor Judas, emboldened by the desire of money,
drew his sword and beheaded the pontiff, on the 25th day of November, after he had held
the pontificate twelve years—three of which were before the persecution, but the nine remaining
were passed by him under persecutions of diverse kinds. The blood-money being

broader, and tied round the neck in a knot. Cf. following passage from Neale’s Introduction to the Translation
of the Eastern Liturgies: “But while the Gospel is being read, the bishop lays aside his omophorion, thereby
making profession of his service to the Lord. For since it is the Lord who is represented as speaking by the
Gospel, and is, as it were, Himself present, the bishop at that time ventures not to be arrayed with the symbol
of His incarnation—I mean, the omophorion; but taking it off from his shoulders, he gives it to the deacon, who
holds it folded in his right hand, himself standing near the bishop, and preceding the holy gifts. When he has
finished the liturgy, and comes to the communion, he again assumes the omophorion, manifesting that before
this he was one of the ministers, and was afraid to put upon himself that holy garment. But when the work is
accomplished, and he goes on to elevate the bread, and to divide it into parts, and to receive it himself, and distribute
it to others, it is necessary that he should put on all the sacred symbols of his dignity; and since the
omophorion is the principal vest of a pontiff, he necessarily assumes that, and in that is partaker of the most divine
things.” [All this unknown to antiquity.]</note>

instantly claimed by the executioner, these wicked purchasers, or rather destroyers, of man’s
life quickly returned, for they feared the multitude of the people, since, as I have said, they
were without their military escort. But the body of the blessed martyr, as the fathers affirm
who went first to the place of execution, remained erect, as if instant in prayer, until many
people, coming together, discovered it standing2270 in the same posture; so that what was
his constant practice whilst living, to this his inanimate body testified. They found also the
aged man and woman watching with grief and lamentation the most precious relic of the
Church. So, honouring him with a triumphal funeral, they covered his body with the linen
sheets; but the sacred blood which had been poured forth, they collected reverently in a
wallet.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile an innumerable multitude of either sex, flocking together from the
populous city, with groans and ejaculations asked each other in turn, being ignorant, in
what manner this had happened. In truth, from the least to the greatest, a very great grief
was prevalent amongst all. For when the chief men of the city beheld the laudable importunity
of the multitude, who were busied in dividing his sacred spoils to keep them as relics, they
wrapped him up the tighter in the skins and linen sheets. For the most holy minister of God
was always clothed in sacerdotal vestments of a white colour2271—that is, with the tunic,
the kolobion, and the omophorion. Then there arose among them no small contention; for
some were for carrying the most sacred limbs to the church which he had himself built, and
where he now rests, but others were endeavouring to carry him to the sanctuary of the
evangelist, where he attained the goal of martyrdom; and since neither party would yield to
the other, they began to turn their religious observance into a wrangling and a fight.2272 In
the meanwhile a spirited body of senators of those who are engaged in the public transport
service, seeing what had happened, for they were near the sea, prepared a boat, and suddenly
seizing upon the sacred relics, they placed them in it, and scaling the Pharos from behind,
by a quarter which has the name of Leucado, they came to the church of the most blessed
mother of God, and Ever-Virgin Mary, which, as we began to say, he had constructed in
the western quarter, in a suburb, for a cemetery of the martyrs. Thereupon the throng of
the people, as if the heavenly treasure had been snatched from them, some by straight roads,
and others by a more devious route, followed with hasty steps. And when they at length ar-

rived there, there was no longer any altercation where he was to be placed, but by a common
and unimpeachable counsel they agreed first to place him in his episcopal chair, and then
to bury him.</p>
<p>And this, most prudent reader, I would not have you regard as a wild fancy and superstition,
since, if you learn the cause of this novelty, you will admire and approve of the zeal
and deed of the populace. For this blessed priest, when he celebrated the sacrament of the
divine mysteries, did not, as is the ecclesiastical custom, sit upon his pontifical throne, but
upon its footstool underneath, which, when the people beheld, they disliked, and complainingly
exclaimed, “Thou oughtest, O father, to sit upon thy chair;” and when they repeated
this frequently, the minister of the Lord rising, calmed their complaints with tranquil voice,
and again took his seat upon the same stool. So all this seemed to be done by him from
motives of humility. But upon a certain great festival it happened that he was offering the
sacrifice of the mass,2273 and wished to do this same thing. Thereupon, not only the people,
but the clergy also, exclaimed with one voice, “Take thy seat upon thy chair, bishop.” But
he, as if conscious of a mystery, feigned not to hear this; and giving the signal for silence,—for
no one dared pertinaciously to withstand him,—he made them all quiet, and yet, nevertheless,
sat down on the footstool of the chair; and the solemnities of the mass2274 having been celebrated
as usual, each one of the faithful returned to his own home.</p>
<p>But the man of God sending for the clergy, with tranquil and serene mind, charged
them with rashness, saying, “How is it that ye blush not for having joined the cry of the laity,
and reproaching me? Howbeit, since your reproach flows not from the muddy torrent of
arrogance, but from the pure fountain of love, I will unfold to you the secret of this mystery.
Very often when I wish to draw near to that seat, I see a virtue as it were sitting upon it, exceeding
radiant with the brightness of its light. Then, being in suspense between joy and
fear, I acknowledge that I am altogether unworthy to sit upon such a seat, and if I did not
hesitate to cause an occasion of offence to the people, without doubt I should not even
venture to sit upon the stool itself. Thus it is, my beloved sons, that I seem to you, in this,
to, transgress the pontifical rule.2275 Nevertheless, many times when I see it vacant, as ye
yourselves are witnesses, I refuse not to sit upon the chair after the accustomed manner.
Wherefore do ye, now that ye are acquainted with my secret, and being well assured that,
if I shall be indulged, I will sit upon the chair, for I hold not in slight esteem the dignity of
my order, cease any further from joining in the exclamations of the populace.” This explan-

ation the most holy father whilst he was yet alive, was compelled to give to the clergy. The
faithful of Christ, therefore, remembering all this with pious devotion, brought his sacred
body, and caused it to sit upon the episcopal throne. As much joy and exultation arose then
to heaven from the people, as if they were attending him alive and in the body. Then embalming
him with sweet spices, they wrapped him in silken coverings; what each one of
them could be the first to bring, this he accounted to himself as greatest gain. Then carrying
palms, the tokens of victory, with flaming tapers, with sounding hymns, and with fragrant
incense, celebrating the triumph of his heavenly victory, they laid down the sacred relics,
and buried them in the cemetery which had been long ago constructed by him, where too
from henceforth, and even to this day, miraculous virtues cease not to show themselves.
Pious vows, forsooth, are received with a propitious hearing; the health of the impotent is
restored; the expulsion of unclean spirits testifies to the martyr’s merits. These gifts, O Lord
Jesus, are Thine, whose wont it is thus magnificently to honour Thy martyrs after death:
Thou who with the Father and the Holy Consubstantial Spirit livest and reignest for evermore.
Amen.</p>
<p>After this, how that wolf and framer of treachery, that is Arius, covered with a sheep’s
skin, entered into the Lord’s fold to worry and torment it, or in what manner he was enabled
to attain to the dignity of the priesthood, let us employ ourselves in relating in brief.2276
And this not to annoy those who ventured to recall to the threshing-floor of the Lord those
tares of apostacy and contagion that had been winnowed out of the Church by a heavenly
fan; for these are without doubt reckoned eminent for sanctity, but thinking it a light thing
to believe so holy a man, they transgressed the injunctions of the divine command. What
then? Do we reprehend them? By no means. For as long as this corruptible body weighs us
down, and this earthly habitation depresses the sense of our infirmity, many are easily deceived
in their imaginations, and think that which is unjust to be just, that to be holy which
is impure. The Gibeonites who, by the divine threatenings, were to be utterly destroyed,
having one thing in their wishes and another in their voice and mien, were able quickly to
deceive Joshua,2277 that just distributor of the land of promise. David2278 also, full of
prophetic inspiration, when he had heard the words of the deceitful youth, although it was
by the inscrutable and just judgment of God, yet acted very differently from what the true
nature of the case required. What also can be more sublime than the apostles, who have not
removed themselves from our infirmity? For one of them writes, “In many things we offend
all;”2279 and another, “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not

in us.”2280 But when we repent of these, so much the more readily do we obtain pardon,
when we have sinned not willingly, but through ignorance or frailty. And certainly offences
of this sort come not of prevarication, but of the indulgence of compassion. But I leave to
others to write an apology for this; let us pursue what is in hand. After that magnificent

<p>But since the fourth passover of the persecution has arrived, it is sufficient, in the case
of those who have been apprehended and thrown into prison, and who have sustained torments
not to be borne,2283 and stripes intolerable, and many other dreadful afflictions, and
afterwards have been betrayed by the frailty of the flesh, even though they were not at the
first received on account of their grievous fall that followed, yet because they contended
sorely and resisted long; for they did not come to this of their own will, but were betrayed
by the frailty of the flesh; for they show in their bodies the marks of Jesus,2284 and some are
now, for the third year, bewailing their fault: it is sufficient, I say, that from the time of their
submissive approach, other forty days should be enjoined upon them, to keep them in remembrance
of these things; those forty days during which, though our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ had fasted, He was yet, after He had been baptized, tempted of the devil. And
when they shall have, during these days, exercised themselves much, and constantly fasted,
then let them watch in prayer, meditating upon what was spoken by the Lord to him who
tempted Him to fall down and worship him: “Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written,
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”2285</p>
<p>Balsamon. The present canons treat of those who have in the persecution denied the
faith, and are doing penance. And the first canon ordains, that upon those who after many
torments have sacrificed to the gods, not being able by reason of frailty to persevere, and
who have passed three years in penitence, other forty days should be enjoined, and that then
they should be admitted into the Church. Observe these present canons which lay down

and concerning those who have of their own accord sought martyrdom, and have
lapsed, and then have again confessed the faith, and other things of the like nature. Consult
also, for you will profitably do so, many canons of the Council of Ancyra.</p>
<p>Zonaras. Amongst those who in these turbulent times denied the faith, the holy Peter
makes a distinction, and says, that upon those who had been brought before the tyrant, and
thrown into prison, and who had endured very grievous torments, and intolerable scourgings,
and such as could be cured by no care or medicine (for ἄκος signifies medical care, and
ἀνήκεστον is the same as immedicabile), and other dreadful afflictions, and afterwards
yielding, sacrificed to the gods, being betrayed as it were by the weakness of the flesh, which
could not hold out under the pain unto the end, that for them the time past should suffice
for punishment; since, indeed, says he, the fourth passover has now past since they made
this very grievous fall. And although perhaps at first, when they approached in penitence,
they were not received, yet because they did not of their own free-will proceed to sacrifice
to the gods, and resisted long, and bear about with them the marks of Jesus, that is to say,
the scars of the wounds which, in behalf of Christ, they have endured, and the third year
has now elapsed since they first bewailed their fall, he decrees that, as an additional punishment,
other forty days from the time that they came asking to be admitted to communion
should be enjoined on them in the place of any further severity; during which they should
exercise a still greater degree of penance, and should fast more earnestly, that is, with more
attentive care, keeping guard over themselves, being watchful in prayer, meditating upon,
that is, turning over perpetually in their minds, and saying in words, the text quoted by the
Lord against the tempter, “Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”</p>

conflict of torments, were led captive, being broken in spirit by poverty of strength, and a
certain blindness of the understanding, a year in addition to the foregoing time will suffice;
for they gave themselves up to be afflicted for the name of Christ, even though in their
dungeon they enjoyed much consolation from their brethren; which, indeed, they shall return
many fold, desiring to be set free from that most bitter captivity of the devil, especially remembering
Him who said: “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed
me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
are bruised; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompense unto our
God.”2286</p>
<p>Balsamon. This canon enacts that those who have only been evil entreated in prison,
and who without torment have lapsed, should be punished after the three years with an
additional year. For though they obtained consolation, certain of the faithful ministering
to them the necessaries of life, yet they ought to obtain pardon, as being those who have
suffered severely for the faith.</p>
<p>Zonaras. In the second order, he places those who have only been thrown into prison,
and evil entreated in the dungeon, and yet, though harassed by no torments, have offended;
upon whom, besides the time past, the three years, namely, of which we have spoken, he
proposes to inflict the penalty of an additional year, since they also, says he, have for Christ’s
name endured hardness, even though it may be that they obtained some consolation from
the brethren whilst in prison. For it is probable that the faithful, who were not in custody,
ministered to those in bonds the necessaries of life, and brought to them some alleviation
of their lot. Which things, indeed, they shall return many fold; for those consolations which
they enjoyed in prison they shall vex themselves with penance, and afflict themselves in diverse
ways, if they wish to be set free from the captivity of the devil, having become his
captives and slaves by their denial of Christ. He subjoins the word of the prophet, taken
from Isaiah, which he says that they ought to keep in remembrance.</p>

<head>Canon III.</head>
<p>But as for those who have suffered none of these things, and have shown no fruit of
faith, but of their own accord have gone over to wickedness, being betrayed by fear and
cowardice, and now come to repentance, it is necessary and convenient to propose the
parable of the unfruitful fig-tree, as the Lord says: “A certain man had a fig-tree planted in
his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the
dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and
find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? And he answering, said unto him,
Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it. And if it bear fruit, well;
and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.” Keeping this before their eyes, and
showing forth fruit worthy of repentance, after so long an interval of time, they will be
profited.</p>
<p>Balsamon. Those who from fear only and timidity deserted the faith, and then had an
eye towards repentance, the canon punishes with three years’ exclusion, according to the
parable of the fig-tree in the Gospels. For the Lord said, Three years I come to it seeking
fruit, and find none; but the vine-dresser replies, Lord, let it alone this year also.</p>
<p>Zonaras. But those, he says, who having suffered no hardness, have deserted from fear
only and timidity, in that they of their own accord have approached to wickedness, and then
looked towards repentance, their case the parable of the fig-tree in the Gospels will exactly
suit. Let them keep this before their eyes, and show forth for an equal period labours worthy
of penitence, and they shall be profited; that is, after the fourth year. For the Lord said, Three
years I come to it seeking fruit, and find none; and the vine-dresser answered, Lord, let it
alone this year also.</p>

<p>To those who are altogether reprobate, and unrepentant, who possess the Ethiopian’s
unchanging skin,2287 and the leopard’s spots, it shall be said, as it was spoken to another
fig-tree, “Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; and it presently withered away.”2288
For in them is fulfilled what was spoken by the Preacher: “That which is crooked cannot be
made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.”2289 For unless that which
is crooked shall first be made straight, it is impossible for it to be adorned; and unless that
which is wanting shall first be made up, it cannot be numbered. Hence also, in the end, will
happen unto them what is spoken by Esaias the prophet: “They shall look upon the carcases
of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall
their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.”2290 Since as by the
same also has been predicted, “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.”2291</p>
<p>Balsamon. What has been previously said of the lapsed, has been said of the repentant.
But against those who are unrepentant, he brings forward the cursing of another fig-tree,
to which the Lord said, because of its unprofitableness, “No fruit grow on thee hence-forward
for ever.”</p>
<p>Zonaras. What has been previously said of the lapsed, has been said of the repentant.
Against those whom, from desperation or depraved opinion, are impenitent, and carry
about with them perpetually the inherent and indelible blackness of sin, as of an Ethiopian’s
skin, or the leopard’s spots, he brings forward the cursing of another fig-tree. To which the
Lord said for its barrenness, “Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.” And he says
that in them must be fulfilled that word of the Preacher: “That which is crooked cannot be
made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.” Then having explained

<p>But upon those who have used dissimulation like David, who feigned himself to be
mad2292 to avoid death, being not mad in reality; and those who have not nakedly written
down their denial of the faith, but being in much tribulation, as boys endowed with sagacity
and prudence amongst foolish children, have mocked the snares of their enemies, either
passing by the altars, or giving a writing, or sending heathen to do sacrifice instead of
themselves, even though some of them who have confessed have, as I have heard, pardoned
individuals of them, since with the greatest caution they have avoided to touch the fire with
their own hands, and to offer incense to the impure demons; yet inasmuch as they escaped
the notice of their persecutors by doing this, let a penalty of six months’ penance be imposed
upon them. For thus will they be the rather profited, meditating upon the prophet’s words,
and saying, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be
upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called the Messenger of My mighty counsel.”2293
Who, as ye know, when another infant in the sixth month2294 of his conception had preached
before His coming repentance for the remission of sins, was himself also conceived to preach
repentance. Moreover, we hear both also preaching, in the first place, not only repentance,
but the kingdom of heaven, which, as we have learned, is within us;2295 for the word which
we believe is near us, in our mouth, and in our heart; which they, being put in remembrance
of, will learn to confess with their mouths that Jesus is the Christ; believing in their heart
that God hath raised him from the dead, and being as those who hear, that “with the heart
man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”

<p>Balsamon. But if any have pretended to approach the altars, or to write their denial of
the faith, and have not done this nakedly and openly, but by feigned arts have illuded those
who offered them violence, as David did, who, when he was flying from Saul, and was
amongst strangers, feigned himself to be mad, and thus escaped death. So they mocked the
snares of their enemies, as children endowed with wisdom and prudence mock foolish
children; for they deceived the impious heathen, in that they seemed to sacrifice, although
they did not sacrifice, or perhaps they suborned heathens and infidels to take their place,
and by these means they thought that they offered sacrifice; for them, he says, a period of
six months will suffice for penance. For although they did not sacrifice, yet because they

pardoned individuals of them. He compares them to children, as not having manfully
withstood the idolaters, but to prudent children, because by artifice they avoided doing
sacrifice.</p>
<p>Zonaras. But if any have pretended to approach the altars, or to write their denial of the
faith, but have not nakedly written down their abnegation, that is, not manifestly, not openly;
but by a sort of trick have cheated those who offered them violence; as David, who while he
was flying from Saul, and had come amongst strange people, feigned himself to be mad,
and in this way avoided death. They mocked indeed, he says, the insidious devices of their
enemies; as prudent children, endowed with wisdom and sagacity, and those who skilfully
take counsel, deceive foolish children. Now he compares those to prudent children by whom
the impious heathen were deceived, and those who though they did not sacrifice, yet seemed
to sacrifice, prudent indeed, as having thus far avoided sacrificing; but children, in that they
did not show forth a mature and manly spirit, and did not nobly resist the worshippers of
idols, but covenanted to sacrifice, even though they suborned some in their places, heathens,
forsooth, and infidels, and when these sacrificed, they were considered to have sacrificed.
For men of this sort, he says, a period of six months will suffice for penance. For although
they did not sacrifice, yet because they covenanted to sacrifice, or suborned others to do so,
and thus themselves appeared to have sacrificed, they were judged to stand in need of repentance;
even though some confessors might have pardoned individuals of them; for some
of those who witnessed to the faith and suffered for it, pardoned those who by an artifice,
as has been said, escaped offering sacrifice, and admitted them to communion with the
faithful, because they studiously avoided offering sacrifice to demons. And on account of
the fixing of this term of six months, he calls to remembrance the annunciation made by
Gabriel, in the sixth month of the conception of the Forerunner, in which the Lord was
conceived. Then he subjoins the words of the apostle.</p>

<p>In the case of those who have sent Christian slaves to offer sacrifice for them, the slaves
indeed as being in their master’s hands, and in a manner themselves also in the custody of
their masters, and being threatened by them, and from their fear having come to this pass
and having lapsed, shall during the year show forth the works of penitence, learning for the
future, as the slaves of Christ, to do the will of Christ and to fear Him, listening to this especially,
that “whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
whether he be bond or free.”2297</p>
<p>Balsamon. The slaves who under the commands and threatenings of their masters
offered sacrifice, this father punishes with a year’s exclusion; yet he pardons them as having
acted under the orders of a master, and does not inflict a heavy punishment upon them.
But yet since they are much more the servants of Christ, even as they ought to fear Hi
more, he imposes on them a moderate punishment; for, as says the great Paul, “whatsoever
good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or
free.”</p>
<p>Zonaras. Some have sent their own Christian servants, even against their will, to offer
sacrifice in their stead. These servants, therefore, although not of their own free-will, but
being compelled by their masters, they offered sacrifice, this father ordains shall pass a year
in penance, and enjoins them to remember that, being of the number of the faithful, they
are the servants of Christ, and that Him they ought rather to fear; for “whatsoever any man
doeth,” says the great apostle, “the same shall he receive, whether he be bond or free.”</p>

<p>But the freemen shall be tried by penance for three years, both for their dissimulation,

threatening;2298 knowing, says he, that our and their Master is in heaven; and that
there is no respect of persons with Him.2299 Now, if we all have one Master, with whom is
no respect of persons, since Christ is all and in all, in barbarian, Scythian, bond or free,2300
they ought to consider what they have done, wishing to preserve their own lives. They have

<p>Balsamon. But upon the freemen, or the masters of the servant compelled to sacrifice,
he enjoins a punishment of three years, both because they pretended to sacrifice, and seemed
to assent to it; and also because they compelled their fellow-servants to offer sacrifice, and
did not obey the apostle, who ordered them to forbear threatening their servants, inasmuch

<p>But to those who have been delivered up, and have fallen, who also of their own accord
have approached the contest, confessing themselves to be Christians, and have been tormented
and thrown into prison, it is right with joy and exultation of heart to add strength, and
to communicate to them in all things, both in prayer, and in partaking of the body and blood
of Christ, and in hortatory discourse; in order that contending the more constantly, they
may be counted worthy of “the prize of their high calling.”2301 For “seven times,” he says,
“a just man falleth, and riseth up again,”2302 which, indeed, if all that have lapsed had done,
they would have shown forth a most perfect penitence, and one which penetrates the whole
heart.</p>
<p>Balsamon. Some had had information laid against them before the tyrant, and had been
delivered up, or themselves had of their own accord given themselves up, and then being
overcome by their torments, had failed in their testimony. Afterwards repenting, and acknowledging
what was right and good, they confessed themselves to be Christians, so that
they were cast into prison, and afflicted with torments. These this holy man thinks it right
to receive with joy of heart, and to confirm in the orthodox faith, and to communicate with,
both in prayers and in partaking of the sacraments, and to exhort with cheering words, that
they may be more constant in the contest, and counted worthy of the heavenly kingdom.
And that it might not be thought that they ought not to be received, because they had lapsed,
he brings forward the testimony of Scripture to the effect that “seven times,” that is, often,
“the just man falleth, and riseth up again.” And, says he, if all who have failed in their confession
had done this, namely, taken up their struggle again, and before the tyrant confessed
themselves to be Christians, they would have shown forth a most perfect penitence. The
subject, therefore, comprehended in this canon differs from that contained in the first canon,
for there indeed those who by reason of their torment had lapsed, were not converted so as
to confess the faith before the tyrants; but here those who by reason of their torment have
lapsed, with a worthy penitence, confess the Lord before the tyrants, wherefore they are
reckoned not to have fallen.</p>
<p>Zonaras. But, says he, if any have had information laid against them before the tyrants,
and have been delivered up, or have of themselves given themselves up, and being overcome
by the violence of their torments have failed in their testimony, not being able to endure
the distresses and afflictions with which in the dungeon they were afflicted; and afterwards
taking up the contest anew, have confessed themselves to be Christians, so that they have
been again cast into prison and afflicted with torments: such men this holy martyr judges

it reasonable that they should be joyfully received; and that they should be strengthened,
that is, have strength, spirit, and confidence added to them, in order that they may confess
the faith, and that they should be communicated with in all things, both in prayer, and in
partaking of the sacraments, and that they should be exhorted with loving words, to rouse
themselves to give testimony to the faith, that they may be more constant in the contest,
and counted worthy of the heavenly kingdom. And that it might not be thought by any that
they ought not to be received from the fact that they had lapsed, and sacrificed to the idols,
he brings forth this testimony from Holy Scripture: “Seven times,” that is, often, “the just
man falleth, and riseth up again.” And, says he, if all who have failed in their confession had
done this, that is, after their fall, taken up the contest afresh, and confessed themselves to
be Christians before the tyrants, they would have given proof of a most perfect repentance.</p>

<p>With those also who, as it were from sleep, themselves leap forth upon a contest which
is travailing long and likely to be protracted, and draw upon themselves the temptations as
it were of a sea-fight, and the inundations of many waves, or rather are for the brethren
kindling the coals of the sinners, with them also we must communicate, inasmuch as they
come to this in the name of Christ, even though they take no heed unto His words, when
He teaches us “to pray that we enter not into temptation;”2303 and again in His prayer, He
says to His Father, “and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”2304 And
perhaps also they know not that the Master of the House and our Great Teacher often retired
from those who would lay snares for Him, and that sometimes He walked not openly because
of them; and even when the time of His passion drew on, He delivered not up Himself, but
waited until they came to Him with “swords and staves.” He said to them therefore, “Are
ye come out, as against a thief with swords and staves, for to take Me?”2305 And they “delivered
Him,” He says, “to Pilate.”2306 As it was with Him it happens to those who walk
keeping Him before them as an example, recollecting His divine words, in which, confirming
us, He speaks of persecution: “Take heed unto yourselves, for they will deliver you up to the
councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.”2307 Now, He says, they will deliver
you up, and not, ye shall deliver up yourselves; and “ye shall be brought before rulers and
kings for My sake,”2308 but not, ye shall bring yourselves, for He would have us pass from
place to place as long as there are those who persecute us for His name’s sake; even as again
we hear Him saying, “But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.”2309
For He would not have us go over to the ministers and satellites of the devil, that we might
not be the cause to them of a manifold death, inasmuch as thus we should be compelling
them both to be harsher, and to carry out their deadly works, but He would have us to wait,
and to take heed to ourselves, to watch and to pray, lest we enter into temptation.2310 Thus
first Stephen, pressing on His footsteps, suffered martyrdom, being apprehended in Jerusalem
by the transgressors, and being brought before the council, he was stoned, and glorified for
the name of Christ, praying with the words, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.”2311 Thus

James, in the second place, being of Herod apprehended, was beheaded with the sword.
Thus Peter, the first of the apostles, having been often apprehended, and thrown into prison,
and treated with igominy, was last of all crucified at Rome. Likewise also, the renowned
Paul having been oftentimes delivered up and brought in peril of death, having endured
many evils, and making his boast in his numerous persecutions and afflictions, in the same
city was also himself beheaded; who, in the things in which he gloried, in these also ended
his life; and at Damascus he was let down by night in a basket by the wall, and escaped the
hands2312 of him who sought to take him. For what they set before themselves, first and
foremost, was to do the work of an evangelist, and to teach the Word of God, in which,
confirming the brethren, that they might continue in the faith, they said this also, “that we
must out of much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.”2313 For they sought not what
was profitable for them, but that which was profitable for the many, that they might be
saved, and that they might be enabled to say unto them many things conducing to this, that
they might act suitably to the Word of God, “unless,” as says the apostle, “the time should
fail me in speaking.”2314</p>
<p>Balsamon. Those who have but just arisen from sleep, and especially if they were weighed
down with a heavy and profound sleep, have no constant reason, but one perturbed and
unsteady. To such as these this blessed martyr likens those who, not in due order, but rashly
and inconsiderately, thrust themselves upon the contest, which is as it were in travail, and
delayed and protracted, inasmuch as it has not yet burst forth openly, but meditates and
delays, hesitating in truth to bring forth the combatants, who bring temptation upon
themselves, or draw it towards them. Now these especially are, for the rest of the faithful,
kindling the coals of the sinners, that is to say, the punishment of the tyrants. But although
he reprehends those who act so, yet he enjoins the faithful nevertheless to communicate
with them, because on account of Christ they have undergone the contest, even though they
have ignored His teaching, for He teaches them to pray that they may not be tempted; and
He did not deliver up Himself, but was delivered up; and we are not to go over to the tormentors,
that we may not be the cause of bringing upon them the guilt of many murders,
as those do who incite them to inflict punishment upon the godly. The canon brings forward
different examples from Holy Scripture.</p>

with a heavy sleep, have no steady reason, but one inconstant and perturbed. To men of

kindle the coals of the sinners, the torments, namely, which are by the tyrants inflicted. But
although he finds fault with those who act in this way, he nevertheless decrees that the
faithful must communicate with them, because in the name of Christ they come forward to
this, trusting, that is, in Christ, or in His name demanding this trial for themselves, even
though, perhaps, they are not obeying His precepts; for He taught them to pray that they
might not be tempted; and they are ignoring the fact too that the Lord retired from those
who were laying snares for Him, and was wont sometimes to walk not openly; neither did
He give up Himself to His passion, but was given up by others; and He commanded His
disciples, when their enemies persecuted them, to fly from city to city, and not of their own
accord to give themselves up to the tormentors, lest they should be the cause of bringing
the guilt of much blood upon their heads, irritating them as it were to inflict punishment
upon godly men. And he brings forward the example of the apostles, of Stephen, of James,
and the chiefs of the order, Peter and Paul.</p>

<p>Whence it is not right either that those of the clergy who have deserted of their own
accord, and have lapsed, and taken up the contest afresh, should remain any longer in their
sacred office, inasmuch as they have left destitute the flock of the Lord, and brought blame
upon themselves, which thing did not one of the apostles. For when the blessed apostle Paul
had undergone many persecutions, and had shown forth the prizes of many contests, though
he knew that it was far better to “depart, and to be with Christ,” yet he brings this forward,
and says, “Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.”2315 For considering
not his own advantage but the advantage of many, that they might be saved, he judged it
more necessary than his own rest to remain with the brethren, and to have a care for them;
who also would have him that teacheth to be “in doctrine”2316 an example to the faithful.
Whence it follows that those who, contending in prison, have fallen from their ministry,
and have again taken up the struggle, are plainly wanting in perception. For how else is it
that they seek for that which they have left, when in this present time they can be useful to
the brethren? For as long as they remained firm and stable, of that which they had done
contrary to reason, of this indulgence was accorded them. But when they lapsed, as having
carried themselves with ostentation,2317 and brought reproach upon themselves, they can
no longer discharge their sacred ministry; and, therefore, let them the rather take heed to
pass their life in humility, ceasing from vainglory. For communion is sufficient for them,
which is granted them with diligence and care for two causes; both that they should not
seem to be afflicted with sorrow, and hence by violence seize on their departure from this
world; and also lest any of the lapsed should have a pretext for being remiss by occasion of
the punishment. And these indeed will reap more shame and ignominy than all others, even
as he who laid the foundation and was not able to finish it; for “all that pass by,” He says,
“will begin to mock him, saying, ‘This man laid the foundation, and was not able to finish
it.’”</p>
<p>Balsamon. The father having spoken of those who of their own accord went over to the
contest of martyrdom, now also speaks of those of the clergy who are in such a case, and he
says, that if any clergyman hath of his own accord sought the contest, and then, not being
able to bear the tortures, has fallen, but returning to himself, has recanted his error, and
before the tyrants confessed himself a Christian, such a one shall no longer discharge his
sacred ministry, because he hath deserted the Lord’s flock, and because, having of his own
accord sought the contest, through not being able to endure the torment, he hath brought

<pb n="637"/>
reproach upon himself. For to neglect the teaching of the people, and to prefer their own
advantage, this did not the apostles. For the mighty Paul, after that he had endured many
torments, though he perceived that it was far better to leave this life, yet chose rather to live
and to be tormented for the salvation and instruction of the people. They are therefore altogether
devoid of perception who seek the sacred ministry from which they have fallen of
their own accord. For how is it that they seek for that which they have left, when they are
able in this season of persecution, that is, to be useful to their brethren? If indeed they had
not fallen, of that which they had done contrary to reason, their spontaneous flight for instance,
or their slackness in teaching and confirming the brethren, of these things indulgence
would be extended to them. But if from their own arrogance and conceit they have
lapsed,—for of such a nature is it rashly to venture to expose themselves to torture, and not
to be able to endure it, and thus a triumph has been gained over them,—they cannot any
longer execute their sacred office. Wherefore let them the rather take heed that they perfect
their confession by humility, ceasing from the vainglory of seeking for the sacred ministry;
for communion with the faithful is sufficient for them, which is granted for two reasons,
with diligent caution, and just judgment. For if we say that we will not hold them to be
communicants, we shall both afflict them with grief, giving our sentence as it were that they
should depart this life with violence; and we shall cause others also, who may have lapsed,
and wish to return to what is right, to be negligent and remiss in this respect, having as a
pretext, that they will not be admitted to communicate with the faithful, even though after
their fall they should confess the faith, who, if they are not converted, will undergo more
shame and ignominy than others, even as he who laid the foundation, and did not finish
the building. For such a one do those resemble, who, for Christ’s sake indeed, have offered
themselves to be tormented, and having laid as it were a good foundation, have not been
able to perfect that which is good by reason of their fall. Observe, then, that not even confession
for Christ’s sake restores him who has once lapsed and thus become an alien from his
clerical office.</p>
<p>Zonaras. The father having spoken of those who have of their own accord exposed
themselves to the contest of martyrdom, now begins to discourse about those of the clergy
who have done the same thing; and says that if any clergyman has of his own accord given
himself up, and then, not being able to endure the violence of the torment, has fallen, and
again recollecting himself has roused himself afresh to the contest, and has confessed himself
a Christian before the tyrants, a man of this sort is not any longer to be admitted to the
sacred ministry. And the reason of this he subjoins; because he has forsaken the Lord’s flock,
and because having of his own accord offered himself to the enemy, and not having with
constancy endured his torments, he has brought reproach upon himself. But that they should
despise the instruction of the people, and prefer their own advantage, this did not the apostles.
For the mighty Paul, though he had endured many torments, and felt that it was better for

<pb n="638"/>
him to leave this life, preferred to live and to be tormented for the salvation and instruction
of the people. Wherefore he demonstrates those to be altogether devoid of perception who
ask for the sacred ministry from which they have voluntarily fallen. For how is it, says he,
that they ask for that which they have left, when in a season of this sort, of raging persecution
forsooth, they can be of great assistance to the brethren? As long as they were free from the
charge of having lapsed, they would have obtained pardon for their action that was rashly
undertaken, that, namely, of voluntarily offering themselves to the adversary, or their negligence
in instructing the brethren. But since they have fallen, inasmuch as they have acted
ostentatiously, they are not to be permitted any longer to discharge their sacred functions.
If, says he, that they had not fallen they would have obtained pardon for their action which
was devoid of reason; calling that action devoid of reason, not only because they gave
themselves up to the enemy, but rather because they deserted the Lord’s flock, and did not
remain to guard it, and to confirm the brethren who were harassed in this time of persecution.
But if they have fallen, from the fact that they have carried themselves vauntingly, and he
here calls pride and arrogance περπερεία , because it is from arrogance that they have put
confidence in themselves, and have put an end to the contest, and have brought reproach
upon themselves; that is, by reason of their fall, they have contracted a blemish and stain,
it is not lawful for them any longer to be occupied in the sacred ministry. Wherefore let
them study, says he, to perfect their confession by humility, ceasing forsooth from all vainglory.
For in that they seek to be enrolled in the sacred ministry, this proceeds from ambition
and self-seeking. For communion is sufficient for them, that the faithful should communicate
with them, and pray with them, and that they should participate in the sacred mysteries.
And this should be granted with diligent caution and care, both lest they should seem to be
afflicted with grief, seizing on a dissolution of this life, lest, that is, as he says, being overcome
with grief, they should depart and get free from the body, that is, go out from it, from the
violence of the torment and afflictions which they undergo in the prison; and that none
should have the pretext of their punishment for carrying themselves dissolutely and cowardly
in the contest of confession, and thus fall away. Who will the rather be put to shame, according
to the saying in the Gospel, “Who could not finish after that he had laid the foundation.”
2318</p>
<p>Moreover, let those apply their minds to what is in this place brought forward by this
great father and holy martyr, who say that it is lawful for bishops to give up their Sees, and
to retain the dignity of the priesthood. For if to the clergy who voluntarily offered themselves
to the contest of confession, and who, when tormented, failed in constancy and yielded, and
afterwards returned to the contest, if to them indulgence is scarcely granted, because they
deferred to execute their ministerial duties; nor, in the opinion of this divine father, is any
<note type="footnote">2318 A digression which follows is entirely directed against Muzalon.</note>

<pb n="639"/>
thing else objected to them but that they deserted the brethren, when in adverse and turbulent
times they might have been useful in confirming them in the faith, and that after that they
had been counted worthy to bear testimony to the faith, and carried about in their flesh the
marks of Christ; how shall that chief priest and pastor, who ought to lay down his life for
the sheep, when he has deserted the flock that was committed unto him, and repudiated its
care and administration, and as far as in him lies given it over to the wolf, be thought worthy
to retain the dignity of the sacred ministry, and not rather be judged worthy of the severest
punishments for deserting the people entrusted to his care? Nay, but he will demand a reward
for this thing, or rather he will himself supply it to himself: refusing that which brings labour
to them, namely, the office of teaching and of correcting vice; but embracing that which
gains for them honour and glory, making it their own, keeping hold of it with their teeth as
it were, and not letting it go in the least. For if in the case of the clergy it be called an action
contrary to reason to desert the people, and to go away from them to the contest in the cause
of piety; how much more contrary to reason shall it be judged for a bishop to desert his
people, not in order that he may contend in a contest, but that he may deliver himself up
to ease and indolence, and lay aside and escape entirely from his cares for the salvation of
souls? The sixteenth canon also of the Seventh OEcumenical Council2319 gravely accuses
those of folly who decree that the dignity of the sacred ministry can be retained by a bishop
who has repudiated his bishopric. For if according to the sentence of the aforesaid canon,
a bishop who has been absent from his See more than six months, unless some one of the
causes there enumerated shall have intervened, has both fallen from the episcopate and the
highest dignity of the priesthood, and is deprived of both; how shall he who has repudiated
the episcopate, and refuses any longer to feed the flock entrusted to him, and despises the
care of it through his desire of an easy life, be held to be of the number of bishops? For if he
who has committed the lesser fault, of leaving for more than six months the people placed
under him destitute of the care and administration of a pastor, incurs the privation of the
episcopate and of his sacred dignity; he who offends in a way greater and much more
grievous, namely, in deserting altogether the multitude which the grace of the Holy Spirit
has committed to him to be cared for and guarded, shall deservedly be punished with
greater severity, and will pay the heavier penalty of losing, as far as he is concerned, the flock
of which he was appointed shepherd by the great and chief Shepherd and High Priest. But
those who decree the dignity of the priesthood to him as a reward and honorarium for declining
his office, in my opinion make both themselves and him obnoxious to the judgment
of God.</p>

<head>Canon XI.</head>
<p>For those who first, when the persecution waxed warm, leaped forth, standing around
the judgment-seat, and beholding the holy martyrs who were hastening to the “prize of their
high calling,”2320 then, fired with a holy zeal, gave themselves up to this, using much boldness,
and especially when they saw those who were drawn aside and lapsed, on their account they
were roused mightily within, and, as it were by some inward voice, impelled to war down
and subdue the adversary who was exulting; for this they earnestly contended, that he might
not seem “to be wise in his own conceit,”2321 on account of those things in which by reason
of his subtlety they appeared to be inferior to him, even though it escaped his observation
that he was overcome by those who with constancy endured the torments of the lash and
scourge, and the sharp edge of the sword, the burning in the fire, and the immersion in the
water. To those also who entreat that the prayers and supplications of faith should be made
either in behalf of those who have been punished by imprisonment, and have been delivered
up by hunger and thirst, or for those who out of prison have by the judges been tortured
with whippings and scourgings, and afterwards have been overcome by the infirmity of the
flesh, it is right to give our consent. For to sympathize with the sorrow and affliction of those
who sorrow and mourn for those who in the contest have been overcome by the great
strength of the evil-contriving devil, whether it be for parents, or brethren, or children, hurts
no one. For we know that on account of the faith of others some have obtained the goodness
of God, both in the remission of sins, and in the health of their bodies, and in the resurrection
of the dead. Therefore, being mindful of the many labours and distresses which for the name
of Christ they have sustained, since they have themselves also repented, and have bewailed
that which was done by them through their being betrayed by the languor and mortification
of the body; and since, besides this, they testify that in their life they have as it were been
aliens from their city, let us pray together with them and entreat for their reconciliation,
together with other things that are befitting, through Him who is “our Advocate with the
Father, and makes propitiation for our sins.” “And if any man sin,” says he, “we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our
sins.”2322</p>
<p>Balsamon. The saint having said before that those who of their own accord entered
upon the contest and lapsed, and did not repent nor recant their error, would be covered
with more shame, as being like men who did not go on with the building beyond the
foundation, that is, did not perfect that which is good, now brings forward a confirmation

of this and other matters, saying, Those who taking their stand in the fervour and vehemence
of the persecution, seeing the holy martyrs, and with what divine zeal they contended to
receive the celestial crown, gave themselves up to martyrdom with much boldness, and especially
when they saw some drawn aside, that is, led astray and deluded by the devil, and
lapsing or denying godliness; wherefore being inwardly inflamed, and with hearts enkindled,
as hearing that they by this means should war down and subdue the proud adversary the
devil, were eager to undergo martyrdom lest the devil should boast and seem “to be wise in
his own conceit,” as having by his subtlety and malice overcome those who of their own
accord sought martyrdom: even though it escaped him that he was rather overcome by those
combatants who bravely withstood the torments. Therefore to the faithful who pray for
those who are enduring punishment, and afflicted by it, it is right to assent or to concur in
this, which is also decreed; and it can by no means be hurtful to sympathize in their sorrow
and affliction with the parents or other relatives in behalf of those who have given their
testimony and undergone martyrdom, but have lapsed by the arts and snares of the devil.
For we know that many have obtained the goodness and compassion of God by the prayers
of others. Therefore we will pray for them that remission of their sins be granted them by
God; and with the others who have lapsed, and have afterwards recanted their error, and
confessed godliness, we will communicate, being mindful of those contests which before
their fall they sustained for God’s sake, and also of their subsequent worthy repentance, and
that they testify that on account of their sin they have been as it were aliens from their city;
and we will not only communicate with them, but pray also for their reconciliation, together
with other things that are convenient, either with the good works which ought to be done
by them—fasting, for instance, almsgiving, and penance; by which things He who is our
Advocate makes the Father propitious towards us. Then he makes use of a passage of Holy
Scripture, and this is taken from the first catholic epistle of the holy apostle and evangelist
John.</p>
<p>Zonaras. The meaning of the present canon is as follows:—Those, he says, who set in
the fervour of the persecution, that is, in its greatest height and most vehement heat, beheld
the martyrdoms of the saints, and how eagerly they hastened to receive the celestial crown,
fired with a holy emulation, gave themselves up to martyrdom, leaping as it were into the
contest with much boldness, in imitation of the saints who suffered, and offered themselves
readily for the confirming of the faith by their testimony; and on that account especially,
because they behold many who were drawn aside, that is, led astray, denying their faith.
Whereupon they being inflamed, that is, tired in heart, endeavoured to subdue the adversary
that was hostile to them, that he might not, as a victor, exult over the godly. Although it escaped
him that he was rather conquered by them, many even unto death showing forth
constancy for the faith. They hastened, therefore, says he, to do this, but overcome by the
violence of their torments, by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, being some of them evil

<pb n="642"/>
entreated in prison, and others punished by decree of the judges, and not being able to endure
their punishment. It is meet, therefore, to sympathize with those who mourn for their sakes.
Now they mourn, says he, some the lapse of parents, others of brethren, and others of children.
To mourn, therefore, with those who bewail the lapsed, hurts no one; neither to join
in prayer and grief with those who pray for themselves, together with other things that are
reasonable, namely, that they who have lapsed may show forth other things that are consistent
with penitence; such as are fasting and tears and other humiliations, and observe the punishment
inflicted on them, and, if their means allow, bestow money upon the poor; by which
means He who is the Advocate in our behalf will render the Father propitious to us. Then
he brings forward a passage from Holy Scripture, which is taken from the first epistle of the
holy apostle and evangelist John.</p>

<head>Canon XII.</head>
<p>Against those who have given money that they might be entirely undisturbed by evil,2323
an accusation cannot be brought. For they have sustained the loss and sacrifice of their
goods that they might not hurt or destroy their soul, which others for the sake of filthy lucre
have not done; and yet the Lord says, “What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul?”2324 and again, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”2325 In
these things, then, they have shown themselves the servants of God, inasmuch as they have
hated, trodden under foot, and despised money, and have thus fulfilled what is written: “The
ransom of a man’s life are his riches.”2326 For we read also in the Acts of the Apostles that
those who in the stead of Paul and Silas were dragged before the magistrates at Thessalonica,
were dismissed with a heavy fine. For after that they had been very burdensome to them for
his name, and had troubled the people and the rulers of the city, “having taken security,”
he says, “of Jason, and of the others, they let them go. And the brethren immediately sent
away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea.”2327</p>
<p>Balsamon. After that the saint had finished his discourse concerning those who of their
own accord had offered themselves to martyrdom, he said that those were not to be reprehended
who by a sum of money paid down freed themselves from the affliction of persecution.
For they preferred to make a sacrifice of their money rather than of their souls. Then
he confirms this, and brings forward different Scripture examples from the Acts of the
Apostles concerning the blessed apostle Paul and others.</p>
<p>Zonaras. But those, he says, are not to be reprehended who have paid money down, and
thus escaped, and maintained their piety, nor for this thing may any one bring an accusation
against them. For they have preferred to lose their money rather than their souls, and have
shown that they wish to serve God and not mammon; that is, riches. And he brings forward
the words of Scripture, and the example, as in the Acts of the Apostles, of the blessed apostle
Paul and others. Now, when it is said that they have been undisturbed by all evil,2328 it is
to be so taken, either that they have been left undisturbed, so far as the denial of the faith is
concerned, which overcomes all evil,2329 or he means2330 the afflictions of persecutions.</p>

<head>Canon XIII.</head>
<p>Hence neither is it lawful to accuse those who have left all, and have retired for the safety
of their life, as if others had been held back by them. For at Ephesus also they seized Gaius
and Aristarchus instead of Paul, and rushed to the theatre, these being Paul’s companions
in travel2331 and he wishing himself to enter in unto the people, since it was by reason of
his having persuaded them, and drawing away a great multitude to the worship of the true
God, that the tumult arose. “The disciples suffered him not,” he says. “Nay, moreover, certain
of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not
adventure himself into the theatre.” But if any persist in contending with them, let them
apply their minds with sincerity to him who says, “Escape for thy life; look not behind
thee.”2332 Let them recall to their minds also how Peter, the chief of the apostles, “was thrown
into prison, and delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;”2333 of whom, when
he had escaped by night, and had been preserved out of the hand of the Jews by the commandment
of the angel of the Lord, it is said, “As soon as it was day, there was no small stir
among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. And when Herod had sought for him, and
found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
death,”2334 on account of whom no blame is attributed to Peter; for it was in their power,
when they saw what was done, to escape, just as also all the infants in Bethlehem,2335 and
all the coast thereof, might have escaped, if their parents had known what was going to
happen. These were put to death by the murderer Herod, in order to secure the death of
one Infant whom he sought, which Infant itself also escaped at the commandment of the
angel of the Lord, who now began quickly to spoil, and to hasten the prey, according to the
name whereby he was called: as it is written, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz: for before
the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mother, the riches of Damascus
and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.”2336 The Magi then
as now having been despoiled and divided for a prey, humbly, and in the guise of suppliants,
adore the Child, opening their treasures, and offering unto Him gifts most opportune and
magnificent—gold, and frankincense, and myrrh—as to a king, to God, and to man; whence
they were no longer willing to return to the Assyrian king, being forbidden to do so by
Providence. For “being warned of God in a dream,” he says, “that they should not return to

Herod, they departed into their own country another way.”2337 Hence the bloodthirsty
“Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent
forth,” he says, “and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coast
thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time that he had diligently inquired
of the wise men.”2338 Together with whom, having sought to kill another infant that had
been previously born, and not being able to find him, he slew the child’s father Zacharias
between the temple and the altar, the child having escaped with his mother Elisabeth.2339
Whence these men that have withdrawn themselves are not at all to be blamed.</p>
<p>Balsamon. But if any, says he, have left their good and gone away, lest they should be
detailed and brought into peril, as being those perhaps who might not be able to persist in
their confession to the end, on account of the cruelty of their tormentors, they shall not be
found fault with, even though others have been detained on their account. And he brings
forward as an instance on this score Gaius and Aristarchus, who were detained instead of
Paul; the soldiers who kept Peter; the infants who were massacred by Herod on account of
Christ; and Zacharias, the father of the revered and blessed forerunner.</p>
<p>Zonaras. But if any, says he, have left their possessions, and have gone away, lest being
detained they should be endangered, and because, perhaps, they would not be able to persist
in their confession unto the end on account of the cruelty of the tormentors, they are not
to be accused, even if others are detained and punished on their account. And, again, he
brings forward an example from the Acts of the Apostles, saying that at Ephesus also Gaius
and Aristarchus were apprehended in the stead of Paul, and that Paul was not blamed for
this; nor was Peter, when he was brought forth out of prison by an angel, and escaped the
danger, and the soldiers who guarded him were on his account punished. Then he cites
another example from the Gospel, namely, the infants who were put to death by Herod; on
account of which, says he, our Lord was not blamed. And when Elisabeth had taken to flight
with John, and had preserved him, his father Zacharias was put to death, the child being
demanded of him; nor was this imputed as a crime to John.</p>

<p>But if any have endured much violence and the strong pressure of necessity, receiving
into their mouths iron and chains, and for their good affection towards the faith have bravely
borne the burning of their hands that against their will had been put to the profane sacrifice,
as from their prison the thrice-blessed martyrs have written to me respecting those in Libya,
and others their fellow-ministers; such, on the testimony of the rest of their brethren, can
be placed in the ministry amongst the confessors, as those who have been mortified by many
torments, and were no longer able either to speak, or to give utterance, or to move, so as to
resist those who vainly offered them violence. For they did not assent to their impiety; as I
have again heard from their fellow-ministers, they will be reckoned amongst the confessors,
as also he who hath after the example of Timothy ordered his life, obeying him who says,
“Follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight
of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
profession before many witnesses.”2340</p>
<p>Balsamon. Those who by the violence of the tyrant seemed to eat meat that had been
offered to idols, or to drink wine from the Greek libations,—for it happened sometimes that
they were thrown upon the ground, and hooks or pieces of iron put into their mouths to
keep them open, and then the tyrants poured wine down their throats, or threw into them
pieces of meat; or putting hot coals into their hands, together with incense, they compelled
them to sacrifice,—if they were clergymen, the canon decrees that they should each in his
own degree be ranked amongst the confessors; but if laymen, that they should be reckoned
as martyrs, because they did not these things of their own free-will, nor did they at all assent
to the action. As also amongst the confessors are to be reckoned those who from the extremity
of the tortures lost their strength of body, and were not able to resist those who poured into
their mouths the wine of the libations. And next in order he speaks of those who give the
testimony of a good conscience, and enumerates them amongst the confessors.</p>
<p>Zonaras. Those who chastised the blessed martyrs, after many torments, in the case of
some violently poured into their mouths the wine of the libations, or even crammed into
their mouths some of the meat that had been offered to idols, and putting incense into their
hands, they dragged them to the altars, and then violently seizing on their hands, they either
sprinkled the incense upon the altar or placed hot coals together with the incense into their
hands, that, not being able to bear the pain of the burning, they might drop the incense together
with the coals upon the altar; for they were constrained by them. Men of this sort,
he affirms, can remain enrolled in the sacred ministry, or rather be placed in the rank of
confessors. For they did not by their own choice either taste the libations, or place the incense
<note type="footnote">2340 1 Tim. vi. 11, 12.</note>

upon the altar, but being compelled by violence, their reason not consenting to the action;
as also those who from the extremity of the suffering lost their bodily vigour, so as neither
to be able to speak or move, nor to resist those who were violently pouring into their months
the wine of libations, these also are to be placed amongst the confessors. And next in order
he discourses of those who give the testimony of a good conscience, and places them also

<p>No one shall find fault with us for observing the fourth day of the week, and the preparation,
2341 on which it is reasonably enjoined us to fast according to the tradition.2342 On
the fourth day, indeed, because on it the Jews took counsel for the betrayal of the Lord; and
on the sixth, because on it He himself suffered for us. But the Lord’s day we celebrate as a
day of joy, because on it He rose again, on which day we have received it for a custom not
even to bow the knee.</p>
<p>Balsamon. Conformably to the sixty-fourth Apostolical canon, which decrees that we
are not to fast on the Sabbath, with one exception, the great Sabbath; and to the sixty-ninth
canon, which severely punishes those who do not fast in the Holy Lent, and on every fourth
day of the week and day of preparation. Thus also does the present canon decree.</p>

nor will any one find fault with us for fasting on them; and the reasons he subjoins. But on
the Lord’s day we ought not to fast, for it is a day of joy for the resurrection of the Lord, and
on it, says he, we have received that we ought not even to bow the knee. This word, therefore,
is to be carefully observed, “we have received,” and “it is enjoined upon us according to the
tradition.” For from hence it is evident that long-established custom was taken for law.2343
Moreover, the great Basil annexes also the causes for which it was forbidden to bend the
knee on the Lord’s day, and from the Passover to Pentecost. Read also the sixty-sixth and
sixty-ninth Apostolical canons.2344</p>

<head>Note by the American Editor.</head>
<p>Here may be noted the historic fact that this terrible epoch of persecutions had driven
many to the deserts, where they dwelt as hermits.2345 It now introduced monasticism, in its
earliest and least objectionable forms, into Egypt, whence it soon spread into the Church
at large. For a favourable view of the character and life of St. Antony, see Neale’s history2346
of this period; but, if he turns it into an indirect plea for the subsequent history of monasticism,
we shall find in Canon Kingsley’s Hypatia a high-wrought testimony of an antagonistic
character. Bingham,2347 avoiding the entanglements of primitive with mediæval history,
affords a just view of what may be said of the rise of this mighty institution, based upon two
texts2348 of Holy Scripture, proceeding from the Incarnate Word Himself, which impressed
themselves on the fervid spirit of Antony. Who can wonder that fire and sword and ravening
wolves predisposed men and women to avoid the domestic life, and the bringing of hapless
families into existence as a prey to the remorseless cruelty of the empire? Far be it from me
to forget what the world owes, directly and indirectly, to the nobler and purer orders,—what
learning must ever acknowledge as its debt to the Benedictines of the West.2349 But, on the
other hand, after the melancholy episcopate of Cyril, we cannot but trace, in the history of
Oriental monasticism, not only the causes of the decay of Alexandrian scholarship and influence,
but of the ignominious fate of the Byzantine Empire, and of that paltry devotion
to images which seemed to invoke the retributions of a “jealous god,” and which favoured
the rise of an impostor who found in his “abhorrence of idols” an excuse for making himself
the “Scourge of God.”</p>

<p>Since certainly “grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,”2355 whence also by grace we are
saved, according to that word of the apostle, “and that not of yourselves, nor of works, lest
any man should boast;”2356 by the will of God, “the Word was made flesh,”2357 and “was
found in fashion as a man.”2358 But yet He was not left without His divinity. For neither
“though He was rich did He become poor”2359 that He might absolutely be separated from
His power and glory, but that He might Himself endure death for us sinners, the just for
the unjust, that He might bring us to God, “being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
by the Spirit;” and afterwards other things. Whence the evangelist also asserts the truth
when he says, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;” then indeed, from the time
when the angel had saluted the virgin, saying, “Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord
is with thee.” Now when Gabriel said, “The Lord is with thee,” he meant God the Word is
with thee. For he shows that He was conceived in the womb, and was to become flesh; as it
is written, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the
Son of God;”2360 and afterwards other things. Now God the Word, in the absence of a man,
by the will of God, who easily effects everything, was made flesh in the womb of the virgin,
not requiring the operation of the presence of a man. For more efficacious than a man was
the power of God overshadowing the virgin, together with the Holy Ghost also who came
upon her.</p>

<head>V.—That Up to the Time of the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews Rightly Appointed
the Fourteenth Day of the First Lunar Month.</head>

<p>I.2364</p>
<p>1. Since the mercy of God is everywhere great, let us bless Him, and also because He
has sent unto us the Spirit of truth to guide us into all truth. For for this cause the month
Abib was appointed by the law to be the beginning of months, and was made known unto
us as the first among the months of the year; both by the ancient writers who lived before,
and by the later who lived after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was shown to possess a most
clear and evidently definite period, especially because in some places the reaping is early,
and sometimes it is late, so as to be sometimes before the time and sometimes after it, as it
happened in the very beginning of the giving of the law, before the Passover, according as
it is written, “But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.”2365
Whence it is rightly prescribed by the law, that from the vernal equinox, in whatsoever week
the fourteenth day of the first month shall fall, in it the Passover is to be celebrated, becoming
and conformable songs of praise having been first taken up for its celebration. For this first
month, says he, “shall be unto you the beginning of months,”2366 when the sun in the
summer-time sends forth a far stronger and clearer light, and the days are lengthened and
become longer, whilst the nights are contracted and shortened. Moreover, when the new
seeds have sprung up, they are thoroughly purged, and borne into the threshing floor; nor
only this, but also all the shrubs blossom, and burst forth into flower. Immediately therefore
they are discovered to send forth in alternation various and diverse fruits, so that the grapeclusters
are found at that time; as says the lawgiver, “Now, it was the time of spring, of the
first ripe grapes;”2367 and when he sent the men to spy out the land, they brought, on bearers,
a large cluster of grapes, and pomegranates also, and figs. For then, as they say, our eternal
God also, the Maker and Creator of all things, framed all things, and said to them, “Let the
earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind,
whose seed is in itself upon the earth.” Then he adds, “And it was so; and God saw that it
was good.”2368 Moreover, he makes quite clear that the first month amongst the Hebrews
was appointed by law, which we know to have been observed by the Jews up to the destruction
of Jerusalem, because this has been so handed down by the Hebrew tradition. But after the
destruction of the city it was mocked at by some hardening of heart, which we observing,

according to the law, with sincerity have received; and in this, according to the Word, when
he speaks of the day of our holy festivity, which the election hath attained: but the rest have
become hardened,2369 as said the Scripture; and after other things.</p>
<p>2. And He says as follows: “All these things will they do unto you for My name’s sake,
because they know not Him that sent Me.”2370 But if they knew not Him who sent, and
Him who was sent, there is no reason to doubt but that they have been ignorant of the Passover
as prescribed by the law, so as not merely to err in their choice of the place, but also
in reckoning the beginning of the month, which is the first amongst the months of the year,
on the fourteenth day of which, being accurately observed, after the equinox, the ancients
celebrated the Passover according to the divine command; whereas the men of the present
day now celebrate it before the equinox, and that altogether through negligence and error,
being ignorant how they celebrated it in its season, as He confesses who in these things was
described.</p>
<p>3. Whether therefore the Jews erroneously sometimes celebrate their Passover according
to the course of the moon in the month Phamenoth, or according to the intercalary month,
every third year in the month Pharmuthi2371 matters not to us. For we have no other object
than to keep the remembrance of His Passion, and that at this very time; as those who were
eye-witnesses of it have from the beginning handed down, before the Egyptians believed.
For neither by observing the course of the moon do they necessarily celebrate it on the sixteenth
day of Phamenoth, but once every three years in the month Pharmuthi; for from the
beginning, and before the advent of Christ, they seem to have so done. Hence, when the
Lord reproves them by the prophet, He says, “They do always err in their heart; and I have
sworn in My wrath that they shall not enter into My rest.”2372</p>
<p>4. Wherefore, as thou seest, even in this thou appearest to be lying greatly, not only
against men, but also against God. First, indeed, since in this matter the Jews never erred,
as consorting with those who were eye-witnesses and ministers, much less from the beginning
before the advent of Christ. For God does not say that they did always err in their heart as
regards the precept of the law concerning the Passover, as thou hast written, but on account
of all their other disobedience, and on account of their evil and unseemly deeds, when, indeed,
He perceived them turning to idolatry and to fornication.</p>
<p>5. And after a few things. So that also in this respect, since thou hast slumbered, rouse
thyself much, and very much, with the scourge of the Preacher, being mindful especially of
<note type="footnote">2369 Rom. xi. 7. [“Our holy festivity” = Easter.]</note>

<pb n="656"/>
that passage where he speaks of “slipping on the pavement, and with the tongue.”2373 For,
as thou seest again, the charge cast by thee upon their leaders is reflected back; nay, and one
may suspect a great subsequent danger, inasmuch as we hear that the stone which a man
casts up on high falls back upon his head. Much more reckless is he who, in this respect,
ventures to bring a charge against Moses, that mighty servant of God, or Joshua, the son of
Nun, who succeeded him, or those who in succession rightly followed them and ruled; the
judges, I mean, and the kings who appeared, or the prophets whom the Holy Spirit inspired,
and those who amongst the high-priests were blameless, and those who, in following the
traditions, changed nothing, but agreed as to the observance of the Passover in its season,
as also of the rest of their feasts.</p>
<p>6. And after other things. But thou oughtest rather to have pursued a safer and more
auspicious course, and not to have written rashly and slanderously, that they seem from the
beginning, and always, to have been in error about the Passover, which you cannot prove,
whatever charge you may wish to bring against those who, at the present time, have erred
with a grievous wandering, having fallen away from the commandment of the law concerning
the Passover and other things. For the ancients seem to have kept it after the vernal equinox,
which you can discover if you read ancient books, and those especially which were written
by the learned Hebrews.</p>
<p>7. That therefore up to the period of the Lord’s Passion, and at the time of the last destruction
of Jerusalem, which happened under Vespasian, the Roman emperor, the people
of Israel, rightly observing the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, celebrated on it the
Passover of the law, has been briefly demonstrated. Therefore, when the holy prophets, and
all, as I have said, who righteously and justly walked in the law of the Lord, together with
the entire people, celebrated a typical and shadowy Passover, the Creator and Lord of every
visible and invisible creature, the only-begotten Son, and the Word co-eternal with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, and of the same substance with them, according to His divine
nature, our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, being in the end of the world born according to the
flesh of our holy and glorious lady, Mother of God, and Ever-Virgin, and, of a truth, of Mary
the Mother of God; and being seen upon earth, and having true and real converse as man
with men, who were of the same substance with Him, according to His human nature,
Himself also, with the people, in the years before His public ministry and during His public
ministry, did celebrate the legal and shadowy Passover, eating the typical lamb. For “I came
not to destroy the law, or the prophets, but to fulfil them,” the Saviour Himself said in the
Gospel.</p>
<p>But after His public ministry He did not eat of the lamb,2374 but Himself suffered as
the true Lamb in the Paschal feast, as John, the divine and evangelist, teaches us in the
<note type="footnote">2373 Ecclus. xx. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">2374 [But compare Browne, On the Thirty-nine Articles, p. 717, note 3, American edition, 1874.]</note>

<pb n="657"/>
Gospel written by him, where he thus speaks: “Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the
hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall,
lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover.”2375 And after a few things
more. “When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the
judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it
was the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour,”2376 as the correct books
render it, and the copy itself that was written by the hand of the evangelist, which, by the
divine grace, has been preserved in the most holy church of Ephesus, and is there adored
by the faithful. And again the same evangelist says: “The Jews therefore, because it was the
preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-day (for that
Sabbath-day was an high day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they
might be taken away.”2377 On that day, therefore, on which the Jews were about to eat the
Passover in the evening, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was crucified, being made the
victim to those who were about to partake by faith of the mystery concerning Him, according
to what is written by the blessed Paul: “For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;”2378
and not as some who, carried along by ignorance, confidently affirm that after He had eaten
the Passover, He was betrayed; which we neither learn from the holy evangelists, nor has
any of the blessed apostles handed it down to us. At the time, therefore, in which our Lord
and God Jesus Christ suffered for us, according to the flesh, He did not eat of the legal Passover;
but, as I have said, He Himself, as the true Lamb, was sacrificed for us in the feast of
the typical Passover, on the day of the preparation, the fourteenth of the first lunar month.
The typical Passover, therefore, then ceased, the true Passover being present: “For Christ
our Passover was sacrificed for us,” as has been before said, and as that chosen vessel, the
apostle Paul, teaches.2379</p>

<p>II.2380</p>
<p>Now it was the preparation, about the third hour, as the accurate books have it, and the
autograph copy itself of the Evangelist John, which up to this day has by divine grace been
preserved in the most holy church of Ephesus, and is there adored2381 by the faithful.</p>
<note type="footnote">2375 John xviii. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">2376 John xix. 13, 14. And about the sixth hour is the reading of our English version. According to St. Mark,
the crucifixion took place at the third hour (chap. xxv. 25). Eusebius, Theophylact, and Severus (in the Catena,

<p>The things which pertain to the divinity and humanity of the Second Man from heaven,

now we have thought it necessary to explain the things which pertain to the first man, who
is of earth and earthy, being about, namely, to demonstrate this, that he was created at the
same time one and the same, although sometimes he is separately designated as the man
external and internal. For if, according to the Word of salvation, He who made what is
without, made also that which is within, He certainly, by one operation, and at the same
time, made both, on that day, indeed, on which God said, “Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness;”2383 whence it is manifest that man was not formed by a conjunction of
the body with a certain pre-existent type. For if the earth, at the bidding of the Creator,
brought forth the other animals endowed with life, much rather did the dust which God
took from the earth receive a vital energy from the will and operation of God.</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>

  <p>I.
(Meletian schism, p. 259.)</p>
<p>The date of the Meletian schism is very much in need of elucidation. I follow Neale,
however, as follows: Athanasius places its origin a.d. 306 (according to Tillemont and Baronius)
or a.d. 301; the latter more probable, as demonstrated by the Benedictine editors.
But the dates are, perhaps, the least of the difficulties which encumber the whole matter.
Somewhat distrustfully I have, after several efforts to construct an original elucidation, adopted
the theory of Neale, as a diligent and conscientious inquirer whose Oriental studies
qualify him to utter almost a decisive voice, albeit he never forgets his Occidentalism, and
hence fails to speak with absolute fidelity to the spirit of Catholic antiquity.</p>
<p>We know something of Lycopolis from the blessed Alexander; it seems to have been a
sort of centre to the bishoprics of the Thebais. It was just the sort of centre, in a region sufficient
for a separate patriarchate, to suggest to an ambitious and unscrupulous prelate an
effort at independency. Meletius, who succeeded the good Alexander, was just the man to
set up for himself; a man not unlikely to be stimulated by the bad example of Paul of Samosata,
and by the ingenuity that triumphed over the first council that called Paul to account.
Bearing all this in mind, we may accept Neale’s conviction that Meletius had long been a
scandal to the churches, and in the time of persecution had lapsed, and sacrificed to idols.
Peter summoned him to a council, by which he was convicted and degraded; whereupon
he not only refused to submit, but arrogated to himself the cathedra of Alexandria, and
began to ordain other bishops, and, in short, to reorganize its jurisdiction.2390 Owing, I
think probable, to the exceptional and overgrown extent of this enormous “patriarchate,”
as it was called a little later, the schism gained a considerable following. The distance of
Lycopolis from Lower Egypt must have favoured the attempt, and Peter’s recent accession
made it easy for Meletius to circulate evil stories against him. The schism, as usual, soon
developed into heresy, which even the Nicene Synod failed to extinguish. Arius had joined
the first outbreak, but conformed for a time, and was ordained a deacon by Achillas. His
troublesome spirit, however, soon showed itself again after his ordination to the priesthood;
and the remnant of the Meletians made common cause with him after his condemnation
at Nicæa. Of Peter’s legitimate exercise of authority, and of the impurity and wickedness of
Meletius before his invasion of Alexandria, there is no reason to doubt; but for the details,
<note type="footnote">2390 He reported to the Nicene Council that he had ordained twenty-eight bishops and eight priests or deacons.</note>

<pb n="663"/>
recourse must be had to Neale.2391 The famous Sixth Canon of Nice finds its explanation
in this rebellion; but, incidentally, it defines the position of other great centres, which now
began to be known as patriarchates. Neale’s remarks2392 on the excessive leniency of the
council in settling the case of Meletius, are specially to be noted.</p>
    
<p>II.
Canonical Epistle, p. 279.)</p>
<p>The judgment of Dupin is so exceptionally eulogistic touching these canons, that I quote
it, as follows:2393—</p>
<p>“Of all the canons of antiquity concerning the discipline of the lapsed, there are none
more judicious or more equitable than those we have now described. There appear in them
a wisdom and prudence altogether singular in tempering the rigours of punishment by a
reasonable moderation, without which justice would be weakened. He examines carefully
all the circumstances which might augment or diminish the quality of the crime; and as he
does not lengthen out penance by methods too severe, so neither does he deceive the sinner
by a facility too remiss.”</p>
<p>Like the famous Canonical Epistles of St. Basil, however, these are compilations of
canons accepted by the churches of his jurisdiction. Dupin says of those of Basil2394 (To
Amphilochius), “They are not to be considered as the particular opinions of St. Basil, but as
the laws of the Church in his time; and therefore they are not written in the form of personal
letters, but after the manner of synodical decisions.”</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>[a.d. 2732395–313–326.] The records of the Ante-Nicene period, so far as Alexandria is
concerned, are complete in this great primate, the friend and patron of Athanasius, and,
with him, the master-spirit of the great Council of Nicæa. I have so arranged the “Fragments”
of the Edinburgh series in this volume as to make them a great and important integer in
rounding out and fulfilling the portraiture of the school and the See of Alexandria. The
student will thus have at hand the materials for a covetable survey of the Alexandrian
Fathers,—their history, their influence, and their immense authority in early Christendom.
In an elucidation2396 I venture to condense my thoughts upon some points which it has
been the interest of unbelievers to misrepresent, and to colour for their own purposes. But,
as the limitations of my editorial duty do not allow me to enter upon a dissertation, I am
thankful to refer the reader to the truly valuable though by no means exhaustive work of
Dr. Neale on The Patriarchate of Alexandria. His statements are not, indeed, to be received
with unreserving confidence; for, in spite of his pure and lofty purposes, his mind had been
formed under the strong bias of a transient fashion in divinity, and he always surveyed his
subject from an Occidental if not from a Latin (I do not mean a strictly Roman) point of
view. To other popular historians I need not refer the student, save, by anticipation, to the
list of authorities which will be furnished in the concluding volume of this series.2397</p>
<p>Let us reflect, then, upon the epoch to which we have now come. The intense sufferings,
labours, and intellectual as well as moral struggles, of the three heroic centuries, are closing,
and Alexander of Alexandria is the grand figure of the period. Diocletian is preparing to let
loose upon the sheep of Christ the ferocious wolves of the tenth persecution. Lucian is
founding the school of Antioch,2398 revising the New Testament, and, in fact, the whole
Bible of the Fathers, for his labours included the version of the Seventy. Unhappily, the

ambitious Arius, who calls him master, has begun to trouble the evangelical See of St. Mark;
and Achillas, notwithstanding the warnings of Peter, has laid hands upon him, and made
him a presbyter. He aspires to be made a bishop. But anon a boy is playing on the shore at
Alexandria in whom a flaming genius for the priesthood already manifests itself. Alexander,
looking forth from his windows, sees him “playing church” with his schoolmates, and actually
dipping a young pagan in the sea, “in the name of the Father,” etc. No doubt something of
the kind did occur, and thus was the boy Athanasius brought to the notice of his bishop.
But even Dupin rejects the rest of the story, that Alexander decided the question of the boybaptism
in favour of its validity, as the Latins would have us believe. Anyhow, we have this
miracle of precocity attending Alexander as his deacon at the Council of Nicæa, and then
soon after succeeding to his episcopal chair. Athanasius is the grandest figure of the primitive
ages after the apostles fell asleep. Raised up to complete their testimony to the eternal Logos,
and to suffer like them, we soon behold him the noble example of constancy against the
new perils of the world’s favour and the patronage of the Cæsars. “Athanasius against the
world” was in two senses his great encomium, and the epitome of his glorious life and warfare.
Not less was it “Athanasius for the world.” Alas! the majestic school of Pantænus and
Clement soon after comes to its enigmatical decline. Some plants, when they have borne
their superlative flower and fruit, mysteriously decay. It was so, alas! with the great Christian
academy that not improbably owes its beginnings to Apollos.</p>

<p>Alexander was appointed successor to Achillas,2399 as Bishop of Alexandria, about a.d.
312. The virtues of this prelate, which Eusebius has passed over entirely without mention,
other ecclesiastical writers have greatly extolled. For on all sides he is styled “the staunchest
upholder of evangelical doctrine,” “the patron and protector of apostolic doctrine;” and
“that bishop of divine faith, full of wisdom and of zeal enkindled by the Holy Spirit.” He
was the first to detect and to condemn Arius;2400 and taking his stand upon passages of
Holy Scripture, as Theodoret remarks,2401 he taught that the Son of God was of one and
the same majesty with the Father, and had the same substance with the Father who begat
Him.</p>
<p>At first he sought to bring back Arius from his heresy. But when he perceived that he
openly and obstinately taught his false doctrines, he assembled a first and then a second
synod of the bishops of Egypt, and degraded him from the order of the priesthood,2402 and

<head>I.—To Alexander, Bishop of the City of Constantinople.</head>
<p>To the most reverend and like-minded brother, Alexander, Alexander sends greeting in the
Lord:</p>
<p>1. The ambitious and avaricious will of wicked men is always wont to lay snares against
those churches which seem greater, by various pretexts attacking the ecclesiastical piety of
such. For incited by the devil who works in them, to the lust of that which is set before them,
and throwing away all religious scruples, they trample under foot the fear of the judgment
of God. Concerning which things, I who suffer, have thought it necessary to show to your
piety, in order that you may be aware of such men, lest any of them presume to set foot in
your dioceses, whether by themselves or by others; for these sorcerers know how to use hypocrisy
to carry out their fraud; and to employ letters composed and dressed out with lies,
which are able to deceive a man who is intent upon a simple and sincere faith. Arius,
therefore, and Achilles,2404 having lately entered into a conspiracy, emulating the ambition
of Colluthus, have turned out far worse than he. For Colluthus, indeed, who reprehends
these very men, found some pretext for his evil purpose; but these, beholding his2405 battering
of Christ, endured no longer to be subject to the Church; but building for themselves dens
of thieves, they hold their assemblies in them unceasingly, night and day directing their
calumnies against Christ and against us. For since they call in question all pious and
apostolical doctrine, after the manner of the Jews, they have constructed a workshop for
contending against Christ, denying the Godhead of our Saviour, and preaching that He is
only the equal of all others. And having collected all the passages which speak of His plan
of salvation and His humiliation for our sakes, they endeavour from these to collect the
preaching of their impiety, ignoring altogether the passages in which His eternal Godhead
and unutterable glory with the Father is set forth. Since, therefore, they back up the impious

opinion concerning Christ, which is held by the Jews and Greeks, in every possible way they
strive to gain their approval; busying themselves about all those things which they are wont
to deride in us, and daily stirring up against us seditions and persecutions. And now, indeed,
they drag us before the tribunals of the judges, by intercourse with silly and disorderly women,
whom they have led into error; at another time they cast opprobrium and infamy upon
the Christian religion, their young maidens disgracefully wandering about every village and
street. Nay, even Christ’s indivisible tunic, which His executioners were unwilling to divide,
these wretches have dared to rend.2406</p>
<p>2. And we, indeed, though we discovered rather late, on account of their concealment,
their manner of life, and their unholy attempts, by the common suffrage of all have2407 cast
them forth from the congregation of the Church which adores the Godhead of Christ. But
they, running hither and thither against us, have begun to betake themselves to our colleagues
who are of the same mind with us; in appearance, indeed, pretending to seek for peace and
concord, but in reality seeking to draw over some of them by fair words to their own diseases,
asking long wordy letters from them, in order that reading these to the men whom they
have deceived, they may make them impenitent in the errors into which they have fallen,
and obdurate in impiety, as if they had bishops thinking the same thing and siding with
them. Moreover, the things which amongst us they have wrongly taught and done, and on
account of which they have been expelled by us, they do not at all confess to them, but they
either pass them over in silence, or throwing a veil over them, by feigned words and writings
they deceive them. Concealing, therefore, their pestilent doctrine by their specious and
flattering discourse, they circumvent the more simple-minded and such as are open to fraud,
nor do they spare in the meanwhile to traduce our piety to all. Hence it comes to pass that
some, subscribing their letters, receive them into the Church, although in my opinion the
greatest guilt lies upon those ministers who venture to do this; because not only does the
apostolic rule not allow of it, but the working of the devil in these men against Christ is by
this means more strongly kindled. Wherefore without delay, brethren beloved, I have stirred
myself up to show you the faithlessness of these men who say that there was a time when
the Son of God was not; and that He who was not before, came into existence afterwards,
becoming such, when at length He was made, even as every man is wont to be born. For,
they say, God made all things from things which are not, comprehending even the Son of
God in the creation of all things rational and irrational. To which things they add as a consequence,
that He is of mutable nature, and capable both of virtue and vice. And this hypo-

thesis being once assumed, that He is “from things which are not,” they overturn the sacred
writings concerning His eternity, which signify the immutability and the Godhead of Wisdom
and the Word, which are Christ.</p>
<p>3. We, therefore, say these wicked men, can also be the sons of God even as He. For it
is written, “I have nourished and brought up children.”2408 But when what follows was objected
to them, “and they have rebelled against me,” which indeed is not applicable to the
nature of the Saviour, who is of an immutable nature; they, throwing off all religious reverence,
say that God, since He foreknew and had foreseen that His Son would not rebel against
Him, chose Him from all. For He did not choose Him as having by nature anything specially
beyond His other sons, for no one is by nature a son of God, as they say; neither as having
any peculiar property of His own; but God chose Him who was of a mutable nature, on account
of the carefulness of His manners and His practice, which in no way turned to that
which is evil; so that, if Paul and Peter had striven for this, there would have been no difference
between their sonship and His. And to confirm this insane doctrine, playing with Holy
Scripture, they bring forward what is said in the Psalms respecting Christ: “Thou lovest
righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with
the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”2409</p>
<p>4. But that the Son of God was not made “from things which are not,” and that there
was no “time when He was not,”2410 the evangelist John sufficiently shows, when he thus
writes concerning Him: “The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father.”2411
For since that divine teacher intended to show that the Father and the Son are two things
inseparable the one from the other, he spoke of Him as being in the bosom of the Father.
Now that also the Word of God is not comprehended in the number of things that were
created “from things which are not,” the same John says, “All things were made by Him.”
For he set forth His proper personality, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him; and without
Him was not anything made that was made.”2412 For if all things were made by Him, how
comes it that He who gave to the things which are made their existence, at one time Himself
was not. For the Word which makes is not to be defined as being of the same nature with
the things which are made; since He indeed was in the beginning, and all things were made
by Him, and fashioned “from things which are not.” Moreover, that which is seems to be

<pb n="673"/>
contrary to and far removed from those things which are made “from things which are not.”
For that indeed shows that there is no interval between the Father and the Son, since not
even in thought can the mind imagine any distance between them. But that the world was
created “from things which are not,” indicates a more recent and later origin of substance,
since the universe receives an essence of this sort from the Father by the Son. When, therefore,
the most pious John contemplated the essence of the divine Word at a very great distance,
and as placed beyond all conception of those things that are begotten, he thought it not meet
to speak of His generation and creation; not daring to designate the Creator in the same
terms as the things that are made. Not that the Word is unbegotten, for the Father alone is
unbegotten, but because the inexplicable subsistence of the only-begotten Son transcends
the acute comprehension of the evangelists, and perhaps also of angels.</p>
<p>5. Wherefore I do not think that he is to be reckoned amongst the pious who presumes
to inquire into anything beyond these things, not listening to this saying: “Seek not out the
things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.”2413
For if the knowledge of many other things that are incomparably inferior to this, are hidden
from human comprehension, such as in the apostle Paul, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him.”2414 As also God said to Abraham, that “he could not number the stars;”2415
and that passage, “Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain.”2416 How
shall any one be able to investigate too curiously the subsistence of the divine Word, unless
he be smitten with frenzy? Concerning which the Spirit of prophecy says, “Who shall declare
his generation?”2417 And our Saviour Himself, who blesses the pillars of all things in the
world, sought to unburden them of the knowledge of these things, saying that to comprehend
this was quite beyond their nature, and that to the Father alone belonged the knowledge of
this most divine mystery. “For no man,” says He, “knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither
knoweth any man the Father, save the Son.”2418 Of this thing also I think that the Father
spoke, in the words, “My secret is to Me and Mine.”</p>
<p>6. Now that it is an insane thing to think that the Son was made from things which are
not, and was in being in time, the expression, “from things which are not,” itself shows, although
these stupid men understand not the insanity of their own words. For the expression,
“was not,” ought either to be reckoned in time, or in some place of an age. But if it be true

<pb n="674"/>
that “all things were made by Him,” it is established that both every age and time and all
space, and that “when” in which the “was not” is found, was made by Him. And is it not
absurd that He who fashioned the times and the ages and the seasons, in which that “was
not” is mixed up, to say of Him, that He at some time was not? For it is devoid of sense, and
a mark of great ignorance, to affirm that He who is the cause of everything is posterior to
the origin of that thing. For according to them, the space of time in which they say that the
Son had not yet been made by the Father, preceded the wisdom of God that fashioned all
things, and the Scripture speaks falsely according to them, which calls Him “the First-born
of every creature.” Conformable to which, that which the majestically-speaking Paul says
of Him: “Whom He hath appointed heir of all things. By whom also He made the worlds.
But by Him also were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were
created by Him, and for Him; and He is before all things.”2419</p>
<p>7. Wherefore, since it appears that this hypothesis of a creation from things which are
not is most impious, it is necessary to say that the Father is always the Father. But He is the
Father, since the Son is always with Him, on account of whom He is called the Father.
Wherefore, since the Son is always with Him, the Father is always perfect, being destitute
of nothing as regards good; who, not in time, nor after an interval, nor from things which
are not, hath begotten His only-begotten Son. How, then, is it not impious to say, that the
wisdom of God once was not which speaks thus concerning itself: “I was with Him forming
all things; I was His delight;”2420 or that the power of God once did not exist; or that His
Word was at any time mutilated; or that other things were ever wanting from which the
Son is known and the Father expressed? For he who denies that the brightness of the glory
existed, takes away also the primitive light of which it is the brightness. And if the image of
God was not always, it is clear also that He was not always, of which it is the image. Moreover,
in saying that the character of the subsistence of God was not, He also is done away with
who is perfectly expressed by it. Hence one may see that the Sonship of our Saviour has
nothing at all in common with the sonship of the rest. For just as it has been shown that His
inexplicable subsistence excels by an incomparable excellence all other things to which He
has given existence, so also His Sonship, which is according to the nature of the Godhead
of the Father, transcends, by an ineffable excellence, the sonship of those who have been
adopted by Him. For He, indeed, is of an immutable nature, every way perfect, and wanting
in nothing; but these since they are either way subject to change, stand in need of help from
Him. For what progress can the wisdom of God make? What increase can the truth itself
and God the Word receive? In what respect can the life and the true light be made better?
<note type="footnote">2419 Col. i. 16, 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">2420 Prov. viii. 30 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="675"/>
And if this be so, how much more unnatural is it that wisdom should ever be capable of
folly; that the power of God should be conjoined with infirmity; that reason should be obscured
by unreason; or that darkness should be mixed up with the true light? And the apostle
says, on this place, “What communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath
Christ with Belial?”2421 And Solomon says, that it is not possible that it should come to pass
that a man should comprehend with his understanding “the way of a serpent upon a rock,”
which is Christ, according to the opinion of Paul. But men and angels, who are His creatures,
have received His blessing that they might make progress, exercising themselves in virtues
and in the commandments of the law, so as not to sin. Wherefore our Lord, since He is by
nature the Son of the Father, is by all adored. But these, laying aside the spirit of bondage,
when by brave deeds and by progress they have received the spirit of adoption, being blessed
by Him who is the Son by nature, are made sons by adoption.</p>
<p>8. And His proper and peculiar, natural and excellent Sonship, St. Paul has declared,
who thus speaks of God: “Who spared not His own Son, but for us,” who were not His
natural sons, “delivered Him up.”2422 For to distinguish Him from those who are not
properly sons, He said that He was His own Son. And in the Gospel we read: “This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”2423 Moreover, in the Psalms the Saviour says:
“The Lord hath said unto Me, Thou art my Son.”2424 Where, showing that He is the true
and genuine Son, He signifies that there are no other genuine sons besides Himself. And
what, too, is the meaning of this: “From the womb before the morning I begat thee”?2425
Does He not plainly indicate the natural sonship of paternal bringing forth, which he obtained
not by the careful framing of His manners, not by the exercise of and increase in virtue, but
by property of nature? Wherefore, the only-begotten Son of the Father, indeed, possesses
an indefectible Sonship; but the adoption of rational sons belongs not to them by nature,
but is prepared for them by the probity of their life, and by the free gift of God. And it is
mutable as the Scripture recognises: “For when the sons of God saw the daughters of men,
they took them wives,”2426 etc. And in another place: “I have nourished and brought up
children, but they have rebelled against Me,”2427 as we find God speaking by the prophet
Isaiah.</p>

deeming it to be burdensome at great length to call these things to the remembrance of
teachers who are of the same mind with myself. For ye yourselves are taught of God, nor
are ye ignorant that this doctrine, which hath lately raised its head against the piety of the
Church, is that of Ebion and Artemas; nor is it aught else but an imitation of Paul of Samosata,
bishop of Antioch, who, by the judgment and counsel of all the bishops, and in every
place, was separated from the Church.2428 To whom Lucian succeeding, remained for many
years separate from the communion of three bishops.2429 And now lately having drained
the dregs of their impiety, there have arisen amongst us those who teach this doctrine of a
creation from things which are not,2430 their hidden sprouts, Arius and Achilles, and the
gathering of those who join in their wickedness. And three bishops in Syria, having been,
in some manner, consecrated on account of their agreement with them, incite them to worse
things. But let the judgment concerning these be reserved for your trial. For they, retaining
in their memory the words which came to be used with respect to His saving Passion, and
abasement, and examination, and what they call His poverty, and in short of all those things
to which the Saviour submitted for our sakes, bring them forward to refute His supreme
and eternal Godhead. But of those words which signify His natural glory and nobility, and
abiding with the Father, they have become unmindful. Such as this: “I and My Father are
one,”2431 which indeed the Lord says, not as proclaiming Himself to be the Father, nor to
demonstrate that two persons are one; but that the Son of the Father most exactly preserves
the expressed likeness of the Father, inasmuch as He has by nature impressed upon Him
His similitude in every respect, and is the image of the Father in no way discrepant, and the
expressed figure of the primitive exemplar. Whence, also, to Philip, who then was desirous
to see Him, the Lord shows this abundantly. For when he said, “Show us the Father,”2432
He answered: “He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,” since the Father was Himself
seen through the spotless and living mirror of the divine image. Similar to which is what
the saints say in the Psalms: “In Thy light shall we see light.”2433 Wherefore he that honoureth
the Son, honoureth the Father also;”2434 and with reason, for every impious word which
they dare to speak against the Son, has reference to the Father.</p>

<p>10. But after these things, brethren beloved, what is there wonderful in that which I am
about to write, if I shall set forth the false calumnies against me and our most pious laity?
For those who have set themselves in array against the Godhead of Christ, do not scruple
to utter their ungrateful ravings against us. Who will not either that any of the ancients
should be compared with them, or suffer that any of those whom, from our earliest years,
we have used as instructors should be placed on a level with them. Nay, and they do not
think that any of all those who are now our colleagues, has attained even to a moderate
amount of wisdom; boasting themselves to be the only men who are wise and divested of
worldly possessions, the sole discoverers of dogmas, and that to them alone are those things
revealed which have never before come into the mind of any other under the sun. Oh, the
impious arrogance! Oh, the immeasurable madness! Oh, the vainglory befitting those that
are crazed! Oh, the pride of Satan which has taken root in their unholy souls. The religious
perspicuity of the ancient Scriptures caused them no shame, nor did the consentient doctrine
of our colleagues concerning Christ keep in check their audacity against Him. Their impiety
not even the demons will bear, who are ever on the watch for a blasphemous word uttered
against the Son.</p>
<p>11. And let these things be now urged according to our power against those who, with
respect to matter which they know nothing of, have, as it were, rolled in the dust against
Christ, and have taken in hand to calumniate our piety towards Him. For those inventors
of stupid fables say, that we who turn away with aversion from the impious and unscriptural
blasphemy against Christ, of those who speak of His coming from the things which are not
assert, that there are two unbegottens. For they ignorantly affirm that one of two things
must necessarily be said, either that He is from things which are not, or that there are two
unbegottens; nor do those ignorant men know how great is the difference between the unbegotten
Father, and the things which were by Him created from things which are not, as
well the rational as the irrational. Between which two, as holding the middle place, the only
begotten nature of God, the Word by which the Father formed all things out of nothing,
was begotten of the true Father Himself. As in a certain place the Lord Himself testified,
saying, “Every one that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him.”2435
12. Concerning whom we thus believe, even as the Apostolic Church believes. In one
Father unbegotten, who has from no one the cause of His being, who is unchangeable and
immutable, who is always the same, and admits of no increase or diminution; who gave to
us the Law, the prophets, and the Gospels; who is Lord of the patriarchs and apostles, and
all the saints. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God; not begotten of
things which are not, but of Him who is the Father; not in a corporeal manner, by excision
or division as Sabellius and Valentinus thought, but in a certain inexplicable and unspeakable
<note type="footnote">2435 John v. 1.</note>

<pb n="678"/>
manner, according to the words of the prophet cited above: “Who shall declare His generation?”
2436 Since that His subsistence no nature which is begotten can investigate, even as
the Father can be investigated by none; because that the nature of rational beings cannot
receive the knowledge of His divine generation by the Father. But men who are moved by
the Spirit of truth, have no need to learn these things from me, for in our ears are sounding
the words before uttered by Christ on this very thing, “No man knoweth the Father, save
the Son; and no man knoweth who the Son is, save the Father.”2437 That He is equally with
the Father unchangeable and immutable, wanting in nothing, and the perfect Son, and like
to the Father, we have learnt; in this alone is He inferior to the Father, that He is not unbegotten.
For He is the very exact image of the Father, and in nothing differing from Him.
For it is clear that He is the image fully containing all things by which the greatest similitude
is declared, as the Lord Himself hath taught us, when He says, “My Father is greater than
I.”2438 And according to this we believe that the Son is of the Father, always existing. “For
He is the brightness of His glory, the express image of His Father’s person.”2439 But let no
one take that word always so as to raise suspicion that He is unbegotten, as they imagine
who have their senses blinded. For neither are the words, “He was,” or “always,” or “before
all worlds,” equivalent to unbegotten. But neither can the human mind employ any other
word to signify unbegotten. And thus I think that you understand it, and I trust to your
right purpose in all things, since these words do not at all signify unbegotten. For these
words seem to denote simply a lengthening out of time, but the Godhead, and as it were the
antiquity of the only-begotten, they cannot worthily signify; but they have been employed
by holy men, whilst each, according to his capacity, seeks to express this mystery, asking
indulgence from the hearers, and pleading a reasonable excuse, in saying, Thus far have we
attained. But if there be any who are expecting from mortal lips some word which exceeds
human capacity, saying that those things have been done away which are known in part, it
is manifest that the words, “He was,” and “always,” and “before all ages,” come far short of
what they hoped. And whatever word shall be employed is not equivalent to unbegotten.
Therefore to the unbegotten Father, indeed, we ought to preserve His proper dignity, in
confessing that no one is the cause of His being; but to the Son must be allotted His fitting
honour, in assigning to Him, as we have said, a generation from the Father without beginning,
and allotting adoration to Him, so as only piously and properly to use the words, “He was,”
and “always,” and “before all worlds,” with respect to Him; by no means rejecting His
Godhead, but ascribing to Him a similitude which exactly answers in every respect to the

<pb n="679"/>
Image and Exemplar of the Father. But we must say that to the Father alone belongs the
property of being unbegotten, for the Saviour Himself said, “My Father is greater than I.”2440
And besides the pious opinion concerning the Father and the Son, we confess to one Holy
Spirit, as the divine Scriptures teach us; who hath inaugurated both the holy men of the Old
Testament, and the divine teachers of that which is called the New. And besides, also, one
only Catholic and Apostolic Church, which can never be destroyed, though all the world
should seek to make war with it; but it is victorious over every most impious revolt of the
heretics who rise up against it. For her Goodman hath confirmed our minds by saying, “Be
of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”2441 After this we know of the resurrection of
the dead, the first-fruits of which was our Lord Jesus Christ, who in very deed, and not in
appearance merely, carried a body, of Mary Mother of God, who in the end of the world
came to the human race to put away sin, was crucified and died, and yet did He not thus
perceive any detriment to His divinity, being raised from the dead, taken up into heaven,
seated at the right hand of majesty.</p>
<p>13. These things in part have I written in this epistle, thinking it burdensome to write
out each accurately, even as I said before, because they escape not your religious diligence.
Thus do we teach, thus do we preach. These are the apostolic doctrines of the Church, for
which also we die, esteeming those but little who would compel us to forswear them, even
if they would force us by tortures, and not casting away our hope in them. To these Arius
and Achilles opposing themselves, and those who with them are the enemies of the truth,
have been expelled from the Church, as being aliens from our holy doctrine, according to
the blessed Paul, who says, “If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have
received, let him be accursed; even though he feign himself an angel from heaven.”2442 And
also, “If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing,”
2443 and so forth. These, therefore, who have been anathematized by the brotherhood,
let no one of you receive, nor admit of those things which are either said or written by them.
For these seducers do always lie, nor will they ever speak the truth. They go about the cities,
attempting nothing else but that under the mark of friendship and the name of peace, by
their hypocrisy and blandishments, they may give and receive letters, to deceive by means
of these a few “silly women, and laden with sins, who have been led captive by them,”2444
and so forth.</p>

<p>14. These men, therefore, who have dared such things against Christ; who have partly
in public derided the Christian religion; partly seek to traduce and inform against its professors
before the judgment-seats; who in a time of peace, as far as in them lies, have stirred
up a persecution against us; who have enervated the ineffable mystery of Christ’s generation;
from these, I say, beloved and like-minded brethren, turning away in aversion, give your
suffrages with us against their mad daring; even as our colleagues have done, who being
moved with indignation, have both written to us letters against these men, and have subscribed
our letter. Which also I have sent unto you by my son Apion the deacon, being some
of them from the whole of Egypt and the Thebaid, some from Libya and Pentapolis. There
are others also from Syria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Asia, Cappadocia, and the other neighbouring
provinces. After the example of which I trust also that I shall receive letters from you. For
though I have prepared many helps towards curing those who have suffered injury, this is
the especial remedy that has been devised for healing the multitudes that have been deceived
by them, that they may comply with the general consent of our colleagues, and thus hasten
to return to repentance. Salute one another, together with the brethren who are with you.
I pray that ye may be strong in the Lord, beloved, and that I may profit by your love towards
Christ.</p>

<head>II.—Epistle Catholic.2445</head>
<p>To our beloved and most reverend fellow-ministers of the Catholic Church in every place, Alexander
sends greeting in the Lord:</p>
<p>1. Since the body of the Catholic Church is one,2446 and it is commanded in Holy
Scripture that we should keep the bond of unanimity and peace, it follows that we should
write and signify to one another the things which are done by each of us; that whether one
member suffer or rejoice we may all either suffer or rejoice with one another. In our diocese,
then, not so long ago, there have gone forth lawless men, and adversaries of Christ, teaching
men to apostatize; which thing, with good right, one might suspect and call the precursor
of Antichrist. I indeed wished to cover the matter up in silence, that so perhaps the evil
might spend itself in the leaders of the heresy alone, and that it might not spread to other
places and defile the ears of any of the more simple-minded. But since Eusebius, the present
bishop of Nicomedia, imagining that with him rest all ecclesiastical matters,2447 because,
having left Berytus and cast his eyes upon the church of the Nicomedians, and no punishment
has been inflicted upon him, he is set over these apostates, and has undertaken to write
everywhere, commending them, if by any means he may draw aside some who are ignorant
to this most disgraceful and Antichristian heresy; it became necessary for me, as knowing
what is written in the law, no longer to remain silent, but to announce to you all, that you
may know both those who have become apostates, and also the wretched words of their
heresy; and if Eusebius write, not to give heed to him.</p>
<p>2. For he, desiring by their assistance to renew that ancient wickedness of his mind,
with respect to which he has for a time been silent, pretends that he is writing in their behalf,
but he proves by his deed that he is exerting himself to do this on his own account. Now
the apostates from the Church are these: Arius, Achilles,2448 Aithales, Carpones, the other
Arius, Sarmates, who were formerly priests; Euzoius, Lucius, Julius, Menas, Helladius, and
Gaius, formerly deacons; and with them Secundus and Theonas, who were once called
bishops. And the words invented by them, and spoken contrary to the mind of Scripture,
are as follows:—</p>
<p>“God was not always the Father; but there was a time when God was not the Father.
The Word of God was not always, but was made ‘from things that are not;’ for He who is
God fashioned the non-existing from the non-existing; wherefore there was a time when

<pb n="682"/>
He was not. For the Son is a thing created, and a thing made: nor is He like to the Father in
substance; nor is He the true and natural Word of the Father; nor is He His true Wisdom;
but He is one of the things fashioned and made. And He is called, by a misapplication of
the terms, the Word and Wisdom, since He is Himself made by the proper Word of God,
and by that wisdom which is in God, in which, as God made all other things, so also did He
make Him. Wherefore, He is by His very nature changeable and mutable, equally with
other rational beings. The Word, too, is alien and separate from the substance of God. The
father also is ineffable to the Son; for neither does the Word perfectly and accurately know
the Father, neither can He perfectly see Him. For neither does the Son indeed know His
own substance as it is. Since He for our sakes was made, that by Him as by an instrument
God might create us; nor would He have existed had not God wished to make us. Some one
asked of them whether the Son of God could change even as the devil changed; and they
feared not to answer that He can; for since He was made and created, He is of mutable
nature.”</p>
<p>3. Since those about Arius speak these things and shamelessly maintain them, we,
coming together with the Bishops of Egypt and the Libyas, nearly a hundred in number,
have anathematized them, together with their followers. But those about Eusebius have received
them, earnestly endeavouring to mix up falsehood with truth, impiety with piety.
But they will not prevail; for the truth prevails, and there is no communion betwixt light
and darkness, no concord between Christ and Belial.2449 For who ever heard such things?
or who, now hearing them, is not astonished, and does not stop his ears that the pollution
of these words should not touch them? Who that hears John saying, “In the beginning was
the Word,”2450 does not condemn those who say there was a time when He was not? Who
that hears these words of the Gospel, “the only-begotten Son;”2451 and, “by Him were all
things made,”2452 will not hate those who declare He is one of the things made? For how
can He be one of the things made by Him? or how shall He be the only-begotten who, as
they say, is reckoned with all the rest, if indeed He is a thing made and created? And how
can He be made of things which are not, when the Father says, “My heart belched forth a
good Word;”2453 and, “From the womb, before the morning have I begotten Thee?”2454 Or
how is He unlike to the substance of the Father, who is the perfect image and brightness of
the Father, and who says, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father?”2455 And how, if the

<pb n="683"/>
Son is the Word or Wisdom and Reason of God, was there a time when He was not? It is
all one as if they said, that there was a time when God was without reason and wisdom.
How, also, can He be changeable and mutable, who says indeed by Himself: “I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me,”2456 and, “I and My Father are one;”2457 and by the prophet,
“I am the Lord, I change not?”2458 For even though one saying may refer to the Father
Himself, yet it would now be more aptly spoken of the Word, because when He became
man, He changed not; but, as says the apostle, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and
for ever.”2459 Who hath induced them to say, that for our sakes He was made; although
Paul says, “for whom are all things, and by whom are all things?”2460</p>
<p>4. Now concerning their blasphemous assertion who say that the Son does not perfectly
know the Father, we need not wonder: for having once purposed in their mind to wage war
against Christ, they impugn also these words of His, “As the Father knoweth Me, even so
know I the Father.”2461 Wherefore, if the Father only in part knoweth the Son, then it is
evident that the Son doth not perfectly know the Father. But if it be wicked thus to speak,
and if the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is plain that, even as the Father knoweth His
own Word, so also the Word knoweth His own Father, of whom He is the Word.</p>
<p>5. By saying these things, and by unfolding the divine Scriptures, we have often refuted
them. But they, chameleon-like, changing their sentiments, endeavour to claim for themselves
that saying: “When the wicked cometh, then cometh contempt.”2462 Before them, indeed,
many heresies existed, which, having dared more than was right, have fallen into madness.
But these by all their words have attempted to do away with the Godhead of Christ, have
made those seem righteous, since they have come nearer to Antichrist. Wherefore they have
been excommunicated and anathematized by the Church.2463 And indeed, although we
grieve at the destruction of these men, especially that after having once learned the doctrine
of the Church, they have now gone back; yet we do not wonder at it; for this very thing
Hymenæus and Philetus suffered,2464 and before them Judas, who, though he followed the
Saviour, afterwards became a traitor and an apostate. Moreover, concerning these very men,
warnings are not wanting to us, for the Lord foretold: “Take heed that ye be not deceived:

for many shall come in My Name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not
therefore after them.”2465 Paul, too, having learnt these things from the Saviour, wrote, “In
the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines
of devils which turn away from the truth.”2466</p>
<p>6. Since, therefore, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has thus Himself exhorted us, and
by His apostle hath signified such things to us; we, who have heard their impiety with our
own ears, have consistently anathematized such men, as I have already said, and have declared
them to be aliens from the Catholic Church and faith, and we have made known the thing,
beloved and most honoured fellow-ministers, to your piety, that you should not receive any
of them, should they venture rashly to come unto you, and that you should not trust Eusebius
or any one else who writes concerning them. For it becomes us as Christians to turn
with aversion from all who speak or think against Christ, as the adversaries of God and the
destroyers of souls, and “not even to wish them Godspeed, lest at any time we become partakers
of their evil deeds,”2467 as the blessed John enjoins. Salute the brethren who are with

<p>Alexander, to the priests and deacons, Alexandria and Mareotis, being present to them present,
brethren beloved in the Lord, sends greeting:</p>
<p>Although you have been forward to subscribe the letters that I sent to those about Arius,
urging them to abjure their impiety, and to obey the wholesome and Catholic faith; and in
this manner have shown your orthodox purpose, and your agreement in the doctrines of
the Catholic Church; yet because I have also sent letters to all our fellow-ministers in every
place with respect to the things which concern Arius and his companions; I have thought
it necessary to call together you the clergy of the city, and to summon you also of Mareotis;
especially since of your number Chares and Pistus, the priests; Sarapion, Parammon, Zosimus,
and Irenæus, the deacons, have gone over to the party of Arius, and have preferred to be
deposed with them; that you may know what is now written, and that you should declare
your consent in these matters, and give your suffrage for the deposition of those about Arius
and Pistus. For it is right that you should know what I have written, and that you should
each one, as if he had written it himself retain it in his heart.</p>

<head>V.—On the Soul and Body and the Passion of the Lord.2472</head>
<p>1. The Word which is ungrudgingly sent down from heaven, is fitted for the irrigation
of our hearts, if we have been prepared for His power, not by speaking only, but by listening.
For as the rain without the ground does not produce fruit, so neither does the Word
fructify without hearing, nor hearing without the Word. Moreover, the Word then becomes
fruitful when we pronounce it, and in the same way hearing, when we listen. Therefore since
the Word draws forth its power, do you also ungrudgingly lend your ears, and when you
come to hear, cleanse yourselves from all ill-will and unbelief. Two very bad things are illwill
and unbelief, both of which are contrary to righteousness; for ill-will is opposed to
charity, and unbelief to faith; just in the same way as bitterness is opposed to sweetness,
darkness to light, evil to good, death to life, falsehood to truth. Those, therefore, who abound
in these vices that are repugnant to virtue, are in a manner dead; for the malignant and the
unbelieving hate charity and faith, and they who do this are the enemies of God.</p>
<p>2. Since therefore ye know, brethren beloved, that the malignant and the unbelieving
are the enemies of righteousness, beware of these, embrace faith and charity, by which all
the holy men who have existed from the beginning of the world to this day have attained
unto salvation. And show forth the fruit of charity, not in words only, but also in deeds, that
is, in all godly patience for God’s sake. For, see! the Lord Himself hath shown His charity
towards us, not only in words but also in deeds, since He hath given Himself up as the price
of our salvation. Besides, we were not created, like the rest of the world, by word alone, but
also by deed. For God made the world to exist by the power of a single word, but us He
produced by the efficacy alike of His word and working. For it was not enough for God to
say, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,”2473 but deed followed word; for,
taking the dust from the ground, He formed man out of it, conformable to His image and
similitude, and into him He breathed the breath of life, so that Adam became a living soul.</p>
<p>3. But when man afterwards by his fall had inclined to death, it was necessary that that
form should be recreated anew to salvation by the same Artificer. For the form indeed lay
rotting in the ground; but that inspiration which had been as the breath of life, was detained
separate from the body in a dark place, which is called Hades. There was, therefore, a division
<note type="footnote">2472 Many writings of the ancients, as Cardinal Mai has remarked, may be disinterred from the Oriental
manuscripts in the Vatican library, some of which have been brought to light by that eminent scholar. In an
Arabic ms. he discovered a large portion of the following discourse by St. Alexander, the patriarch of Alexandria,
which he afterwards met with entire in the Syrian Vatican manuscript 368. The Greek version being lost, Mai,
with the assistance of the erudite Maronites, Matthæus Sciahuanus, and Franciscus Mehasebus, translated the
discourse into Latin, and his version has been chiefly followed in the following translation. Of its genuineness
there is no doubt, and it is quite worthy of a place among his other writings.</note>

<pb n="690"/>
of the soul from the body; it was banished ad inferos, whilst the latter was resolved into dust;
and there was a great interval of separation between them; for the body, by the dissolution
of the flesh, becomes corrupt; the soul being loosened from it, its action ceases. For as when
the king is thrown into chains, the city falls to ruin; or as when the general is taken captive,
the army is scattered abroad; or as when the helmsman is shaken off, the vessel is submerged;
so when the soul is bound in chains, its body goes to pieces; as the city without its king, so
its members are dissolved; as is the case with an army when its general is lost, they are
drowned in death, even as happens to a vessel when deprived of its helmsman. The soul,
therefore, governed the man, as long as the body survived; even as the king governs the city,
the general the army, the helmsman the ship. But it was powerless to rule it, from the time
when it was immoveably tied to it, and became immersed in error; therefore it was that it
declined from the straight path, and followed tempters, giving heed to fornication, idolatry,
and shedding of blood; by which evil deeds it has destroyed the proper manhood. Nay, but
itself also being carried at length to the lower regions, it was there detained by the wicked
tempter. Else was it wont, as the king restores the ruined city, the general collects the dispersed
army, the sailor repairs the broken ship, even so, I say, the soul used to minister
supplies to the body before that the body was dissolved in the dust, being not as yet itself
bound fast with fetters. But after that the soul became bound, not with material fetters but
with sins, and thus was rendered impotent to act, then it left its body in the ground, and
being cast down to the lower regions, it was made the footstool of death, and despicable to
all.</p>
<p>4. Man went forth from paradise to a region which was the sink of unrighteousness,
fornication, adultery, and cruel murder. And there he found his destruction; for all things
conspired to his death, and worked the ruin of him who had hardly entered there. Meanwhile
man wanted some consolation and assistance and rest. For when was it well with man? In
his mother’s womb? But when he was shut up there, he differed but little from the dead.
When he was nourished with milk from the breast? Not even then, indeed, did he feel any
joy. Was it rather whilst he was coming to maturity? But then, especially, dangers impended
over him from his youthful lusts. Was it, lastly, when he grew old? Nay, but then does he
begin to groan, being pressed down by the weight of old age, and the expectation of death.
For what else is old age but the expectation of death? Verily all the inhabitants of earth do
die, young men and old, little children and adults, for no age or bodily stature is exempt
from death. Why, then, is man tormented by this exceeding grief? Doubtless the very aspect
of death begets sadness; for we behold in a dead man the face changed, the figure dead, the
body shrunk up with emaciation, the mouth silent, the skin cold, the carcase prostrate on
the ground, the eyes sunken, the limbs immoveable, the flesh wasted away, the veins congealed,
the bones whitened, the joints dissolved, all parts of him reduced to dust, and the
man no longer existing. What, then, is man? A flower, I say, that is but for a little time, which

<pb n="691"/>
in his mother’s womb is not apparent, in youth flourishes, but which in old age withers and
departs in death.</p>
<p>5. But now, after all this bondage to death and corruption of the manhood, God hath
visited His creature, which He formed after His own image and similitude; and this He hath
done that it might not for ever be the sport of death. Therefore God sent down from heaven
His incorporeal Son to take flesh upon Him in the Virgin’s womb; and thus, equally as thou,
was He made man; to save lost man, and collect all His scattered members. For Christ, when
He joined the manhood to His person, united that which death by the separation of the
body had dispersed. Christ suffered that we should live for ever.</p>
<p>For else why should Christ have died? Had He committed anything worthy of death?
Why did He clothe Himself in flesh who was invested with glory? And since He was God,
why did He become man? And since He reigned in heaven, why did He come down to earth,
and become incarnate in the virgin’s womb? What necessity, I ask, impelled God to come
down to earth, to assume flesh, to be wrapped in swaddling clothes in a manger-cradle, to
be nourished with the milk from the breast, to receive baptism from a servant, to be lifted
up upon the cross, to be interred in an earthly sepulchre, to rise again the third day from
the dead?2474 What necessity, I say, impelled Him to this? It is sufficiently discovered that
He suffered shame for man’s sake, to set him free from death; and that He exclaimed, as in
the words of the prophet, “I have endured as a travailing woman.”2475 In very deed did He
endure for our sakes sorrow, ignominy, torment, even death itself, and burial. For thus He
says Himself by the prophet: “I went down into the deep.”2476 Who made Him thus to go
down? The impious people. Behold, ye sons of men, behold what recompense Israel made
unto Him! She slew her Benefactor, returning evil for good, affliction for joy, death for life.
They slew by nailing to the tree Him who had brought to life their dead, had healed their
maimed, had made their lepers clean, had given light to their blind. Behold, ye sons of men!
behold, all ye people, these new wonders! They suspended Him on the tree, who stretches
out the earth; they transfixed Him with nails who laid firm the foundation of the world;
they circumscribed Him who circumscribed the heavens; they bound Him who absolves
sinners; they gave Him vinegar to drink who hath made them to drink of righteousness;
<note type="footnote">2474 The passage, as far as to “rise again the third day from the dead,” is generally marked with inverted
commas, and Mai remarks that it had been already brought to light by him under the name of the same Alexander,

101, in which is contained the celebrated Monophysite work entitled Fides Patrum. It is established therefore
that this discourse was written in Greek by Alexander, and afterwards translated not only into the Syriac, but
also into the Arabic language. [I have made this passage into a paragraph distinct from the rest.]</note>

they fed Him with gall who hath offered to them the Bread of Life; they caused corruption
to come upon His hands, and feet who healed their hands and feet; they violently closed
His eyes who restored sight to them; they gave Him over to the tomb, who raised their dead
to life both in the time before His Passion and also whilst He was hanging on the tree.</p>
<p>6. For when our Lord was suffering upon the cross, the tombs were burst open, the infernal
region was disclosed, the souls leapt forth, the dead returned to life, and many of
them were seen in Jerusalem, whilst the mystery of the cross was being perfected; what time
our Lord trampled upon death, dissolved the enmity, bound the strong man, and raised the
trophy of the cross, His body being lifted up upon it, that the body might appear on high,
and death to be depressed under the foot of flesh. Then the heavenly powers wondered, the
angels were astonished, the elements trembled, every creature was shaken whilst they looked
on this new mystery, and the terrific spectacle which was being enacted in the universe. Yet
the entire people, as unconscious of the mystery, exulted over Christ in derision; although
the earth was rocking, the mountains, the valleys, and the sea were shaken, and every creature
of God was smitten with confusion. The lights of heaven were afraid, the sun fled away, the
moon disappeared, the stars withdrew their shining, the day came to end;2477 the angel in
astonishment departed from the temple after the rending of the veil, and darkness covered
the earth on which its Lord had closed His eyes. Meanwhile hell2478 was with light resplendent,
for thither had the star descended. The Lord, indeed, did not descend into hell in His
body but in His Spirit. He forsooth is working everywhere, for whilst He raised the dead by
His body, by His spirit was He liberating their souls. For when the body of the Lord was
hung upon the cross, the tombs, as we have said, were opened; hell was unbarred. the dead
received their life, the souls were sent back again into the world, and that because the Lord
had conquered hell, had trodden down death, had covered the enemy with shame; therefore
was it that the souls came forth from Hades, and the dead appeared upon the earth.</p>
<p>7. Ye see, therefore, how great was the effect of the death of Christ, for no creature endured
His fall with equal mind, nor did the elements His Passion, neither did the earth retain
His body, nor hell His Spirit. All things were in the Passion of Christ disturbed and convulsed.
The Lord exclaimed, as once before to Lazarus, Come forth, ye dead, from your tombs and
your secret places; for I, the Christ, give unto you resurrection. For then the earth could not
long hold the body of our Lord that in it was buried; but it exclaimed, O my Lord, pardon
mine iniquities, save me from Thy wrath, absolve me from the curse, for I have received the
blood of the righteous, and yet I have not covered the bodies of men or Thine own body!
What is at length this wonderful mystery? Why, O Lord, didst Thou come down to earth,

unless it was for man’s sake, who has been scattered everywhere: for in every place has Thy
fair image been disseminated? Nay! but if thou shouldest give but one little word, at the instant
all bodies would stand before Thee. Now, since Thou hast come to earth, and hast
sought for the members of Thy fashioning, undertake for man who is Thine own, receive
that which is committed to Thee, recover Thine image, Thine Adam. Then the Lord, the
third day after His death, rose again, thus bringing man to a knowledge of the Trinity. Then
all the nations of the human race were saved by Christ. One submitted to the judgment, and
many thousands were absolved. Moreover, He being made like to man whom He had saved,
ascended to the height of heaven, to offer before His Father, not gold or silver, or precious
stones, but the man whom He had formed after His own image and similitude; and the
Father, raising Him to His right hand, hath seated Him upon a throne on high, and hath
made Him to be judge of the peoples, the leader of the angelic host, the charioteer of the
cherubim, the Son of the true Jerusalem, the Virgin’s spouse, and King for ever and ever.

<head>VI.—The Addition in the Codex, with a Various Reading.</head>
<p>God, therefore, wishing to visit His own form which He had fashioned after His own
image and similitude, hath in these last times sent into the world His incorporeal and only
Son, who being in the Virgin’s womb incarnate, was born perfect man to raise erect lost
man, re-collecting His scattered members. For why else should Christ have died? Was He
capitally accused? And since He was God, why was He made man? Why did He who was
reigning in heaven come down to earth? Who compelled God to come down to earth, to
take flesh of the holy Virgin, to be wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger, to
be nourished with milk, to be baptized in the Jordan, to be mocked of the people, to be
nailed to the tree, to be buried in the bosom of the earth, and the third day to rise again from
the dead; in the cause of redemption to give life for life, blood for blood, to undergo death
for death? For Christ, by dying, hath discharged the debt of death to which man was obnoxious.
Oh, the new and ineffable mystery! the Judge was judged. He who absolves from sin
was bound; He was mocked who once framed the world; He was stretched upon the cross
who stretched out the heavens; He was fed with gall who gave the manna to be bread; He
died who gives life. He was given up to the tomb who raises the dead. The powers were astonished,
the angels wondered, the elements trembled, the whole created universe was
shaken, the earth quaked, and its foundations rocked; the sun fled away, the elements were
subverted, the light of day receded; because they could not bear to look upon their crucified
Lord.2479 The creature, in amazement, said, What is this novel mystery? The judge is judged
and is silent; the invisible is seen and is not confounded; the incomprehensible is grasped
and is not indignant at it; the immeasurable is contained in a measure and makes no opposition;
the impassable suffers and does not avenge its own injury; the immortal dies and
complains not; the celestial is buried and bears it with an equal mind. What, I say, is this
mystery? The creature surely is transfixed with amazement. But when our Lord rose from
death and trampled it down, when He bound the strong man and set man free, then every
creature wondered at the Judge who for Adam’s sake was judged, at the invisible being seen,
at the impassable suffering, at the immortal dead, at the celestial buried in the earth. For
our Lord was made man; He was condemned that He might impart compassion; He was
bound that He might set free; He was apprehended that He might liberate; He suffered that
He might heal our sufferings; He died to restore life to us; He was buried to raise us up. For
when our Lord suffered, His humanity suffered, that which He had like unto man; and He
dissolves the sufferings of him who is His like, and by dying He hath destroyed death. It was
for this cause that He came down upon earth, that by pursuing death He might kill the rebel
that slew men. For one underwent the judgment, and myriads were set free; one was buried,
and myriads rose again. He is the Mediator between God and man; He is the resurrection

and the salvation of all; He is the Guide of the erring, the Shepherd of men who have been
set free, the life of the dead, the charioteer of the cherubim, the standard-bearer of the angels,
and the King of kings, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>
<p>I.
(Some points, p. 289.)</p>
<p>That the theology of the great school of Alexandria had a character of its own, is most
apparent; I should be the last to deny it. As its succession of teachers was like that of
hereditary descent in a family, a family likeness is naturally to be found in this school, from
the great Clement to the great Athanasius. It is a school that hands on the traditions in which
Apollos had been reared; it not less reflects the Greek influences always dominant in the
capital of the Macedonian hero; but it is a school in which the Gospel of Christ as the Light
of the world was always made predominant: and, while a most liberal view of human
knowledge was inculcated in it, yet the faith was always exalted as the mother and mistress
of the true gnosis and of all science. The wise men of this world were summoned with an
imperial voice, from this eldest seat and centre of Christian learning, to cast their crowns
and their treasures at the feet of Jesus. With a generous patronage Clement conceded all he
could to the philosophy of the Greeks, and yet sublimely rose above it to a sphere it never
discovered, and looked down upon all merely human intellect and its achievements like
Uriel in the sun.</p>
<p>It was the special though unconscious mission of this school to prepare the way, and to
shape the thought of Christendom, for the great epoch of the (nominal) conversion of the
empire, and for the all-important synodical period, its logical consequence. It was in this
school that the technical formulas of the Church were naturally wrought out. The process
was like that of the artist who has first to make his own tools. He does many things, and
resorts to many contrivances, never afterwards necessary when once the tools are complete
and his laboratory furnished with all he wants for his work. To my mind, therefore, it is but
a pastime of no practical worth to contrast the idiosyncrasies of Clement with those of
Origen, and to set up distinctions between the Logos of this doctor and that.2480 The differences
to be descried belong to the personal peculiarities of great minds not yet guided to
unity of diction by a scientific theology. The marvel is their harmony of thought. Their ends
and their antagonisms are the same. The outcome of their mental efforts and their pious
faith is seen in the result. Alexander was their product, and Athanasius (bringing all their
sheaves to the Church’s garner, winnowed and harvested) is the perpetual gnomon of the
Alexandrian school. Its testimony, its prescription, its harmony and unity, are all summed
up in him.</p>
<note type="footnote">2480 See, against Petavius and others, Dr. Holmes’s learned note, vol. iii. p. 628, Elucidation I.</note>

<pb n="697"/>
<p>It is extraordinary that many truly evangelical critics seem to see, in the subordination
taught by Origen,2481 something not reconcileable with the Nicene orthodoxy. Even Bishop
Bull is a subordinationist, and so are all the great orthodox divines. When Origen maintains
the μοναρχία (the Father as the root and source of the Godhead, as do all the Greeks2482),
and also a subordination of the Son in the divine οὐσία, he is surely consistent with the
Athanasian doctrine;2483 and, if he is led to affirm a diversity of essence in connection with
this subordination, he does it with such limitations as should convince us that he, too, would
have subscribed the ὁμοούσιον, in which Alexandrians no whit inferior to him finally formulated
the convictions and testimonies of their predecessors.248</p>

<p>II.
(Since the body of the Catholic Church is one, etc., p. 296.)</p>
<p>As so shortly preceding the meeting of the Great Council, this letter is most important
as a clear testimony to the meaning the first council attached to that article of the Creed
which affirms “one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.” We must compare the Treatises
of Cyprian for the West, with this and the Letter of Firmilian2485 for the East, as clearly
elucidating the contemporary mind of the Church, and hence the meaning of those words
which reflect their mind in the Creed. To make any reflections of my own would be out of
place, save only, negatively, as I compare it with the modern creed of the Council of Trent
(Pius IV.), which defines the Catholic Church to be the communion which acknowledges
the Church of Rome as “the mother and mistress of churches.”</p>
<p>The concluding section of this letter is decisive as to the absolute autonomy of the Alexandrian
dioecese.2486 To all the other churches Alexander merely communicates his sentence,
which they are all bound to respect. Whether the Christian Church at this period reflected
the Apostolic Institutions is not the question, but merely what its theory was in the fourth
century, and how far East and West accorded with the theory of Cyprian.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Methodius.</head>
<p>[a.d. 260–312]. Considering the strong language in which Methodius is praised by ancient
writers, as well as by the moderns, I feel that our learned translator has too hastily dismissed
his name and works in the biographical introduction below. Epiphanius makes great use of
him in his refutations of Origen; and Dupin’s critical and historical notice of him is prolonged
and highly discriminating, furnishing an abridgment of all his writings and of those vulgarly
attributed to him heretofore.2487 I have made into an elucidation some references which
may be of use to the student. In like manner, I have thrown into the form of notes and elucidations
what would be less pertinent and less useful in a preface. There are no facts to be
added to what is here given by the translator; and remarks on the several works, which he
has too sparingly annotated, will be more conveniently bestowed, perhaps, on the pages to
which they immediately refer. The following is the translator’s brief but useful</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>Methodius, who is also called Eubulius,2488 was, first of all bishop, simultaneously of
Olympus and Patara, in Lycia, as is testified by several ancient writers.2489 He was afterwards
removed, according to St. Jerome, to the episcopal See of Tyre in Phoenicia, and at the end
of the latest of the great persecutions of the Church, about the year 312, he suffered martyrdom
at Chalcis in Greece. Some consider that it was at Chalcis in Syria, and that St. Jerome’s
testimony ought to be thus understood, as Syria was more likely to be the scene of his martyrdom
that Greece, as being nearer to his diocese. Others affirm that he suffered under
Decius and Valerian; but this is incorrect, since he wrote not only against Origen long after
the death of Adamantius, but also against Porphyry, whilst he was alive, in the reign of
Diocletian.</p>
<p>Methodius is known chiefly as the antagonist of Origen; although, as has been pointed
out, he was himself influenced in no small degree by the method of Origen, as may be seen
by his tendency to allegorical interpretations of Holy Scripture. The only complete work of
this writer which has come down to us is his Banquet of the Ten Virgins, a dialogue of con-

siderable power and grace, in praise of the virginal life. His antagonism to Origen, however,
comes out less in this than in his works On the Resurrection, and On Things Created. The
treatise On Free Will is, according to recent critics, of doubtful authorship, although the
internal evidence must be said to confirm the ancient testimonies which assign it to Methodius.
His writings against Porphyry, with the exception of some slight fragments, are lost,
as are also his exegetical writings.2490</p>
<p>Combefis published an edition of his works in 1644; but only so much of the Banquet
as was contained in the Bibliotheca of Photius. In 1656 Leo Allatius published for the first
time a complete edition of this work at Rome from the Vatican ms. Combefis in 1672 published
an edition founded chiefly upon this; and his work has become the basis of all subsequent
reprints. </p>
<p>The following translation has been made almost entirely from the text of Migne, which

<head>The Banquet of the Ten Virgins;2494
Or,
Concerning Chastity.</head>
<p>Persons of the Dialogue: Euboulios,2495 Gregorion, Arete; Marcella, Theophila,
Thaleia, Theopatra, Thallousa, Agathe, Procilla, Thekla, Tusiane, Domnina.</p>
<p>Introduction.—Plan of the Work; Way to Paradise; Description and Personification
of Virtue; The Agnos a Symbol of Chastity; Marcella, the Eldest and Foremost
Among the Virgins of Christ.</p>
<p>Euboulios. You have arrived most seasonably, Gregorion, for I have just been looking
for you, wanting to hear of the meeting of Marcella and Theopatra, and of the other virgins
who were present at the banquet, and of the nature of their discourses on the subject of
chastity; for it is said that they argued with such ability and power that there was nothing
lacking to the full consideration of the subject. If, therefore, you have come here for any
other purpose, put that off to another time, and do not delay to give us a complete and
connected account of the matter of which we are inquiring.</p>
<p>Gregorion.2496 I seem to be disappointed of my hope, as some one else has given you
intelligence beforehand on the subject respecting which you ask me. For I thought that you
had heard nothing of what had happened, and I was flattering myself greatly with the idea
that I should be the first to tell you of it. And for this reason I made all haste to come here
to you, fearing the very thing which has happened, that some one might anticipate me.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Be comforted, my excellent friend, for we have had no precise information
respecting anything which happened; since the person who brought us the intelligence had
nothing to tell us, except that there had been dialogues; but when he was asked what they
were, and to what purpose, he did not know.</p>

<p>Gregorion. Well then, as I came here for this reason, do you want to hear all that was
said from the beginning; or shall I pass by parts of it, and recall only those points which I
consider worthy of mention?</p>
<p>Euboulios. By no means the latter; but first, Gregorion, relate to us from the very beginning
where the meeting was, and about the setting forth of the viands, and about yourself,
how you poured out the wine
<lg>
<l>“They in golden cups</l>
<l>Each other pledged, while towards broad heaven they looked.”2497</l>

<p>Gregorion. You are always skilful in discussions, and excessively powerful in argument—
thoroughly confuting all your adversaries.</p>
<p>Euboulios. It is not worth while, Gregorion, to contend about these things at present;
but do oblige us by simply telling us what happened from the beginning.</p>
<p>Gregorion. Well, I will try. But first answer me this: You know, I presume, Arete,2498
the daughter of Philosophia?</p>
<p>Euboulios. Why do you ask?</p>
<p>Gregorion. “We went by invitation to a garden of hers with an eastern aspect, to enjoy
the fruits of the season, myself, and Procilla, and Tusiane.” I am repeating the words of Theo
patra, for it was of her I obtained the information. “We went, Gregorion, by a very rough,
steep, and arduous path: when we drew near to the place,” said Theopatra, “we were met
by a tall and beautiful woman walking along quietly and gracefully, clothed in a shining
robe as white as snow. Her beauty was something altogether inconceivable and divine.
Modesty, blended with majesty, bloomed on her countenance. It was a face,” she said, “such
as I know not that I had ever seen, awe-inspiring, yet tempered with gentleness and mirth;
for it was wholly unadorned by art, and had nothing counterfeit. She came up to us, and,
like a mother who sees her daughters after a long separation, she embraced and kissed each
one of us with great joy, saying, ‘O, my daughters, you have come with toil and pain to me
who am earnestly longing to conduct you to the pasture of immortality; toilsomely have
you come by a way abounding with many frightful reptiles; for, as I looked, I saw you often
stepping aside, and I was fearing lest you should turn back and slip over the precipices. But
thanks to the Bridegroom to whom I have espoused2499 you, my children, for having granted
an effectual answer to all our prayers.’ And, while she is thus speaking,” said Theopatra, “we
arrive at the enclosure, the doors not being shut as yet, and as we enter we come upon Thekla
and Agathe and Marcella preparing to sup. And Arete immediately said, ‘Do you also come
hither, and sit down here in your place along with these your fellows.’ Now,” said she to me,

“we who were there as guests were altogether, I think, ten in number; and the place was
marvellously beautiful, and abounding in the means of recreation. The air was diffused in
soft and regular currents, mingled with pure beams of light, and a stream flowing as gently
as oil through the very middle of the garden, threw up a most delicious drink; and the water
flowing from it, transparent and pure, formed itself into fountains, and these, overflowing
like rivers, watered all the garden with their abundant streams; and there were different
kinds of trees there, full of fresh fruits, and the fruits that hung joyfully from their branches
were of equal beauty; and there were ever-blooming meadows strewn with variegated and
sweet-scented flowers, from which came a gentle breeze laden with sweetest odour. And
the agnos2500 grew near, a lofty tree, under which we reposed, from its being exceedingly
wide-spreading and shady.”</p>
<p>Euboulios. You seem to me, my good friend, to be making a revelation of a second
paradise.2501</p>
<p>Gregorion. You speak truly and wisely. “When there,” she said, “we had all kinds of
food and a variety of festivities, so that no delight was wanting. After this Arete,2502 entering,
gave utterance to these words:—</p>
<p>“‘Young maidens, the glory of my greatness, beautiful virgins, who tend the undefiled
meadows of Christ with unwedded hands, we have now had enough of food and feasting,
for all things are abundant and plentiful with us.2503 What is there, then, besides which I
wish and expect? That each of you shall pronounce a discourse in praise of virginity. Let
Marcella begin, since she sits in the highest place, and is at the same time the eldest. I shall
be ashamed of myself if I do not make the successful disputant an object of envy, binding
her with the unfading flowers of wisdom.’</p>
<p>“And then,” I think she said, “Marcella immediately began to speak as follows.”</p>

<head>Discourse I.—Marcella.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—The Difficulty and Excellence of Virginity; The Study of Doctrine Necessary
for Virgins.</head>
<p>Virginity is something supernaturally great, wonderful, and glorious; and, to speak
plainly and in accordance with the Holy Scriptures, this best and noblest manner of life
alone is the root2504 of immortality, and also its flower and first-fruits; and for this reason
the Lord promises that those shall enter into the kingdom of heaven who have made themselves
eunuchs, in that passage2505 of the Gospels in which He lays down the various reasons
for which men have made themselves eunuchs. Chastity with men is a very rare thing, and
difficult of attainment, and in proportion to its supreme excellence and magnificence is the
greatness of its dangers.2506</p>
<p>For this reason, it requires strong and generous natures, such as, vaulting over the stream
of pleasure, direct the chariot of the soul upwards from the earth, not turning aside from
their aim, until having, by swiftness of thought, lightly bounded above the world, and taken
their stand truly upon the vault of heaven, they purely contemplate immortality itself as it
springs forth2507 from the undefiled bosom of the Almighty.</p>
<p>Earth could not bring forth this draught; heaven alone knew the fountain from whence
it flows; for we must think of virginity as walking indeed upon the earth, but as also reaching
up to heaven. And hence some who have longed for it, and considering only the end of it,
have come, by reason of coarseness of mind, ineffectually with unwashed feet, and have
gone aside out of the way, from having conceived no worthy idea of the virginal manner of
life. For it is not enough to keep the body only undefiled, just as we should not show that
we think more of the temple than of the image of the god; but we should care for the souls
of men as being the divinities of their bodies, and adorn them with righteousness. And then
do they most care for them and tend them when, striving untiringly to hear divine discourses,
they do not desist until, wearing the doors of the wise,2508 they attain to the knowledge of
the truth.</p>
<p>For as the putrid humours and matter of flesh, and all those things which corrupt it,
are driven out by salt, in the same manner all the irrational appetites of a virgin are banished
from the body by divine teaching. For it must needs be that the soul which is not sprinkled

with the words of Christ, as with salt, should stink and breed worms, as King David, openly
confessing with tears in the mountains, cried out, “My wounds stink and are corrupt,”2509
because he had not salted himself with the exercises of self-control, and so subdued his
carnal appetites, but self-indulgently had yielded to them, and became corrupted in adultery.
And hence, in Leviticus,2510 every gift, unless it be seasoned with salt, is forbidden to be
offered as an oblation to the Lord God. Now the whole spiritual meditation of the Scriptures
is given to us as salt which stings in order to benefit, and which disinfects, without which it
is impossible for a soul, by means of reason, to be brought to the Almighty; for “ye are the
salt of the earth,”2511 said the Lord to the apostles. It is fitting, then, that a virgin should always
love things which are honourable, and be distinguished among the foremost for wisdom
and addicted to nothing slothful or luxurious, but should excel, and set her mind upon
things worthy of the state of virginity, always putting away, by the word, the foulness of
luxury, lest in any way some slight hidden corruption should breed the worm of incontinence;
for “the unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord,” how she may please the Lord,
“that she may be holy both in body and in spirit,”2512 says the blessed Paul. But many of
them who consider the hearing of the word quite a secondary matter, think they do great
things if they give their attention to it for a little while. But discrimination must be exercised
with respect to these; for it is not fitting to impart divine instruction to a nature which is
careful about trifles, and low, and which counterfeits wisdom. For would it not be laughable
to go on talking to those who direct all their energy towards things of little value, in order
that they may complete most accurately those things which they want to bring to perfection,
but do not think that the greatest pains are to be taken with those necessary things by which
most of all the love of chastity would be increased in them?</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Virginity a Plant from Heaven, Introduced Late; The Advancement of
Mankind to Perfection, How Arranged.</head>
<p>For truly by a great stretch of power the plant of virginity was sent down to men from
heaven, and for this reason it was not revealed to the first generations. For the race of
mankind was still very small in number; and it was necessary that it should first be increased
in number, and then brought to perfection. Therefore the men of old times thought it
nothing unseemly to take their own sisters for wives, until the law coming separated them,
and by forbidding that which at first had seemed to be right, declared it to be a sin, calling
him cursed who should “uncover the nakedness” of his sister;2513 God thus mercifully
bringing to our race the needful help in due season, as parents do to their children. For they
do not at once set masters over them, but allow them, during the period of childhood, to
amuse themselves like young animals, and first send them to teachers stammering like
themselves, until they cast off the youthful wool of the mind, and go onwards to the practice
of greater things, and from thence again to that of greater still. And thus we must consider
that the God and Father of all acted towards our forefathers. For the world, while still unfilled
with men, was like a child, and it was necessary that it should first be filled with these, and
so grow to manhood. But when hereafter it was colonized from end to end, the race of man
spreading to a boundless extent, God no longer allowed man to remain in the same ways,
considering how they might now proceed from one point to another, and advance nearer
to heaven, until, having attained to the very greatest and most exalted lesson of virginity,
they should reach to perfection; that first they should abandon the intermarriage of brothers
and sisters, and marry wives from other families; and then that they should no longer have
many wives, like brute beasts, as though born for the mere propagation of the species; and
then that they should not be adulterers; and then again that they should go on to continence,
and from continence to virginity, when, having trained themselves to despise the flesh, they
sail fearlessly into the peaceful haven of immortality.2514</p>

<head>Chapter III.—By the Circumcision of Abraham, Marriage with Sisters Forbidden;
In the Times of the Prophets Polygamy Put a Stop To; Conjugal Purity Itself by
Degrees Enforced.</head>
<p>If, however, any one should venture to find fault with our argument as destitute of
Scripture proof, we will bring forward the writings of the prophets, and more fully demonstrate
the truth of the statements already made. Now Abraham, when he first received the
covenant of circumcision, seems to signify, by receiving circumcision in a member of his
own body, nothing else than this, that one should no longer beget children with one born
of the same parent; showing that every one should abstain from intercourse with his own
sister, as his own flesh. And thus, from the time of Abraham, the custom of marrying with
sisters has ceased; and from the times of the prophets the contracting of marriage with several
wives has been done away with; for we read, “Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself
from thine appetites;”2515 for “wine and women will make men of understanding to fall
away;”2516 and in another place, “Let thy fountain be blessed; and rejoice with the wife of
thy youth,”2517 manifestly forbidding a plurality of wives. And Jeremiah clearly gives the
name of “fed horses”2518 to those who lust after other women; and we read, “The multiplying
brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any
fast foundation.”2519</p>
<p>Lest, however, we should seem prolix in collecting the testimonies of the prophets, let
us again point out how chastity succeeded to marriage with one wife, taking away by degrees
the lusts of the flesh, until it removed entirely the inclination for sexual intercourse engendered
by habit. For presently one is introduced earnestly deprecating, from henceforth,
this seduction, saying, “O Lord, Father, and Governor of my life, leave me not to their
counsels; give me not a proud look; let not the greediness of the belly, nor lust of the flesh,
take hold of me.”2520 And in the Book of Wisdom, a book full of all virtue, the Holy Spirit,
now openly drawing His hearers to continence and chastity, sings on this wise, “Better it is
to have no children, and to have virtue, for the memorial thereof is immortal; because it is
known with God and with men. When it is present men take example at it; and when it is
gone they desire it: it weareth a crown and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory,
striving for undefiled rewards.”2521</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Christ Alone Taught Virginity, Openly Preaching the Kingdom of
Heaven; The Likeness of God to Be Attained in the Light of the Divine Virtues.</head>
<p>We have already spoken of the periods of the human race, and how, beginning with the
intermarriage of brothers and sisters, it went on to continence; and we have now left for us
the subject of virginity. Let us then endeavour to speak of this as well as we can. And first
let us inquire for what reason it was that no one of the many patriarchs and prophets and
righteous men, who taught and did many noble things, either praised or chose the state of
virginity. Because it was reserved for the Lord alone to be the first to teach this doctrine,
since He alone, coming down to us, taught man to draw near to God; for it was fitting that
He who was first and chief of priests, of prophets, and of angels, should also be saluted as
first and chief of virgins.2522 For in old times man was not yet perfect, and for this reason
was unable to receive perfection, which is virginity. For, being made in the Image of God,
he needed to receive that which was according to His Likeness;2523 which the Word being
sent down into the world to perfect, He first took upon Him our form, disfigured as it was
by many sins, in order that we, for whose sake He bore it, might be able again to receive the
divine form. For it is then that we are truly fashioned in the likeness of God, when we represent
His features in a human life, like skilful painters, stamping them upon ourselves as
upon tablets, learning the path which He showed us. And for this reason He, being God,
was pleased to put on human flesh, so that we, beholding as on a tablet the divine Pattern
of our life, should also be able to imitate Him who painted it. For He was not one who,
thinking one thing, did another; nor, while He considered one thing to be right, taught another.
But whatever things were truly useful and right, these He both taught and did.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Christ, by Preserving His Flesh Incorrupt in Virginity, Draws to the
Exercise of Virginity; The Small Number of Virgins in Proportion to the Number
of Saints.</head>
<p>What then did the Lord, who is the Truth and the Light, take in hand when He came
down from heaven? He preserved the flesh which He had taken upon Him incorrupt in
virginity, so that we also, if we would come to the likeness of God and Christ, should endeavour
to honour virginity. For the likeness of God is the avoiding of corruption. And that the
Word, when He was incarnate, became chief Virgin, in the same way as He was chief
Shepherd and chief Prophet of the Church, the Christ-possessed John shows us, saying, in
the Book of the Revelation, “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having His name and His Father’s name
written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the
elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand,
which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women;
for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth;”2524
showing that the Lord is leader of the choir of virgins. And remark, in addition to this, how
very great in the sight of God is the dignity of virginity: “These were redeemed from among
men, being the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no
guile: for they are without fault,”2525 he says, “and they follow the Lamb whithersoever He
goeth.” And he clearly intends by this to teach us that the number of virgins was, from the
beginning, restricted to so many, namely, a hundred and forty and four thousand, while the
multitude of the other saints is innumerable. For let us consider what he means when discoursing
of the rest. “I beheld a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations,
and kindreds, and people, and tongues.”2526 It is plain, therefore, as I said, that in the case
of the other saints he introduces an unspeakable multitude, while in the case of those who
are in a state of virginity he mentions only a very small number, so as to make a strong
contrast with those who make up the innumerable number.2527</p>
<p>This, O Arete, is my discourse to you on the subject of virginity. But, if I have omitted
anything, let Theophila, who succeeds me, supply the omission.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Marriage Not Abolished by the Commendation of Virginity.</head>
<p>And then, she said, Theophila spoke:—Since Marcella has excellently begun this discussion
without sufficiently completing it, it is necessary that I should endeavour to put a finish
to it. Now, the fact that man has advanced by degrees to virginity, God urging him on from
time to time, seems to me to have been admirably proved; but I cannot say the same as to
the assertion that from henceforth they should no longer beget children. For I think I have
perceived clearly from the Scriptures that, after He had brought in virginity, the Word did
not altogether abolish the generation of children; for although the moon may be greater
than the stars, the light of the other stars is not destroyed by the moonlight.</p>
<p>Let us begin with Genesis, that we may give its place of antiquity and supremacy to this
scripture. Now the sentence and ordinance of God respecting the begetting of children2528
is confessedly being fulfilled to this day, the Creator still fashioning man. For this is quite
manifest, that God, like a painter, is at this very time working at the world, as the Lord also
taught, “My Father worketh hitherto.”2529 But when the rivers shall cease to flow and fall
into the reservoir of the sea, and the light shall be perfectly separated from the darkness,—for
the separation is still going on,—and the dry land shall henceforth cease to bring forth its
fruits with creeping things and four-footed beasts, and the predestined number of men shall
be fulfilled; then from henceforth shall men abstain from the generation of children. But at
present man must cooperate in the forming of the image of God, while the world exists and
is still being formed; for it is said, “Increase and multiply.”2530 And we must not be offended
at the ordinance of the Creator, from which, moreover, we ourselves have our being. For
the casting of seed into the furrows of the matrix is the beginning of the generation of men,
so that bone taken from bone, and flesh from flesh, by an invisible power, are fashioned
into another man. And in this way we must consider that the saying is fulfilled, “This is now
bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh.”2531</p>

<p>And this perhaps is what was shadowed forth by the sleep and trance of the first man,
which prefigured the embraces of connubial love. When thirsting for children a man falls
into a kind of trance,2532 softened and subdued by the pleasures of generation as by sleep,
so that again something drawn from his flesh and from his bones is, as I said, fashioned into
another man. For the harmony of the bodies being disturbed in the embraces of love, as
those tell us who have experience of the marriage state, all the marrow-like and generative
part of the blood, like a kind of liquid bone, coming together from all the members, worked
into foam and curdled, is projected through the organs of generation into the living body
of the female. And probably it is for this reason that a man is said to leave his father and his
mother, since he is then suddenly unmindful of all things when united to his wife in the
embraces of love, he is overcome by the desire of generation, offering his side to the divine
Creator to take away from it, so that the father may again appear in the son.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if God still forms man, shall we not be guilty of audacity if we think of the
generation of children as something offensive, which the Almighty Himself is not ashamed
to make use of in working with His undefiled hands; for He says to Jeremiah, “Before I
formed thee in the belly I knew thee;”2533 and to Job, “Didst thou take clay and form a living
creature, and make it speak upon the earth?”2534 and Job draws near to Him in supplication,
saying, “Thine hands have made me and fashioned me.”2535 Would it not, then, be absurd
to forbid marriage unions, seeing that we expect that after us there will be martyrs, and
those who shall oppose the evil one, for whose sake also the Word promised that He would
shorten those days?2536 For if the generation of children henceforth had seemed evil to God,
as you said, for what reason will those who have come into existence in opposition to the
divine decree and will be able to appear well-pleasing to God? And must not that which is
begotten be something spurious, and not a creature of God, if, like a counterfeit coin, it is
moulded apart from the intention and ordinance of the lawful authority? And so we concede
to men the power of forming men.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—An Ambiguous Passage of Scripture; Not Only the Faithful But Even
Prelates Sometimes Illegitimate.</head>
<p>But Marcella, interrupting, said, “O Theophila, there appears here a great mistake, and
something contrary to what you have said; and do you think to escape under cover of the
cloud which you have thrown around you? For there comes that argument, which perhaps
any one who addresses you as a very wise person will bring forward: What do you say of
those who are begotten unlawfully in adultery? For you laid it down that it was inconceivable
and impossible for any one to enter into the world unless he was introduced by the will of
the divine Ruler, his frame being prepared for him by God. And that you may not take refuge
behind a safe wall, bringing forward the Scripture which says, ‘As for the children of the
adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection,’2537 he will answer you easily, that we
often see those who are unlawfully begotten coming to perfection like ripe fruit.</p>
<p>And if, again, you answer sophistically, ‘O, my friend, by those who come not to perfection
I understand being perfected in Christ-taught righteousness;’ he will say, ‘But, indeed,
my worthy friend, very many who are begotten of unrighteous seed are not only numbered
among those who are gathered into the flock of the brethren, but are often called even to
preside over them.2538 Since, then, it is clear, and all testify, that those who are born of
adultery do come to perfection, we must not imagine that the Spirit was teaching respecting
conceptions and births, but rather perhaps concerning those who adulterate the truth, who,
corrupting the Scriptures by false doctrines, bring forth an imperfect and immature wisdom,
mixing their error with piety.’ And, therefore, this plea being taken away from you, come
now and tell us if those who are born of adultery are begotten by the will of God; for you
said that it was impossible that the offspring of a man should be brought to perfection unless
the Lord formed it and gave it life.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Human Generation, and the Work of God Therein Set Forth.</head>
<p>Theophila, as though caught round the middle by a strong antagonist, grew giddy, and
with difficulty recovering herself, replied, “You ask a question, my worthy friend, which
needs to be solved by an example, that you may still better understand how the creative
power of God, pervading all things, is more especially the real cause in the generation of
men, making those things to grow which are planted in the productive earth. For that which
is sown is not to be blamed, but he who sows in a strange soil by unlawful embraces, as
though purchasing a slight pleasure by shamefully selling his own seed. For imagine our
birth into the world to be like some such thing as a house having its entrance lying close to
lofty mountains; and that the house extends a great way down, far from the entrance, and
that it has many holes behind, and that in this part it has circular.” “I imagine it,” said
Marcella. “Well, then, suppose that a modeller seated within is fashioning many statues;
imagine, again, that the substance of clay is incessantly brought to him from without, through
the holes, by many men who do not any of them see the artist himself. Now suppose the
house to be covered with mist and clouds, and nothing visible to those who are outside but
only the holes.” “Let this also be supposed,” she said. “And that each one of those who are
labouring together to provide the clay has one hole allotted to himself, into which he alone
has to bring and deposit his own clay, not touching any other hole. And if, again, he shall
officiously endeavour to open that which is allotted to another, let him be threatened with
fire and scourges.</p>
<p>“Well, now, consider further what comes after this: the modeller within going round
to the holes and taking privately for his modelling the clay which he finds at each hole, and
having in a certain number of months made his model, giving it back through the same
hole; having this for his rule, that every lump of clay which is capable of being moulded
shall be worked up indifferently, even if it be unlawfully thrown by any one through another’s
hole, for the clay has done no wrong, and, therefore, as being blameless, should be moulded
and formed; but that he who, in opposition to the ordinance and law, deposited it in another’s
hole, should be punished as a criminal and transgressor. For the clay should not be blamed,
but he who did this in violation of what is right; for, through incontinence, having carried
it away, he secretly, by violence, deposited it in another’s hole.” “You say most truly.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Holy Father Follows Up the Same Argument.</head>
<p>And now that these things are completed, it remains for you to apply this picture, my
wisest of friends, to the things which have been already spoken of; comparing the house to
the invisible nature of our generation, and the entrance adjacent to the mountains to the
sending down of our souls from heaven, and their descent into the bodies; the holes to the
female sex, and the modeller to the creative power of God, which, under the cover of generation,
making use of our nature, invisibly forms us men within, working the garments for
the souls. Those who carry the clay represent the male sex in the comparison; when thirsting
for children, they bring and cast in seed into the natural channels of the female, as those in
the comparison cast clay into the holes. For the seed, which, so to speak, partakes of a divine
creative power, is not to be thought guilty of the incentives to incontinence; and art always
works up the matter submitted to it; and nothing is to be considered as evil in itself, but
becomes so by the act of those who used it in such a way; for when properly and purely
made use of, it comes out pure, but if disgracefully and improperly, then it becomes disgraceful.
For how did iron, which was discovered for the benefit of agriculture and the arts, injure
those who sharpened it for murderous battles? Or how did gold, or silver, or brass, and, to
take it collectively, the whole of the workable earth, injure those who, ungratefully towards
their Creator, make a wrong use of them by turning parts of them into various kinds of
idols? And if any one should supply wool from that which had been stolen to the weaving
art, that art, regarding this one thing only, manufactures the material submitted to it, if it
will receive the preparation, rejecting nothing of that which is serviceable to itself, since that
which is stolen is here not to be blamed, being lifeless. And, therefore, the material itself is
to be wrought and adorned, but he who is discovered to have abstracted it unjustly should
be punished. So, in like manner, the violators of marriage, and those who break the strings
of the harmony of life, as of a harp, raging with lust, and letting loose their desires in adultery,
should themselves be tortured and punished, for they do a great wrong stealing from the
gardens of others the embraces of generation; but the seed itself, as in the case of the wool,
should be formed and endowed with life.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—God Cares Even for Adulterous Births; Angels Given to Them as

<p>But what need is there to protract the argument by using such examples? for nature
could not thus, in a little time, accomplish so great a work without divine help. For who
gave to the bones their fixed nature? and who bound the yielding members with nerves, to
be extended and relaxed at the joints? or who prepared channels for the blood, and a soft
windpipe for the breath? or what god caused the humours to ferment, mixing them with
blood and forming the soft flesh out of the earth, but only the Supreme Artist making us to
be man, the rational and living image of Himself, and forming it like wax, in the womb,
from moist slight seed? or by whose providence was it that the foetus was not suffocated by
damp when shut up within, in the connexion of the vessels? or who, after it was brought
forth and had come into the light, changed it from weakness and smallness to size, and
beauty, and strength, unless God Himself, the Supreme Artist, as I said, making by His cre-
ative power copies of Christ, and living pictures? Whence, also, we have received from the
inspired writings, that those who are begotten, even though it be in adultery, are committed
to guardian angels. But if they came into being in opposition to the will and the decree of
the blessed nature of God, how should they be delivered over to angels, to be nourished
with much gentleness and indulgence? and how, if they had to accuse their own parents,
could they confidently, before the judgment seat of Christ, invoke Him and say, “Thou didst
not, O Lord, grudge us this common light; but these appointed us to death, despising Thy
command?” “For,” He says, “children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness
against their parents at their trial.”2539</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Rational Soul from God Himself; Chastity Not the Only Good,
Although the Best and Most Honoured.</head>
<p>And perhaps there will be room for some to argue plausibly among those who are
wanting in discrimination and judgment, that this fleshly garment of the soul, being planted
by men, is shaped spontaneously apart from the sentence of God. If, however, he should
teach that the immortal being of the soul also is sown along with the mortal body, he will
not be believed; for the Almighty alone breathes into man the undying and undecaying part,
as also it is He alone who is Creator of the invisible and indestructible. For, He says, He
“breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”2540 And those
artificers who, to the destruction of men, make images in human form, not perceiving and
knowing their own Maker, are blamed by the Word, which says, in the Book of Wisdom, a
book full of all virtue,2541 “his heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life
of less value than clay; forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and Him that inspired into
him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit;”2542 that is, God, the Maker of all men;
therefore, also, according to the apostle, He “will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the truth.”2543 And now, although this subject be scarcely completed,
yet there are others which remain to be discussed. For when one thoroughly examines and
understands those things which happen to man according to his nature, he will know not
to despise the procreation of children, although he applauds chastity, and prefers it in honour.
For although honey be sweeter and more pleasant than other things, we are not for that
reason to consider other things bitter which are mixed up in the natural sweetness of fruits.
And, in support of these statements, I will bring forward a trustworthy witness, namely,
Paul, who says, “So then he that giveth her2544 in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth
her not in marriage doeth better.”2545 Now the word, in setting forth that which is better
and sweeter, did not intend to take away the inferior, but arranges so as to assign to each
its own proper use and advantage. For there are some to whom it is not given to attain virginity;
and there are others whom He no longer wills to be excited by procreations to lust,
and to be defiled, but henceforth to meditate and to keep the mind upon the transformation

<head>Chapter I.—Passages of Holy Scripture2550 Compared.</head>
<p>You seem to me, O Theophila, to excel all in action and in speech, and to be second to
none in wisdom. For there is no one who will find fault with your discourse, however contentious
and contradictory he may be. Yet, while everything else seems rightly spoken, one
thing, my friend, distresses and troubles me, considering that that wise and most spiritual
man—I mean Paul—would not vainly refer to Christ and the Church the union of the first
man and woman,2551 if the Scripture meant nothing higher than what is conveyed by the
mere words and the history; for if we are to take the Scripture as a bare representation wholly
referring to the union of man and woman, for what reason should the apostle, calling these
things to remembrance, and guiding us, as I opine, into the way of the Spirit, allegorize the
history of Adam and Eve as having a reference to Christ and the Church? For the passage
in Genesis reads thus: “And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”2552
But the apostle considering this passage, by no means, as I said, intends to take it according
to its mere natural sense, as referring to the union of man and woman, as you do; for you,
explaining the passage in too natural a sense, laid down that the Spirit is speaking only of
conception and births; that the bone taken from the bones was made another man, and that
living creatures coming together swell like trees at the time of conception. But he, more
spiritually referring the passage to Christ, thus teaches: “He that loveth his wife loveth
himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as
the Lord the Church: for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For
this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church.”2553</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Digressions of the Apostle Paul; The Character of His Doctrine:
Nothing in It Contradictory; Condemnation of Origen, Who Wrongly Turns
Everything into Allegory.</head>
<p>Let it not disturb you, if, in discussing one class of subjects, he, i.e., Paul, should pass
over into another, so as to appear to mix them up, and to import matters foreign to the
subject under consideration, departing from the question, as now for instance. For wishing,
as it seems, to strengthen most carefully the argument on behalf of chastity, he prepares the
mode of argument beforehand, beginning with the more persuasive mode of speech. For
the character of his speech being very various, and arranged for the purpose of progressive
proof, begins gently, but flows forward into a style which is loftier and more magnificent.
And then, again changing to what is deep, he sometimes finishes with what is simple and
easy, and sometimes with what is more difficult and delicate; and yet introducing nothing
which is foreign to the subject by these changes, but, bringing them all together according
to a certain marvellous relationship, he works into one the question which is set forth as his
subject. It is needful, then, that I should more accurately unfold the meaning of the apostle’s
arguments, yet rejecting nothing of what has been said before. For you seem to me, O
Theophila, to have discussed those words of the Scripture amply and clearly, and to have
set them forth as they are without mistake. For it is a dangerous thing wholly to despise the
literal meaning,2554 as has been said, and especially of Genesis, where the unchangeable
decrees of God for the constitution of the universe are set forth, in agreement with which,
even until now, the world is perfectly ordered, most beautifully in accordance with a perfect
rule, until the Lawgiver Himself having re-arranged it, wishing to order it anew, shall break
up the first laws of nature by a fresh disposition. But, since it is not fitting to leave the
demonstration of the argument unexamined—and, so to speak, half-lame—come let us, as
it were completing our pair, bring forth the analogical sense, looking more deeply into the
Scripture; for Paul is not to be despised when he passes over the literal meaning, and shows
that the words extend to Christ and the Church.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Comparison Instituted Between the First and Second Adam.</head>
<p>And, first, we must inquire if Adam can be likened to the Son of God, when he was
found in the transgression of the Fall, and heard the sentence, “Dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return.”2555 For how shall he be considered “the first-born of every creature,”2556
who, after the creation of the earth and the firmament, was formed out of clay? And how
shall he be admitted to be “the tree of life” who was cast out for his transgression,2557 lest
“he should again stretch forth his hand and eat of it, and live forever?”2558 For it is necessary
that a thing which is likened unto anything else, should in many respects be similar and
analogous to that of which it is the similitude, and not have its constitution opposite and
dissimilar. For one who should venture to compare the uneven to the even, or harmony to
discord, would not be considered rational. But the even should be compared to that which
in its nature is even, although it should be even only in a small measure; and the white to
that which in its nature is white, even although it should be very small, and should show
but moderately the whiteness by reason of which it is called white. Now, it is beyond all
doubt clear to every one, that that which is sinless and incorrupt is even, and harmonious,
and bright as wisdom; but that that which is mortal and sinful is uneven and discordant,
and cast out as guilty and subject to condemnation.</p>

<p>Such, then, I consider to be the objections urged by many who, despising, as it seems,
the wisdom of Paul, dislike the comparing of the first man to Christ. For come, let us consider
how rightly Paul compared Adam to Christ, not only considering him to be the type and
image, but also that Christ Himself became the very same thing,2559 because the Eternal
Word fell upon Him. For it was fitting that the first-born of God, the first shoot, the onlybegotten,
even the wisdom of God, should be joined to the first-formed man, and first and
first-born of mankind, and should become incarnate. And this was Christ, a man filled with
the pure and perfect Godhead, and God received into man. For it was most suitable that the
oldest of the Æons and the first of the Archangels, when about to hold communion with
men, should dwell in the oldest and the first of men, even Adam. And thus, when renovating
those things which were from the beginning, and forming them again of the Virgin by the
Spirit, He frames the same2560 just as at the beginning. When the earth was still virgin and
untilled, God, taking mould, formed the reasonable creature from it without seed.2561</p>

<p>And here I may adduce the prophet Jeremiah as a trustworthy and lucid witness, who

the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he
made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.”2562 For when Adam,
having been formed out of clay, was still soft and moist, and not yet, like a tile, made hard
and incorruptible, sin ruined him, flowing and dropping down upon him like water. And
therefore God, moistening him afresh and forming anew the same clay to His honour,
having first hardened and fixed it in the Virgin’s womb, and united and mixed it with the
Word, brought it forth into life no longer soft and broken; lest, being overflowed again by
streams of corruption from without, it should become soft, and perish as the Lord in His
teaching shows in the parable of the finding of the sheep; where my Lord says to those
standing by, “What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not
leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost until he find it?
and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing; and when he cometh
home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me;
for I have found my sheep which was lost.”</p>

<p>Now, since He truly was and is, being in the beginning with God, and being God,2563
He is the chief Commander and Shepherd of the heavenly ones, whom all reasonable creatures
obey and attend, who tends in order and numbers the multitudes of the blessed angels. For
this is the equal and perfect number of immortal creatures, divided according to their races
and tribes, man also being here taken into the flock. For he also was created without corruption,
that he might honour the king and maker of all things, responding to the shouts of the
melodious angels which came from heaven. But when it came to pass that, by transgressing
the commandment (of God), he suffered a terrible and destructive fall, being thus reduced
to a state of death, for this reason the Lord says that He came from heaven into (a human)
life, leaving the ranks and the armies of angels. For the mountains are to be explained by
the heavens, and the ninety and nine sheep by the principalities and powers2564 which the
Captain and Shepherd left when He went down to seek the lost one. For it remained that
man should be included in this catalogue and number, the Lord lifting him up and wrapping
him round, that he might not again, as I said, be overflowed and swallowed up by the waves
of deceit. For with this purpose the Word assumed the nature of man, that, having overcome
the serpent, He might by Himself destroy the condemnation which had come into being
along with man’s ruin. For it was fitting that the Evil One should be overcome by no other,
but by him whom he had deceived, and whom he was boasting that he held in subjection,
because no otherwise was it possible that sin and condemnation should be destroyed, unless
that same man on whose account it had been said, “Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt
return,”2565 should be created anew, and undo the sentence which for his sake had gone
forth on all, that “as in Adam” at first “all die, even so” again “in Christ,” who assumed the
nature and position of Adam, should “all be made alive.”2566</p>

<p>And now we seem to have said almost enough on the fact that man has become the organ
and clothing of the Only-begotten, and what He was who came to dwell in him. But the fact
that there is no moral inequality or discord2567 may again be considered briefly from the
beginning. For he speaks well who says that that is in its own nature good and righteous
and holy, by participation of which other things become good, and that wisdom is in connection
with2568 God, and that, on the other hand, sin is unholy and unrighteous and evil.
For life and death, corruption and incorruption, are two things in the highest degree opposed
to each other. For life is a moral equality, but corruption an inequality; and righteousness
and prudence a harmony, but unrighteousness and folly a discord. Now, man being between
these is neither righteousness itself, nor unrighteousness; but being placed midway between
incorruption and corruption, to whichever of these he may incline is said to partake of the
nature of that which has laid hold of him. Now, when he inclines to corruption, he becomes
corrupt and mortal, and when to incorruption, he becomes incorrupt and immortal. For,
being placed midway between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
of the Fruit of which he tasted,2569 he was changed into the nature of the latter, himself being
neither the tree of life nor that of corruption; but having been shown forth as mortal, from
his participation in and presence with corruption, and, again, as incorrupt and immortal
by connection with and participation in life; as Paul also taught, saying, “Corruption shall
not inherit incorruption, nor death life,”2570 rightly defining corruption and death to be
that which corrupts and kills, and not that which is corrupted and dies; and incorruption
and life that which gives life and immortality, and not that which receives life and immortality.
And thus man is neither a discord and an inequality, nor an equality and a harmony.
But when he received discord, which is transgression and sin, he became discordant and
unseemly; but when he received harmony, that is righteousness, he became a harmonious
and seemly organ, in order that the Lord, the Incorruption which conquered death, might
harmonize the resurrection with the flesh, not suffering it again to be inherited by corruption.
And on this point also let these statements suffice.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Bones and Flesh of Wisdom; The Side Out of Which the Spiritual
Eve is Formed, the Holy Spirit; The Woman the Help-Meet of Adam; Virgins
Betrothed to Christ.</head>
<p>For it has been already established by no contemptible arguments from Scripture, that
the first man may be properly referred to Christ Himself, and is no longer a type and representation
and image of the Only-begotten, but has become actually Wisdom and the Word.</p>
<p>For man, having been composed, like water, of wisdom and life, has become identical
with the very same untainted light which poured into him. Whence it was that the apostle
directly referred to Christ the words which had been spoken of Adam. For thus will it be
most certainly agreed that the Church is formed out of His bones and flesh; and it was for
this cause that the Word, leaving His Father in heaven, came down to be “joined to His
wife;”2571 and slept in the trance of His passion, and willingly suffered death for her, that
He might present the Church to Himself glorious and blameless, having cleansed her by the
laver,2572 for the receiving of the spiritual and blessed seed, which is sown by Him who with
whispers implants it in the depths of the mind; and is conceived and formed by the Church,
as by a woman. so as to give birth and nourishment to virtue. For in this way, too, the
command, “Increase and multiply,”2573 is duly fulfilled, the Church increasing daily in
greatness and beauty and multitude, by the union and communion of the Word who now
still comes down to us and falls into a trance by the memorial of His passion; for otherwise
the Church could not conceive believers, and give them new birth by the laver of regeneration,
unless Christ, emptying Himself for their sake, that He might be contained by them, as I
said, through the recapitulation of His passion, should die again, coming down from heaven,
and being “joined to His wife,” the Church, should provide for a certain power being taken
from His own side, so that all who are built up in Him should grow up, even those who are
born again by the laver, receiving of His bones and of His flesh, that is, of His holiness and
of His glory. For he who says that the bones and flesh of Wisdom are understanding and
virtue, says most rightly; and that the side2574 is the Spirit of truth, the Paraclete, of whom
the illuminated2575 receiving are fitly born again to incorruption. For it is impossible for
any one to be a partaker of the Holy Spirit, and to be chosen a member of Christ, unless the
Word first came down upon him and fell into a trance, in order that he, being filled2576

with the Spirit, and rising again from sleep with Him who was laid to sleep for his sake,
should be able to receive renewal and restoration. For He may fitly be called the side2577 of
the Word, even the sevenfold Spirit of truth, according to the prophet;2578 of whom God
taking, in the trance of Christ, that is, after His incarnation and passion, prepares a helpmeet
for Him2579—I mean the souls which are betrothed and given in marriage to Him.
For it is frequently the case that the Scriptures thus call the assembly and mass of believers
by the name of the Church, the more perfect in their progress being led up to be the one
person and body of the Church. For those who are the better, and who embrace the truth
more clearly, being delivered from the evils of the flesh, become, on account of their perfect
purification and faith, a church and help-meet of Christ, betrothed and given in marriage
to Him as a virgin, according to the apostle,2580 so that receiving the pure and genuine seed
of His doctrine, they may co-operate with Him, helping in preaching for the salvation of
others. And those who are still imperfect and beginning their lessons, are born to salvation,
and shaped, as by mothers, by those who are more perfect, until they are brought forth and
regenerated unto the greatness and beauty of virtue; and so these, in their turn making
progress, having become a church, assist in labouring for the birth and nurture of other
children, accomplishing in the receptacle of the soul, as in a womb, the blameless will of the
Word.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Dispensation of Grace in Paul the Apostle.</head>
<p>Now we should consider the case of the renowned Paul, that when he was not yet perfect
in Christ, he was first born and suckled, Ananias preaching to him, and renewing him in
baptism, as the history in the Acts relates. But when he was grown to a man, and was built
up, then being moulded to spiritual perfection, he was made the help-meet and bride of the
Word; and receiving and conceiving the seeds of life, he who was before a child, becomes
a church and a mother, himself labouring in birth of those who, through him, believed in
the Lord, until Christ was formed and born in them also. For he says, “My little children,
of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;”2581 and again, “In Christ
Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.”2582</p>
<p>It is evident, then, that the statement respecting Eve and Adam is to be referred to the
Church and Christ. For this is truly a great mystery and a supernatural, of which I, from my
weakness and dulness, am unable to speak, according to its worth and greatness. Nevertheless,
let us attempt it. It remains that I speak to you on what follows, and of its signification.</p>

<p>Now Paul, when summoning all persons to sanctification and purity, in this way referred
that which had been spoken concerning the first man and Eve in a secondary sense to Christ
and the Church, in order to silence the ignorant, now deprived of all excuse. For men who
are incontinent in consequence of the uncontrolled impulses of sensuality in them, dare to
force the Scriptures beyond their true meaning, so as to twist into a defence of their incontinence
the saying, “Increase and multiply;”2583 and the other, “Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother;”2584 and they are not ashamed to run counter to the Spirit, but,
as though born for this purpose, they kindle up the smouldering and lurking passion, fanning
and provoking it; and therefore he, cutting off very sharply these dishonest follies and invented
excuses, and having arrived at the subject of instructing them how men should behave
to their wives, showing that it should be as Christ did to the Church, “who gave Himself for
it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing2585 of water by the Word,”2586 he
referred back to Genesis, mentioning the things spoken concerning the first man, and explaining
these things as bearing on the subject before him, that he might take away occasion
for the abuse of these passages from those who taught the sensual gratification of the body,
under the pretext of begetting children.</p>

when he says,2588 Now, concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a
man not to touch a woman,” thence showing already very clearly that it is good not to
touch2589 a woman, laying it down. and setting it forth unconditionally. But afterwards,
being aware of the weakness of the less continent, and their passion for intercourse, he
permitted those who are unable to govern the flesh to use their own wives, rather than,
shamefully transgressing, to give themselves up to fornication. Then, after having given this
permission, he immediately added these words,2590 “that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency;”
which means, “if you, such as you are, cannot, on account of the incontinence
and softness of your bodies, be perfectly continent, I will rather permit you to have intercourse
with your own wives, lest, professing perfect continence, ye be constantly tempted
by the evil one, and be inflamed with lust after other men’s wives.”</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Paul an Example to Widows, and to Those Who Do Not Live with
Their Wives.</head>
<p>Come, now, and let us examine more carefully the very words which are before us, and
observe that the apostle did not grant these things unconditionally to all, but first laid down
the reason on account of which he was led to this. For, having set forth that “it is good for
a man not to touch a woman,”2591 he added immediately, “Nevertheless, to avoid fornication,
let every man have his own wife”2592—that is, “on account of the fornication which would
arise from your being unable to restrain your voluptuousness”—“and let every woman have
her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also
the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one
the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer;2593
and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this
by permission, and not of commandment.”2594 And this is very carefully considered. “By
permission” he says, showing that he was giving counsel, “not of command;” for he receives
command respecting chastity and the not touching of a woman, but permission respecting
those who are unable, as I said, to chasten their appetites. These things, then, he lays down
concerning men and women who are married to one spouse, or who shall hereafter be so;
but we must now examine carefully the apostle’s language respecting men who have lost
their wives, and women who have lost their husbands, and what he declares on this subject.</p>
<p>“I say therefore,” he goes on,2595 “to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if
they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than
to burn.” Here also he persisted in giving the preference to continence. For, taking himself
as a notable example, in order to stir them up to emulation, he challenged his hearers to
this state of life, teaching that it was better that a man who had been bound to one wife
should henceforth remain single, as he also did.2596 But if, on the other hand, this should
be a matter of difficulty to any one, on account of the strength of animal passion, he allows
that one who is in such a condition may, “by permission,” contract a second marriage; not
as though he expressed the opinion that a second marriage was in itself good,2597 but judging

it better than burning. Just as though, in the fast which prepares for the Easter celebration,
one should offer food to another who was dangerously ill, and say,” In truth, my friend, it
were fitting and good that you should bravely hold out like us, and partake of the same
things,2598 for it is forbidden even to think of food to-day; but since you are held down and
weakened by disease, and cannot bear it, therefore, ‘by permission,’ we advise you to eat
food, lest, being quite unable, from sickness, to hold up against the desire for food, you
perish.” Thus also the apostle speaks here, first saying that he wished all were healthy and
continent, as he also was, but afterwards allowing a second marriage to those who are
burdened with the disease of the passions, lest they should be wholly defiled by fornication,
goaded on by the itchings of the organs of generation to promiscuous intercourse, considering
such a second marriage far preferable to burning and indecency.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Doctrine of Paul Concerning Virginity Explained.</head>
<p>I have now brought to an end what I have to say respecting continence and marriage
and chastity, and intercourse with men, and in which of these there is help towards progress
in righteousness; but it still remains to speak concerning virginity—if, indeed, anything be
prescribed on this subject. Let us then treat this subject also; for it stands thus:2599 “Now
concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one
that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I suppose therefore that this is good for
the present distress; I say, that it is good for a man so to be. Art thou bound unto a wife?
seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. But and if thou marry,
thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have
trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.” Having given his opinion with great caution respecting
virginity, and being about to advise him who wished it to give his virgin in marriage, so that
none of those things which conduce to sanctification should be of necessity and by compulsion,
but according to the free purpose of the soul. for this is acceptable to God, he does not
wish these things to be said as by authority, and as the mind of the Lord, with reference to
the giving of a virgin in marriage; for after he had said,2600 “if a virgin marry, she hath not
sinned,” directly afterwards, with the greatest caution, he modified his statement, showing
that he had advised these things by human permission, and not by divine. So, immediately
after he had said, “if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned,” he added, “such shall have trouble
in the flesh: but I spare you.”2601 By which he means: “I sparing you, such as you are, consented
to these things, because you have chosen to think thus of them, that I may not seem
to hurry you on by violence, and compel any one to this.2602 But yet if it shall please you
who find chastity hard to bear, rather to turn to marriage; I consider it to be profitable for
you to restrain yourselves in the gratification of the flesh, not making your marriage an occasion
for abusing your own vessels to uncleanness.” Then he adds,2603 “But this I say,
brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they
had none.” And again, going on and challenging them to the same things, he confirmed his
statement, powerfully supporting the state of virginity, and adding expressly the following
words to those which he had spoken before, he exclaimed,2604 “I would have you without

carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord:2605 but he
that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There
is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things
of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth
for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.” Now it is clear to all, without
any doubt, that to care for the things of the Lord and to please God, is much better than to
care for the things of the world and to please one’s wife. For who is there so foolish and
blind. as not to perceive in this statement the higher praise which Paul accords to chastity?

<head>Chapter XIV.—Virginity a Gift of God: the Purpose of Virginity Not Rashly to Be
Adopted by Any One.</head>
<p>Consider besides how, in addition to the words already quoted, he commends the state
of virginity as a gift of God. Wherefore he rejects those of the more incontinent, who, under
the influence of vain-glory, would advance to this state, advising them to marry, lest in their
time of manly strength, the flesh stirring up the desires and passions, they should be goaded
on to defile the soul. For let us consider what he lays down:2607 “But if any man think that
he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin,” he says,” if she pass the flower of her
age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let him marry;” properly
here preferring marriage to “uncomeliness,” in the case of those who had chosen the state
of virginity, but afterwards finding it intolerable and grievous, and in word boasting of their
perseverance before men, out of shame, but indeed no longer having the power to persevere
in the life of a eunuch. But for him who of his own free will and purpose decides to preserve
his flesh in virgin purity, “having no necessity,”2608 that is, passion calling forth his loins to
intercourse, for there are, as it seems, differences in men’s bodies; such a one contending
and struggling, and zealously abiding by his profession, and admirably fulfilling it, he exhorts
to abide and to preserve it, according the highest prize to virginity. For he that is able, he
says, and ambitious to preserve his flesh pure, does better; but he that is unable, and enters
into marriage lawfully, and does not indulge in secret corruption, does well. And now enough
has been said on these subjects.</p>
<p>Let any one who will, take in his hand the Epistle to the Corinthians, and, examining
all its passages one by one, then consider what we have said, comparing them together, as

<head>Chapter II.—The Protection of Chastity and Virginity Divinely Given to Men, that
They May Emerge from the Mire of Vices.</head>
<p>Now I at least seem to perceive that nothing has been such a means of restoring men
to paradise, and of the change to incorruption, and of reconciliation to God, and such a
means of salvation to men, by guiding us to life, as chastity. And I will now endeavour to
show why I think so concerning these things, that having heard distinctly the power of the
grace already spoken of, you may know of how great blessings it has become the giver to
us. Anciently, then, after the fall of man, when he was cast out by reason of his transgression,
the stream of corruption poured forth abundantly, and running along in violent currents,
not only fiercely swept along whatever touched it from without, but also rushing within it,
overwhelmed the souls of men. And they,2610 continuously exposed to this, were carried
along dumb and stupid, neglecting to pilot their vessels,2611 from having nothing firm to
lay hold of. For the senses of the soul, as those have said who are learned in these things,
when, being overcome by the excitements to passion which fall upon them from without,
they receive the sudden bursts of the waves of folly which rush into them, being darkened
turn aside from the divine course its whole vessel, which is by nature easily guided.
Wherefore God, pitying us who were in such a condition, and were able neither to stand
nor to rise, sent down from heaven the best and most glorious help, virginity, that by it we
might tie our bodies fast, like ships, and have a calm, coming to an anchorage without
damage, as also the Holy Spirit witnesses. For this is said in the hundred and thirty-sixth2612
psalm, where the souls send joyfully up to God a hymn of thanksgiving,2613 as many as have
been taken hold of and raised up to walk with Christ in heaven, that they might not be
overwhelmed by the streams of the world and the flesh. Whence, also, they say that Pharaoh
was a type of the devil in Egypt, since he mercilessly commanded the males to be cast into
the river,2614 but the females to be preserved alive. For the devil, ruling2615 from Adam to
Moses over this great Egypt, the world, took care to have the male and rational offspring of
the soul carried away and destroyed by the streams of passions, but he longs for the carnal
and irrational offspring to increase and multiply.</p>

the Willows Signify; The Willow a Symbol of Chastity; The Willows Watered by
Streams.</head>
<p>But not to pass away from our subject, come, let us take in our hands and examine this
psalm, which the pure and stainless souls sing to God, saying:2617 “By the rivers of Babylon
there we sat down; yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon
the willows in the midst thereof,” clearly giving the name of harps to their bodies which
they hung upon the branches of chastity, fastening them to the wood that they might not
be snatched away and dragged along again by the stream of incontinence. For Babylon,
which is interpreted “disturbance” or “confusion,” signifies this life around which the water
flows, while we sit in the midst of which the water flows round us, as long as we are in the
world, the rivers of evil always beating upon us. Wherefore, also, we are always fearful, and
we groan and cry with weeping to God, that our harps may not be snatched off by the waves
of pleasure, and slip down from the tree of chastity. For everywhere the divine writings take
the willow as the type of chastity, because, when its flower is steeped in water, if it be drunk,
it extinguishes whatever kindles sensual desires and passions within us, until it entirely
renders barren, and makes every inclination to the begetting of children without effect, as
also Homer indicated, for this reason calling the willows destructive of fruit.2618 And in
Isaiah the righteous are said to “spring up as willows by the water courses.”2619 Surely, then,
the shoot of virginity is raised to a great and glorious height, when the righteous, and he to
whom it is given to preserve it and to cultivate it, bedewing it with wisdom, is watered by
the gentlest streams of Christ. For as it is the nature of this tree to bud and grow through
water, so it is the nature of virginity to blossom and grow to maturity when enriched by
words, so that one can hang his body2620 upon it.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Author Goes on with the Interpretation of the Same Passage.</head>
<p>If, then, the rivers of Babylon are the streams of voluptuousness, as wise men say, which
confuse and disturb the soul, then the willows must be chastity, to which we may suspend
and draw up the organs of lust which overbalance and weigh down the mind, so that they
may not be borne down by the torrents of incontinence, and be drawn like worms to impurity
and corruption. For God has bestowed upon us virginity as a most useful and a serviceable
help towards incorruption, sending it as an ally to those who are contending for and longing
after Zion, as the psalm shows, which is resplendent charity and the commandment respecting
it, for Zion is interpreted “The commandment of the watchtower.”2621 Now, let us here
enumerate the points which follow. For why do the souls declare that they were asked by
those who led them captive to sing the Lord’s song in a strange land? Surely because the
Gospel teaches a holy and secret song, which sinners and adulterers sing to the Evil One.
For they insult the commandments, accomplishing the will of the spirits of evil, and cast
holy things to dogs, and pearls before swine,2622 in the same manner as those of whom the
prophet says with indignation, “They read the law2623 without;”2624 for the Jews were not
to read the law going forth out of the gates of Jerusalem or out of their houses; and for this
reason the prophet blames them strongly, and cries that they were liable to condemnation,
because, while they were transgressing the commandments, and acting impiously towards
God, they were pretentiously reading the law, as if, forsooth, they were piously observing
its precepts; but they did not receive it in their souls, holding it firmly with faith, but rejected
it, denying it by their works. And hence they sing the Lord’s song in a strange land, explaining
the law by distorting and degrading it, expecting a sensual kingdom, and setting their hopes
on this alien world, which the Word says will pass away,2625 where those who carry them
captive entice them with pleasures, lying in wait to deceive them.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Gifts of Virgins, Adorned with Which They are Presented to One
Husband, Christ.</head>
<p>Now, those who sing the Gospel to senseless people seem to sing the Lord’s song in a
strange land, of which Christ is not the husbandman; but those who have put on and shone
in the most pure and bright, and unmingled and pious and becoming, ornament of virginity,
and are found barren and unproductive of unsettled and grievous passions, do not sing the
song in a strange land; because they are not borne thither by their hopes, nor do they stick
fast in the lusts of their mortal bodies, nor do they take a low view of the meaning of the
commandments, but well and nobly, with a lofty disposition, they have regard to the
promises which are above, thirsting for heaven as a congenial abode, whence God, approving
their dispositions, promises with an oath to give them choice honours, appointing and es-
tablishing them “above His chief joy;” for He says thus:2626 “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy;” meaning by Jerusalem, as
I said, these very undefiled and incorrupt souls, which, having with self-denial drawn in the
pure draught of virginity with unpolluted lips, are “espoused to one husband,” to be
presented “as a chaste virgin to Christ”2627 in heaven, “having gotten the victory, striving
for undefiled rewards.”2628 Hence also the prophet Isaiah proclaims, saying,2629 “Arise,
shine,2630 for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” Now these
promises, it is evident to every one, will be fulfilled after the resurrection.2631 For the Holy
Spirit does not speak of that well-known town in Judea; but truly of that heavenly city, the
blessed Jerusalem, which He declares to be the assembly of the souls which God plainly
promises to place first, “above His chief joy,” in the new dispensation, settling those who
are clothed in the most white robe of virginity in the pure dwelling of unapproachable light;
because they had it not in mind to put off their wedding garment—that is, to relax their
minds by wandering thoughts.</p>

<p>Further, the expression in Jeremiah,2632 “That a maid should not forget her ornaments,
nor a bride her attire,”2633 shows that she should not give up or loosen the band of chastity
through wiles and distractions. For by the heart are properly denoted our heart and mind.
Now the breastband, the girdle which gathers together and keeps firm the purpose of the
soul to chastity, is love to God, which our Captain and Shepherd, Jesus, who is also our
Ruler and Bridegroom, O illustrious virgins, commands both you and me to hold fast unbroken
and sealed up even to the end; for one will not easily find anything else a greater
help to men than this possession, pleasing and grateful to God. Therefore, I say, that we
should all exercise and honour chastity, and always cultivate and commend it.</p>

something worthy in the first place of yourself, and then of those who are present. For I am
persuaded, having thoroughly learnt it from the sacred writings, that the greatest and most
glorious offering and gift, to which there is nothing comparable, which men can offer to
God, is the life2635 of virginity. For although many accomplished many admirable things,
according to their vows, in the law, they alone were said to fulfil a great vow who were
willing to offer themselves of their free-will. For the passage runs thus: “And the Lord spake
unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, when either man
or woman shall separate themselves…unto the Lord.”2636 One vows to offer gold and silver
vessels for the sanctuary when he comes, another to offer the tithe of his fruits, another of
his property, another the best of his flocks, another consecrates his being; and no one is able
to vow a great vow to the Lord, but he who has offered himself entirely to God.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Abraham’s Sacrifice of a Heifer Three Years Old, of a Goat, and of a
Ram Also Three Years Old: Its Meaning; Every Age to Be Consecrated to God;
The Threefold Watch and Our Age.</head>
<p>I must endeavour, O virgins, by a true exposition, to explain to you the mind of the
Scripture according to its meaning.2637 Now, he who watches over and restrains himself in
part, and in part is distracted and wandering, is not wholly given up to God. Hence it is
necessary that the perfect man offer up all, both the things of the soul and those of the flesh,
so that he may be complete and not lacking. Therefore also God commands Abraham,2638
“Take Me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three
years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon;” which is admirably said; for remark, that
concerning those things, He also gives this command, Bring them Me and keep them free
from the yoke, even thy soul uninjured, like a heifer, and your flesh, and your reason; the
last like a goat, since he traverses lofty and precipitous places, and the other like a ram, that
he may in nowise skip away, and fall and slip off from the right way. For thus shalt thou be
perfect and blameless, O Abraham, when thou hast offered to Me thy soul, and thy sense,
and thy mind, which He mentioned under the symbol of the heifer, the goat, and the ram
of three years old, as though they represented the pure knowledge of the Trinity.</p>
<p>And perhaps He also symbolizes the beginning, the middle, and the end of our life and
of our age, wishing as far as possible that men should spend their boyhood, their manhood,
and their more advanced life purely, and offer them up to Him. Just as our Lord Jesus Christ
commands in the Gospels, thus directing: “Let not your lights be extinguished, and let not
your loins be loosed. Therefore also be ye like men who wait for their lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him
immediately. Blessed are ye, when he shall make you sit down, and shall come and serve
you. And if he come in the second, or in the third watch, ye are blessed.”2639 For consider,
O virgins, when He mentions three watches of the night, and His three comings, He shadows
forth in symbol our three periods of life, that of the boy, of the full-grown man, and of the
old man; so that if He should come and remove us from the world while spending our first
period, that is, while we are boys, He may receive us ready and pure, having nothing amiss;
and the second and the third in like manner. For the evening watch is the time of the budding
and youth of man, when the reason begins to be disturbed and to be clouded by the changes
of life, his flesh gaining strength and urging him to lust. The second is the time when, afterwards
advancing to a full-grown man, he begins to acquire stability, and to make a stand

<head>Chapter III.—Far Best to Cultivate Virtue from Boyhood.</head>
<p>Therefore, it is becoming that we should kindle the unquenchable light of faith in the
heart, and gird our loins with purity, and watch and ever wait for the Lord so that, if He
should will to come and take any of us away in the first period of life, or in the second, or
in the third, and should find us most ready, and working what He appointed, He may make
us to lie down in the bosom of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. Now Jeremiah says, “It is
good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth;”2640 and “that his soul should not depart
from the Lord.” It is good, indeed, from boyhood, to submit the neck to the divine Hand,
and not to shake off, even to old age, the Rider who guides with pure mind, when the Evil
One is ever dragging down the mind to that which is worse. For who is there that does not
receive through the eyes, through the ears, through the taste and smell and touch, pleasures
and delights, so as to become impatient of the control of continence as a driver, who checks
and vehemently restrains the horse from evil? Another who turns his thoughts to other
things will think differently; but we say that he offers himself perfectly to God who strives
to keep the flesh undefiled from childhood, practising virginity; for it speedily brings great
and much-desired gifts of hopes to those who strive for it, drying up the corrupting lusts
and passions of the soul. But come, let us explain how we give ourselves up to the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Perfect Consecration and Devotion to God: What It is.</head>
<p>That which is laid down in the Book of Numbers,2641 “greatly to vow a vow,” serves to
show, as, with a little more explanation, I proceed to prove, that chastity is the great vow
above all vows. For then am I plainly consecrated altogether to the Lord, when I not only
strive to keep the flesh untouched by intercourse, but also unspotted by other kinds of unseemliness.
For “the unmarried woman,” it is said,2642 “careth for the things of the Lord,
how she may please the Lord.;” not merely that she may bear away the glory in part of not
being maimed in her virtue, but in both parts, according to the apostle, that she may be
sanctified in body and spirit, offering up her members to the Lord. For let us say what it is
to offer up oneself perfectly to the Lord. If, for instance, I open my mouth on some subjects,
and close it upon others; thus, if I open it for the explanation of the Scriptures, for the praise
of God, according to my power, in a true faith and with all due honour, and if I close it,
putting a door and a watch upon it2643 against foolish discourse, my mouth is kept pure,
and is offered up to God. “My tongue is a pen,”2644 an organ of wisdom; for the Word of
the Spirit writes by it in clearest letters, from the depth and power of the Scriptures, even
the Lord, the swift Writer of the ages, that He quickly and swiftly registers and fulfils the
counsel of the Father, hearing the words, “quickly spoil, swiftly plunder.”2645 To such a
Scribe the words may be applied, “My tongue is a pen;” for a beautiful pen is sanctified and
offered to Him, writing things more lovely than the poets and orators who confirm the
doctrines of men. If, too, I accustom my eyes not to lust after the charms of the body, nor
to take delight in unseemly sights, but to look up to the things which are above, then my
eyes are kept pure, and are offered to the Lord. If I shut my ears against detraction and
slanders, and open them to the word of God, having intercourse with wise men,2646 then
have I offered up my ears to the Lord. If I keep my hands from dishonourable dealing, from
acts of covetousness and of licentiousness, then are my hands kept pure to God. If I withhold
my steps from going2647 in perverse ways, then have I offered up my feet, not going to the
places of public resort and banquets, where wicked men are found, but into the right way,
fulfilling something of the2648 commands. What, then, remains to me, if I also keep the

<head>Chapter V.—The Vow of Chastity, and Its Rites in the Law; Vines, Christ, and the
Devil.</head>
<p>I will now endeavour to explain to you, O virgins, the rest of that which is prescribed;
for this is attached to your duties, consisting of laws concerning virginity, which are useful
as teaching how we should abstain, and how advance to virginity. For it is written thus:2649
“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto
them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
separate themselves unto the Lord; he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink,
and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor
of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried, all the days of his separation.” And this means,
that he who has devoted and offered himself to the Lord shall not take of the fruits of the
plant of evil, because of its natural tendency to produce intoxication and distraction of mind.
For we perceive from the Scriptures two kinds of vines which were separate from each other,
and were unlike. For the one is productive of immortality and righteousness; but the other
of madness and insanity. The sober and joy-producing vine, from whose instructions, as
from branches, there joyfully hang down clusters of graces, distilling love, is our Lord Jesus,
who says expressly to the apostles,2650 “I am the true vine, ye are the branches; and my
Father is the husbandman.” But the wild and death-bearing vine is the devil, who drops
down fury and poison and wrath, as Moses relates, writing concerning him,2651 “For their
vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall,
their clusters are bitter: their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.”
The inhabitants of Sodom having gathered grapes from this, were goaded on to an unnatural
and fruitless desire for males. Hence, also, in the time of Noah, men having given themselves
up to drunkenness, sank down into unbelief, and, being overwhelmed by the deluge, were
drowned. And Cain, too, having drawn from this, stained his fratricidal hands, and defiled
the earth with the blood of his own family. Hence, too, the heathen, becoming intoxicated,
sharpen their passions for murderous battles; for man is not so much excited, nor goes so
far astray through wine, as from anger and wrath. A man does not become intoxicated and
go astray through wine, in the same way as he does from sorrow, or from love, or from incontinence.
And therefore it is ordered that a virgin shall not taste of this vine, so that she
may be sober and watchful from the cares of life, and may kindle the shining torch of the
light of righteousness for the Word. “Take heed to yourselves,” says the Lord,2652 “lest at

<head>Chapter VI.—Sikera, a Manufactured and Spurious Wine, Yet Intoxicating; Things
Which are Akin to Sins are to Be Avoided by a Virgin; The Altar of Incense (a
Symbol Of) Virgins.</head>
<p>Moreover, it is not only forbidden to virgins in any way to touch those things which
are made from that vine, but even such things as resemble them and are akin to them. For
Sikera, which is manufactured, is called a spurious kind of wine, whether made of palms or
of other fruit-trees. For in the same way that draughts of wine overthrow man’s reason, so
do these exceedingly; and to speak the plain truth, the wise are accustomed to call by the
name of Sikera all that produces drunkenness and distraction of mind, besides wine. In order,
therefore, that the virgin may not, when guarding against those sins which are in their own
nature evil, be defiled by those which are like them and akin to them, conquering the one
and being conquered by the other, that is, decorating herself with textures of different cloths,
or with stones and gold, and other decorations of the body, things which intoxicate the soul;
on this account it is ordered that she do not give herself up to womanish weaknesses and
laughter, exciting herself to wiles and foolish talking, which whirl the mind around and
confuse it; as it is indicated in another place,2653 “Ye shall not eat the hyæna and animals
like it; nor the weasel and creatures of that kind.” For this is the straight and direct way to
heaven, not merely not to avoid any stumbling-block which would trip up and destroy men
who are agitated by a desire for luxuries and pleasures, but also from such things as resemble
them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has been handed down that the unbloody altar of God signifies the assembly
of the chaste; thus virginity appears to be something great and glorious. Therefore it ought
to be preserved undefiled and altogether pure, having no participation in the impurities of
the flesh; but it should be set up before the presence of the testimony, gilded with wisdom,
for the Holy of holies, sending forth a sweet savour of love to the Lord; for He says,2654
“Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim-wood shalt thou make it. And
thou shalt make the staves of shittim-wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt
put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over
the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense
every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. And when Aaron
lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it; a perpetual incense before the Lord
throughout your generations. Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-sacrifices
nor meat-offering; neither shall ye pour drink-offering thereon.”</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Church Intermediate Between the Shadows of the Law and the
Realities of Heaven.</head>
<p>If the law, according to the apostle, is spiritual, containing the images “of future good
things,”2655 come then, let us strip off the veil of the letter which is spread over it, and consider
its naked and true meaning. The Hebrews were commanded to ornament the Tabernacle
as a type of the Church, that they might be able, by means of sensible things, to announce
beforehand the image of divine things. For the pattern which was shown to Moses2656 in
the mount, to which he was to have regard in fashioning the Tabernacle, was a kind of accurate
representation of the heavenly dwelling, which we now perceive more clearly than
through types, yet more darkly than if we saw the reality. For not yet, in our present condition,
has the truth come unmingled to men, who are here unable to bear the sight of pure immortality,
just as we cannot bear to look upon the rays of the sun. And the Jews declared that
the shadow of the image (of the heavenly things which was afforded to them), was the third
from the reality; but we clearly behold the image of the heavenly order; for the truth will be
accurately made manifest after the resurrection, when we shall see the heavenly tabernacle
(the city in heaven “whose builder and maker is God”2657) “face to face,” and not “darkly”
and “in part.”2658</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Double Altar, Widows and Virgins; Gold the Symbol of Virginity.</head>
<p>Now the Jews prophesied our state, but we foretell the heavenly; since the Tabernacle
was a symbol of the Church, and the Church of heaven. Therefore, these things being so,
and the Tabernacle being taken for a type of the Church, as I said, it is fitting that the altars
should signify some of the things in the Church. And we have already compared the brazen
altar to the company and circuit of widows; for they are a living altar of God, to which they
bring calves and tithes, and free-will offerings, as a sacrifice to the Lord; but the golden altar
within the2659 Holy of holies, before the presence of the testimony, on which it is forbidden
to offer sacrifice and libation, has reference to those in a state of virginity, as those who have
their bodies preserved pure, like unalloyed gold, from carnal intercourse. Now gold is
commended for two reasons: the first, that it does not rust, and the second, that in its colour
it seems in a measure to resemble the rays of the sun; and thus it is suitably a symbol of
virginity, which does not admit any stain or spot, but ever shines forth with the light of the
Word. Therefore, also, it stands nearer to God within the Holy of holies, and before the veil,
with undefiled hands, like incense, offering up prayers to the Lord, acceptable as a sweet
savour; as also John indicated, saying that the incense in the vials of the four-and-twenty
elders were the prayers of the saints. This, then, I offer to thee, O Arete, on the spur of the
moment, according to my ability, on the subject of chastity.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The Excellence of the Abiding Glory of Virginity; The Soul Made in the
Image of the Image of God, that is of His Son; The Devil a Suitor for the Soul.</head>
<p>With great confidence of being able to persuade, and to carry on this admirable discourse,
O Arete, if thou go with me, will I also endeavour, according to my ability, to contribute
something to the discussion of the subject before us; something commensurate to my own
power, and not to be compared with that which has already been spoken. For I should be
unable to put forth in philosophizing anything that could compete with those things which
have already been so variously and brilliantly worked out. For I shall seem to bear away the
reproach of silliness, if I make an effort to match myself with my superiors in wisdom. If,
however, you will bear even with those who speak as they can, I will endeavour to speak,
not lacking at least in good will. And here let me begin.</p>
<p>We have all come into this world, O virgins, endowed with singular beauty, which has
a relationship and affinity to divine wisdom. For the souls of men do then most accurately
resemble Him who begat and formed them, when, reflecting the unsullied representation
of His likeness, and the features of that countenance, to which God looking formed them
to have an immortal and indestructible shape, they remain such. For the unbegotten and
incorporeal beauty, which neither begins nor is corruptible, but is unchangeable, and grows
not old and has need of nothing, He resting in Himself, and in the very light which is in
unspeakable and inapproachable places,2660 embracing all things in the circumference of
His power, creating and arranging, made the soul after the image of His image. Therefore,
also, it is reasonable and immortal. For being made after the image of the Only-begotten,
as I said, it has an unsurpassable beauty, and therefore evil spirits2661 love it, and plot and
strive to defile its godlike and lovely image, as the prophet Jeremiah shows, reproaching
Jerusalem, “Thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed;”2662 speaking of
her who prostituted herself to the powers which came against her to pollute her. For her
lovers are the devil and his angels, who plan to defile and pollute our reasonable and clearsighted
beauty of mind by intercourse with themselves, and desire to cohabit with every
soul which is betrothed to the Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Parable of the Ten Virgins.2663</head>
<p>If, then, any one will keep this beauty inviolate and unharmed, and such as He who
constructed it formed and fashioned it, imitating the eternal and intelligible nature of which
man is the representation and likeness, and will become like a glorious and holy image, he
will be transferred thence to heaven, the city of the blessed, and will dwell there as in a
sanctuary. Now our beauty is then best preserved undefiled and perfect when, protected by
virginity, it is not darkened by the heat of corruption from without; but, remaining in itself,
it is adorned with righteousness, being brought as a bride to the Son of God; as He also
Himself suggests, exhorting that the light of chastity should be kindled in their flesh, as in
lamps; since the number of the ten virgins s signifies the souls that have believed in Jesus
Christ, symbolizing by the ten the only right way to heaven. Now five of them were prudent
and wise; and five were foolish and unwise, for they had not the forethought to fill their
vessels with oil, remaining destitute of righteousness. Now by these He signifies those who
strive to come to the boundaries of virginity, and who strain every nerve to fulfil this love,
acting virtuously and temperately, and who profess and boast that this is their aim; but who,
making light of it, and being subdued by the changes of the world, come rather to be sketches
of the shadowy image of virtue, than workers who represent the living truth itself.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Same Endeavour and Effort After Virginity, with a Different
Result. </head>
<p>Now when it is said2664 that “the kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins, which
took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom,” this means that the same way
towards the goal had been entered upon, as is shown by the mark X.2665 By profession they
had equally proposed the same end, and therefore they are called ten, since, as I have said,
they chose the same profession; but they did not, for all that, go forth in the same way to
meet the bridegroom. For some provided abundant future nourishment for their lamps
which were fed with oil, but others were careless, thinking only of the present. And, therefore,
they are divided into two equal numbers of five, inasmuch as the one class preserved the
five senses, which most people consider the gates of wisdom, pure and undefiled by sins;
but the others, on the contrary, corrupted them by multitudes of sins, defiling themselves
with evil. For having restrained them, and kept them free from righteousness, they bore a
more abundant crop of transgressions, in consequence of which it came to pass that they
were forbidden, and shut out from the divine courts. For whether, on the one hand, we do
right, or, on the other, do wrong through these senses, our habits of good and evil are confirmed.
And as Thallousa said that there is a chastity of the eyes, and of the ears, and of the
tongue, and so on of the other senses; so here she who keeps inviolate the faith of the five
pathways of virtue—sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing—is called by the name of the five
virgins, because she has kept the five forms of the sense pure to Christ, as a lamp, causing
the light of holiness to shine forth clearly from each of them. For the flesh is truly, as it were,
our five-lighted lamp, which the soul will bear like a torch, when it stands before Christ the
Bridegroom, on the day of the resurrection, showing her faith springing out clear and bright
through all the senses, as He Himself taught, saying,2666 “I am come to send fire on the
earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?” meaning by the earth our bodies, in which
He wished the swift-moving and fiery operation of His doctrine to be kindled. Now the oil
represents wisdom and righteousness; for while the soul rains down unsparingly, and pours
forth these things upon the body, the light of virtue is kindled unquenchably, making its
good actions to shine before men, so that our Father which is in heaven may be glorified.2667</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—What the Oil in the Lamps Means.</head>
<p>Now they offered, in Leviticus,2668 oil of this kind, “pure oil olive, beaten for the light,
to cause the lamps to burn continually, without the veil…before the Lord.” But they were
commanded to have a feeble light from the evening to the morning. For their light seemed
to resemble the prophetic word, which gives encouragement to temperance, being nourished
by the acts and the faith of the people. But the temple (in which the light was kept burning)
refers to “the lot of their inheritance,”2669 inasmuch as a light can shine in only one house.
Therefore it was necessary that it should be lighted before day. For he says,2670 “they shall
burn it until the morning,” that is, until the coming of Christ. But the Sun of chastity and
of righteousness having arisen, there is no need of other light.</p>
<p>So long, then, as this people treasured up nourishment for the light, supplying oil by
their works, the light of continence was not extinguished among them, but was ever shining
and giving light in the “lot of their inheritance.” But when the oil failed, by their turning
away from the faith to incontinence, the light was entirely extinguished, so that the virgins
have again to kindle their lamps by light transmitted from one to another, bringing the light
of incorruption to the world from above. Let us then supply now the oil of good works
abundantly, and of prudence, being purged from all corruption which would weigh us down;
lest, while the Bridegroom tarries, our lamps may also in like manner be extinguished. For
the delay is the interval which precedes the appearing of Christ. Now the slumbering and
sleeping of the virgins signifies the departure from life; and the midnight is the kingdom of
Antichrist, during which the destroying angel passes over the houses.2671 But the cry which
was made when it was said,2672 “Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him,”
is the voice which shall be heard from heaven, and the trumpet, when the saints, all their
bodies being raised, shall be caught up, and shall go on the clouds to meet the Lord.2673</p>
<p>For it is to be observed that the word of God says, that after the cry all the virgins arose,
that is, that the dead shall be raised after the voice which comes from heaven, as also Paul
intimates,2674 that “the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;” that is
the tabernacles,2675 for they died, being put off by their souls. “Then we which are alive shall

the light of prudence and continence, full of ethereal splendour.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Reward of Virginity.</head>
<p>These, O fair virgins, are the orgies of our mysteries; these the mystic rites of those who
are initiated in virginity; these the “undefiled rewards”2677 of the conflict of virginity. I am
betrothed to the Word, and receive as a reward the eternal crown of immortality and riches
from the Father; and I triumph in eternity, crowned with the bright and unfading flowers
of wisdom. I am one in the choir with Christ dispensing His rewards in heaven, around the
unbeginning and never-ending King. I have become the torch-bearer of the unapproachable
lights,2678 and I join with their company in the new song of the archangels, showing forth
the new grace of the Church; for the Word says that the company of virgins always follow
the Lord, and have fellowship with Him wherever He is. And this is what John signifies in
the commemoration of the hundred and forty-four thousand.2679</p>
<p>Go then, ye virgin band of the new ages. Go, fill your vessels with righteousness, for the
hour is coming when ye must rise and meet the bridegroom. Go, lightly leaving on one side
the fascinations and the pleasures of life, which confuse and bewitch the soul; and thus shall
ye attain the promises, “This I swear by Him who has shown me the way of life.” This crown,
woven by the prophets, I have taken from the prophetic meadows, and offer to thee, O Arete.</p>
<p>Agathe having thus admirably brought her discourse to an end, she said, and having

<head>Chapter I.—What the True and Seemly Manner of Praising; The Father Greater
Than the Son, Not in Substance, But in Order; Virginity the Lily; Faithful Souls
and Virgins, the One Bride of the One Christ.</head>
<p>It is not lawful for me to delay, O Arete, after such discourses, seeing that I confide undoubtingly
in the manifold wisdom of God, which gives richly and widely to whomsoever
it wills. For sailors who have experience of the sea declare that the same wind blows on all
who sail; and that different persons, managing their course differently, strive to reach different
ports. Some have a fair wind; to others it blows across their course; and yet both easily accomplish
their voyage. Now, in the same way, the “understanding Spirit,2680 holy, one
only,”2681 gently breathing down from the treasures of the Father above, giving us all the
clear fair wind of knowledge, will suffice to guide the course of our words without offence.
And now it is time for me to speak. This, O virgins, is the one true and seemly mode of
praising, when he who praises brings forward a witness better than all those who are praised.
For thence one may learn with certainty that the commendation is given not from favour,
nor of necessity, nor from repute, but in accordance with truth and an unflattering judgment.
And so the prophets and apostles, who spoke more fully concerning the Son of God, and
assigned to Him a divinity above other men, did not refer their praises of Him to the
teaching of angels, but to Him upon whom all authority and power depend. For it was fitting
that He who was greater than all things after the Father, should have the Father, who alone
is greater than Himself,2682 as His witness. And so I will not bring forward the praises of
virginity from mere human report, but from Him who cares for us, and who has taken up
the whole matter, showing that He is the husbandman of this grace, and a lover of its beauty,
and a fitting witness. And this is quite clear, in the Song of Songs,2683 to any one who is
willing to see it, where Christ Himself, praising those who are firmly established in virginity,
says,2684 “As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters;” comparing the
grace of chastity to the lily, on account of its purity and fragrance, and sweetness and joyousness.
For chastity is like a spring flower, always softly exhaling immortality from its white
petals. Therefore He is not ashamed to confess that He loves the beauty of its prime, in the

following words:2685 “Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished
my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How fair is thy love, my sister,
my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than
all spices! Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under thy
tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. A garden enclosed is my
sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.”</p>
<p>These praises does Christ proclaim to those who have come to the boundaries of virginity,
describing them all under the one name of His spouse; for the spouse must be betrothed to
the Bridegroom, and called by His name. And, moreover, she must be undefiled and unpolluted,
as a garden sealed, in which all the odours of the fragrance of heaven are grown, that
Christ alone may come and gather them, blooming with incorporeal seeds. For the Word
loves none of the things of the flesh, because He is not of such a nature as to be contented
with any of the things which are corruptible, as hands, or face, or feet; but He looks upon
and delights in the beauty which is immaterial and spiritual, not touching the beauty of the
body.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Interpretation of that Passage of the Canticles.2686</head>
<p>Consider now, O virgins, that, in saying to the bride, “Thou hast ravished my heart, my
sister, my spouse,” He shows the clear eye of the understanding, when the inner man has
cleansed it and looks more clearly upon the truth. For it is clear to every one that there is a
twofold power of sight, the one of the soul, and the other of the body. But the Word does
not profess a love for that of the body, but only that of the understanding, saying, “Thou
hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck;” which means,
By the most lovely sight of thy mind, thou hast urged my heart to love, radiating forth from
within the glorious beauty of chastity. Now the chains of the neck are necklaces which are
composed of various precious stones; and the souls which take care of the body, place around
the outward neck of the flesh this visible ornament to deceive those who behold; but those
who live chastely, on the other hand, adorn themselves within with ornaments truly composed
of various precious stones, namely, of freedom, of magnanimity, of wisdom, and of love,
caring little for those temporal decorations which, like leaves blossoming for an hour, dry
up with the changes of the body. For there is seen in man a twofold beauty, of which the
Lord accepts that which is within and is immortal, saying, “Thou hast ravished my heart
with one chain of thy neck;” meaning to show that He had been drawn to love by the
splendour of the inner man shining forth in its glory, even as the Psalmist also testifies,
saying, “The King’s daughter is all glorious within.”2687</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Virgins Being Martyrs First Among the Companions of Christ.</head>
<p>Let no one suppose that all the remaining company of those who have believed are
condemned, thinking that we who are virgins alone shall be led on to attain the promises,
not understanding that there shall be tribes and families and orders, according to the analogy
of the faith of each. And this Paul, too, sets forth, saying,2688 “There is one glory of the sun,
and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from
another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.” And the Lord does not profess
to give the same honours to all; but to some He promises that they shall be numbered in
the kingdom of heaven, to others the inheritance of the earth, and to others to see the
Father.2689 And here, also, He announces that the order and holy choir of the virgins shall
first enter in company with Him into the rest of the new dispensation, as into a bridal
chamber. For they were martyrs, not as bearing the pains of the body for a little moment of
time, but as enduring them through all their life, not shrinking from truly wrestling in an
Olympian contest for the prize of chastity; but resisting the fierce torments of pleasures and
fears and griefs, and the other evils of the iniquity of men, they first of all carry off the prize,
taking their place in the higher rank of those who receive the promise. Undoubtedly these
are the souls whom the Word calls alone His chosen spouse and His sister, but the rest
concubines and virgins and daughters, speaking thus:2690 “There are threescore queens and
fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she
is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her: the daughters saw
her and blessed her: yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.” For there
being plainly many daughters of the Church, one alone is the chosen and most precious in
her eyes above all, namely, the order of virgins.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Passage2691 Explained; The Queens, the Holy Souls Before the
Deluge; The Concubines, the Souls of the Prophets; The Divine Seed for Spiritual
Offspring in the Books of the Prophets; The Nuptials of the Word in the
Prophets as Though Clandestine.</head>
<p>Now if any one should have a doubt about these things, inasmuch as the points are
nowhere fully wrought out, and should still wish more fully to perceive their spiritual significance,
namely, what the queens and the concubines and the virgins are, we will say that
these may have been spoken concerning those who have been conspicuous for their righteousness
from the beginning throughout the progress of time; as of those before the flood,
and those after the flood, and so on of those after Christ. The Church, then, is the spouse.
The queens are those royal souls before the deluge, who became well-pleasing to God, that
is, those about Abel and Seth and Enoch. The concubines2692 those after the flood, namely,
those of the prophets, in whom, before the Church was betrothed to the Lord, being united
to them after the manner of concubines, He sowed true words in an incorrupt and pure
philosophy, so that, conceiving faith, they might bring forth to Him the Spirit of salvation.
For such fruits do the souls bring forth with whom Christ has had intercourse, fruits which
bear an ever-memorable renown. For if you will look at the books of Moses, or David, or
Solomon, or Isaiah, or of the prophets who follow, O virgins, you will see what offspring
they have left, for the saving of life, from their intercourse with the Son of God. Hence the
Word has with deep perception called the souls of the prophets concubines, because He did
not espouse them openly, as He did the Church, having killed for her the fatted calf.2693</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Sixty Queens: Why Sixty, and Why Queens; The Excellence of the
Saints of the First Age.</head>
<p>In addition to these matters, there is this also to be considered, so that nothing may escape
us of things which are necessary, why He said that the queens were sixty, and the concubines
eighty, and the virgins so numerous as not to be counted from their multitude, but
the spouse one. And first let us speak of the sixty. I imagine that He named under the sixty
queens, those who had pleased God from the first-made man in succession to Noah, for this
reason, since these had no need of precepts and laws for their salvation, the creation of the
world in six days being still recent. For they remembered that in six days God formed the
creation, and those things which were made in paradise; and how man, receiving a command
not to touch2694 the tree of knowledge, ran aground, the author of evil having led him
astray.2695 Thence he gave the symbolical name of sixty queens to those souls who, from
the creation of the world, in succession chose God as the object of their love, and were almost,
so to speak, the offspring of the first age, and neighbours of the great six days’ work, from
their having been born, as I said, immediately after the six days. For these had great honour,
being associated with the angels, and often seeing God manifested visibly, and not in a
dream. For consider what confidence Seth had towards God, and Abel, and Enos, and Enoch,
and Methuselah, and Noah, the first lovers of righteousness, and the first of the first-born
children who are written in heaven,2696 being thought worthy of the kingdom, as a kind of
first-fruits of the plants for salvation, coming out as early fruit to God. And so much may
suffice concerning these.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Eighty Concubines, What; The Knowledge of the Incarnation
Communicated to the Prophets.</head>
<p>It still remains to speak concerning the concubines. To those who lived after the deluge
the knowledge of God was henceforth more remote, and they needed other instruction to
ward off the evil, and to be their helper, since idolatry was already creeping in. Therefore
God, that the race of man might not be wholly destroyed, through forgetfulness of the things
which were good, commanded His own Son to reveal to the prophets His own future appearance
in the world by the flesh, in which the joy and knowledge of the spiritual eighth day2697
shall be proclaimed, which would bring the remission of sins and the resurrection, and that
thereby the passions and corruptions of men would be circumcised. And, therefore, He
called by the name of the eighty virgins the list of the prophets from Abraham, on account
of the dignity of circumcision, which embraces the number eight, in accordance with which
also the law is framed; because they first, before the Church was espoused to the Word, received
the divine seed, and foretold the circumcision of the spiritual eighth day.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Virgins,2698 the Righteous Ancients; The Church, the One Only

<p>Now he calls by the name of virgins, who belong to a countless assembly, those who,
being inferior to the better ones, have practised righteousness, and have striven against sin
with youthful and noble energy. But of these, neither the queens, nor the concubines, nor
the virgins, are compared to the Church. For she is reckoned the perfect and chosen one
beyond all these, consisting and composed of all the apostles, the Bride who surpasses all
in the beauty of youth and virginity. Therefore, also, she is blessed and praised by all, because
she saw and heard freely what those desired to see, even for a little time, and saw not, and
to hear, but heard not. For “blessed,” said our Lord to His disciples,2699 “are your eyes, for
they see; and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, That many prophets have
desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things
which ye hear, and have not heard them.” For this reason, then, the prophets count them
blessed, and admire them, because the Church was thought worthy to participate in those
things which they did not attain to hear or see. For “there are threescore queens, and fourscore
concubines, and virgins without number. My dove, my undefiled, is but one.”2700</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Human Nature of Christ His One Dove.</head>
<p>Can any one now say otherwise than that the Bride is the undefiled flesh of the Lord,
for the sake of which He left the Father and came down here, and was joined to it, and, being
incarnate, dwelt in it? Therefore He called it figuratively a dove, because that creature is
tame and domestic, and readily adapts itself to man’s mode of life. For she alone, so to speak,
was found spotless and undefiled, and excelling all in the glory and beauty of righteousness,
so that none of those who had pleased God most perfectly could stand near to her in a
comparison of virtue. And for this reason she was thought worthy to become a partaker of
the kingdom of the Only-begotten, being betrothed and united to Him. And in the fortyfourth
psalm,2701 the queen who, chosen out of many, stands at the right hand of God,
clothed in the golden ornament of virtue, whose beauty the King desired,2702 is, as I said,
the undefiled and blessed flesh, which the Word Himself carried into the heavens, and
presented at the right hand of God, “wrought about with divers colours,” that is, in the
pursuits of immortality, which he calls symbolically golden fringes. For since this garment
is variegated and woven of various virtues, as chastity, prudence, faith, love, patience, and
other good things, which, covering, as they do, the unseemliness of the flesh, adorn man
with a golden ornament.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Virgins Immediately After the Queen and Spouse.</head>
<p>Moreover, we must further consider what the Spirit delivers to us in the rest of the
psalm, after the enthronization of the manhood assumed by the Word at the right hand of
the Father. “The virgins,” He says,2703 “that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall
be brought unto thee. With joy and gladness shall they be brought, and shall enter into the
King’s palace.” Now, here the Spirit seems quite plainly to praise virginity, next, as we have
explained, to the Bride of the Lord, who promises that the virgins shall approach second to
the Almighty with joy and gladness, guarded and escorted by angels. For so lovely and desirable
is in truth the glory of virginity, that, next to the Queen, whom the Lord exalts, and
presents in sinless glory to the Father, the choir and order of virgins bear her company, assigned
to a place second to that of the Bride. Let these efforts of mine to speak to thee, O
Arete, concerning chastity, be engraven on a monument.</p>
<p>And Procilla having thus spoken, Thekla said, It is my turn after her to continue the
contest; and I rejoice, since I too have the favouring wisdom of words, perceiving that I am,
like a harp, inwardly attuned, and prepared to speak with elegance and propriety.</p>
<p>Arete. I most willingly hail thy readiness, O Thekla, in which I confide to give me fitting
discourse, in accordance with thy powers; since thou wilt yield to none in universal philosophy
and instruction, instructed by Paul in what is fitting to say of evangelical and divine
doctrine.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Methodius’ Derivation of the Word Virginity:2704 Wholly Divine; Virtue,
in Greek—ἀρετή, Whence So Called.</head>
<p>Well, then, let us first say, beginning from the origin of the name, for what cause this
supreme and blessed pursuit was called παρθενία, what it aims at, what power it has, and
afterwards, what fruits it gives forth. For almost all have been ignorant of this virtue as being
superior to ten thousand other advantages of virtue which we cultivate for the purification
and adornment of the soul. For virginity2705 is divine by the change of one letter,2706 as she
alone makes him who has her, and is initiated by her incorruptible rites like unto God, than
which it is impossible to find a greater good, removed, as it is, from pleasure and grief; and
the wing of the soul sprinkled by it becomes stronger and lighter, accustomed daily to fly
from human desires.</p>
<p>For since the children of the wise have said that our life is a festival, and that we have
come to exhibit in the theatre the drama of truth, that is, righteousness, the devil and the
demons plotting and striving against us, it is necessary for us to look upwards and to take
our flight aloft, and to flee from the blandishments of their tongues, and from their forms
tinged with the outward appearance of temperance, more than from the Sirens of Homer.
For many, bewitched by the pleasures of error, take their flight downwards, and are weighed
down when they come into this life, their nerves being relaxed and unstrung, by means of
which the power of the wings of temperance is strengthened, lightening the downward
tendency of the corruption of the body. Whence, O Arete, whether thou hast thy name,
signifying virtue, because thou art worthy of being chosen2707 for thyself, or because thou
raisest2708 and liftest up to heaven, ever going in the purest minds, come, give me thy help
in my discourse, which thou hast thyself appointed me to speak.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Lofty Mind and Constancy of the Sacred Virgins; The Introduction
of Virgins into the Blessed Abodes Before Others.</head>
<p>Those who take a downward flight, and fall into pleasures, do not desist from grief and
labours until, through their passionate desires, they fulfil the want of their intemperance,
and, being degraded and shut out from the sanctuary, they are removed from the scene of
truth, and, instead of procreating children with modesty and temperance, they rave in the
wild pleasures of unlawful amours. But those who, on light wing, ascend into the supramundane
life, and see from afar what other men do not see, the very pastures of immortality,
bearing in abundance flowers of inconceivable beauty, are ever turning themselves again to
the spectacles there; and, for this reason, those things are thought small which are here
considered noble—such as wealth, and glory, and birth, and marriage; and they think no
more of those things.2709 But yet if any of them should choose to give up their bodies to
wild beasts or to fire, and be punished, they are ready to have no care for pains, for the desire
of them or the fear of them; so that they seem, while in the world, not to be in the world,
but to have already reached, in thought and in the tendency of their desires, the assembly
of those who are in heaven.</p>
<p>Now it is not right that the wing of virginity should, by its own nature, be weighed down
upon the earth, but that it should soar upwards to heaven, to a pure atmosphere, and to the
life which is akin to that of angels. Whence also they, first of all, after their call and departure
hence, who have rightly and faithfully contended as virgins for Christ, bear away the prize
of victory, being crowned by Him with the flowers of immortality. For, as soon as their souls
have left the world, it is said that the angels meet them with much rejoicing, and conduct
them to the very pastures already spoken of, to which also they were longing to come, contemplating
them in imagination from afar, when, while they were yet dwelling in their
bodies, they appeared to them divine.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Lot and Inheritance of Virginity.</head>
<p>Furthermore, when they have come hither, they see wonderful and glorious and blessed
things of beauty, and such as cannot be spoken to men. They see there righteousness itself
and prudence, and love itself, and truth and temperance, and other flowers and plants of
wisdom, equally splendid, of which we here behold only the shadows2710 and apparitions,
as in dreams, and think that they consist of the actions of men, because there is no clear
image of them here, but only dim copies, which themselves we see often when making dark
copies of them. For never has any one seen with his eyes the greatness or the form or the
beauty of righteousness itself, or of understanding, or of peace; but there, in Him whose
name is I AM,2711 they are seen perfect and clear, as they are. For there is a tree of temperance
itself, and of love, and of understanding, as there are plants of the fruits which grow here—as
of grapes, the pomegranate, and of apples; and so, too, the fruits of those trees are gathered
and eaten, and do not perish and wither, but those who gather them grow to immortality
and a likeness to God. Just as he from whom all are descended, before the fall and the
blinding of his eyes, being in paradise, enjoyed its fruits, God appointing man to dress and
to keep the plants of wisdom. For it was entrusted to the first Adam to cultivate those fruits.
Now Jeremiah saw that these things exist specially in a certain place, removed to a great
distance from our world, where, compassionating those who have fallen from that good
state, he says:2712 “Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that
thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and
peace. Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures?” The virgins
having entered into the treasures of these things, gather the reasonable fruits of the virtues,
sprinkled with manifold and well-ordered lights, which, like a fountain, God throws up over
them, irradiating that state with unquenchable lights. And they sing harmoniously, giving
glory to God. For a pure atmosphere is shed over them, and one which is not oppressed by
the sun.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Exhortation to the Cultivation of Virginity; A Passage from the Apocalypse2713
is Proposed to Be Examined.</head>
<p>Now, then, O Virgins, daughters of undefiled temperance, let us strive for a life of
blessedness and the kingdom of heaven. And do ye unite with those before you in an earnest
desire for the same glory of chastity, caring little for the things of this life. For immortality
and chastity do not contribute a little to happiness, raising up the flesh aloft, and drying up
its moisture and its clay-like weight, by a greater force of attraction. And let not the uncleanness
which you hear creep in and weigh you down to the earth; nor let sorrow transform
your joy, melting away your hopes in better things; but shake off incessantly the calamities
which come upon you, not defiling your mind with lamentations. Let faith conquer wholly,
and let its light drive away the visions of evil which crowd around the heart. For, as when
the moon brightly shining fills the heaven with its light, and all the air becomes clear, but
suddenly the clouds from the west, enviously rushing in, for a little while overshadow its
light, but do not destroy it, since they are immediately driven away by a blast of the wind;
so ye also, when causing the light of chastity to shine in the world, although pressed upon
by afflictions and labours, do not grow weary and abandon your hopes. For the clouds which
come from the Evil One are driven away by the Spirit,2714 if ye, like your Mother, who gives
birth to the male Virgin in heaven, fear nothing the serpent that lies in wait and plots against
you; concerning whom I intend to discourse to you more plainly; for it is now time.</p>
<p>John, in the course of the Apocalypse, says:2715 “And there appeared a great wonder in
heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of twelve stars: and she, being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be
delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon,
having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the
third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before
the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
And she brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her
child was caught up unto God, and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness,
where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two
hundred and threescore days.” So far we have given, in brief, the history of the woman and
the dragon. But to search out and explain the solution of them is beyond my powers. Nevertheless,
let me venture, trusting in Him who commanded to search the Scriptures.2716 If,

<head>Chapter V.—The Woman Who Brings Forth, to Whom the Dragon is Opposed, the
Church; Her Adornment and Grace.</head>
<p>The woman who appeared in heaven clothed with the sun, and crowned with twelve
stars, and having the moon for her footstool, and being with child, and travailing in birth,
is certainly, according to the accurate interpretation, our mother,2717 O virgins, being a
power by herself distinct from her children; whom the prophets, according to the aspect of
their subjects, have called sometimes Jerusalem, sometimes a Bride, sometimes Mount Zion,
and sometimes the Temple and Tabernacle of God. For she is the power which is desired
to give light in the prophet, the Spirit crying to her:2718 “Arise, shine; for thy light is come,
and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,
and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be
seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy
rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves together, they
come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.”
It is the Church whose children shall come to her with all speed after the resurrection, running
to her from all quarters. She rejoices receiving the light which never goes down, and
clothed with the brightness of the Word as with a robe. For with what other more precious
or honourable ornament was it becoming that the queen should be adorned, to be led as a
Bride to the Lord, when she had received a garment of light, and therefore was called by the
Father? Come, then, let us go forward in our discourse, and look upon this marvelous woman
as upon virgins prepared for a marriage, pure and undefiled, perfect and radiating a permanent
beauty, wanting nothing of the brightness of light; and instead of a dress, clothed with
light itself; and instead of precious stones, her head adorned with shining stars. For instead
of the clothing which we have, she had light; and for gold and brilliant stones, she had stars;
but stars not such as those which are set in the invisible heaven, but better and more
resplendent, so that those may rather be considered as their images and likenesses.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Works of the Church, the Bringing Forth of Children in Baptism;
The Moon in Baptism, the Full Moon of Christ’s Passion.</head>
<p>Now the statement that she stands upon the moon, as I consider, denotes the faith of
those who are cleansed from corruption in the laver of regeneration, because the light of the
moon has more resemblance to tepid water, and all moist substance is dependent upon her.
The Church, then, stands upon our faith and adoption, under the figure of the moon, until
the fulness of the nations come in, labouring and bringing forth natural men as spiritual
men; for which reason too she is a mother. For just as a woman receiving the unformed
seed of a man, within a certain time brings forth a perfect man, in the same way, one should
say, does the Church conceive those who flee to the Word, and, forming them according to
the likeness and form of Christ, after a certain time produce them as citizens of that blessed
state. Whence it is necessary that she should stand upon the laver, bringing forth those who
are washed in it. And in this way the power which she has in connection with the laver is
called the moon,2719 because the regenerate shine being renewed with a new ray,2720 that
is, a new light. Whence, also, they are by a descriptive term called newly-enlightened;2721
the moon ever showing forth anew to them the spiritual full moon, namely, the period and
the memorial of the passion, until the glory and the perfect light of the great day arise.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Child of the Woman in the Apocalypse Not Christ, But the
Faithful Who are Born in the Laver.</head>
<p>If any one, for there is no difficulty in speaking distinctly, should be vexed, and reply
to what we have said: “But how, O virgins, can this explanation seem to you to be according
to the mind of Scripture, when the Apocalypse plainly defines that the Church brings forth
a male, while you teach that her labour-pains have their fulfilment in those who are washed
in the laver?” We will answer, But, O faultfinder, not even to you will it be possible to show
that Christ Himself2722 is the one who is born. For long before the Apocalypse, the mystery
of the Incarnation of the Word was fulfilled. And John speaks concerning things present
and things to come. But Christ, long ago conceived, was not caught up to the throne of God
when He was brought forth, from fear of the serpent injuring Him. But for this was He begotten,
and Himself came down from the throne of the Father, that He should remain and
subdue the dragon who made an assault upon the flesh. So that you also must confess that
the Church labours and gives birth to those who are baptized. As the spirit says somewhere
in Isaiah:2723 “Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered
of a man-child. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth
be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion
travailed, she brought forth her children.”2724 From whom did he flee? Surely from the
dragon, that the spiritual Zion might bear a masculine people, who should come back from
the passions and weakness of women to the unity of the Lord, and grow strong in manly
virtue.</p>
<note type="footnote">2722 It is hardly necessary to observe, that amid many interpretations of the passage, this which Methodius
condemns is probably the true one, as it is certainly the most natural.—Tr. [It is certainly worth observing, that

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Faithful in Baptism Males, Configured to Christ; The Saints
Themselves Christs.</head>
<p>Let us then go over the ground again from the beginning, until we come in course to
the end, explaining what we have said. Consider if the passage seems to you to be explained
to your mind. For I think that the Church is here said to give birth to a male; since the enlightened2725
receive the features, and the image, and the manliness of Christ, the likeness
of the form of the Word being stamped upon them, and begotten in them by a true knowledge
and faith, so that in each one Christ is spiritually born. And, therefore, the Church swells
and travails in birth until Christ is formed in us,2726 so that each of the saints, by partaking
of Christ, has been born a Christ. According to which meaning it is said in a certain scripture,
2727 “Touch not mine anointed,2728 and do my prophets no harm,” as though those
who were baptized into Christ had been made Christs2729 by communication of the Spirit,
the Church contributing here their clearness and transformation into the image of the Word.
And Paul confirms this, teaching it plainly, where he says:2730 “For this cause I bow my
knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and
earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be
strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts
by faith.” For it is necessary that the word of truth should be imprinted and stamped upon
the souls of the regenerate.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Son of God, Who Ever Is, is To-Day Begotten in the Minds and
Sense of the Faithful.</head>
<p>Now, in perfect agreement and correspondence with what has been said, seems to be
this which was spoken by the Father from above to Christ when He came to be baptized in
the water of the Jordan, “Thou art my son: this day have I begotten thee;”2731 for it is to be
remarked that He was declared to be His Son unconditionally, and without regard to time;
for He says “Thou art,” and not “Thou hast become,” showing that He had neither recently
attained to the relation of Son, nor again, having begun before, after this had an end, but
having been previously begotten,2732 that He was to be, and was the same. But the expression,
“This day have I begotten thee,” signifies that He willed that He who existed before the ages
in heaven should be begotten on the earth—that is, that He who was before unknown should
be made known. Now, certainly, Christ has never yet been born in those men who have
never perceived the manifold wisdom of God—that is, has never been known, has never
been manifested, has never appeared to them. But if these also should perceive the mystery
of grace, then in them too, when they were converted and believed, He would be born in
knowledge and understanding. Therefore from hence the Church is fitly said to form and
beget the male Word in those who are cleansed.2733 So far I have spoken according to my
ability concerning the travail of the Church; and here we must change to the subject of the
dragon and the other matters. Let us endeavour, then, to explain it in some measure, not
deterred by the greatness of the obscurity of the Scripture; and if anything difficult comes
to be considered, I will again help you to cross it like a river.</p>

<p>The dragon, which is great, and red, and cunning, and manifold, and seven-headed,
and horned, and draws down the third part of the stars, and stands ready to devour the child
of the woman who is travailing, is the devil, who lies in wait to destroy the Christ-accepted
mind of the baptized, and the image and clear features of the Word which had been brought
forth in them. But he misses and fails of his prey, the regenerate being caught up on high
to the throne of God—that is, the mind of those who are renovated is lifted up around the
divine seat and the basis of truth against which there is no stumbling, being taught to look
upon and regard the things which are there, so that it may not be deceived by the dragon
weighing them down. For it is not allowed to him to destroy those whose thoughts and looks
are upwards. And the stars, which the dragon touched with the end of his tail, and drew
them down to earth, are the bodies of heresies; for we must say that the stars, which are
dark, obscure, and falling, are the assemblies of the heterodox; since they, too, wish to be
acquainted with the heavenly ones, and to have believed in Christ, and to have the seat of
their soul in heaven, and to come near to the stars as children of light. But they are dragged
down, being shaken out by the folds of the dragon, because they did not remain within the
triangular forms of godliness, falling away from it with respect to an orthodox service.
Whence also they are called the third part of the stars, as having gone astray with regard to
one of the three Persons of the Trinity. As when they say, like Sabellios, that the Almighty
Person of the Father Himself suffered;2734 or as when they say, like Artemas, that the Person
of the Son was born and manifested only in appearance;2735 or when they contend, like the
Ebionites, that the prophets spoke of the Person of the Spirit, of their own motion. For of
Marcion and Valentinus, and those about Elkesaios and others, it is better not even to make
mention.</p>

<p>Now she who brings forth, and has brought forth, the masculine Word in the hearts of
the faithful, and who passed, undefiled and uninjured by the wrath of the beast, into the
wilderness, is, as we have explained, our mother the Church. And the wilderness into which
she comes, and is nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, which is truly waste
and unfruitful of evils, and barren of corruption, and difficult of access and of transit to the
multitude; but fruitful and abounding in pasture, and blooming and easy of access to the
holy, and full of wisdom, and productive of life, is this most lovely, and beautifully wooded
and well-watered abode of Arete.2736 Here the south wind awakes, and the north wind
blows, and the spices flow out,2737 and all things are filled with refreshing dews, and crowned
with the unfading plants of immortal life; in which we now gather flowers, and weave with
sacred fingers the purple and glorious crown of virginity for the queen. For the Bride of the
Word is adorned with the fruits of virtue. And the thousand two hundred and sixty days
that we are staying here, O virgins, is the accurate and perfect understanding concerning
the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, in which our mother increases, and rejoices, and
exults throughout this time, until the restitution of the new dispensation, when, coming
into the assembly in the heavens, she will no longer contemplate the I AM through the
means of human knowledge, but will clearly behold entering in together with Christ. For a
thousand,2738 consisting of a hundred multiplied by ten, embraces a full and perfect number,
and is a symbol of the Father Himself, who made the universe by Himself, and rules all
things for Himself. Two hundred embraces two perfect numbers united together, and is the
symbol of the Holy Spirit, since He is the Author of our knowledge of the Son and the

the number six proceeding2739 from unity is composed of its proper parts, so that nothing
in it is wanting or redundant, and is complete when resolved into its parts. Thus it is necessary
that the number six, when it is divided into even parts by even parts, should again make up

the same quantity from its separated segments.2740 For, first, if divided equally, it makes
three; then, if divided into three parts, it makes two; and again, if divided by six, it makes
one, and is again collected into itself. For when divided into twice three, and three times
two, and six times one, when the three and the two and the one are put together, they
complete the six again. But everything is of necessity perfect which neither needs anything
else in order to its completion, nor has anything over. Of the other numbers, some are more
than perfect, as twelve. For the half of it is six, and the third four, and the fourth three, and
the sixth two, and the twelfth one. The numbers into which it can be divided, when put together,
exceed twelve, this number not having preserved itself equal to its parts, like the
number six. And those which are imperfect, are numbers like eight. For the half of it is four,
and the fourth two, and the eighth one. Now the numbers into which it is divided, when
put together, make seven, and one is wanting to its completion, not being in all points harmonious
with itself, like six, which has reference to the Son of God, who came from the
fulness of the Godhead into a human life. For having emptied Himself,2741 and taken upon
Him the form of a slave, He was restored again to His former perfection and dignity. For
He being humbled, and apparently degraded, was restored again from His humiliation and
degradation to His former completeness and greatness, having never been diminished from
His essential perfection.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is evident that the creation of the world was accomplished in harmony
with this number, God having made heaven and earth, and the things which are in them,
in six days; the word of creative power containing the number six, in accordance with which
the Trinity is the maker of bodies. For length, and breadth, and depth make up a body. And
the number six is composed of triangles. On these subjects, however, there is not sufficient
time at present to enlarge with accuracy, for fear of letting the main subject slip, in considering
that which is secondary.</p>

<p>The Church, then, coming hither into this wilderness, a place unproductive of evils, is
nourished, flying on the heavenward wings of virginity, which the Word called the “wings
of great eagle,”2742 having conquered the serpent, and driven away from her full moon the
wintry clouds. It is for the sake of these things, meanwhile, that all these discourses are held,
teaching us, O fair virgins, to imitate according to our strength our mother, and not to be
troubled by the pains and changes and afflictions of life, that you may enter in exulting with
her into the bride-chamber, showing your lamps. Do not, therefore, lose courage on account
of the schemes and slanders of the beast, but bravely prepare for the battle, armed with the
helmet of salvation,2743 and the breastplate, and the greaves. For you will bring upon him
an immense consternation when you attack him with great advantage and courage; nor will
he at all resist, seeing his adversaries set in array by One more powerful; but the manyheaded
and many-faced beast will immediately allow you to carry off the spoils of the seven

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Seven Crowns of the Beast to Be Taken Away by Victorious
Chastity; The Ten Crowns of the Dragon, the Vices Opposed to the Decalogue;
The Opinion of Fate the Greatest Evil.</head>
<p>Therefore, taking to you a masculine and sober mind, oppose your armour to the
swelling beast, and do not at all give way, nor be troubled because of his fury. For you will
have immense glory if you overcome him, and take away the seven crowns which are upon
him, on account of which we have to struggle and wrestle, according to our teacher Paul.
For she who having first overcome the devil, and destroyed his seven heads, becomes possessed
of the seven crowns of virtue, having gone through the seven great struggles of chastity.
For incontinence and luxury is a head of the dragon; and whoever bruises this is wreathed
with the crown of temperance. Cowardice and weakness is also a head; and he who treads
upon this carries off the crown of martyrdom. Unbelief and folly, and other similar fruits
of wickedness, is another head; and he who has overcome these and destroyed them carries
off the honours connected with them, the power of the dragon being in many ways rooted
up. Moreover, the ten horns and stings which he was said to have upon his heads are the
ten opposites, O virgins, to the Decalogue, by which he was accustomed to gore and cast
down the souls of many imagining and contriving things in opposition to the law, “Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God,”2745 and to the other precepts which follow. Consider now the
fiery and bitter horn of fornication, by which he casts down the incontinent; consider
adultery, consider falsehood, covetousness, theft, and the other sister and related vices,
which flourish by nature around his murderous heads, which if you root out with the aid
of Christ, you will receive, as it were, divine heads, and will bloom with the crowns gained
from the dragon. For it is our duty to prefer and to set forward the best things, who have
received, above the earth-born, a commanding and voluntary mind, and one free from all
necessity, so as to make choice like masters of the things which please us, not being in
bondage to fate or fortune. And so no man would be master of himself and good, unless
selecting the human example of Christ, and bringing himself to the likeness of Him, he
should imitate Him in his manner of life. For of all evils the greatest which is implanted in
many is that which refers the causes of sins to the motions of the stars, and says that our life
is guided by the necessities of fate, as those say who study the stars, with much insolence.
For they, trusting more in guessing than in prudence, that is, in something between truth
and falsehood, go far astray from the sight of things as they are. Whence, if you permit me,
O Arete, now that I have completed the discourse which you, my mistress, appointed to be

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Doctrine of Mathematicians Not Wholly to Be Despised, When
They are Concerned About the Knowledge of the Stars; The Twelve Signs of the
Zodiac Mythical Names.</head>
<p>Thekla. Resuming then, let us first lay bare, in speaking of those things according to
our power, the imposture of those who boast as though they alone had comprehended from
what forms the heaven is arranged, in accordance with the hypothesis of the Chaldeans and
Egyptians. For they say that the circumference of the world is likened to the turnings of a
well-rounded globe, the earth having a central point. For its outline being spherical, it is
necessary, they say, since there are the same distances of the parts, that the earth should be
the centre of the universe, around which, as being older, the heaven is whirling. For if a
circumference is described from the central point, which seems to be a circle,—for it is impossible
for a circle to be described without a point, and it is impossible for a circle to be
without a point,—surely the earth consisted before all, they say, in a state of chaos and disorganization.
Now certainly the wretched ones were overwhelmed in the chaos of error,
“because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful;
but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened;”2747 and their
wise men said that nothing earth-born was more honourable or more ancient than the
Olympians. Whence they are not mere children who know Christ, like the Greeks, who,
burying the truth in fairies and fictions, rather than in artistic words, ascribing human
calamities to the heavens, are not ashamed to describe the circumference of the world by
geometrical theorems and figures, and explain that the heaven is adorned with the images
of birds and of animals that live in water and on dry land, and that the qualities of the stars
were made from the calamities of the men of old, so that the movements of the planets, in
their opinion, depended upon the same kind of bodies. And they say that the stars revolve
around the nature of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, being drawn along by the passage of
the circle of the Zodiac, so that through their intermingling they see the things which happen
to many, according to their conjunctions and departures, their rising and setting.</p>
<p>For the whole heaven being spherical, and having the earth for its central point, as they
think,2748 because all the straight lines from the circumference falling upon the earth are
equal to one another, holds back from the circles which surround it, of which the meridian
is the greatest; and the second, which divides it into two equal parts, is the horizon; and the
third, which separates these, the equinoctial; and on each side of this the two tropics, the
summer and the winter—the one on the north, and the other on the south. Beyond is that

which is called the axis, around which are the greater and lesser Bears, and beyond them is
the tropic. And the Bears, turning about themselves, and weighing upon the axis, which
passes through the poles, produce the motion of the whole world, having their heads against
each other’s loins, and being untouched by our horizon.</p>
<p>Then they say that the Zodiac touches all the circles, making its movements diagonally,
and that there are in it a number of signs, which are called the twelve signs of the Zodiac,
beginning with the Ram, and going on to the Fishes, which, they say, were so determined
from mythical causes; saying that it was the Ram that conveyed Helle, the daughter of Athamas,
and her brother Phryxos into Scythia; and that the head of the Ox is in honour of
Zeus, who, in the form of a Bull, carried over Europe into Crete; and they say the circle
called the Galaxy, or milky way, which reaches from the Fishes to the Ram, was poured forth
for Herakles from the breasts of Hera, by the commands of Zeus. And thus, according to
them, there was no natal destiny before Europe or Phryxos, and the Dioscuroi,2749 and the
other signs of the Zodiac, which were placed among the constellations, from men and beasts.
But our ancestors lived without destiny. Let us endeavour now to crush falsehood, like
physicians, taking its edge off, and quenching it with the healing medicine of words, here

<head>Chapter XV.—Arguments from the Novelty of Fate and Generation; That Golden
Age, Early Men; Solid Arguments Against the Mathematicians.</head>
<p>If it were better, O wretched ones, that man should be subject to the star of his birth,
than that he should not, why was not his generation and birth from the very time when the
race of man began to be? And if it was, what is the need of those which had lately been placed
among the stars, of the Lion, the Crab, the Twins, the Virgin, the Bull, the Balance, the
Scorpion, the Ram, the Archer, the Fishes, the Goat, the Watercarrier, Perseus, Cassiopeia,
Cepheus, Pegasus, Hydra, the Raven, the Cup, the Lyre, the Dragon, and others, from which
you introduce, by your instructions, many to the knowledge of mathematics, or, rather, to
a knowledge which is anathema?2750 Well, then, either there was generation among those
before, and the removal of these creatures above was absurd; or else there was not, and God
changed human life into a better state and government than that of those who before that
lived an inferior life. But the ancients were better than those of the present time; whence
theirs was called the golden age. There was then no natal destiny.</p>
<p>If the sun, driving through the circles and passing along the signs of the Zodiac in his
annual periods, accomplishes the changes and turnings of the seasons, how did those who
were born before the signs of the Zodiac were placed among the stars, and the heaven was
adorned with them, continue to exist, when summer, autumn, winter, and spring, were not
as yet separated from each other, by means of which the body is increased and strengthened?
But they did exist, and were longer lived and stronger than those who live now, since God
then disposed the seasons in the same manner. The heaven was not then diversified by such
shapes.</p>
<p>If the sun and the moon and the other stars were made for the division and protection
of the members of the time,2751 and for the adornment of the heaven, and the changes of
the seasons, they are divine, and better than men; for these must needs pass a better life,
and a blessed and peaceful one, and one which far exceeds our own life in righteousness
and virtue, observing a motion which is well-ordered and happy. But if they are the causes
of the calamities and mischief of mortals, and busy themselves in working the lasciviousness,
and the changes and vicissitudes of life, then they are more miserable than men, looking
upon the earth, and their weak and lawless actions, and doing nothing better than men, if
at least our life depends upon their revolutions and movements.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Several Other Things Turned Against the Same Mathematicians.</head>
<p>If no action is performed without a previous desire, and there is no desire without a
want, yet the Divine Being has no wants, and therefore has no conception of evil. And if the
nature of the stars be nearer in order to that of God, being better than the virtue of the best
men, then the stars also are neither productive of evil, nor in want.</p>
<p>And besides, every one of those who are persuaded that the sun and moon and stars are
divine, will allow that they are far removed from evil, and incapable of human actions which
spring from the sense of pleasure and pain; for such abominable desires are unsuitable to
heavenly beings. But if they are by nature exempt from these, and in no want of anything,
how should they be the causes to men of those things which they do not will themselves,
and from which they are exempt?</p>
<p>Now those who decide that man is not possessed of free-will, and affirm that he is governed
by the unavoidable necessities of fate, and her unwritten commands, are guilty of
impiety towards God Himself, making Him out to be the cause and author of human evils.
For if He harmoniously orders the whole circular motion of the stars, with a wisdom which
man can neither express nor comprehend, directing the course of the universe; and the stars
produce the qualities of virtue and vice in human life, dragging men to these things by the
chains of necessity; then they declare God to be the Cause and Giver of evils. But God is the
cause of injury to no one; therefore fate2752 is not the cause of all things.</p>
<p>Whoever has the least intelligence will confess that God is good, righteous, wise, true,
helpful, not the cause of evils, free from passion, and everything of that kind. And if the
righteous be better than the unrighteous, and unrighteousness be abominable to them, God,
being righteous, rejoices in righteousness, and unrighteousness is hateful to Him, being
opposed and hostile to righteousness. Therefore God is not the author of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>If that which profits is altogether good, and temperance is profitable to one’s house and
life and friends, then temperance is good. And if temperance be in its nature good, and licentiousness
be opposed to temperance, and that which is opposed to good be evil, then licentiousness
is evil. And if licentiousness be in its nature evil, and out of licentiousness come
adulteries, thefts, quarrels, and murders, then a licentious life is in its nature evil. But the
Divine Being is not by nature implicated in evils. Therefore our birth is not the cause of
these things.</p>
<p>If the temperate are better than the incontinent, and incontinence is abominable to
them, and God rejoices in temperance, being free from the knowledge of passions, then incontinence
is hateful also to God. Moreover, that the action which is in accordance with
temperance, being a virtue, is better than that which is in accordance with incontinence,
<note type="footnote">2752 γένεσις = birth, i.e., our life is not controlled by the star of our nativity.—Tr. [See Hippolytus, vol. v. p.

<pb n="788"/>
which is a vice, we may learn from kings and rulers, and commanders, and women, and
children, and citizens, and masters, and servants, and pedagogues, and teachers; for each
of these is useful to himself and to the public when he is temperate; but when he is licentious
he is injurious to himself and to the public. And if there be any difference between a filthy
man and a noble man, a licentious and a temperate; and if the character of the noble and
the temperate be the better, and that of the opposite the worse; and if those of the better
character be near to God and His friends, and those of the worse be far from Him and His
enemies, those who believe in fate make no distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness,
between filthiness and nobility, between licentiousness and temperance, which is
a contradiction. For if good be opposed to evil, and unrighteousness be evil, and this be
opposed to righteousness and righteousness be good, and good be hostile to evil, and evil
be unlike to good, then righteousness is different from unrighteousness. And therefore God
is not the cause of evils, nor does He rejoice in evils. Nor does reason commend them, being
good. If, then, any are evil, they are evil in accordance with the wants and desires of their
minds, and not by necessity.</p>
<p>
<lg>
<l>“They perish self-destroyed,</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>By their own fault.”2753</p>
<p>If destiny2754 leads one on to kill a man, and to stain his hands with murder, and the
law forbids this, punishing criminals, and by threats restrains the decrees of destiny, such
as committing injustice, adultery, theft, poisoning, then the law is in opposition to destiny;
for those things which destiny appointed the law prohibits, and those things which the law
prohibits destiny compels men to do. Hence law is hostile to destiny. But if it be hostile,
then lawgivers do not act in accordance with destiny; for by passing decrees in opposition
to destiny they destroy destiny. Either, then, there is destiny and there was no need of laws;
or there are laws and they are not in accordance with destiny. But it is impossible that anyone
should be born or anything done apart from destiny; for they say it is not lawful for anyone
even to move a finger apart from fate. And therefore it was in accordance with destiny that
Minos and Dracon, and Lycurgus, and Solon, and Zaleukos were law-givers and appointed
laws, prohibiting adulteries, murders, violence, rape, thefts, as things which neither existed
nor took place in accordance with destiny. But if these things were in accordance with destiny,
then the laws were not in accordance with destiny. For destiny itself would not be destroyed
by itself, cancelling itself, and contending against itself; here appointing laws forbidding
adultery and murders, and taking vengeance upon and punishing the wicked, and there
producing murders and adulteries. But this is impossible: for nothing is alien and abhorrent
to itself, and self-destructive, and at variance with itself. And, therefore, there is no destiny.</p>
<note type="footnote">2753 Hom., Od., i. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">2754 γένεσις = birth, h. the star of man’s nativity, h. destiny.</note>

<pb n="789"/>
<p>If everything in the world falls out in accordance with destiny, and nothing without it,
then the law must needs be produced by destiny. But the law destroys destiny, teaching that
virtue should be learnt, and diligently performed; and that vice should be avoided, and that
it is produced by want of discipline. Therefore there is no destiny.</p>
<p>If destiny makes men to injure one another, and to be injured by one another, what
need is there of laws? But if laws are made that they may check the sinful, God having a care
for those who are injured, it were better that the evil should not act in accordance with Fate,
than that they should be set right, after having acted. But God is good and wise, and does
what is best. Therefore there is no fixed destiny. Either education and habit are the cause
of sins, or the passions of the soul, and those desires which arise through the body. But
whichever of these be the cause, God is not the cause. If it is better to be righteous than to
be unrighteous, why is not man made so at once from his birth? But if afterwards he is
tempered by instruction and laws, that he may become better, he is so tempered as possessing
free-will, and not by nature evil. If the evil are evil in accordance with destiny, by the decrees
of Providence, they are not blameworthy and deserving of the punishment which is inflicted
by the laws, since they live according to their own nature, and are not capable of being
changed.</p>
<p>And, again, if the good, living according to their own proper nature, are praiseworthy,
their natal destiny being the cause of their goodness; yet the wicked, living according to
their own proper nature, are not blamable in the eye of a righteous judge. For, if we must
speak plainly, he who lives according to the nature which belongs to him, in no way sins.
For he did not make himself thus, but Fate; and he lives according to its motion, being urged
on by unavoidable necessity. Then no one is bad. But some men are bad: and vice is
blameworthy, and hostile to God, as reason has shown. But virtue is lovable and praiseworthy,
God having appointed a law for the punishment of the wicked. Therefore there is no Fate.</p>

that to do good or evil is in our own power, and not decided by the stars. For there are two
motions in us, the lust of the flesh and that of the soul, differing from each other,2755 whence
they have received two names, that of virtue and that of vice. And we ought to obey the most
noble and most useful leading of virtue, choosing the best in preference to the base. But
enough on these points. I must come to the end of my discourse; for I fear, and am ashamed,
after these discourses on chastity, that I should be obliged to introduce the opinions of men
who study the heavens, or rather who study nonsense, who waste their life with mere conceits,
passing it in nothing but fabulous figments. And now may these offerings of ours, composed
from the words which are spoken by God, be acceptable to thee, O Arete, my mistress.</p>

the blush of modesty; for she is altogether brilliant in body and soul.</p>

to the Jews for Celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles: What They Signify;
The Sum of This Septenary Uncertain; Not Clear to Any One When the Consummation
of the World Will Be; Even Now the Fabric of the World Completed.</head>
<p>O Arete, thou dearest boast to the lovers of virginity, I also implore thee to afford me
thine aid, lest I should be wanting in words, the subject having been so largely and variously
handled. Wherefore I ask to be excused exordium and introductions, lest, whilst I delay in
embellishments suitable to them, I depart from the subject: so glorious, and honourable,
and renowned a thing is virginity.</p>
<p>God, when He appointed to the true Israelites the legal rite of the true feast of the tabernacles,
directed, in Leviticus, how they should keep and do honour to the feast; above all
things, saying that each one should adorn his tabernacle with chastity. I will add the words
themselves of Scripture, from which, without any doubt, it will be shown how agreeable to
God, and acceptable to Him, is this ordinance of virginity: “In the fifteenth day of the seventh
month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord
seven days: on the first day shall be a Sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a Sabbath. And
ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and
the boughs of thick trees, and willows2756 of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord
your God seven days. And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year. It
shall be a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye
shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths; that your
generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought
them out of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.”2757</p>
<p>Here the Jews, fluttering about the bare letter of Scripture, like drones about the leaves
of herbs, but not about flowers and fruits as the bee, fully believe that these words and ordinances
were spoken concerning such a tabernacle as they erect; as if God delighted in
those trivial adornments which they, preparing, fabricate from trees, not perceiving the
wealth of good things to come; whereas these things, being like air and phantom shadows,
foretell the resurrection and the putting up of our tabernacle that had fallen upon the earth,
which at length, in the seventh thousand of years, resuming again immortal, we shall celebrate
the great feast of true tabernacles in the new and indissoluble creation, the fruits of the earth

the works of creation.2758</p>
<p>For since in six days God made the heaven and the earth, and finished the whole world,
and rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made, and blessed the seventh
day and sanctified it,2759 so by a figure in the seventh month, when the fruits of the earth
have been gathered in, we are commanded to keep the feast to the Lord, which signifies that,
when this world shall be terminated at the seventh thousand years, when God shall have
completed the world, He shall rejoice in us.2760 For now to this time all things are created
by His all-sufficient will and inconceivable power; the earth still yielding its fruits, and the
waters being gathered together in their receptacles; and the light still severed from darkness,
and the allotted number of men not yet being complete; and the sun arising to rule the day,
and the moon the night; and four-footed creatures, and beasts, and creeping things arising
from the earth, and winged creatures, and creatures that swim, from the water. Then, when
the appointed times shall have been accomplished, and God shall have ceased to form this
creation, in the seventh month, the great resurrection-day, it is commanded that the Feast
of our Tabernacles shall be celebrated to the Lord, of which the things said in Leviticus are
symbols and figures, which things, carefully investigating, we should consider the naked
truth itself, for He saith, “A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: to understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.”2761</p>
<p>Wherefore let it shame the Jews that they do not perceive the deep things of the Scriptures,
thinking that nothing else than outward things are contained in the law and the
prophets; for they, intent upon things earthly, have in greater esteem the riches of the world
than the wealth which is of the soul. For since the Scriptures are in this way divided that
some of them give the likeness of past events, some of them a type of the future, the miserable
men, going back, deal with the figures of the future as if they were already things of the past.
As in the instance of the immolation of the Lamb, the mystery of which they regard as solely
in remembrance of the deliverance of their fathers from Egypt, when, although the firstborn
of Egypt were smitten, they themselves were preserved by marking the door-posts of
their houses with blood. Nor do they understand that by it also the death of Christ is personified,

<head>Chapter II.—Figure, Image, Truth: Law, Grace, Glory; Man Created Immortal: Death
Brought in by Destructive Sin.</head>
<p>And let these things be said for the sake of example, showing that the Jews have wonderfully
fallen from the hope of future good, because they consider things present to be only
signs of things already accomplished; whilst they do not perceive that the figures represent
images, and images are the representatives of truth. For the law is indeed the figure and the
shadow of an image, that is, of the Gospel; but the image, namely, the Gospel, is the representative
of truth itself. For the men of olden time and the law foretold to us the characteristics
of the Church, and the Church represents those of the new dispensation which is to come.
Whence we, having received Christ, saying, “I am the truth,”2762 know that shadows and
figures have ceased; and we hasten on to the truth, proclaiming its glorious images. For now
we know “in part,” and as it were “through a glass,”2763 since that which is perfect has not
yet come to us; namely, the kingdom of heaven and the resurrection, when “that which is
in part shall be done away.”2764 For then will all our tabernacles be firmly set up, when again
the body shall rise, with bones again joined and compacted with flesh. Then shall we celebrate
truly to the Lord a glad festal-day, when we shall receive eternal tabernacles, no more to
perish or be dissolved into the dust of the tomb. Now, our tabernacle was at first fixed in
an immoveable state, but was moved by transgression and bent to the earth, God putting
an end to sin by means of death, lest man immortal, living a sinner, and sin living in him,
should be liable to eternal curse. Wherefore he died, although he had not been created liable
to death or corruption, and the soul was separated from the flesh, that sin might perish by
death, not being able to live longer in one dead. Whence sin being dead and destroyed, again
I shall rise immortal; and I praise God who by means of death frees His sons from death,
and I celebrate lawfully to His honour a festal-day, adorning my tabernacle, that is my flesh,
with good works, as there did the five virgins with the five-lighted lamps.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—How Each One Ought to Prepare Himself for the Future Resurrection.</head>
<p>In the first day of the resurrection I am examined whether I bring these things which
are commanded, whether I am adorned with virtuous works, whether I am overshadowed
by the boughs of chastity. For account the resurrection to be the erection of the tabernacle.
Account that the things which are taken for the putting together of the tabernacle are the
works of righteousness. I take, therefore, on the first day the things which are set down, that
is, on the day in which I stand to be judged, whether I have adorned my tabernacle with the
things commanded; if those things are found on that day which here in time we are commanded
to prepare, and there to offer to God. But come, let us consider what follows.</p>
<p>“And ye shall take you,” He says, “on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches
of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows (and the tree of chastity) of the
brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God.”2765 The Jews, uncircumcised in heart,
think that the most beautiful fruit of wood is the citron wood, on account of its size; nor are
they ashamed to say that God is worshipped with cedar, to whom not all the quadrupeds of
the earth would suffice as a burnt-offering or as incense for burning. And moreover, O hard
breasts, if the citron appear beautiful to you, why not the pomegranate, and other fruits of
trees, and amongst them apples, which much surpass the citron? Indeed, in the Song of
Songs,2766 Solomon having made mention of all these fruits, passes over in silence the citron
only. But this deceives the unwary, for they have not understood that the tree of life2767
which Paradise once bore, now again the Church has produced for all, even the ripe and
comely fruit of faith.</p>
<p>Such fruit it is necessary that we bring when we come to the judgment-seat of Christ,
on the first day of the feast; for if we are without it we shall not be able to feast with God,
nor to have part, according to John,2768 in the first resurrection. For the tree of life is wisdom
first begotten of all. “She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her,” says the prophet;2769
“and happy is every one that retaineth her.” “A tree planted by the waterside, that will bring
forth his fruit in due season;”2770 that is, learning and charity and discretion are imparted
in due time to those who come to the waters of redemption.</p>
<p>He that hath not believed in Christ, nor hath understood that He is the first principle
and the tree of life, since he cannot show to God his tabernacle adorned with the most goodly
of fruits, how shall he celebrate the feast? How shall he rejoice? Desirest thou to know the

goodly fruit of the tree? Consider the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how pleasant they are
beyond the children of men. Good fruit came by Moses, that is the Law, but not so goodly
as the Gospel. For the Law is a kind of figure and shadow of things to come, but the Gospel
is truth and the grace of life. Pleasant was the fruit of the prophets, but not so pleasant as
the fruit of immortality which is plucked from the Gospel.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Mind Clearer When Cleansed from Sin; The Ornaments of the
Mind and the Order of Virtue; Charity Deep and Full; Chastity the Last Ornament
of All; The Very Use of Matrimony to Be Restrained.</head>
<p>“And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palmtrees.”
2771 This signifies the exercise of divine discipline, by which the mind that subdues
the passions is cleansed and adorned by the sweeping out and ejection from it of sins. For
it is necessary to come cleansed and adorned to the feast, arrayed, as by a decorator, in the
discipline and exercise of virtue. For the mind being cleansed by laborious exercises from
the distracting thoughts which darken it, quickly perceives the truth; as the widow in the
Gospels2772 found the piece of money after she had swept the house and cast out the dirt,
that is, the passions which obscure and cloud the mind, which increase in us from our luxuriousness
and carelessness.</p>
<p>Whoso, therefore, desires to come to that Feast of Tabernacles, to be numbered with
the saints, let him first procure the goodly fruit of faith, then palm branches, that is, attentive
meditation upon and study of the Scriptures, afterwards the far-spreading and thickly-leaved
branches of charity, which He commands us to take after the palm branches; most fitly
calling charity dense boughs, because it is all thick and close and very fruitful, not having
anything bare or empty, but all full, both branches and trunks. Such is charity, having no
part void or unfruitful. For “though I sell all my goods and give to the poor, and though I
yield up my body to the fire, and though I have so great faith that I can remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing.”2773 Charity, therefore, is a tree the thickest and most
fruitful of all, full and abounding copiously abounding in graces.</p>
<p>After this, what else does He will that we should take? Willow branches; by that figure
indicating righteousness, because “the just,” according to the prophet, shall spring up “as
grass in the midst of the waters, as willows by the watercourses,”2774 flourishing in the word.
Lastly, to crown all, it is commanded that the bough of the Agnos tree be brought to decorate
the Tabernacle, because it is by its very name the tree of chastity, by which those already
named are adorned. Let the wanton now be gone, who, through their love of pleasure, reject
chastity. How shall they enter into the feast with Christ who have not adorned their tabernacle
with boughs of chastity, that God-making and blessed tree with which all who are hastening
to that assembly and nuptial banquet ought to be begirt, and to cover their loins? For come,
fair virgins, consider the Scripture itself, and its commands, how the Divine word has as-

sumed chastity to be the crown of those virtues and duties that have been mentioned,
showing how becoming and desirable it is for the resurrection, and that without it no one
will obtain the promises which we who profess virginity supremely cultivate and offer to
the Lord. They also possess it who live chastely with their wives, and do, as it were about
the trunk, yield its lowly branches bearing chastity, not being able like us to reach its lofty
and mighty boughs, or even to touch them; yet they, too, offer no less truly, although in a
less degree, the branches of chastity.2775 But those who are goaded on by their lusts, although
they do not commit fornication, yet who, even in the things which are permitted with a
lawful wife, through the heat of unsubdued concupiscence are excessive in embraces, how
shall they celebrate the feast? how shall they rejoice, who have not adorned their tabernacle,
that is their flesh, with the boughs of the Agnos, nor have listened to that which has been
said, that “they that have wives be as though they had none?”2776</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Mystery of the Tabernacles.</head>
<p>Wherefore, above all other things, I say to those who love contests, and who are strongminded,
that without delay they should honour chastity, as a thing the most useful and
glorious. For in the new and indissoluble creation, whoever shall not be found decorated
with the boughs of chastity, shall neither obtain rest, because he has not fulfilled the command
of God according to the law, nor shall he enter into the land of promise, because he has not
previously celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles. For they only who have celebrated the Feast
of Tabernacles come to the Holy Land, setting out from those dwellings which are called
tabernacles, until they come to enter into the temple and city of God, advancing to a greater
and more glorious joy, as the Jewish types indicate. For like as the Israelites, having left the
borders of Egypt, first came to the Tabernacles,2777 and from hence, having again set forth,
came into the land of promise, so also do we. For I also, taking my journey, and going forth
from the Egypt of this life, came first to the resurrection, which is the true Feast of the
Tabernacles, and there having set up my tabernacle, adorned with the fruits of virtue, on
the first day of the resurrection, which is the day of judgment, celebrate with Christ the
millennium of rest, which is called the seventh day, even the true Sabbath. Then again from
thence I, a follower of Jesus, “who hath entered into the heavens,”2778 as they also, after the
rest of the Feast of Tabernacles, came into the land of promise, come into the heavens, not
continuing to remain in tabernacles—that is, my body not remaining as it was before, but,
after the space of a thousand years, changed from a human and corruptible form into angelic
size and beauty, where at last we virgins, when the festival of the resurrection is consummated,
shall pass from the wonderful place of the tabernacle to greater and better things, ascending
into the very house of God above the heavens, as, says the Psalmist, “in the voice of praise
and thanksgiving, among such as keep holy day.”2779 I, O Arete, my mistress, offer as a gift
to thee this robe, adorned according to my ability.</p>

anxiety of mind Domnina must be from the character of the discourses, perplexed in heart

speak more feebly than the rest of the virgins, since they have spoken on the subject with
such ability and variety. If, therefore, she was evidently moved, come and complete this too;
for I wonder if she had anything to say, being the last speaker.</p>

perplexed from want of words. After, therefore, Tusiane had ceased, Arete looked at her

to pray, and turning round, invoked Wisdom to be her present helper. And when she had
prayed, Theopatra said that suddenly courage came to her, and a certain divine confidence

<p>O Arete, I also, omitting the long preludes of exordiums, will endeavour according to
my ability to enter upon the subject, lest, by delaying upon those matters which are outside
the subject in hand, I should speak of them at greater length than their importance would
warrant. For I account it a very great part of prudence not to make long speeches, which
merely charm the ears, before coming to the main question, but to begin forthwith at the
point in debate. So I will begin from thence, for it is time.</p>
<p>Nothing can so much profit a man, O fair virgins, with respect to moral excellence, as
chastity; for chastity alone accomplishes and brings it about that the soul should be governed
in the noblest and best way, and should be set free, pure from the stains and pollutions of
the world. For which reason, when Christ taught us to cultivate it, and showed its unsurpassable
beauty, the kingdom of the Evil One was destroyed, who aforetime led captive and enslaved
the whole race of men, so that none of the more ancient people pleased the Lord, but
all were overcome by errors, since the law was not of itself sufficient to free the human race
from corruption, until virginity, succeeding the law, governed men by the precepts of Christ.
Nor truly had the first men so often run headlong into combats and slaughter, into lust and
idolatry, if the righteousness that is by the law had been to them sufficient for salvation.
Now truly they were then confused by great and frequent calamities; but from the time when
Christ was incarnate, and armed and adorned His flesh with virginity, the savage tyrant who
was master of incontinence was taken away, and peace and faith have dominion, men no
longer turning so much as before to idolatry.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Allegory of the Trees Demanding a King, in the Book of Judges,2780
Explained.</head>
<p>But lest I should appear to some to be sophistical, and to conjecture these things from
mere probabilities, and to babble, I will bring forward to you, O virgins, from the Old
Testament, written prophecy from the Book of Judges, to show that I speak the truth, where
the future reign of chastity was already clearly foretold. For we read: “The trees went forth
on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour
God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come
thou, and reign over us. But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and
my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then said the trees unto the vine,
Come thou, and reign over us. And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then said all the trees unto
the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth
ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow; and if not, let fire
come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.”</p>
<p>Now, that these things are not said of trees growing out of the earth, is clear. For inanimate
trees cannot be assembled in council to choose a king, inasmuch as they firmly fixed
by deep roots to the earth. But altogether are these things narrated concerning souls which,
before the incarnation of Christ, too deeply luxuriating in transgressions, approach to God
as suppliants, and ask His mercy, and that they may be governed by His pity and compassion,
which Scripture expresses under the figure of the olive, because oil is of great advantage to
our bodies, and takes away our fatigues and ailments, and affords light. For all lamp-light
increases when nourished by oil. So also the mercies of God entirely dissolve death, and
assist the human race, and nourish the light of the heart.2781 And consider whether the laws,
from the first created man until Christ in succession, were not set forth in these words by
the Scripture by figments, in opposition to which the devil has deceived the human race.
And it has likened the fig-tree to the command given to man in paradise, because, when he
was deceived, he covered his nakedness with the leaves of a fig-tree;2782 and the vine to the
precept given to Noah at the time of the deluge, because, when overpowered by wine, he
was mocked.2783 The olive signifies the law given to Moses in the desert, because the
prophetic grace, the holy oil, had failed from their inheritance when they broke the law.
Lastly, the bramble not inaptly refers to the law which was given to the apostles for the sal-

vation of the world; because by their instruction we have been taught virginity, of which
alone the devil has not been able to make a deceptive image. For which cause, also, four
Gospels have been given, because God has four times given the Gospel2784 to the human
race, and has instructed them by four laws, the times of which are clearly known by the diversity
of the fruits. For the fig-tree, on account of its sweetness and richness, represents
the delights of man, which he had in paradise before the fall. Indeed, not rarely, as we shall
afterwards show, the Holy Spirit2785 takes the fruit of the fig-tree as an emblem of goodness.
But the vine, on account of the gladness produced by wine, and the joy of those who were
saved from wrath and from the deluge, signifies the change produced from fear and anxiety
into joy.2786 Moreover, the olive, on account of the oil which it produces, indicates the
compassion of God, who again, after the deluge, bore patiently when men turned aside to
ungodliness, so that He gave them the law and manifested Himself to some, and nourished
by oil the light of virtue, now almost extinguished.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Bramble and the Agnos the Symbol of Chastity; The Four Gospels,
that Is, Teachings or Laws, Instructing to Salvation.</head>
<p>Now the bramble commends chastity, for the bramble and the agnos is the same tree:
by some it is called bramble, by others agnos.2787 Perhaps it is because the plant is akin to
virginity that it is called bramble and agnos; bramble, because of its strength and firmness
against pleasures; agnos, because it always continues chaste. Hence the Scripture relates that
Elijah, fleeing from the face of the woman Jezebel,2788 at first came under a bramble, and
there, having been heard, received strength and took food; signifying that to him who flies
from the incitements of lust, and from a woman—that is, from pleasure—the tree of chastity
is a refuge and a shade, ruling men from the coming of Christ, the chief of virgins. For when
the first laws, which were published in the times of Adam and Noah and Moses, were unable
to give salvation to man, the evangelical law alone has saved all.</p>
<p>And this is the cause why the fig-tree may be said not to have obtained the kingdom
over trees, which, in a spiritual sense, mean men; and the fig-tree the command, because
man desired, even after the fall, again to be subject to the dominion of virtue, and not to be
deprived of the immortality of the paradise of pleasure. But, having transgressed, he was
rejected and cast far away, as one who could no longer be governed by immortality, nor was
capable of receiving it. And the first message to him after the transgression was preached
by Noah,2789 to which, if he had applied his mind, he might have been saved from sin; for
in it he promised both happiness and rest from evils, if he gave heed to it with all his might,
just as the vine promises to yield wine to those who cultivate it with care and labour. But
neither did this law rule mankind, for men did not obey it, although zealously preached by
Noah. But, after they began to be surrounded and drowning by the waters, they began to
repent, and to promise that they would obey the commandments. Wherefore with scorn
they are rejected as subjects; that is, they are contemptuously told that they cannot be helped
by the law; the Spirit answering them back and reproaching them because they had deserted
those men whom God had commanded to help them, and to save them, and make them
glad; such as Noah and those with him. “Even to you, O rebellious,” said he, “I come, to
bring help to you who are destitute of prudence, and who differ in nothing from dry trees,
and who formerly did not believe me when I preached that you ought to flee from present
things.”</p>

<p>And so those men, having been thus rejected from the divine care, and the human race
having again given themselves up to error, again God sent forth, by Moses, a law to rule
them and recall them to righteousness. But these, thinking fit to bid a long farewell to this
law, turned to idolatry. Hence God gave them up to mutual slaughters, to exiles, and captivities,
the law itself confessing, as it were, that it could not save them. Therefore, worn out
with ills and afflicted, they again promised that they would obey the commandments; until
God, pitying man the fourth time, sent chastity to rule over them, which Scripture consequently
called the bramble. And she consuming pleasures threatens besides, that unless
all undoubtingly obey her, and truly come to her, she will destroy all with fire, since there
will be hereafter no other law or doctrine but judgment and fire. For this reason, man
henceforth began to do righteousness, and firmly to believe in God, and to separate himself
from the devil. Thus chastity was sent down, as being most useful and helpful to men. For
of her alone was the devil unable to forge an imitation to lead men astray, as is the case with
the other precepts.</p>

Fig-Trees and Vines.</head>
<p>The fig-tree, as I said, from the sweetness and excellence of its fruit, being taken as a
type of the delights of paradise, the devil, having beguiled the man by its imitations, led him
captive, persuading him to conceal the nakedness of his body by fig-leaves; that is, by their
friction he excited him to sexual pleasure. Again, those that had been saved from the deluge,
he intoxicated with a drink which was an imitation of the vine of spiritual joy; and again he
mocked them, having stripped them of virtue. And what I say will hereafter be more clear.</p>
<p>The enemy, by his power, always imitates2790 the forms of virtue and righteousness,
not for the purpose of truly promoting its exercise, but for deception and hypocrisy. For in
order that those who fly from death he may entice to death, he is outwardly dyed with the
colours of immortality. And hence he wishes to seem a fig-tree or vine, and to produce
sweetness and joy, and is “transformed into an angel of light,”2791 ensnaring many by the
appearance of piety.</p>
<p>For we find in the Sacred Writings that there are two kinds of fig-trees and vines, “the
good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil;”2792 “wine that maketh glad the heart of man,”2793
and wine which is the poison of dragons, and the incurable venom of asps.2794 But from
the time when chastity began to rule over men, the fraud was detected and overcome, Christ,
the chief of virgins, overturning it. So both the true fig-tree and the true vine yield fruit after
that the power of chastity has laid hold upon all men, as Joel the prophet preaches, saying:
“Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great things. Be not afraid, ye
beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit,
the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice
in the Lord your God, for He hath given you food unto righteousness;”2795 calling the former
laws the vine and the fig, trees bearing fruit unto righteousness for the children of the spiritual
Zion, which bore fruit after the incarnation of the Word, when chastity ruled over us,
when formerly, on account of sin and much error, they had checked and destroyed their
buds. For the true vine and the true fig-tree were not able to yield such nourishment to us
as would be profitable for life, whilst as yet the false fig-tree, variously adorned for the purpose
of fraud, flourished. But when the Lord dried up the false branches, the imitations of the

true branches, uttering the sentence against the bitter fig-tree, “Let no fruit grow on thee
henceforward for ever,”2796 then those which were truly fruit-bearing trees flourished and
yielded food unto righteousness.</p>
<p>The vine, and that not in a few places, refers to the Lord Himself,2797 and the fig-tree
to the Holy Spirit, as the Lord “maketh glad the hearts of men,” and the Spirit healeth them.
And therefore Hezekiah is commanded2798 first to make a plaster with a lump of figs—that
is, the fruit of the Spirit—that he may be healed—that is, according to the apostle—by love;
for he says, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance;”2799 which, on account of their great pleasantness, the
prophet calls figs. Micah also says, “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his
fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid.”2800 Now it is certain that those who have taken
refuge and rested under the Spirit, and under the shadow of the Word, shall not be alarmed,
nor frightened by him who troubles the hearts of men.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Mystery of the Vision of Zechariah.</head>
<p>Moreover, Zechariah shows that the olive shadows forth the law of Moses, speaking
thus: “And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me, as a man that is wakened
out of his sleep, and said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold
a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it.…And two olive-trees by it, one upon
the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.”2801 And after a few
words, the prophet, asking what are the olives on the right and left of the candlestick, and
what the two olive-boughs in the hands of the two pipes, the angel answered and said: “These
are the two sons of fruitfulness2802 which stand by the Lord of the whole earth,” signifying
the two first-born virtues that are waiting upon God, which, in His dwelling, supply around
the wick, through the boughs, the spiritual oil of God, that man may have the light of divine
knowledge. But the two boughs of the two olives are the law and the prophets, around, as
it were, the lot2803 of the inheritance, of which Christ and the Holy Spirit are the authors,
we ourselves meanwhile not being able to take the whole fruit and the greatness of these
plants, before chastity began to rule the world, but only their boughs—to wit, the law and
the prophets—did we formerly cultivate, and those moderately, often letting them slip. For
who was ever able to receive Christ or the Spirit, unless he first purified himself? For the
exercise which prepares the soul from childhood for desirable and delectable glory, and
carries this grace safely thither with ease, and from small toils raises up mighty hopes, is
chastity, which gives immortality to our bodies; which it becomes all men willingly to prefer
in honour and to praise above all things; some, that by its means they may be betrothed to
the Word, practising virginity; and others, that by it they may be freed from the curse, “Dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”2804</p>
<p>This, O Arete, is the discourse on virginity which you required of me, accomplished
according to my ability; which I pray, O mistress, although it is mediocre and short, that
thou wilt receive with kindness from me who was chosen to speak last.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—The True and Chaste Virgins Few; Chastity a Contest; Thekla Chief of
Virgins.</head>
<p>I do accept it, Theopatra related that Arete said, and approve of it all. For it is an excellent
thing, even although you had not spoken so clearly, to take up and go through with earnest-
ness those things which have been said, not to prepare a sweet entertainment for those who
listen, but for correction, recollection, and abstinence. For whoever teaches that chastity is
to be preferred and embraced first of all among my pursuits, rightly advises; which many
think that they honour and cultivate, but which few, so to speak, really honour. For it is not
one who has studied to restrain his flesh from the pleasure of carnal delight that cultivates
chastity, if he do not keep in check the rest of the desires; but rather he dishonours it, and
that in no small degree, by base lusts, exchanging pleasures for pleasures. Nor if he have
strongly resisted the desires of the senses, but is lifted up with vainglory, and from this cause
is able to repress the heats of burning lust, and reckon them all as nothing, can he be thought
to honour chastity; for he dishonours it in that he is lifted up with pride, cleansing the outside
of the cup and platter, that is, the flesh and the body, but injuring the heart by conceit and
ambition. Nor when any one is conceited of riches is he desirous of honouring chastity; he
dishonours it more than all, preferring a little gain to that to which nothing is comparable
of those things that are in this life esteemed. For all riches and gold “in respect of it are as a
little sand.”2805 And neither does he who loves himself above measure, and eagerly considers
that which is expedient for himself alone, regardless of the necessities of his neighbour,
honour chastity, but he also dishonours it. For he who has repelled from himself charity,
mercy, and humanity, is much inferior to those who honourably exercise chastity. Nor is it
right, on the one hand, by the use of chastity to keep virginity, and, on the other hand, to
pollute the soul by evil deeds and lust; nor here to profess purity and continence, and there
to pollute it by indulgence in vices. Nor, again, here to declare that the things of this world
bring no care to himself; there to be eager in procuring them, and in concern about them.
But all the members are to be preserved intact and free from corruption; not only those
which are sexual, but those members also which minister to the service of lusts. For it would
be ridiculous to preserve the organs of generation pure, but not the tongue; or to preserve
the tongue, but neither the eyesight, the ears, nor the hands; or lastly, to preserve these pure,
but not the mind, defiling it with pride and anger.</p>
<p>It is altogether necessary for him who has resolved that he will not err from the practice
of chastity, to keep all his members and senses clean and under restraint, as is customary
with the planks of ships, whose fastenings the ship-masters diligently join together, lest by
<note type="footnote">2805 Wisd. vii. 9.</note>

<pb n="810"/>
any means the way and access may lie open for sin to pour itself into the mind. For great
pursuits are liable to great falls, and evil is more opposed to that which is really good than
to that which is not good. For many who thought that to repress vehement lascivious desires
constituted chastity, neglecting other duties connected with it, failed also in this, and have
brought blame2806 upon those endeavouring after it by the right way, as you have proved
who are a model in everything, leading a virgin life in deed and word. And now what that
is which becomes a virgin state has been described.</p>
<p>And you all in my hearing having sufficiently contended in speaking, I pronounce victors
and crown; but Thekla with a larger and thicker chaplet, as the chief of you, and as having
shone with greater lustre than the rest.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Thekla Singing Decorously a Hymn, the Rest of the Virgins Sing with
Her; John the Baptist a Martyr to Chastity; The Church the Spouse of God, Pure
and Virgin.</head>
<p>Theopatra said that Arete having said these things, commanded them all to rise, and,
standing under the Agnos, to send up to the Lord in a becoming manner a hymn of
thanksgiving; and that Thekla should begin and should lead the rest. And when they had
stood up, she said that Thekla, standing in the midst of the virgins on the right of Arete,
decorously sang; but the rest, standing together in a circle after the manner of a chorus, responded
to her: “I keep myself pure for Thee, O Bridegroom, and holding a lighted torch I
go to meet Thee.”2807</p>
<p>Thekla. 1. From above, O virgins, the sound of a noise that wakes the dead has come,
bidding us all to meet the Bridegroom in white robes, and with torches towards the east.
Arise, before the King enters within the gates.</p>

happy bridal chamber.</p>
<p>Chorus. I keep myself pure for Thee, O Bridegroom, and holding a lighted torch I go
to meet Thee.</p>
<p>Thekla. 4. Having escaped, O blessed One, from the innumerable enchanting wiles of

of wild beasts, I await Thee from heaven.</p>

<p>Euboulios. Deservedly, O Gregorion, has Thekla borne off the chief prize.</p>
<p>Gregorion. Deservedly indeed.</p>
<p>Euboulios. But what about the stranger Telmisiake?2815 Tell me, was she not listening
from without? I wonder if she could keep silence on hearing of this banquet, and would not
forthwith, as a bird flies to its food, listen to the things which were spoken.</p>
<p>Gregorion. The report is that she was present with Methodios2816 when he inquired
respecting these things of Arete. But it is a good as well as a happy thing to have such a
mistress and guide as Arete, that is virtue.</p>
<p>Euboulios. But, Gregorion, which shall we say are the better, those who without lust
govern concupiscence, or those who under the assaults of concupiscence continue pure?</p>
<p>Gregorion. For my part, I think those who are free from lust, for they have their mind
undefiled, and are altogether uncorrupted, sinning in no respect.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Well, I swear by chastity, and wisely, O Gregorion. But lest in any wise I
hinder you, if I gainsay your words, it is that I may the better learn, and that no one hereafter
may refute me.</p>
<p>Gregorion. Gainsay me as you will, you have my permission. For, Euboulios, I think
that I know sufficient to teach you that he who is not concupiscent is better than he who is.
If I cannot, then there is no one who can convince you.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Bless me! I am glad that you answer me so magnanimously, and show how
wealthy you are as regards wisdom.</p>
<p>Gregorion. A mere chatterer, so you seem to be, O Euboulios.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Why so?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Because you ask rather for the sake of amusement than of truth.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Speak fair, I pray you, my good friend; for I greatly admire your wisdom and
renown. I say this because, with reference to the things that many wise men often dispute
among themselves, you say that you not only understand them, but also vaunt that you can

<pb n="816"/>
<p>Gregorion. Now tell me truly whether it is a difficulty with you to receive the opinion,
that they who are not concupiscent excel those who are concupiscent, and yet restrain
themselves? or are you joking?</p>
<p>Euboulios. How so, when I tell you that I do not know? But, come, tell me, O wisest
lady, in what do the non-concupiscent and chaste excel the concupiscent who live chastely?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Because, in the first place, they have the soul itself pure, and the Holy Spirit
always dwells in it, seeing that it is not distracted and disturbed by fancies and unrestrained
thoughts, so as to pollute the mind. But they are in every way inaccessible to lust, both as
to their flesh and to their heart, enjoying tranquillity from passions. But they who are allured
from without, through the sense of sight, with fancies, and receiving lust flowing like a
stream into the heart, are often not less polluted, even when they think that they contend
and fight against pleasures, being vanquished in their mind.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Shall we then say that they who serenely live and are not disturbed by lusts
are pure?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Certainly. For these2817 are they whom God makes gods in the beatitudes;
they who believe in Him without doubt. And He says that they shall look upon God with
confidence, because they bring in nothing that darkens or confuses the eye of the soul for
the beholding of God; but all desire of things secular being eliminated, they not only, as I
said, preserve the flesh pure from carnal connection, but even the heart, in which, especially,
as in a temple, the Holy Spirit rests and dwells, is open to no unclean thoughts.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Stay now; for I think that from hence we shall the better go on to the discovery
of what things are truly the best; and, tell me, do you call anyone a good pilot?</p>
<p>Gregorion. I certainly do.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Whether is it he that saves his vessel in great and perplexing storms, or is it
he who does so in a breathless calm?</p>
<p>Gregorion. He that does so in a great and perplexing storm.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Shall we not then say that the soul, which is deluged with the surging waves
of the passions, and yet does not, on that account, weary or grow faint, but direct her vessel—
that is, the flesh—nobly into the port of chastity, is better and more estimable than he
that navigates in calm weather?</p>
<p>Gregorion. We will say so.</p>
<p>Euboulios. For to be prepared against the entrance of the gales of the Evil Spirit, and
not to be cast away or overcome, but to refer all to Christ, and strongly to contend against
pleasures, brings greater praise than he wins who lives a virgin life calmly and with ease.</p>
<p>Gregorion. It appears so.</p>
<note type="footnote">2817 Matt. v. 8.</note>

<pb n="817"/>
<p>Euboulios. And what saith the Lord? Does He not seem to show that he who retains
continence, though concupiscent, excels him who, having no concupiscence, leads a virgin
life?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Where does He say so?</p>
<p>Euboulios. Where, comparing a wise man to a house well founded, He declares him
immoveable because he cannot be overthrown by rains, and floods, and winds; likening, as
it would seem, these storms to lusts, but the immoveable and unshaken firmness of the soul
in chastity to the rock.</p>
<p>Gregorion. You appear to speak what is true.</p>
<p>Euboulios. And what say you of the physician? Do you not call him the best who has
been proved in great diseases, and has healed many patients?</p>
<p>Gregorion. I do.</p>
<p>Euboulios. But the one who has never at any time practised, nor ever had the sick in his
hands, is he not still in all respects the inferior?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Yes.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Then we may certainly say that a soul which is contained by a concupiscent
body, and which appeases with the medicaments of temperance the disorders arising from
the heat of lusts, carries off the palm for healing, over one to whose lot it has fallen to govern
aright a body which is free from lust.2818</p>
<p>Gregorion. It must be allowed.</p>
<p>Euboulios. And how is it in wrestling? Whether is the better wrestler he who has many
and strong antagonists, and continually is contending without being worsted, or he who
has no opponents?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Manifestly he who wrestles.</p>
<p>Euboulios. And, in wrestling, is not the athlete who contends the more experienced?</p>
<p>Gregorion. It must be granted.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Therefore it is clear that he whose soul contends against the impulses of lust,
and is not borne down by it, but draws back and sets himself in array against it, appears
stronger than he who does not lust.2819</p>
<p>Gregorion. True.</p>
<p>Euboulios. What then? Does it not appear to you, Gregorion, that there is more courage
in being valiant against the assaults of base desires?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>Euboulios. Is not this courage the strength of virtue?</p>
<p>Gregorion. Plainly so.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher,2821 in commenting on Plato’s Symposium, remarks: “Even natural birth
(i.e., in Plato’s system) was nothing but a reproduction of the same eternal form and
idea.…The whole discussion displays the gradation, not only from that pleasure which arises
from the contemplation of personal beauty through that which every larger object, whether
single or manifold, may occasion, to that immediate pleasure of which the source is in the
Eternal Beauty,” etc. Our author ennobles such theorizing by mounting up to the great I
Am.</p>

(Christ Himself is the one who is born, p. 337.)</p>
<p>Wordsworth, and many others of the learned, sustain our author’s comment on this
passage.2822 So Aquinas, ad loc., Bede, and many others. Methodius is incorrectly represented
as rejecting2823 the idea that “the woman” is the Blessed Virgin Mary, for no such idea existed
for him to reject. He rejects the idea that the man-child is Christ; but that idea was connected
with the supposition that the woman was the Church of the Hebrews bringing forth the
Messiah. Gregory the Great regards the woman as the Christian Church. So Hippolytus:2824
“By the woman…is meant most manifestly the Church, endued with the Father’s Word,
whose brightness is above the sun,” etc. Bossuet says candidly,2825 “C’est l’Église, tout
éclatante de la lumière de J. C.,” etc.</p>
<p>Now, note the progress of corruption, one fable engendering another. The text of Gen.
iii. 15, contrary to the Hebrew, the Seventy, the Syriac, and the Vulgate itself, in the best
mss., is made to read, “She shall bruise thy head,” etc. The “woman,” therefore, becomes the
Mother of our Lord, and the “great red dragon” (of verse 3), from which the woman “fled
into the wilderness,” is next represented as under her feet (where the moon appears in the
sacred narrative); and then the Immaculate Conception of her Holy Seed is transferred back

an “Immaculate Conception” when, in the ordinary process of nature, she was made the
mother of the Virgin. So, then, the bull Ineffabilis—comes forth, eighteen hundred years
after the event,2826 with the announcement that what thousands of saints and many bishops
of Rome have denounced as a fable must be received by all Christians on peril of eternal
damnation.2827 The worst of it all is the fact, that, as the mystery of the Incarnation of the
Son of God has heretofore been the only “Immaculate Conception” known to the faith of
Christendom, thousands now imagine that this is what was only so lately set forth, and what
we must therefore renounce as false.</p>

<head>Concerning Free-Will.2828</head>
<p>Orthodoxus. The old man of Ithaca, according to the legend of the Greeks, when he
wished to hear the song of the Sirens, on account of the charm of their voluptuous voice,
sailed to Sicily in bonds, and stopped up the ears of his companions; not that he grudged
them the hearing, or desired to load himself with bonds, but because the consequence of
those singers’ music to those who heard it was death. For such, in the opinion of the Greeks,
are the charms of the Sirens. Now I am not within hearing of any such song as this; nor have
I any desire to hear the Sirens who chant men’s dirges, and whose silence is more profitable
to men than their voice; but I pray to enjoy the pleasure of a divine voice, which, though it
be often beard, I long to hear again; not that I am overcome with the charm of a voluptuous
voice, but I am being taught divine mysteries, and expect as the result, not death but eternal
salvation. For the singers are not the deadly Sirens of the Greeks, but a divine choir of
prophets, with whom there is no need to stop the ears of one’s companions, nor to load
one’s-self with bonds, in fear of the penalty of hearing. For, in the one case, the hearer, with
the entrance of the voice, ceases to live; in the other, the more he hears, the better life will
he enjoy, being led onwards by a divine Spirit. Let every one come, then, and hear the divine
song without any fear. There are not with us the Sirens from the shore of Sicily, nor the
bonds of Ulysses, nor the wax poured melting into men’s ears; but a loosening of all bonds,
and liberty to listen to every one that approaches. For it is worthy of us to hear such a song
as this; and to hear such singers as these, seems to me to be a thing to be prayed for. But if
one wishes to hear the choir of the apostles as well, he will find the same harmony of song.
For the others sang beforehand the divine plan in a mystical manner; but these sing an interpretation
of what has been mystically announced by the former. Oh, concordant harmony,
composed by the Divine Spirit! Oh, the comeliness of those who sing of the mysteries of
God! Oh, that I also may join in these songs in my prayer. Let us then also sing the like song,
and raise the hymn to the Holy Father, glorifying in the Spirit Jesus, who is in His bosom.2829</p>
<p>Shun not, man, a spiritual hymn, nor be ill-disposed to listen to it. Death belongs not
to it; a story of salvation is our song. Already I seem to taste better enjoyments, as I discourse
on such subjects as these; and especially when there is before me such a flowering meadow,
that is to say, our assembly of those who unite in singing and hearing the divine mysteries.
Wherefore I dare to ask you to listen to me with ears free from all envy, without imitating

the jealousy of Cain,2830 or persecuting your brother, like Esau,2831 or approving the brethren
of Joseph,2832 because they hated their brother on account of his words; but differing far
from all these, insomuch that each of you is used to speak the mind of his neighbour. And,
on this account, there is no evil jealousy among you, as ye have undertaken to supply your
brother’s deficiencies. O noble audience, and venerable company, and spiritual food! That
I may ever have a right to share in such pleasures, be this my prayer!</p>
<p>Valentinian. As I was walking yesterday evening, my friend, along the shore of the sea,
and was gazing on it somewhat intently, I saw an extraordinary instance of divine power,
and a work of art produced by wise science, if at least such a thing may be called a work of
art. For as that verse of Homer2833 says,—
<lg>
<l>“As when two adverse winds blowing from Thrace,</l>
<l>Boreas and Zephyrus, the fishy deep</l>
<l>Vex sudden, all around, the sable flood</l>
<l>High curled, flings forth the salt weed on the shore;”—</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>So it seemed to me to have happened yesterday. For I saw waves very like mountaintops,
and, so to speak, reaching up to heaven itself. Whence I expected nothing else but that
the whole land would be deluged, and I began to form in my mind a place of escape, and a
Noah’s ark. But it was not as I thought; for, just as the sea rose to a crest, it broke up again
into itself, without overstepping its own limits, having, so to speak, a feeling of awe for a
divine decree.2834 And as oftentimes a servant, compelled by his master to do something
against his will, obeys the command through fear, while he dares not say a word of what he
suffers in his unwillingness to do it, but, full of rage, mutters to himself,—somewhat so it
appeared to me that the sea, as if enraged and confining its awe within itself, kept itself under,
as not willing to let its Master perceive its anger.</p>
<p>On these occurrences I began to gaze in silence, and wished to measure in my mind the
heaven and its sphere. I began to inquire whence it rises and where it sets; also what sort of
motion it had—whether a progressive one, that is to say, one from place to place, or a revolving
one; and, besides, how its movement is continued. And, of a truth, it seemed worth
while to inquire also about the sun,—what is the manner of his being set in the heaven; also
what is the orbit he traverses; also whither it is that, after a short time, he retires; and why
it is that even he does not go out of his proper course: but he, too, as one may say, is observing

a commandment of a higher power, and appears with us just when he is allowed to do so,
and departs as if he were called away.</p>
<p>So, as I was investigating these things, I saw that the sunshine was departing, and the
daylight failing, and that immediately darkness came on; and the sun was succeeded by the
moon, who, at her first rising, was not of full size, but after advancing in her course
presented a larger appearance. And I did not cease inquiring about her also, but examined
the cause of her waning and waxing, and why it is that she, too, observes the revolution of
days; and it seemed to me from all this that there is a divine government and power controlling
the whole, which we may justly call God.</p>
<p>And thereupon I began to praise the Creator, as I saw the earth fast fixed, and living
creatures in such variety, and the blossoms of plants with their many hues. But my mind
did not rest upon these things alone; but thereupon I began to inquire whence they have
their origin—whether from some source eternally co-existent with God, or from Himself
alone, none co-existing with Him; for that He has made nothing out of that which has no
existence appeared to me the right view to take, unless my reason were altogether untrustworthy.
For it is the nature of things which come into being to derive their origin from what
is already existing. And it seemed to me that it might be said with equal truth, that nothing
is eternally co-existent with God distinct from Himself, but that whatever exists has its origin
from Him, and I was persuaded of this also by the undeniable disposition of the elements,
and by the orderly arrangement of nature about them.</p>
<p>So, with some such thoughts of the fair order of things, I returned home. But on the
day following, that is today, as I came I saw two beings of the same race—I mean
men—striking and abusing one another; and another, again, wishing to strip his neighbour.
And now some began to venture upon a more terrible deed; for one stripped a corpse, and
exposed again to the light of day a body that had been once hidden in the earth, and treated
a form like his own with such insult as to leave the corpse to be food for dogs; while another
bared his sword, and attacked a man like himself. And he wanted to procure safety by flight;
but the other ceased not from pursuing, nor would control his anger. And why should I say
more? It is enough that he attacked him, and at once smote him with his sword. So the
wounded man became a suppliant to his fellow, and spread out his hands in supplication,
and was willing to give up his clothing, and only made a claim for life. But the other did not
subdue his anger, nor pity his fellowman, nor would he see his own image in the being before
him; but, like a wild beast, made preparations with his sword for feeding upon him. And
now he was even putting his mouth to the body so like his own, such was the extent of his
rage. And there was to be seen one man suffering injurious treatment, and another forthwith
stripping him, and not even covering with earth the body which he denuded of clothing.
But, in addition to these, there was another who, robbing others of their marriage rights,

<pb n="824"/>
wanted to insult his neighbour’s wife, and urged her to turn to unlawful embraces, not
wishing her husband to be father to a child of his own.</p>
<p>After that I began to believe the tragedies, and thought that the dinner of Thyestes had
really taken place; and believed in the unlawful lust of Oinomaos, nor doubted of the strife
in which brother drew the sword on brother.</p>
<p>So, after beholding such things as these, I began to inquire whence they arise, and what
is their origin, and who is the author of such devices against men, whence came their discovery,
and who is the teacher of them. Now to dare to say that God was the author of these
things was impossible; for surely it could not even be said that they have from Him their
substance, or their existence. For how were it possible to entertain these thoughts of God?
For He is good, and the Creator of what is excellent, and to Him belongs nothing bad. Nay,
it is His nature to take no pleasure in such things; but He forbids their production, and rejects
those who delight in them, but admits into His presence those who avoid them. And how
could it be anything but absurd to call God the maker of these things of which He disapproves?
For He would not wish them not to be, if He had first been their creator; and He
wishes those who approach Him to be imitators of Him.</p>
<p>Wherefore it seemed to me unreasonable to attribute these things to God, or to speak
of them as having sprung from Him; though it must certainly be granted that it is possible
for something to come into existence out of what has no existence, in case He made what
is evil. For He who brought them into existence out of non-existence would not reduce them
to the loss of it. And again, it must be said that there was once a time when God took
pleasure in evil things, which now is not the case. Wherefore it seems to me impossible to
say this of God. For it is unsuitable to His nature to attach this to Him. Wherefore it seemed
to me that there is co-existent with Him somewhat which has the name of matter, from
which He formed existing things, distinguishing between them with wise art, and arranging
them in a fair order, from which also evil things seem to have come into being. For as this
matter was without quality or form, and, besides this, was borne about without order, and
was untouched by divine art, God bore no grudge against it, nor left it to be continually thus
borne about, but began to work upon it, and wished to separate its best parts from its worst,
and thus made all that it was fitting for God to make out of it; but so much of it as was like
lees, so to speak, this being unfitted for being made into anything, He left as it was, since it
was of no use to Him; and from this it seems to me that what is evil has now streamed down
among men. This seemed to me the right view to take of these things. But, my friend, if you
think that anything I have said is wrong, mention it, for I exceedingly desire to hear about
these things.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. I appreciate your readiness, my friend, and applaud your zeal about the
subject; and as for the opinion which you have expressed respecting existing things, to the
effect that God made them out of some underlying substance, I do not altogether find fault

<pb n="825"/>
with it. For, truly, the origin of evil is a subject that has called out opinions from many
men.2835 Before you and me, no doubt, there have been many able men who have made the
most searching inquiry into the matter. And some of them expressed the same opinion as
you did, but others again represented God as the creator of these things, fearing to allow
the existence of substance as coeval with Him; while the former, from fear of saying that
God was the author of evil, thought fit to represent matter as coeval with Him.2836 And it
was the fate of both of these to fail to speak rightly on the subject, in consequence of their
fear of God not being in agreement with an accurate knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>But others declined to inquire about such a question at all, on the ground that such an
inquiry is endless. As for me, however, my connection with you in friendship does not allow
me to decline the subject of inquiry, especially when you announce your own purpose, that
you are not swayed by prejudice,—although you had your opinion about the condition of
things derived from your conjectures,—but say that you are confirmed in a desire of
knowing the truth.</p>
<p>Wherefore I will willingly turn to the discussion of the question. But I wish this companion
of mine here to listen to our conversation.2837 For, indeed, he seems to have much the
same opinions about these things as you have, wherefore I wish that you should both have
a share in the discussion. For whatever I should say to you, situated as you are, I shall say
just as much to him. If, then, you are indulgent enough to think I speak truly on this great
subject, give an answer to each question I ask; for the result of this will be that you will gain
a knowledge of the truth, and I shall not carry on my discussion with you at random.</p>
<p>Valentinian. I am ready to do as you say; and therefore be quite ready to ask those
questions from which you think I may be able to gain an accurate knowledge of this important
subject. For the object which I have set before myself is not the base one of gaining a victory,
but that of becoming thoroughly acquainted with the truth. Wherefore apply yourself to
the rest of the discussion.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Well, then, I do not suppose you are ignorant that it is impossible for two
uncreated things to exist together, although you seem to have expressed nearly as much as
this in an earlier part of the conversation. Assuredly we must of necessity say one of two
things: either that God is separate from matter, or, on the other hand, that He is inseparable

from it. If, then, one would say that they are united, he will say that that which is uncreated
is one only, for each of the things spoken of will be a part of the other; and as they are parts
of each other, there will not be two uncreated things, but one composed of different elements.
For we do not, because a man has different members, break him up into many beings. But,
as the demands of reason require, we say that a single being, man, of many parts, has been
created by God. So it is necessary, if God be not separate from matter, to say that that which
is uncreated is one only; but if one shall say that He is separate, there must necessarily be
something intermediate between the two, which makes their separation evident. For it is
impossible to estimate the distance of one thing from another, unless there be something
else with which the distance between them may be compared. And this holds good, not only
as far as the instance before us, but also to any number of others. For the argument which
we advanced in the case of two uncreated things would of necessity be of equal force, were
the uncreated things granted to be three in number. For I should ask also respecting them,
whether they are separate from each other, or, on the other hand, are united each to its
neighbour. For if any one resolve to say that they are united, he will be told the same as before;
if, again, that they are separate, he will not escape the necessary existence of that which
separates them.</p>
<p>If, then, any one were to say that there is a third account which might fitly be given of
uncreated things, namely, that neither is God separate from matter, nor, again, are they
united as part of a whole; but that God is locally situate in matter, and matter in God, he
must be told as the consequence,2838 that if we say that God is placed in matter, we must of
necessity say that He is contained within limits, and circumscribed by matter. But then He
must, equally with matter, be carried about without order. And that He rests not, nor remains
by Himself, is a necessary result of that in which He is being carried, now this way, and now
that. And besides this, we must say that God was in worse case still.</p>
<p>For if matter were once without order, and He, determining to change it for the better,
put it into order, there was a time when God was in that which had no order. And I might
fairly ask this question also, whether God filled matter completely, or existed in some part
of it. For if one resolve to say that God was in some part of matter, how far smaller than
matter does he make Him; that is, if a part of it contained God altogether. But if he were to
say that He is in all of it, and is extended through the whole of matter, he must tell us how
He wrought upon it. For we must say that there was a sort of contraction of God, which
being effected, He wrought upon that from which He was withdrawn, or else that He wrought
in union with matter, without having a place of withdrawal. But if any one say that matter
is in God, there is equal need of inquiry, namely, whether it is by His being separated from
Himself, and as creatures exist in the air, by His being divided and parted for the reception
<note type="footnote">2838 Jahn’s reading is here followed.</note>

<pb n="827"/>
of the beings that are in Him; or whether it is locally situated, that is to say, as water in land;
for if we were to say, as in the air, we must say that God is divisible; but if, as water in
earth,—since matter was without order and arrangement, and besides, contained what was
evil,—we must say, that in God were to be found the disorderly and the evil. Now this seems
to me an unbecoming conclusion, nay, more a dangerous one. For you wish for the existence
of matter, that you may avoid saying that God is the author of evil; and, determining to
avoid this, you say that He is the receptacle of evil.</p>
<p>If, then, under the supposition that matter is separate from created substances, you had
said that it is uncreated, I should have said much about it, to prove that it is impossible for
it to be uncreated; but since you say that the question of the origin of evil is the cause of this
supposition, it therefore seems to me right to proceed to inquire into this. For when it is
clearly stated how evil exists, and that it is not possible to say that God is the cause of evil,
because of matter being subject to Him, it seems to me to destroy such a supposition, to
remark, that if God created the qualities which did not exist, He equally created the substances.
2839</p>
<p>Do you say then, that there co-exists with God matter without qualities out of which
He formed the beginning of this world?</p>
<p>Valentinian. So I think.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. If, then, matter had no qualities, and the world were produced by God,
and qualities exist in the world, then God is the maker of qualities?</p>
<p>Valentinian. It is so.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Now, as I heard you say some time ago that it is impossible for anything
to come into being out of that which has no existence, answer my question: Do you think
that the qualities of the world were not produced out of any existing qualities?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. And that they are something distinct from substances?</p>
<p>Valentinian. Yes.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. If, then, qualities were neither made by God out of any ready at hand, nor
derive their existence from substances, because they are not substances, we must say that
they were produced by God out of what had no existence. Wherefore I thought you spoke
extravagantly in saying that it was impossible to suppose that anything was produced by
God out of what did not exist.</p>
<p>But let our discussion of this matter stand thus. For truly we see among ourselves men
making things out of what does not exist, although they seem for the most part to be making
them with something. As, for instance, we may have an example in the case of architects;
for they truly do not make cities out of cities, nor in like manner temples out of temples.2840</p>
<note type="footnote">2839 The text is here in an uncertain state. Cf. Migne and Jahn.</note>
<note type="footnote">2840 Imperfect. The rest from the Bibliotheca of Photius.</note>

<pb n="828"/>
<p>But if, because substances underlie these things, you think that the builders make them
out of what does exist, you are mistaken in your calculation. For it is not the substance which
makes the city or the temples, but art applied to substance. And this art is not produced out
of some art which lies in the substances themselves, but from that which is not in them.</p>
<p>But you seem likely to meet me with this argument: that the artificer makes the art which
is connected with the substance out of the art which he has. Now I think it is a good reply
to this to say, that in man it is not produced from any art lying beneath; for it is not to be
granted that substance by itself is art. For art is in the class of accidents, and is one of the
things that have an existence only when they are employed about some substance. For man
will exist even without the art of building, but it will have no existence unless man be previously
in being. Whence we must say that it is in the nature of things for arts to be produced
in men out of what has no existence. If, then, we have shown that this is so in the case of
men, why was it improper to say that God is able to make not only qualities, but also substances,
out of that which has no existence? For as it appears possible for something to be
produced out of what exists not, it is evident that this is the case with substances. To return
to the question of evil. Do you think evil comes under the head of substances, or of qualities
of substances?</p>
<p>Valentinian. Of qualities.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. But matter was found to be without quality or form?</p>
<p>Valentinian. It was.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Well, then, the connection of these names with substance is owing to its
accidents. For murder is not a substance, nor is any other evil; but the substance receives a
cognate name from putting it into practice. For a man is not (spoken of as) murder, but by
committing it he receives the derived name of murderer, without being himself murder;
and, to speak concisely, no other evil is a substance; but by practising any evil, it can be
called evil. Similarly consider, if you imagine anything else to be the cause of evil to men,
that it too is evil by reason of its acting by them, and suggesting the committal of evil. For
a man is evil in consequence of his actions. For he is said to be evil, because he is the doer
of evil. Now what a man does, is not the man himself, but his activity, and it is from his actions
that he receives the title of evil. For if we were to say that he is that which he does, and
he commits murders, adulteries, and such-like, he will be all these. Now if he is these, then
when they are produced he has an existence, but when they are not, he too ceases to be.
Now these things are produced by men. Men then will be the authors of them, and the causes
of their existing or not existing. But if each man is evil in consequence of what he practises,
and what he practises has an origin, he also made a beginning in evil, and evil too had a
beginning. Now if this is the case, no one is without a beginning in evil, nor are evil things
without an origin.</p>

<pb n="829"/>
<p>Valentinian. Well, my friend, you seem to me to have argued sufficiently against the
other side. For you appeared to draw right conclusions from the premises which we granted
to the discussion. For truly if matter is without qualities, then God is the maker of qualities;
and if evils are qualities, God will be the author of evils. But it seems to me false to say that
matter is without qualities; for it cannot be said respecting any substance that it is without
qualities. But indeed, in the very act of saying that it is without qualities, you declare that it
has a quality, by describing the character of matter, which is a kind of quality. Therefore, if
you please, begin the discussion from the beginning; for it seems to me that matter never
began to have qualities. For such being the case, I assert, my friend, that evil arises from its
emanation.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. If matter were possessed of qualities from eternity, of what will God be
the creator? For if we say substances, we speak of them as pre-existing; if, again, we say
qualities, these too are declared to have an existence. Since, then, both substances and
qualities exist, it seems to me superfluous to call God a creator. But answer me a question.
In what way do you say that God was a creator? Was it by changing the existence of those
substances into non-existence, or by changing the qualities while He preserved the substances?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I think that there was no change of the substances, but only of the qualities;
and in respect to these we call God a creator. And just as if one might chance to say that a
house was made of stones, it cannot be said of them that they do not still continue stones
in substance, because they are called a house; for I affirm that the house is made by the
quality of construction. So I think that God, while substance remained, produced a change
of its qualities, by reason of which I say that this world was made by God.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Do you think, too, that evil is among the qualities of substances?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. And were these qualities in matter from the first, or had they a beginning?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I say that these qualities were eternally co-existent with matter.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. But do you not say that God has made a change in the qualities?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do say this.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. For the better?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I think so.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. If, then, evil is among the qualities of matter, and its qualities were changed
by God for the better, the inquiry must be made whence evil arose. For either all of them,
being evil, underwent a change for the better, or some of them being evil, and some not, the
evil ones were not changed for the better; but the rest, as far as they were found superior,
were changed by God for the sake of order.</p>
<p>Valentinian. That is the opinion I held from the beginning.</p>

<pb n="830"/>
<p>Orthodoxus. How, then, do you say it was that He left the qualities of evil as they were?
Was it that He was able to do away with them, or that, though He wished to do so, He was
unable? For if you say that He was able, but disinclined to do so, He must be the author of
these things; because, while He had power to bring evil to an end, He allowed it to remain
as it was, especially when He had begun to work upon matter. For if He had had nothing at
all to do with matter, He would not have been the author of what He allowed to remain.
But since He works upon a part of it, and leaves a part of it to itself, while He has power to
change it for the better, I think He is the author of evil, since He left part of matter in its
vileness. He wrought then for the ruin of a part; and, in this respect, it seems to me that this
part was chiefly injured by His arranging it in matter, so that it became partaker of evil. For
before matter was put in order, it was without the perception of evil; but now each of its
parts has the capacity of perceiving evil. Now, take an example in the case of man. Previously
to becoming a living creature, he was insensible to evil; but from the time when he is fashioned
by God into the form of man, he gains the perception of approaching evil. So this act
of God, which you say was done for the benefit of matter, is found to have happened to it
rather for the worse. But if you say that God was not able to stop evil, does the impossibility
result from His being naturally weak, or from His being overcome by fear, and in subjection
to some more powerful being? See which of these you would like to attribute to the almighty
and good God. But, again, answer me about matter. Is matter simple or compound? For if
matter be simple and uniform, and the universe compound, and composed of different
substances, it is impossible to say that it is made of matter, because compound things cannot
be composed of one pure and simple ingredient. For composition indicates the mixture of
several simple things. But if, on the other hand, you say that matter is compound, it has
been entirely composed of simple elements, and they were once each separately simple, and
by their composition matter was produced; for compound things derive their composition
from simple things. So there was once a time when matter did not exist—that is to say, before
the combination of the simple elements. But if there was once a time when matter did not
exist, and there was never a time when what is uncreated did not exist, then matter is not
uncreated. And from this it follows that there are many things which are uncreated. For if
God were uncreated, and the simple elements of which matter was composed were uncreated,
the number of the uncreated would be more than two. But to omit inquiring what are the
simple elements, matter or form—for this would be followed by many absurdities—let me
ask, do you think that nothing that exists is contrary to itself?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Yet water is contrary to fire, and darkness to light, and heat to cold, and
moisture to dryness.</p>
<p>Valentinian. I think it is.</p>

<pb n="831"/>
<p>Orthodoxus. If, then, nothing that exists is contrary to itself, and these are contrary to
one another, they will not be one and the same matter—no, nor formed from one and the
same matter. But, again, I wish to ask, do you think that the parts of a thing are not destructive
of one another?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. And that fire and water, and the rest likewise, are parts of matter?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I hold them to be so.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Why, then, do you not think that water is destructive of fire, and light of
darkness, and so on with the rest?</p>
<p>Valentinian. I do.</p>
<p>Orthodoxus. Then, if parts of a thing are not destructive of one another, and these are
found to be so, they will not be parts of the same thing. But if they are not parts of the same
thing, they will not be parts of one and the same matter. And, indeed, they will not be matter
either, because nothing that exists is destructive of itself. And this being the case with the
contraries, it is shown that they are not matter. This is enough on the subject of matter.</p>
<p>Now we must come to the examination of evils, and must necessarily inquire into the
evils among men. As to these, are they forms of the principle of evil, or parts of it? If forms,
evil will not have a separate existence distinct from them, because the species are to be sought
for in the forms, and underlie them. But if this is the case, evil has an origin. For its forms
are shown to have an origin—such as murder, and adultery, and the like. But if you will
have them to be parts of some principle of evil, and they have an origin, it also must have
an origin. For those things whose parts have an origin, are of necessity originated likewise.
For the whole consists of parts. And the whole will not exist if the parts do not, though there
may be some parts, even if the whole be not there.</p>
<p>Now there is nothing existing of which one part is originated, and another part not. But
if I were even to grant this, then there was a time when evil was not complete, namely, before
matter was wrought by God. And it attains completeness when man is produced by God;
for man is the maker of the parts of evil. And from this it follows that the cause of evil being
complete, is God the Creator, which it is impious to say. But if you say that evil is neither
of the things supposed, but is the doing of something evil, you declare that it has an origin.
For the doing of a thing makes the beginning of its existence. And besides this, you have
nothing further to pronounce evil. For what other action have you to point out as such, except
what happens among men? Now, it has been already shown that he who acts is not evil according
to his being, but in accordance with his evil doing.</p>
<p>Because there is nothing evil by nature, but it is by use that evil things become such. So
I say, says he, that man was made with a free-will, not as if there were already evil in existence,
which he had the power of choosing if he wished, but on account of his capacity of obeying
or disobeying God.</p>

<pb n="832"/>
<p>For this was the meaning of the gift of Free Will. And man after his creation receives a
commandment from God; and from this at once rises evil, for he does not obey the divine
command; and this alone is evil, namely, disobedience, which had a beginning.</p>
<p>For man2841 received power, and enslaved himself, not because he was overpowered
by the irresistible tendencies of his nature, nor because the capacity with which he was gifted
deprived him of what was better for him; for it was for the sake of this that I say he was endowed
with it (but he received the power above mentioned), in order that he may obtain
an addition to what he already possesses, which accrues to him from the Superior Being in
consequence of his obedience, and is demanded as a debt from his Maker. For I say that
man was made not for destruction, but for better things. For if he were made as any of the
elements, or those things which render a similar service to God, he would cease to receive
a reward befitting deliberate choice, and would be like an instrument of the maker; and it
would be unreasonable for him to suffer blame for his wrong-doings, for the real author of
them is the one by whom he is used. But man did not understand better things, since he did
not know the author (of his existence), but only the object for which he was made. I say
therefore that God, purposing thus to honour man, and to grant him an understanding of
better things, has given him the power of being able to do what he wishes, and commends
the employment of his power for better things; not that He deprives him again of free-will,
but wishes to point out the better way. For the power is present with him, and he receives
the commandment; but God exhorts him to turn his power of choice to better things. For
as a father exhorts his son, who has power to learn his lessons, to give more attention to
them inasmuch as, while he points out this as the better course, he does not deprive his son
of the power which he possessed, even if he be not inclined to learn willingly; so I do not
think that God, while He urges on man to obey His commands, deprives him of the power
of purposing and withholding obedience. For He points out the cause of His giving this
advice, in that He does not deprive him of the power. But He gives commands, in order that
man may be able to enjoy better things. For this is the consequence of obeying the commands
of God. So that He does not give commands in order to take away the power which He has
given, but in order that a better gift may be bestowed, as to one worthy of attaining greater
things, in return for his having rendered obedience to God, while he had power to withhold
it. I say that man was made with free-will, not as if there were already existing some evil,

<pb n="833"/>
which he had the power of choosing if he wished,…but that the power of obeying and disobeying
God is the only cause.2842</p>
<p>For this was the object to be obtained by free-will. And man after his creation receives
a commandment from God, and from this at once rises evil; for he does not obey the divine
command, and this alone is evil, namely, disobedience, which had a beginning. For no one
has it in his power to say that it is without an origin, when its author had an origin. But you
will be sure to ask whence arose this disobedience. It is clearly recorded in Holy Scripture,
by which I am enabled to say that man was not made by God in this condition, but that he
has come to it by some teaching. For man did not receive such a nature as this. For if it were
the case that his nature was such, this would not have come upon him by teaching. Now
one says in Holy Writ, that “man has learnt (evil).”2843 I say, then, that disobedience to God
is taught. For this alone is evil which is produced in opposition to the purpose of God, for
man would not learn evil by itself. He, then, who teaches evil is the Serpent.</p>
<p>For my part, I said that the beginning of evil was envy, and that it arose from man’s
being distinguished by God with higher honour. Now evil is disobedience to the commandment
of God.</p>

<p>I. God did not make evil,2845 nor is He at all in any way the author of evil; but whatever
failed to keep the law, which He in all justice ordained, after being made by Him with the
faculty of free-will, for the purpose of guarding and keeping it, is called evil. Now it is the
gravest fault to disobey God, by overstepping the bounds of that righteousness which is
consistent with free-will.</p>
<p>II. Now the question has already been raised,2846 and answered,2847 that the “coats of
skins”2848 are not bodies. Nevertheless, let us speak of it again, for it is not enough to have
mentioned it once. Before the preparation of these coats of skins, the first man himself acknowledges
that he has both bones and flesh; for when he saw the woman brought to him:
“This is now,” he cried,2849 “bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.” And again: She shall
be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.2850 For this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.”
For I cannot endure the trifling of some who shamelessly do violence to Scripture, in order
that their opinion, that the resurrection is without flesh, may find support; supposing rational
bones and flesh, and in different ways changing it backwards and forwards by allegorizing.
And Christ confirms the taking of these things as they are written, when, to the question of
the Pharisees about putting away a wife, He answers: “Have ye not read that He which made
them at the beginning made them male and female; and said, For this cause shall a man
leave his father,”2851 and so on.</p>
<p>III. But it is evidently absurd to think that the body will not co-exist with the soul in the
eternal state, because it is a bond and fetters; in order that, according to their view, we who
are to live in the kingdom of light may not be for ever condemned to be bondmen of corruption.
For as the question has been sufficiently solved, and the statement refitted in which

they defined the flesh to be the soul’s chain, the argument also is destroyed, that the flesh
will not rise again, lest, if we resume it, we be prisoners in the kingdom of light.</p>
<p>IV. In order, then, that man might not be an undying or ever-living evil, as would have
been the case if sin were dominant within him, as it had sprung up in an immortal body,
and was provided with immortal sustenance, God for this cause pronounced him mortal,
and clothed him with mortality. For this is what was meant by the coats of skins, in order
that, by the dissolution of the body, sin might be altogether destroyed from the very roots,
that there might not be left even the smallest particle of root from which new shoots of sin
might again burst forth.</p>
<p>V. For as a fig-tree, which has grown in the splendid buildings2852 of a temple, and has
reached a great size, and is spread over all the joints of the stones with thickly-branching
roots, ceases not to grow, till, by the loosening of the stones from the place in which it sprung
up, it is altogether torn away; for it is possible for the stones to be fitted into their own places,
when the fig tree is taken away, so that the temple may be preserved, having no longer to
support what was the cause of its own destruction; while the fig-tree, torn away by the roots,
dies; in the same way also, God, the builder, checked by the seasonable application of death,
His own temple, man, when he had fostered sin, like a wild fig-tree, “killing,”2853 in the
words of Scripture, “and making alive,” in order that the flesh, after sin is withered and dead,
may, like a restored temple, be raised up again with the same parts, uninjured and immortal,
while sin is utterly and entirely destroyed. For while the body still lives, before it has passed
through death, sin must also live with it, as it has its roots concealed within us even though
it be externally checked by the wounds inflicted by corrections and warnings; since, otherwise,
it would not happen that we do wrong after baptism, as we should be entirely and absolutely
free from sin. But now, even after believing, and after the time of being touched by the water
of sanctification, we are oftentimes found in sin. For no one can boast of being so free from
sin as not even to have an evil thought. So that it is come to pass that sin is now restrained
and lulled to sleep by faith, so that it does not produce injurious fruits, but yet is not torn
up by the roots. For the present we restrain its sprouts, such as evil imaginations, “lest any
root of bitterness springing up trouble”2854 us, not suffering its leaves to unclose and open
into shoots; while the Word, like an axe, cuts at its roots which grow below. But hereafter
the very thought of evil will disappear.</p>
<p>VI. But come now, since there is need of many examples in matters of this kind, let us
examine them particularly from this point of view, without desisting till our argument ends
in clearer explanation and proof. It appears, then, as if an eminent craftsman were to cast

<pb n="836"/>
over again a noble image, wrought by himself of gold or other material, and beautifully
proportioned in all its members, upon his suddenly perceiving that it had been mutilated
by some infamous man, who, too envious to endure the image being beautiful, spoiled it,
and thus enjoyed the empty pleasure of indulged jealousy. For take notice, most wise
Aglaophon, that, if the artificer wish that that upon which he has bestowed so much pains
and care and labour, shall be quite free from injury, he will be impelled to melt it down, and
restore it to its former condition. But if he should not cast it afresh, nor reconstruct it, but
allow it to remain as it is, repairing and restoring it, it must be that the image, being passed
through the fire and forged, cannot any longer be preserved unchanged, but will be altered
and wasted. Wherefore, if he should wish it to be perfectly beautiful and faultless, it must
be broken up and recast, in order that all the disfigurements and mutilations inflicted upon
it by treachery and envy, may be got rid of by the breaking up and recasting of it, while the
image is restored again uninjured and unalloyed to the same form as before, and made as
like itself as possible. For it is impossible for an image under the hands of the original artist
to be lost, even if it be melted down again, for it may be restored; but it is possible for
blemishes and injuries to be put off, for they melt away and cannot be restored; because in
every work of art the best craftsman looks not for blemish or failure, but for symmetry and
correctness in his work. Now God’s plan seems to me to have been the same as that which
prevails among ourselves. For seeing man, His fairest work, corrupted by envious treachery,
He could not endure, with His love for man, to leave him in such a condition, lest he should
be for ever faulty, and bear the blame to eternity; but dissolved him again into his original
materials, in order that, by remodelling, all the blemishes in him might waste away and
disappear. For the melting down of the statue in the former case corresponds to the death
and dissolution of the body in the latter, and the remoulding of the material in the former,
to the resurrection after death in the latter; as also saith the prophet Jeremiah, for he addresses
the Jews in these words, “And I went down to the potter’s house; and, behold, he wrought
a work upon the stones. And the vessel which he made in his hands was broken; and again
he made another vessel, as it pleased him to make it. And the word of the Lord came to me,
saying, Cannot I do to you as this potter, O house of Israel? Behold, as the clay of the potter
are ye in my hands.”2855</p>
<p>VII. For I call your attention to this, that, as I said, after man’s transgression the Great
Hand was not content to leave as a trophy of victory its own work, debased by the Evil One,
who wickedly injured it from motives of envy; but moistened and reduced it to clay, as a
potter breaks up a vessel, that by the remodelling of it all the blemishes and bruises in it may
disappear, and it may be made afresh faultless and pleasing.</p>

<p>VIII. But it is not satisfactory to say that the universe will be utterly destroyed, and sea
and air and sky will be no longer. For the whole world will be deluged with fire from heaven,
and burnt for the purpose of purification and renewal; it will not, however, come to complete
ruin and corruption. For if it were better for the world not to be than to be, why did God,
in making the world, take the worse course? But God did not work in vain, or do that which
was worst. God therefore ordered the creation with a view to its existence and continuance,
as also the Book of Wisdom confirms, saying, “For God created all things that they might
have their being; and the generations of the world were healthful, and there is no poison of
destruction in them.”2856 And Paul clearly testifies this, saying, “For the earnest expectation
of the creature2857 waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature2858
was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that subjected the same in
hope: because the creature2859 itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the children of God.”2860 For the creation was made subject to
vanity, he says, and he expects that it will be set free from such servitude, as he intends to
call this world by the name of creation. For it is not what is unseen but what is seen that is
subject to corruption. The creation, then, after being restored to a better and more seemly
state, remains, rejoicing and exulting over the children of God at the resurrection; for whose
sake it now groans and travails,2861 waiting itself also for our redemption from the corruption
of the body, that, when we have risen and shaken off the mortality of the flesh, according
to that which is written, “Shake off the dust, and arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem,”2862 and
have been set free from sin, it also shall be freed from corruption and be subject no longer
to vanity, but to righteousness. Isaiah says, too, “For as the new heaven and the new earth
which I make, remaineth before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name be;”2863
and again, “Thus saith the Lord that created the heaven, it is He who prepared the earth and
created it, He determined it; He created it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited.”2864
For in reality God did not establish the universe in vain, or to no purpose but destruction,
as those weak-minded men say, but to exist, and be inhabited, and continue. Wherefore the
earth and the heaven must exist again after the conflagration and shaking of all things.</p>

<p>IX. But if our opponents say, How then is it, if the universe be not destroyed, that the
Lord says that “heaven and earth shall pass away;”2865 and the prophet, that “the heaven
shall perish as smoke, and the earth shall grow old as a garment;”2866 we answer, because
it is usual for the Scriptures to call the change of the world from its present condition to a
better and more glorious one, destruction; as its earlier form is lost in the change of all things
to a state of greater splendour; for there is no contradiction nor absurdity in the Holy
Scriptures. For not “the world” but the “fashion of this world” passeth away,2867 it is said;
so it is usual for the Scriptures to call the change from an earlier form to a better and more
comely state, destruction; just as when one calls by the name of destruction the change from
a childish form into a perfect man, as the stature of the child is turned into manly size and
beauty. We may expect that the creation will pass away, as if it were to perish in the burning,
in order that it may be renewed, not however that it will be destroyed, that we who are renewed
may dwell in a renewed world without taste of sorrow; according as it is said, “When
Thou lettest Thy breath go forth, they shall be made, and Thou shalt renew the face of the
earth;”2868 God henceforth providing for the due temperature of that which surrounds it.
For as the earth is to exist after the present age,2869 there must be by all means inhabitants
for it, who shall no longer be liable to death, nor shall marry, nor beget children, but live in
all happiness, like the angels, without change or decay. Wherefore it is silly to discuss in
what way of life our bodies will then exist, if there is no longer air, nor earth, nor anything
else.</p>
<p>X. But in addition to what has been said, there is this point worth consideration, since
it misleads very much, if we may be outspoken about matters of such importance, Aglaophon.
For you said that the Lord declared plainly2870 that those who shall obtain the resurrection
shall then be as the angels.2871 You brought this objection: The angels, being without flesh,
are on this account in the utmost happiness and glory. We must then, as we are to be made
equal to the angels, be like them stripped of flesh, and be angels. But you overlooked this,
my excellent friend, that He who created and set in order the universe out of nothing, ordained
the nature of immortal beings to be distributed not only among angels and ministers,
but also among principalities, and thrones, and powers. For the race of angels is one, and
that of principalities and powers another; because immortal beings are not all of one order,

and constitution, and tribe, and family, but there are differences of race and tribe. And
neither do the cherubim, departing from their own nature, assume the form of angels; nor,
again, do angels assume the form of the others. For they cannot be anything but what they
are and have been made. Moreover, man also having been appointed by the original order
of things to inhabit the world, and to rule over all that is in it, when he is immortal, will
never be changed from being a man into the form either of angels or any other; for neither
do angels undergo a change from their original form to another. For Christ at His coming
did not proclaim that the human nature should, when it is immortal, be remoulded or
transformed into another nature, but into what it was before the fall. For each one among
created things must remain in its own proper place, that none may be wanting to any, but
all may be full: heaven of angels, thrones of powers, luminaries of ministers; and the more
divine spots, and the undefiled and untainted luminaries, with seraphim, who attend the
Supreme Council, and uphold the universe; and the world of men. For if we granted that
men are changed into angels, it would follow that we say that angels also are changed into
powers, and these into one thing and the other, until our argument proceed too far for safety.</p>
<p>XI. Neither did God, as if He had made man badly, or committed a mistake in the
formation of him, determine afterwards to make an angel, repenting of His work, as the
worst of craftsmen do; nor did He fashion man, after He had wished originally to make an
angel, and failed; for this would be a sign of weakness, etc. Why even then did He make man
and not angels, if He wished men to be angels and not men? Was it because He was unable?
It is blasphemy to suppose so. Or was He so busy in making the worse as to loiter about the
better? This too is absurd. For He does not fail in making what is good, nor defers it, nor is
incapable of it; but He has the power to act how and when He pleases, inasmuch as He is
Himself power. Wherefore it was because He intended man to be man, that He originally
made him so. But if He so intended—since He intends what is good—man is good. Now
man is said to be composed of soul and body; he cannot then exist without a body, but with
a body, unless there be produced another man besides man. For all the orders of immortal
beings must be preserved by God, and among these is man. “For,” says the Book of Wisdom,
“God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.”2872
The body then perishes not; for man is composed of soul and body.</p>
<p>XII. Wherefore observe that these are the very things which the Lord wished to teach
to the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection of the flesh. For this was the
opinion of the Sadducees. Whence it was that, having contrived the parable about the woman
and the seven brethren, that they might cast doubt upon the resurrection of the flesh, “There
came to Him,”2873 it is said, “the Sadducees also, who say that there is no resurrection.”

Christ, then, if there had been no resurrection of the flesh, but the soul only were saved,
would have agreed with their opinion as a right and excellent one. But as it was, He answered
and said, “In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the
angels in heaven,”2874 not on account of having no flesh, but of not marrying nor being
married, but being henceforth incorruptible. And He speaks of our being near the angels
in this respect, that as the angels in heaven, so we also in paradise, spend our time no more
in marriage-feasts or other festivities. but in seeing God and cultivating life, under the direction
of Christ. For He did not say “they shall be angels,” but like angels, in being, for instance,
crowned, as it is written, with glory and honour; differing a little from the angels,2875
while near to being angels. Just as if He had said, while observing the fair order of the sky,
and the stillness of the night, and everything illumined by the heavenly light of the moon,
“the moon shines like the sun.” We should not then say that He asserted that the moon was
absolutely the sun, but like the sun. As also that which is not gold, but approaching the
nature of gold, is said not to be gold, but to be like gold. But if it were gold, it would be said
to be, and not to be like, gold. But since it is not gold, but approaching to the nature of it,
and has the appearance of it, it is said to be like gold; so also when He says that the saints
shall. in the resurrection be like the angels, we do not understand Him to assert that they
will then be actually angels, but approaching to the condition of angels. So that it is most
unreasonable to say, “Since Christ declared that the saints in the resurrection appear as angels,
therefore their bodies do not rise,” although the very words employed give a clear proof of
the real state of the case. For the term “resurrection” is not applied to that which has not
fallen, but to that which has fallen and rises again; as when the prophet says, “I will also raise
up again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down.”2876 Now the much-desired tabernacle
of the soul is fallen, and sunk down into “the dust of the earth.”2877 For it is not that
which is not dead, but that which is dead, that is laid down. But it is the flesh which dies;
the soul is immortal. So, then, if the soul be immortal, and the body be the corpse, those
who say that there is a resurrection, but not of the flesh, deny any resurrection; because it
is not that which remains standing, but that which has fallen2878 and been laid down, that
is set up; according to that which is written, “Does not he who falls rise again, and he who
turns aside return?”2879</p>

<p>XIII. Since flesh was made to border on incorruption and corruption, being itself neither
the one nor the other, and was overcome by corruption for the sake of pleasure, though it
was the work and property of incorruption; therefore it became corruptible, and was laid
in the dust of the earth. When, then, it was overcome by corruption, and delivered over to
death through disobedience, God did not leave it to corruption to be triumphed over as an
inheritance; but, after conquering death by the resurrection, delivered it again to incorruption,
in order that corruption might not receive the property of incorruption, but incorruption
that of corruption. Therefore the apostle answers thus, “For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”2880 Now the corruptible and
mortal putting on immortality, what else is it but that which is “sown in corruption and
raised in incorruption,”2881—for the soul is not corruptible or mortal; but this which is
mortal and corrupting is of flesh,—in order that, “as we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly?”2882 For the image of the earthy which we have
borne is this, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”2883 But the image of the
heavenly is the resurrection from the dead, and incorruption, in order that “as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of
life.”2884 But if any one were to think that the earthy image is the flesh itself, but the heavenly
image some other spiritual body besides the flesh; let him first consider that Christ, the
heavenly man, when He appeared, bore the same form of limbs and the same image of flesh
as ours, through which also He, who was not man, became man, that “as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”2885 For if He bore flesh for any other reason than
that of setting the flesh free, and raising it up, why did He bear flesh superfluously, as He
purposed neither to save it, nor to raise it up? But the Son of God does nothing superfluously.
He did not then take the form of a servant uselessly, but to raise it up and save it. For He
truly was made man, and died, and not in mere appearance, but that He might truly be
shown to be the first begotten from the dead, changing the earthy into the heavenly, and
the mortal into the immortal. When, then, Paul says that “flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God,”2886 he does not give a disparaging opinion of the regeneration of the
flesh, but would teach that the kingdom of God, which is eternal life, is not possessed by the
body, but the body by the life. For if the kingdom of God, which is life, were possessed by

the body, it would happen that the life would be consumed by corruption. But now the life
possesses what is dying, in order that “death may be swallowed up in victory”2887 by life,
and the corruptible may be seen to be the possession of incorruption and immortality, while
it becomes unbound and free from death and sin, but the slave and servant of immortality;
so that the body may be the possession of incorruption, and not incorruption that of the
body.</p>
<p>XIV. If, then, out of such a drop, small, and previously without any existence, in its actual
state of moistness, contractedness, and insignificance, in fact out of nothing, man is
brought into being, how much rather shall man spring again into being out of a previously
existing man? For it is not so difficult to make anything anew after it has once existed and
fallen into decay, as to produce out of nothing that which has never existed. Now, in case
we choose to exhibit the seminal fluid discharged from a man, and place by it a corpse, each
by itself, which of them, as they both lie exposed to view, will the spectators think most likely
to become a man—that drop, which is nothing at all, or that which has already shape, and
size, and substance? For if the very thing which is nothing at all, merely because God pleases,
becomes a man, how much rather shall that which has existence and is brought to perfection
become again a man, if God pleases? For what was the purpose of the theologian Moses, in
introducing, under a mystical sense, the Feast of Tabernacles in the Book of Leviticus? Was
it that we may keep a feast to God, as the Jews with their low view of the Scriptures interpret
it? as if God took pleasure in such tabernacles, decked out with fruits and boughs and leaves,
which immediately wither and lose their verdure. We cannot say so. Tell me, then, what
was the object of the Feast of Tabernacles? It was introduced to point to this real tabernacle
of ours, which, after it was fallen down to corruption through the transgression of the law,
and broken up by sin, God promised to put together again, and to raise up in incorruptibility,
in order that we may truly celebrate in His honour the great and renowned Feast of Tabernacles
at the resurrection; when our tabernacles are put together in the perfect order of immortality
and harmony, and raised up from the dust in incorruption; when the dry bones,2888
according to the most true prophecy, shall hear a voice, and be brought to their joints by
God, the Creator and Perfect Artificer, who will then renew the flesh and bind it on, no
more with such ties as those by which it was at first held together, but by such as shall be
for ever undecaying and indissoluble. For I once saw2889 on Olympus, which is a mountain
of Lycia, fire bursting up from the ground spontaneously on the summit of the mountain;
and by it was standing an Agnos tree, so flourishing, green, and shady, that one might suppose

<pb n="843"/>
a never-failing stream of water had nourished its growth, rather than what was really the
case. For which cause, therefore, though the natures of things are corruptible, and their
bodies consumed by fire, and it is impossible for things which are once of an inflammable
nature to remain unaffected by fire; yet this tree, so far from being burnt, is actually more
vigorous and green than usual, though it is naturally inflammable, and that too when the
fire is glowing about its very roots. I certainly cast some boughs of trees from the adjoining
wood on to the place where the fire burst forth, and they immediately caught fire and were
burnt to ashes. Now, then, tell me why it is that that which cannot bear even to feel the heat
of the sun, but withers up under it unless it be sprinkled with water, is not consumed when
beset by such fiery heat, but both lives and thrives? What is the meaning of this marvel?
God appointed this as an example and introduction to the day that is coming, in order that
we may know more certainly that, when all things are deluged with fire from heaven, the
bodies which are distinguished by chastity and righteousness will be taken up by Him as
free from all injury from the fire as from cold water. For truly, O beneficent and bountiful
Lord, “the creature that serveth Thee, who art the Maker, increaseth his strength against
the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his strength for the benefit of such as
put their trust in Thee;”2890 and at Thy pleasure fire cools, and injures nothing that Thou
determinest to be preserved; and again, water burns more fiercely than fire, and nothing
opposes Thine unconquerable power and might. For Thou createdst all things out of nothing;
wherefore also Thou changest and transformest all things as Thou wilt, seeing they are
Thine, and Thou alone art God.</p>
<p>XV. The apostle certainly, after assigning the planting and watering to art and earth
and water, conceded the growth to God alone, where he says, “Neither is he that planteth
anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”2891 For he knew that
Wisdom, the first-born of God, the parent and artificer of all things, brings forth everything
into the world; whom the ancients called Nature and Providence, because she, with constant
provision and care, gives to all things birth and growth. “For,” says the Wisdom of God,
“my Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”2892 Now it is on this account that Solomon called
Wisdom the artificer of all things, since God is in no respect poor, but able richly to create,
and make, and vary, and increase all things.</p>

the ground, and made our outer man.</p>

<p>For instance, then, the images of our kings here, even though they be not formed of the

<head>Part III.</head>
<p>I. From the Discourse on the Resurrection.2894</p>
<p>I. Read the Book on the Resurrection by St. Methodius, Bishop and Martyr, of which
that which follows is a selection, that the body is not the fetter of the soul, as Origen thought,
nor are souls called by the prophet Jeremiah “fettered” on account of their being within
bodies. For he lays down the principle that the body does not hinder the energies of the
soul, but that rather the body is carried about with it, and cooperates in whatever the soul
commits to it. But how are we to understand the opinion of Gregory2895 the theologian,
and many others?</p>
<p>II. That Origen said that the body was given to the soul as a fetter after the fall, and that
previously it lived without a body; but that this body which we wear is the cause of our sins;
wherefore also he called it a fetter, as it can hinder the soul from good works.</p>
<p>III. That if the body was given to the soul after the fall as a fetter, it must have been
given as a fetter upon the evil or the good. Now it is impossible that it should be upon the
good; for no physician or artificer gives to that which has gone wrong a remedy to cause
further error, much less would God do so. It remains, then, that it was a fetter upon evil.
But surely we see that, at the beginning, Cain, clad in this body, committed murder; and it
is evident into what wickedness those who succeeded him ran. The body is not, then, a fetter
upon evil, nor indeed a fetter at all; nor was the soul clothed in it for the first time after the
fall.</p>
<p>IV. That man, with respect to his nature, is most truly said to be neither soul without
body, nor, on the other hand, body without soul; but a being composed out of the union of
soul and body into one form of the beautiful. But Origen said that the soul alone is man, as
did Plato.</p>
<p>V. That there is a difference between man and other living creatures; and to them are
given varieties of natural form and shape, as many as the tangible and visible forces of nature
produced at the command of God; while to him was given the form and image of God, with
every part accurately finished, after the very original likeness of the Father and the onlybegotten
Son. Now we must consider how the saint states this.</p>
<p>VI. He says that Phidias the statuary, after he had made the Pisæan image of ivory,
ordered oil to be poured out before it, that, as far as he could secure it, it might be preserved
imperishable.</p>
<p>VII. He says, as was said also by Athenagoras,2896 that the devil is a spirit, made by God,
in the neighbourhood of matter, as of course the rest of the angels are, and that he was en-

<pb n="846"/>
trusted with the oversight of matter, and the forms of matter. For, according to the original
constitution of angels, they were made by God, in His providence, for the care of the universe;
in order that, while God exercises a perfect and general supervision over the whole, and
keeps the supreme authority and power over all—for upon Him their existence depends—the
angels appointed for this purpose take charge of particulars. Now the rest of them remained
in the positions for which God made and appointed them; but the devil was insolent, and
having conceived envy of us, behaved wickedly in the charge committed to him; as also did
those who subsequently were enamoured of fleshly charms, and had illicit intercourse with
the daughters of men.2897 For to them also, as was the case with men, God granted the
possession of their own choice. And how is this to be taken?</p>
<p>VIII. He says that by the coats of skins is signified death. For he says of Adam, that when
the Almighty God saw that by treachery he, an immortal being, had become evil, just as his
deceiver the devil was, He prepared the coats of skins on this account; that when he was
thus, as it were, clothed in mortality, all that was evil in him might die in the dissolution of
the body.</p>
<p>IX. He holds that St. Paul had two revelations. For the apostle, he says, does not suppose
paradise to be in the third heaven, in the opinion of those who knew how to observe the
niceties of language, when he says, “I know such a man caught up to the third heaven; and
I know such a man, whether in the body or out of the body, God knoweth, that was caught
up into paradise.”2898 Here he signifies that he has seen two revelations, having been evidently
taken up twice, once to the third heaven, and once into paradise. For the words, “I know
such a man caught up,” make it certain that he was personally shown a revelation respecting
the third heaven. And the words which follow, “And I know such a man, whether in the
body or out of the body, God knoweth, that he was caught up into paradise,” show that another
revelation was made to him respecting paradise. Now he was led to make this statement
by his opponent’s having laid it down from the apostle’s words that paradise is a mere conception,
as it is above the heaven, in order to draw the conclusion that life in paradise is incorporeal.
2899</p>
<p>X. He says that it is in our power to do, or to avoid doing, evil; since otherwise we should
not be punished for doing evil, nor be rewarded for doing well; but the presence or absence
of evil thoughts does not depend upon ourselves. Wherefore even the sainted Paul says,
“For what I would, that do I not, but what I would not, that I do;”2900 that is to say, “My
thoughts are not what I would, but what I would not.” Now he says that the habit of imagining

evil is rooted out by the approach of physical death,2901—since it was for this reason that
death was appointed by God for the sinner, that evil might not remain for ever.</p>
<p>But what is the meaning of this statement? It is to be noted that it has been made by
others of our Fathers as well. What is the meaning, seeing that those who meet death find
in it at the time neither increase nor decrease of sins?</p>

<p>II. A Synopsis of Some Apostolic Words from the Same Discourse.2902</p>
<p>I. Read a compendious interpretation of some apostolic words from the same discourse.
Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this
saying of his, “I was alive without the law once,”2903 refers to the life which was lived in
paradise before the law, not without a body, but with a body, by our first parents, as we have
shown above; for we lived without concupiscence, being altogether ignorant of its assaults.
For not to have a law according to which we ought to live, nor a power of establishing what
manner of life we ought to adopt, so that we might justly be approved or blamed, is considered
to exempt a person from accusation. Because one cannot lust after those things from
which he is not restrained, and even if he lusted after them, he would not be blamed. For
lust is not directed to things which are before us, and subject to our power, but to those
which are before us, and not in our power. For how should one care for a thing which is
neither forbidden nor necessary to him? And for this reason it is said, “I had not known
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”2904 For when (our first parents) heard,
“Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,”2905 then they conceived lust, and gathered it. Therefore
was it said, I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet;” nor would
they have desired to eat, except it had been said, “Thou shalt not eat of it.” For it was thence
that sin took occasion to deceive me. For when the law was given, the devil had it in his
power to work lust in me; “for without the law, sin was dead;”2906 which means “when the
law was not given, sin could not be committed.” But I was alive and blameless before the
law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; “but when
the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained
to life, I found to be unto death.”2907 For after God had given the law, and had
commanded me what I ought to do, and what I ought not to do, the devil wrought lust in
me. For the promise of God which was given to me, this was for life and incorruption, so
that obeying it I might have ever-blooming life and joy unto incorruption; but to him who
disobeyed it, it would issue in death. But the devil, whom he calls sin, because he is the author
of sin, taking occasion by the commandment to deceive me to disobedience, deceived and
slew me, thus rendering me subject to the condemnation, “In the day that thou eatest

<pb n="849"/>
thereof thou shalt surely die.”2908 “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just and good;”2909 because it was given, not for injury, but for safety; for let us not
suppose that God makes anything useless or hurtful. What then? “Was then that which is
good made death unto me?”2910 namely, that which was given as a law, that it might be the
cause of the greatest good? “God forbid.” For it was not the law of God that became the
cause of my being brought into subjection to corruption, but the devil; that he might be
made manifested who, through that which is good, wrought evil; that the inventor of evil
might become and be proved the greatest of all sinners. “For we know that the law is spiritual;”
2911 and therefore it can in no respect be injurious to any one; for spiritual things are far
removed from irrational lust and sin. “But I am carnal, sold under sin;”2912 which means:
But I being carnal, and being placed between good and evil as a voluntary agent, am so that
I may have it in my power to choose what I will. For “behold I set before thee life and
death;”2913 meaning that death would result from disobedience of the spiritual law, that is
of the commandment; and from obedience to the carnal law, that is the counsel of the serpent;
for by such a choice “I am sold” to the devil, fallen under sin. Hence evil, as though besieging
me, cleaves to me and dwells in me, justice giving me up to be sold to the Evil One, in consequence
of having violated the law. Therefore also the expressions: “That which I do, I allow
not,” and “what I hate, that do I,”2914 are not to be understood of doing evil, but of only
thinking it. For it is not in our power to think or not to think of improper things, but to act
or not to act upon our thoughts. For we cannot hinder thoughts from coming into our
minds, since we receive them when they are inspired into us from without; but we are able
to abstain from obeying them and acting upon them. Therefore it is in our power to will
not to think these things; but not to bring it about that they shall pass away, so as not to
come into the mind again; for this does not lie in our power, as I said; which is the meaning
of that statement, “The good that I would, I do not;”2915 for I do not will to think the things
which injure me; for this good is altogether innocent. But “the good that I would, I do not;
but the evil which I would not, that I do;” not willing to think, and yet thinking what I do
not will. And consider whether it was not for these very things that David entreated God,
grieving that he thought of those things which he did not will: “O cleanse Thou me from

my secret faults. Keep Thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion
over me; so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.”2916 And the apostle
too, in another place: “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ.”2917</p>
<p>II. But if any one should venture to oppose this statement, and reply, that the apostle
teaches that we hate not only the evil which is in thought, but that we do that which we will
not, and we hate it even in the very act of doing it, for he says, “The good which I would, I
do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do;”2918 if he who says so speaks the truth, let
us ask him to explain what was the evil which the apostle hated and willed not to do, but
did; and the good which he willed to do, but did not; and conversely, whether as often as
he willed to do good, so often he did not do the good which he willed, but did the evil which
he willed not? And how he can say, when exhorting us to shake off all manner of sin, “Be
ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ?”2919 Thus he meant the things already
mentioned which he willed not to do, not to be done, but only to be thought of. For how
otherwise could he be an exact imitation of Christ? It would be excellent then, and most
delightful, if we had not those who oppose us, and contend with us; but since this is impossible,
we cannot do what we will. For we will not to have those who lead us to passion,
for then we could be saved without weariness and effort; but that does not come to pass
which we will, but that which we will not. For it is necessary, as I said, that we should be
tried. Let us not then, O my soul, let us not give in to the Evil One; but putting on “the whole
armour of God,” which is our protection, let us have “the breastplate of righteousness, and
your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel (of peace). Above all, taking the shield of
faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God,”2920 that ye may
be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; “casting down imaginations, and every high
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of Christ,”2921 “for we wrestle not against
flesh and blood;”2922 “for that which I do, I allow not; for what I would, that do I not: but
what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is
good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in

me—that is, in my flesh—dwelleth no good thing.”2923 And this is rightly said. For remember
how it has been already shown that, from the time when man went astray and disobeyed
the law, thence sin, receiving its birth from his disobedience, dwelt in him. For thus a commotion
was stirred up, and we were filled with agitations and foreign imaginations, being
emptied of the divine inspiration and filled with carnal desire, which the cunning serpent
infused into us. And, therefore, God invented death for our sakes, that He might destroy
sin, lest rising up in us immortals, as I said, it should be immortal. When the apostle says,
“for I know that in me—that is, in my flesh—dwelleth no good thing,” by which words he
means to indicate that sin dwells in us, from the transgression, through lust; out of which,
like young shoots, the imaginations of pleasure rise around us. For there are two kinds of
thoughts in us; the one which arises from the lust which lies in the body, which, as I said,
came from the craft of the Evil Spirit; the other from the law, which is in accordance with
the commandment, which we had implanted in us as a natural law, stirring up our thoughts
to good, when we delight in the law of God according to our mind, for this is the inner man;
but in the law of the devil according to the lust which dwells in the flesh. For he who wars
against and opposes the law of God, that is, against the tendency of the mind to good, is the
same who stirs up the carnal and sensual impulses to lawlessness.</p>
<p>III. For the apostle here sets forth clearly, as I think, three laws: One in accordance with
the good which is implanted in us, which clearly he calls the law of the mind. One the law
which arises from the assault of evil, and which often draws on the soul to lustful fancies,
which, he says,” wars against the law of the mind.”2924 And the third, which is in accordance
with sin, settled in the flesh from lust, which he calls the “law of sin which dwells in our
members;”2925 which the Evil One, urging on, often stirs up against us, driving us to unrighteousness
and evil deeds. For there seems to be in ourselves one thing which is better and
another which is worse. And when that which is in its nature better is about to become more
powerful than that which is worse, the whole mind is carried on to that which is good; but
when that which is worse increases and overbalances, man is on the contrary urged on to
evil imaginations. On account of which the apostle prays to be delivered from it, regarding
it as death and destruction; as also does the prophet when he says, “Cleanse Thou me from
my secret faults.”2926 And the same is denoted by the words, “For I delight in the law of
God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law
of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”2927 By which

<pb n="852"/>
he does not mean that the body is death, but the law of sin which is in his members, lying
hidden in us through the transgression, and ever deluding the soul to the death of unrighteousness.
And he immediately adds, clearly showing from what kind of death he desired to
be delivered, and who he was who delivered him, “I thank God, through Jesus Christ.”2928
And it should be considered, if he said that this body was death, O Aglaophon, as you supposed,
he would not afterwards mention Christ as delivering him from so great an evil. For
in that case what a strange thing should we have had from the advent of Christ? And how
could the apostle have said this, as being able to be delivered from death by the advent of
Christ; when it was the lot of all to die before Christ’s coming into the world? And, therefore,
O Aglaophon, he says not that this body was death, but the sin which dwells in the body
through lust, from which God has delivered him by the coming of Christ. “For the law of
the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death;” so that
“He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit
that dwelleth in you;” having “condemned sin” which is in the body to its destruction; “that
the righteousness of the law”2929 of nature which draws us to good, and is in accordance
with the commandment, might be kindled and manifested. For the good which “the law”
of nature “could not do, in that it was weak,” being overcome by the lust which lies in the
body, God gave strength to accomplish, “sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh;”
so that sin being condemned, to its destruction, so that it should never bear fruit in the flesh,
the righteousness of the law of nature might be fulfilled, abounding in the obedience of
those who walk not according to the lust of the flesh, but according to the lust and guidance
of the Spirit; “for the law of the Spirit of life,” which is the Gospel, being different from
earlier laws, leading by its preaching to obedience and the remission of sins, delivered us
from the law of sin and death, having conquered entirely sin which reigned over our flesh.</p>
<p>IV. He2930 says that plants are neither nourished nor increased from the earth. For he
says, let any one consider how the earth can be changed and taken up into the substance of
trees. For then the place of the earth which lay around, and was drawn up through the roots
into the whole compass of the tree, where the tree grew, must needs be hollowed out; so
that such a thing as they hold respecting the flux of bodies, is absurd. For how could the
earth first enter in through the roots into the trunks of the plants, and then, passing through
their channels into all their branches, be turned into leaves and fruit? Now there are large
trees, such as the cedar, pines, firs, which annually bear much leaves and fruit; and one may
see that they consume none of the surrounding earth into the bulk and substance of the
tree. For it would be necessary, if it were true that the earth went up through the roots, and

<pb n="853"/>
was turned into wood, that the whole place where the earth lay round about them should
be hollowed out; for it is not the nature of a dry substance to flow in, like a moist substance,
and fill up the place of that which moves away. Moreover, there are fig-trees, and other
similar plants, which frequently grow in the buildings of monuments, and yet they never
consume the entire building into themselves. But if any one should choose to collect their
fruit and leaves for many years, he would perceive that their bulk had become much larger
than the earth upon the monuments. Hence it is absurd to suppose that the earth is consumed
into the crop of fruits and leaves; and even if they were all made by it, they would be so only
as using it for their seat and place. For bread is not made without a mill, and a place, and
time, and fire; and yet bread is not made out of any of these things. And the same may be
said of a thousand other things.</p>
<p>V. Now the followers of Origen bring forward this passage, “For we know that if our
earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,”2931 and so forth, to disprove the resurrection
of the body, saying that the “tabernacle” is the body, and the “house not made with hands”
“in the heavens” is our spiritual clothing. Therefore, says the holy Methodius, by this earthly
house must metaphorically2932 be understood our short-lived existence here, and not this
tabernacle; for if you decide to consider the body as being the earthly house which is dissolved,
tell us what is the tabernacle whose house is dissolved? For the tabernacle is one
thing, and the house of the tabernacle another, and still another we who have the tabernacle.
“For,” he says, “if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved”—by which he points
out that the souls are ourselves, that the body is a tabernacle, and that the house of the tabernacle
figuratively represents the enjoyment of the flesh in the present life. If, then, this
present life of the body be dissolved like a house, we shall have that which is not made with
hands in the heavens. “Not made with hands,” he says, to point out the difference; because
this life may be said to be made with hands, seeing that all the employments and pursuits
of life are carried on by the hands of men. For the body, being the workmanship of God, is
not said to be made with hands, inasmuch as it is not formed by the arts of men. But if they
shall say that it is made with hands, because it was the workmanship of God, then our souls
also, and the angels, and the spiritual clothing in the heavens, are made with hands; for all
these things, also, are the workmanship of God. What, then, is the house which is made
with hands? It is, as I have said, the short-lived existence which is sustained by human hands.
For God said, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread;”2933 and when that life is dissolved,
we have the life which is not made with hands. As also the Lord showed, when He

<pb n="854"/>
said: “Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail,
they may receive you into everlasting habitations.”2934 For what the Lord then called “habitations,”
2935 the apostle here calls “clothing.”2936 And what He there calls “friends” “of
unrighteousness,” the apostle here calls “houses” “dissolved.” As then, when the days of our
present life shall fail, those good deeds of beneficence to which we have attained in this unrighteous
life, and in this “world” which “lieth in wickedness,”2937 will receive our souls; so
when this perishable life shall be dissolved, we shall have the habitation which is before the
resurrection—that is, our souls shall be with God, until we shall receive the new house which
is prepared for us, and which shall never fall. Whence also “we groan,” “not for that we
would be unclothed,” as to the body, “but clothed upon”2938 by it in the other life. For the
“house in heaven,” with which we desire to be “clothed,” is immortality; with which, when
we are clothed, every weakness and mortality will be entirely “swallowed up” in it, being
consumed by endless life. “For we walk by faith, not by sight;”2939 that is, for we still go
forward by faith, viewing the things which are beyond with a darkened understanding, and
not clearly, so that we may see these things, and enjoy them, and be in them. “Now this I
say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption.”2940 By flesh, he did not mean flesh itself, but the irrational impulse
towards the lascivious pleasures of the soul. And therefore when he says, “Flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God,” he adds the explanation, “Neither doth corruption
inherit incorruption.” Now corruption is not the thing which is corrupted, but the thing
which corrupts. For when death prevails the body sinks into corruption; but when life still
remains in it, it stands uncorrupted. Therefore, since the flesh is the boundary between
corruption and incorruption, not being either corruption or incorruption, it was vanquished
by corruption on account of pleasure, although it was the work and the possession of incorruption.
Therefore it became subject to corruption. When, then, it had been overcome by
corruption, and was given over to death for chastisement, He did not leave it to be vanquished
and given over as an inheritance to corruption; but again conquering death by the resurrection,
He restored it to incorruption, that corruption might not inherit incorruption, but
incorruption that which is corruptible. And therefore the apostle answers, “This corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.”2941 But the corruptible and mortal

putting on incorruption and immortality, what else is this, but that which is sown in corruption
rising in incorruption?2942 For, “as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall
also bear the image of the heavenly.”2943 For the “image of the earthly” which we have borne
refers to the saying, “Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.”2944 And the “image
of the heavenly is the resurrection from the dead and incorruption.”</p>
<p>VI. Now Justin of Neapolis,2945 a man not far removed either from the times or from
the virtues of the apostles, says that that which is mortal is inherited, but that life inherits;
and that flesh dies, but that the kingdom of heaven lives. When then, Paul says that “flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven,”2946 he does not so speak as seeming to
slight the regeneration of the flesh, but as teaching that the kingdom of God, which is
eternal life, is not inherited by the body, but the body by life. For if the kingdom of God,
which is life, were inherited by the body, it would happen that life was swallowed up by
corruption. But now life inherits that which is mortal, that death may be swallowed up of
life unto victory, and that which is corruptible appear the possession of incorruption; being
made free from death and sin, and become the slave and subject of immortality, that the
body may become the possession of incorruption, and not incorruption of the body.</p>
<p>VII. Now the passage, “The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive,” St.
Methodius thus explains: Those are our bodies; for the souls are we ourselves, who, rising,
resume that which is dead from the earth; so that being caught up with them to meet the
Lord, we may gloriously celebrate the splendid festival of the resurrection, because we have
received our everlasting tabernacles, which shall no longer die nor be dissolved.</p>
<p>VIII. I saw, he says, on Olympus2947 (Olympus is a mountain in Lycia), a fire spontaneously
arising on the top of the mountain from the earth, beside which is the plant Puragnos,
so flourishing, green, and shady, that it seemed rather as though it grew from a fountain.
For what cause, although they are by nature corruptible, and their bodies consumed by fire,
was this plant not only not burnt, but rather more flourishing, although in its nature it is
easily burnt, and the fire was burning about its roots? Then I cast branches of trees out of
the surrounding wood into the place where the fire streamed forth, and, immediately
bursting up into flame, they were converted into cinders. What then is the meaning of this
contradiction? This God appointed as a sign and prelude of the coming Day, that we may

know that, when all things are overwhelmed by fire, the bodies which are endowed with
chastity and righteousness shall pass through it as though it were cold water.</p>
<p>IX. Consider, he says, whether too the blessed John, when he says, “And the sea gave
up the dead which were in it: and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in
them,”2948 does not mean the parts which are given up by the elements for the reconstruction
of each one? By the sea is meant the moist element; by hell,2949 the air, derived from ἀειδές,
because it is invisible, as was said by Origen; and by death, the earth, because those who die
are laid in it; whence also it is called in the Psalms the “dust of death,”2950 Christ saying that
He is brought “into the dust of death.”</p>
<p>X. For, he says, whatever is composed and consists of pure air and pure fire, and is of
like substance with the angelic beings, cannot have the nature of earth and water; since it
would then be earthy. And of such nature, and consisting of such things, Origen has shown
that the body of man shall be which shall rise, which he also said would be spiritual.</p>
<p>XI. And he asks what will be the appearance of the risen body, when this human form,
as according to him useless, shall wholly disappear; since it is the most lovely of all things
which are combined in living creatures, as being the form which the Deity Himself employs,
as the most wise Paul explains: “For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch
as he is the image and glory of God;”2951 in accordance with which the rational bodies of
the angels are set in order? will it be circular, or polygonal, or cubical, or pyramidal? For
there are very many kinds of forms; but this is impossible.2952 Well then, what are we to
think of the assertion, that the godlike shape is to be rejected as more ignoble, for he himself
allows that the soul is like the body, and that man is to rise again without hands or feet?</p>
<p>XII. The transformation, he says, is the restoration into an impassible and glorious state.
For now the body is a body of desire and of humiliation,2953 and therefore Daniel was called
“a man of desires.”2954 But then it will be transfigured into an impassible body, not by the
change of the arrangement of the members, but by its not desiring carnal pleasures.
Then he says, refuting Origen, Origen therefore thinks that the same flesh will not be
restored to the soul, but that the form of each, according to the appearance by which the
flesh is now distinguished, shall arise stamped upon another spiritual body; so that every
one will again appear the same form; and that this is the resurrection which is promised.

<pb n="857"/>
For, he says, the material body being fluid, and in no wise remaining in itself, but wearing
out and being replaced around the appearance by which its shape is distinguished, and by
which the figure is contained, it is necessary that the resurrection should be only that of the
form.</p>
<p>XIII. Then, after a little, he says: If then, O Origen, you maintain that the resurrection
of the body changed into a spiritual body is to be expected only in appearance, and put forth
the vision of Moses and Elias as a most convincing proof of it; saying that they appeared
after their departure from life, preserving no different appearance from that which they had
from the beginning; in the same way will be the resurrection of all men. But Moses and
Elias arose and appeared with this form of which you speak, before Christ suffered and rose.
How then could Christ be celebrated by prophets and apostles as “the first begotten of the
dead?”2955 For if the Christ is believed to be the first begotten of the dead, He is the first
begotten of the dead as having risen before all others. But Moses appeared to the apostles
before Christ suffered, having this form in which you say the resurrection is fulfilled. Hence
then, there is no resurrection of the form without the flesh. For either there is a resurrection
of the form as you teach, and then Christ is no longer “the first begotten of the dead,” from
the fact that souls appeared before Him, having this form after death; or He is truly the first
begotten, and it is quite impossible that any should have been thought meet for a resurrection
before Him, so as not to die again. But if no one arose before Him, and Moses and Elias
appeared to the apostles not having flesh, but only its appearance, the resurrection in the
flesh is clearly manifested. For it is most absurd that the resurrection should be set forth
only in form, since the souls, after their departure from the flesh, never appear to lay aside
the form which, he says, rises again. But if that remains with them, so that it cannot be taken
away, as with the soul of Moses and Elias; and neither perishes, as you think, nor is destroyed,
but is everywhere present with them; then surely that form which never fell cannot be said
to rise again.</p>
<p>XIV. But if any one, finding this inadmissible, answers, But how then, if no one rose
before Christ went down into Hades, are several recorded as having risen before Him?
Among whom is the son of the widow of Sarepta, and the son of the Shunammite, and
Lazarus. We must say: These rose to die again; but we are speaking of those who shall never
die after their rising. And if any one should speak doubtfully concerning the soul of Elias,
as that the Scriptures say that he was taken up in the flesh, and we say that he appeared to
the apostles divested of the flesh, we must say, that to allow that he appeared to the apostles
in the flesh is more in favour of our argument. For it is shown by this case that the body is
susceptible of immortality, as was also proved by the translation of Enoch. For if he could
not receive immortality, he could not remain in a state of insensibility so long a time. If,
<note type="footnote">2955 Rev. i. 5.</note>

<pb n="858"/>
then, he appeared with the body, that was truly after he was dead, but certainly not as having
arisen from the dead. And this, we may say, if we agree with Origen when he says that the
same form is given to the soul after death; when it is separated from the body, which is of
all things the most impossible, from the fact that the form of the flesh was destroyed before
by its changes, as also the form of the melted statue before its entire dissolution. Because
the quality cannot be separated from the material, so as to exist by itself; for the shape which
disappears around the brass is separated from the melted statue, and has not longer a substantial
existence.</p>
<p>XV. Since the form is said to be separated in death from the flesh, come, let us consider
in how many ways that which is separated is said to be separated. Now a thing is said to be
separated from another either in act and subsistence, or in thought; or else in act, but not
in subsistence. As if, for instance, one should separate from each other wheat and barley
which had been mingled together; in as far as they are separated in motion, they are said to
be separated in act; in as far as they stand apart when separated, they are said to be separated
in subsistence. They are separated in thought when we separate matter from its qualities,
and qualities from matter; in act, but not in subsistence, when a thing separated from another
no longer exists, not having a substantive existence. And it may be observed that it is so also
in mechanics, when one looks upon a statue or a brazen horse melted. For, when he considers
these things, he will see their natural form changing; and they alter into another figure from
which the original form disappears. For if any one should melt down the works formed into
the semblance of a man or a horse, he will find the appearance of the form disappearing,
but the material itself remaining. It is, therefore, untenable to say, that the form shall arise
in nowise corrupted, but that the body in which the form was stamped shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>XVI. But he says that it will be so; for it will be changed in a spiritual body. Therefore,
it is necessary to confess that the very same form as at first does not arise, from its being
changed and corrupted with the flesh. For although it be changed into a spiritual body, that
will not be properly the original substance, but a certain resemblance of it, fashioned in an
ethereal body. If, however, it is not the same form, nor yet the body which arises, then it is
another in the place of the first. For that which is like, being different from that which it
resembles, cannot be that very first thing in accordance with which it was made.</p>
<p>XVII. Moreover, he says that that is the appearance or form which shows forth the
identity of the members in the distinctive character of the form.</p>
<p>XVIII. And, when Origen allegorises that which is said by the prophet Ezekiel concerning
the resurrection of the dead, and perverts it to the return of the Israelites from their captivity
in Babylon, the saint in refuting him, after many other remarks, says this also: For neither
did they2956 obtain a perfect liberty, nor did they overcome their enemies by a greater power,
<note type="footnote">2956 The Israelites.</note>

<pb n="859"/>
and dwell again in Jerusalem; and when they frequently intended to build (the temple), they
were prevented by other nations. Whence, also, they were scarce able to build that in fortysix
years, which Solomon completed from the foundations in seven years. But what need
we say on this subject? For from the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and those who after him
reigned over Babylon, until the time of the Persian expedition against the Assyrians, and
the empire of Alexander, and the war which was stirred up by the Romans against the Jews,
Jerusalem was six times overthrown by its enemies. And this is recorded by Josephus, who
says: “Jerusalem was taken in the second year of the reign of Vespasian. It had been taken
before five times; but now for the second time it was destroyed. For Asochæus, king of Egypt,
and after him Antiochus, next Pompey, and after these Sosius, with Herod, took the city
and burnt it; but before these, the king of Babylon conquered and destroyed it.”</p>
<p>XIX. He says that Origen holds these opinions which he refutes. And there may be a
doubt concerning Lazarus and the rich man. The simpler persons think that these things
were spoken as though both were receiving their due for the things which they had done in
life in their bodies; but the more accurate think that, since no one is left in life after the resurrection,
these things do not happen at the resurrection. For the rich man says: “I have
five brethren;…lest they also come into this place of torment,”2957 send Lazarus, that he
may tell them of those things which are here. And, therefore, if we ask respecting the
“tongue,” and the “finger,” and “Abraham’s bosom,” and the reclining there, it may perhaps
be that the soul receives in the change a form similar in appearance to its gross and earthly
body. If, then, any one of those who have fallen asleep is recorded as having appeared, in
the same way he has been seen in the form which he had when he was in the flesh. Besides,
when Samuel appeared, it is clear that, being seen, he was clothed in a body;2958 and this
must especially be admitted, if we are pressed by arguments which prove that the essence
of the soul is incorporeal, and is manifested by itself.2959 But the rich man in torment, and
the poor man who was comforted in the bosom of Abraham, are said, the one to be punished
in Hades, and the other to be comforted in Abraham’s bosom, before the appearing of the
Saviour, and before the end of the world, and therefore before the resurrection; teaching
that now already, at the change, the soul rises a body. Wherefore, the saint says as follows:
Setting forth that the soul, after its removal hence, has a form similar in appearance to this
sensitive body; does Origen represent the soul, after Plato, as being incorporeal? And how
should that which, after removal from the world, is said to have need of a vehicle and a
clothing, so that it might not be found naked, be in itself other than incorporeal? But if it
be incorporeal, must it not also be incapable of passion? For it follows, from its being incor-

poreal, that it is also impassible and imperturbable. If, then, it was not distracted by any irrational
desire, neither was it changed by a pained or suffering body. For neither can that
which is incorporeal sympathize with a body, nor a body with that which is incorporeal,
if,2960 indeed, the soul should seem to be incorporeal, in accordance with what has been
said. But if it sympathize with the body, as is proved by the testimony of those who appear,
it cannot be incorporeal. Therefore God alone is celebrated, as the unbegotten, independent,
and unwearied nature; being incorporeal, and therefore invisible; for “no man hath seen
God.”2961 But souls, being rational bodies, are arranged by the Maker and Father of all
things into members which are visible to reason, having received this impression. Whence,
also, in Hades, as in the case of Lazarus and the rich man, they are spoken of as having a
tongue, and a finger, and the other members; not as though they had with them another
invisible body, but that the souls themselves, naturally, when entirely stripped of their covering,
are such according to their essence.</p>
<p>XX. The saint says at the end: The words, “For to this end Christ both died, and rose,
and revived, that He might be Lord both of the dead and living,”2962 must be taken as referring
to souls and bodies; the souls being the living, as being immortal, and the bodies being
dead.</p>
<p>XXI. Since the body of man is more honourable than other living creatures, because it
is said to have been formed by the hands of God, and because it has attained to be the vehicle
of the reasonable soul; how is it that it is so short-lived, shorter even than some of the irrational
creatures? Is it not clear that its long-lived existence will be after the resurrection?</p>

<head>On the History of Jonah.
From the Book on the Resurrection.2963</head>
<p>I. The history of Jonah2964 contains a great mystery. For it seems that the whale signifies
Time, which never stands still, but is always going on, and consumes the things which are
made by long and shorter intervals. But Jonah, who fled from the presence of God, is himself
the first man who, having transgressed the law, fled from being seen naked of immortality,
having lost through sin his confidence in the Deity. And the ship in which he embarked,
and which was tempest-tossed, is this brief and hard life in the present time; just as though
we had turned and removed from that blessed and secure life, to that which was most tempestuous
and unstable, as from solid land to a ship. For what a ship is to the land, that our
present life is to that which is immortal. And the storm and the tempests which beat against
us are the temptations of this life, which in the world, as in a tempestuous sea, do not permit
us to have a fair voyage free from pain, in a calm sea, and one which is free from evils. And
the casting of Jonah from the ship into the sea, signifies the fall of the first man from life to
death, who received that sentence because, through having sinned, he fell from righteousness:
“Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”2965 And his being swallowed by the whale
signifies our inevitable removal by time. For the belly in which Jonah, when he was swallowed,
was concealed, is the all-receiving earth, which receives all things which are consumed by
time.</p>
<p>II. As, then, Jonah spent three days and as many nights in the whale’s belly, and was
delivered up sound again, so shall we all, who have passed through the three stages of our
present life on earth—I mean the beginning, the middle, and the end, of which all this present
time consists—rise again. For there are altogether three intervals of time, the past, the future,
and the present. And for this reason the Lord spent so many days in the earth symbolically,
thereby teaching clearly that when the forementioned intervals of time have been fulfilled,
then shall come our resurrection, which is the beginning of the future age, and the end of

this. For in that age2966 there is neither past nor future, but only the present. Moreover, Jonah
having spent three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, was not destroyed by his
flesh being dissolved, as is the case with that natural decomposition which takes place in
the belly, in the case of those meats which enter into it, on account of the greater heat in the
liquids, that it might be shown that these bodies of ours may remain undestroyed. For
consider that God had images of Himself made as of gold, that is of a purer spiritual substance,
as the angels; and others of clay or brass, as ourselves. He united the soul which was
made in the image of God to that which was earthy. As, then, we must here honour all the
images of a king, on account of the form which is in them, so also it is incredible that we
who are the images of God should be altogether destroyed as being without honour. Whence
also the Word descended into our world, and was incarnate of our body, in order that,
having fashioned it to a more divine image, He might raise it incorrupt, although it had
been dissolved by time. And, indeed, when we trace out the dispensation which was figuratively
set forth by the prophet, we shall find the whole discourse visibly extending to this.</p>

<head>Extracts from the Work on Things Created.2967</head>
<p>I. This selection is made, by way of compendium or synopsis, from the work of the holy
martyr and bishop Methodius, concerning things created. The passage, “Give not that which
is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine,”2968 is explained by Origen
as signifying that the pearls are the more mystical teachings of our God-given religion, and
the swine those who roll in impiety and in all kinds of pleasures, as swine do in mud; for he
said that it was taught by these words of Christ not to cast about the divine teachings, inasmuch
as they could not bear them who were held by impiety and brutal pleasures. The great
Methodius says: If we must understand by pearls the glorious and divine teachings, and by
swine those who are given up to impiety and pleasures, from whom are to be withheld and
hidden the apostle’s teachings, which stir men up to piety and faith in Christ, see how you
say that no Christians can be converted from their impiety by the teachings of the apostles.
For they would never cast the mysteries of Christ to those who, through want of faith, are
like swine. Either, therefore, these things were cast before all the Greeks and other unbelievers,
and were preached by the disciples of Christ, and converted them from impiety to the faith
of Christ, as we believers certainly confess, and then the words, “Cast not your pearls before
swine,” can no longer mean what has been said; or meaning this, we must say that faith in
Christ and deliverance from impiety have been accorded to none of the unbelievers, whom
we compare to swine, by the apostolic instructions enlightening their souls like pearls. But
this is blasphemous. Therefore the pearls in this place are not to be taken to mean the
deepest doctrines, and the swine the impious; nor are we to understand the words, “Cast
not your pearls before swine,” as forbidding us to cast before the impious and unbelieving
the deep and sanctifying doctrines of faith in Christ; but we must take the pearls to mean
virtues, with which the soul is adorned as with precious pearls; and not to cast them before
swine, as meaning that we are not to cast these virtues, such as chastity, temperance, righteousness,
and truth, that we are not to cast these to impure pleasures, for these are like swine,
lest they, fleeing from the virtues, cause the soul to live a swinish and a vicious life.</p>
<p>II. Origen says that what he calls the Centaur is the universe which is co-eternal with
the only wise and independent God. For he says, since there is no workman without some
work, or maker without something made, so neither is there an Almighty without an object
of His power. For the workman must be so called from his work, and the maker from what
he makes, and the Almighty Ruler from that which He rules over. And so it must be, that
these things were made by God from the beginning, and that there was no time in which
they did not exist. For if there was a time when the things that are made did not exist, then,
as there were no things which had been made, so there was no maker; which you see to be
<note type="footnote">2967 From Photius, Bibliotheca, cod. 235.</note>
<note type="footnote">2968 Matt. vii. 6.</note>

<pb n="864"/>
an impious conclusion. And it will result that the unchangeable and unaltered God has
altered and changed. For if He made the universe later, it is clear that He passed from not
making to making. But this is absurd in connection with what has been said. It is impossible,
therefore, to say that the universe is not unbeginning and co-eternal with God. To whom
the saint replies, in the person of another, asking, “Do you not consider God the beginning
and fountain of wisdom and glory, and in short of all virtue in substance and not by acquisition?”
“Certainly,” he says. “And what besides? Is He not by Himself perfect and independent?”
“True; for it is impossible that he who is independent should have his independence
from another. For we must say, that all which is full by another is also imperfect. For it is
the thing which has its completeness of itself, and in itself alone, which can alone be considered
perfect.” “You say most truly. For would you pronounce that which is neither by
itself complete, nor its own completeness, to be independent?” “By no means. For that which
is perfect through anything else must needs be in itself imperfect.” “Well, then shall God be
considered perfect by Himself, and not by some other?” “Most rightly.” “Then God is
something different from the world, and the world from God?” “Quite so.” “We must not
then say that God is perfect, and Creator, and Almighty, through the world?” “No; for He
must surely by Himself, and not by the world, and that changeable, be found perfect by
Himself.” “Quite so.” “But you will say that the rich man is called rich on account of his
riches? And that the wise man is called wise not as being wisdom itself, but as being a possessor
of substantial wisdom?” “Yes.” “Well, then, since God is something different from
the world, shall He be called on account of the world rich, and beneficent, and Creator?”
“By no means. Away with such a thought!” “Well, then, He is His own riches, and is by
Himself rich and powerful.” “So it seems.” “He was then before the world altogether independent,
being Father, and Almighty, and Creator; so that He by Himself, and not by another,
was this.” “It must be so.” “Yes; for if He were acknowledged to be Almighty on account of
the world, and not of Himself, being distinct from the world,—may God forgive the words,
which the necessity of the argument requires,—He would by Himself be imperfect and have
need of these things, through which He is marvellously Almighty and Creator. We must
not then admit this pestilent sin of those who say concerning God, that He is Almighty and
Creator by the things which He controls and creates, which are changeable, and that He is
not so by Himself.”</p>
<p>III. Now consider it thus: “If, you say, the world was created later, not existing before,
then we must change the passionless and unchangeable God; for it must needs be, that he
who did nothing before, but afterwards, passes from not doing to doing, changes and is
altered.” Then I said, “Did God rest from making the world, or not?” “He rested.” “Because
otherwise it would not have been completed.” “True.” “If, then, the act of making, after not
making, makes an alteration in God, does not His ceasing to make after making the same?”
“Of necessity.” “But should you say that He is altered as not doing to-day, from what He

<pb n="865"/>
was, when He was doing?” “By no means. There is no necessity for His being changed, when
He makes the world from what He was when He was not making it; and neither is there any
necessity for saying that the universe must have co-existed with Him, on account of our not
being forced to say that He has changed, nor that the universe is co-eternal with Him.”</p>
<p>IV. But speak to me thus: “Should you call that a thing created which had no beginning
of its creation?” “Not at all.” “But if there is no beginning of its creation, it is of necessity
uncreated. But if it was created, you will grant that it was created by some cause. For it is
altogether impossible that it should have a beginning without a cause.” “It is impossible.”
“Shall we say, then, that the world and the things which are in it, having come into existence
and formerly not existing, are from any other cause than God?” “It is plain that they are
from God.” “Yes; for it is impossible that that which is limited by an existence which has a
beginning should be co-existent with the infinite.” “It is impossible.” “But again, O Centaur,
let us consider it from the beginning. Do you say that the things which exist were created
by Divine knowledge or not?” “Oh, begone, they will say; not at all.” “Well, but was it from
the elements, or from matter, or the firmaments, or however you choose to name them, for
it makes no difference; these things existing beforehand uncreated and borne along in a
state of chaos; did God separate them and reduce them all to order, as a good painter who
forms one picture out of many colours?” “No, nor yet this.” For they will quite avoid making
a concession against themselves, lest agreeing that there was a beginning of the separation
and transformation of matter, they should be forced in consistency to say, that in all things
God began the ordering and adorning of matter which hitherto had been without form.</p>
<p>V. But come now, since by the favour of God we have arrived at this point in our discourse;
let us suppose a beautiful statue standing upon its base; and that those who behold
it, admiring its harmonious beauty, differ among themselves, some trying to make out that
it had been made, others that it had not. I should ask them: For what reason do you say that
it was not made? on account of the artist, because he must be considered as never resting
from his work? or on account of the statue itself? If it is on account of the artist, how could
it, as not being made, be fashioned by the artist? But if, when it is moulded of brass, it has
all that is needed in order that it may receive whatever impression the artist chooses, how
can that be said not to be made which submits to and receives his labour? If, again, the statue
is declared to be by itself perfect and not made, and to have no need of art, then we must
allow, in accordance with that pernicious heresy, that it is self-made. If perhaps they are
unwilling to admit this argument, and reply more inconsistently, that they do not say that
the figure was not made, but that it was always made, so that there was no beginning of its
being made, so that artist might be said to have this subject of his art without any beginning.
Well then, my friends, we will say to them, if no time, nor any age before can be found in
the past, when the statue was not perfect, will you tell us what the artist contributed to it,
or wrought upon it? For if this statue has need of nothing, and has no beginning of existence,

<pb n="866"/>
for this reason, according to you, a maker never made it, nor will any maker be found. And
so the argument seems to come again to the same conclusion, and we must allow that it is
self-made. For if an artificer is said to have moved a statue ever so slightly, he will submit
to a beginning, when he began to move and adorn that which was before unadorned and
unmoved. But the world neither was nor will be for ever the same. Now we must compare
the artificer to God, and the statue to the world. But how then, O foolish men, can you
imagine the creation to be co-eternal with its Artificer, and to have no need of an artificer?
For it is of necessity that the co-eternal should never have had a beginning of being, and
should be equally uncreated and powerful with Him. But the uncreated appears to be in itself
perfect and unchangeable, and it will have need of nothing, and be free from corruption.
And if this be so, the world can no longer be, as you say it is, capable of change.</p>
<p>VI. He says that the Church2969 is so called from being called out2970 with respect to
pleasures.</p>
<p>VII. The saint says: We said there are two kinds of formative power in what we have
now acknowledged; the one which works by itself what it chooses, not out of things which
already exist, by its bare will, without delay, as soon as it wills. This is the power of the
Father. The other which adorns and embellishes, by imitation of the former, the things
which already exist. This is the power of the Son, the almighty and powerful hand of the
Father, by which, after creating matter not out of things which were already in existence,
He adorns it.</p>
<p>VIII. The saint says that the Book of Job is by Moses. He says, concerning the words,
“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,”2971 that one will not err who says
that the “Beginning” is Wisdom. For Wisdom is said by one of the Divine band to speak in
this manner concerning herself: “The Lord created me the beginning of His ways for His
works: of old He laid my foundation.”2972 It was fitting and more seemly that all things
which came into existence, should be more recent than Wisdom, since they existed through
her. Now consider whether the saying: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God;”2973—whether
these statements be not in agreement with those. For we must say that the Beginning, out
of which the most upright Word came forth, is the Father and Maker of all things, in whom
it was. And the words, “The same was in the beginning with God,” seem to indicate the
position of authority of the Word, which He had with the Father before the world came into

<pb n="867"/>
existence; “beginning” signifying His power. And so, after the peculiar unbeginning beginning,
who is the Father, He is the beginning of other things, by whom all things are made.</p>
<p>IX. He says that Origen, after having fabled many things concerning the eternity of the
universe, adds this also: Nor yet from Adam, as some say, did man, previously not existing,
first take his existence and come into the world. Nor again did the world begin to be made
six days before the creation of Adam. But if any one should prefer to differ in these points,
let him first say, whether a period of time be not easily reckoned from the creation of the
world, according to the Book of Moses, to those who so receive it, the voice of prophecy
here proclaiming: “Thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.…For a thousand
years in Thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a watch in the night.”2974 For
when a thousand years are reckoned as one day in the sight of God, and from the creation
of the world to His rest is six days, so also to our time, six days are defined, as those say who
are clever arithmeticians. Therefore, they say that an age of six thousand years extends from
Adam to our time. For they say that the judgment will come on the seventh day, that is in
the seventh thousand years. Therefore, all the days from our time to that which was in the
beginning, in which God created the heaven and the earth, are computed to be thirteen
days; before which God, because he had as yet created nothing according to their folly, is
stripped of His name of Father and Almighty. But if there are thirteen days in the sight of
God from the creation of the world, how can Wisdom say, in the Book of the Son of Sirach:
“Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?”2975
This is what Origen says seriously, and mark how he trifles.</p>

<head>General Note.</head>
<p>The Banquet appears to me a genuine work, although, like other writings of this Father,
it may have been corrupted. Tokens of such corruptions are not wanting, and there can be
little doubt that Methodius the monkish artist and missionary of the ninth century has been
often copied into the works of his earlier namesake.2981</p>
<p>In a fragment, for example, found on a preceding page,2982 there is a passage on God’s
image in angels and men, which appears in its more probable form in another fragment,2983
discovered by Combefis. As quoted by St. John Damascene, it is enough to say of it, with
the candid Dupin, “I very much question whether the passage belongs to Methodius; or, if it
does, it must be taken in another sense2984 than that in which Damascene understood it, as
the words which immediately precede seem to intimate.” That it is a positive anachronism
in any other sense, is proved by the history of Images, on which see Epiphanius, quoted by
Faber, Difficulties of Romanism, p. 488, ed. 1830. He gives St. Jerome, Opp., ii. p. 177. A
learned friend suggests that the Rev. J. Endell Tyler’s popular work on Primitive Christian
Worship may supply an accessible reference.2985 It is a very good thought, for the whole
book is worth reading, on other points also.</p>

<head>Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna</head>
<p>On the Day that They Met in the Temple.2986</p>
<p>I. Although I have before, as briefly as possible, in my dialogue on chastity, sufficiently
laid the foundations, as it were, for a discourse on virginity, yet to-day the season has brought
forward the entire subject of the glory of virginity, and its incorruptible crown, for the delightful
consideration of the Church’s foster-children. For to-day the council chamber of
the divine oracles is opened wide, and the signs prefiguring this glorious day, with its effects
and issues, are by the sacred preachers read over to the assembled Church. Today the accomplishment
of that ancient and true counsel is, in fact and deed, gloriously manifested to the
world. Today, without any covering,2987 and with unveiled face, we see, as in a mirror, the
glory of the Lord, and the majesty of the divine ark itself. To-day, the most holy assembly,
bearing upon its shoulders the heavenly joy that was for generations expected, imparts it to
the race of man. “Old things are passed away”2988—things new burst forth into flowers, and
such as fade not away. No longer does the stern decree of the law bear sway, but the grace
of the Lord reigneth, drawing all men to itself by saving long-suffering. No second time is

pain. It repulses none; it shrinks from none; it imparts the gifts of healing, without itself
contracting any disease; for the Lord, who loves and cares for man, in it makes His restingplace.
These are the gifts of this new grace. This is that new and strange thing that has
happened under the sun2993—a thing that never had place before, nor will have place again.
That which God of His compassion toward us foreordained has come to pass, He hath given
it fulfilment because of that love for man which is so becoming to Him. With good right,
therefore, has the sacred trumpet sounded, “Old things are passed away, behold all things
are become new.”2994 And what shall I conceive, what shall I speak worthy of this day? I
am struggling to reach the inaccessible, for the remembrance of this holy virgin far transcends
all words of mine. Wherefore, since the greatness of the panegyric required completely puts
to shame our limited powers, let us betake ourselves to that hymn which is not beyond our
faculties, and boasting in our own2995 unalterable defeat, let us join the rejoicing chorus of
Christ’s flock, who are keeping holy-day. And do you, my divine and saintly auditors, keep
strict silence, in order that through the narrow channel of ears, as into the harbour of the
understanding, the vessel freighted with truth may peacefully sail. We keep festival, not according
to the vain customs of the Greek mythology; we keep a feast which brings with it
no ridiculous or frenzied banqueting2996 of the gods, but which teaches us the wondrous
condescension to us men of the awful glory of Him who is God over all.2997</p>
<p>II. Come, therefore, Isaiah, most solemn of preachers and greatest of prophets, wisely
unfold to the Church the mysteries of the congregation in glory, and incite our excellent
guests abundantly, to satiate themselves with enduring dainties, in order that, placing the
reality which we possess over against that mirror of thine, truthful prophet as thou art, thou
mayest joyfully clap thine hands at the issue of thy predictions. It came to pass, he says, “in
the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up;
and the house was full of His glory. And the seraphim stood round about him: each one
had six wings. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts:
the whole earth is full of His glory. And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of
him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, Woe is me! I am pricked
to the heart, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. And one of the seraphim was sent

And he touched my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is
taken away, and thy sin is purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I
send, and who will go unto this people? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And He said, Go,
and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive
not.”2998 These are the proclamations made beforehand by the prophet through the Spirit.
Do thou, dearly beloved, consider the force of these words. So shalt thou understand the
issue of these sacramental2999 symbols, and know both what and how great this assembling
together of ourselves is. And since the prophet has before spoken of this miracle, come thou,
and with the greatest ardour and exultation, and alacrity of heart, together with the keenest
sagacity of thine intelligence, and therewith approach Bethlehem the renowned, and place
before thy mind an image clear and distinct, comparing the prophecy with the actual issue
of events. Thou wilt not stand in need of many words to come to a knowledge of the matter;
only fix thine eyes on the things which are taking place there. “All things truly are plain to
them that understand, and right to them that find knowledge.”3000 For, behold, as a throne
high and lifted up by the glory of Him that fashioned it, the virgin-mother is there made
ready, and that most evidently for the King, the Lord of hosts. Upon this, consider the Lord
now coming unto thee in sinful flesh. Upon this virginal throne, I say, worship Him who
now comes to thee by this new and ever-adorable way. Look around thee with the eye of
faith, and thou wilt find around Him, as by the ordinance of their courses,3001 the royal and
priestly company of the seraphim. These, as His bodyguard, are ever wont to attend the
presence of their king. Whence also in this place they are not only said to hymn with their
praises the divine substance of the divine unity, but also the glory to be adored by all of that
one of the sacred Trinity, which now, by the appearance of God in the flesh, hath even
lighted upon earth. They say: “The whole earth is full of His glory.” For we believe that, together
with the Son, who was made man for our sakes, according to the good pleasure of
His will,3002 was also present the Father, who is inseparable from Him as to His divine
nature, anal also the Spirit, who is of one and the same essence with Him.3003 For, as says

Paul, the interpreter of the divine oracle,3004 “God was in Christ reconciling the world unto

<p>III. Do thou, therefore, O lover of this festival, when thou hast considered well the
glorious mysteries of Bethlehem, which were brought to pass for thy sake, gladly join thyself
to the heavenly host, which is celebrating magnificently thy salvation.3006 As once David
did before the ark, so do thou, before this virginal throne, joyfully lead the dance. Hymn
with gladsome song the Lord, who is always and everywhere present, and Him who from
Teman,3007 as says the prophet, hath thought fit to appear, and that in the flesh, to the race
of men. Say, with Moses, “He is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father’s God, and I will
exalt Him.”3008 Then, after thine hymn of thanksgiving, we shall usefully inquire what cause
aroused the King of Glory to appear in Bethlehem. His compassion for us compelled Him,
who cannot be compelled, to be born in a human body at Bethlehem. But what necessity
was there that He, when a suckling infant,3009 that He who, though both in time, was not
limited by time, that He, who though wrapped in swaddling clothes, was not by them held
fast, what necessity was there that He should be an exile and a stranger from His country?
Should you, forsooth, wish to know this, ye congregation most holy, and upon whom the
Spirit of God hath breathed, listen to Moses proclaiming plainly to the people, stimulating
them, as it were, to the knowledge of this extraordinary nativity, and saying, “Every male
that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord.”3010 O wondrous circumstance!
“O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!”3011 It became indeed
the Lord of the law and the prophets to do all things in accordance with His own law, and
not to make void the law, but to fulfil it, and rather to connect with the fulfilment of the law

the beginning of His grace. Therefore it is that the mother, who was superior to the law,
submits to the law. And she, the holy and undefiled one, observes that time of forty days
that was appointed for the unclean. And He who makes us free from the law, became subject
to the law; and there is offered for Him, who hath sanctified us, a pair of clean birds,3012 in
testimony of those who approach clean and blameless. Now that that parturition was unpolluted,
and stood not in need of expiatory victims, Isaiah is our witness, who proclaims distinctly
to the whole earth under the sun: “Before she travailed,” he says, “she brought forth;
before her pains came, she escaped, and brought forth a man-child.”3013 Who hath heard
such a thing? Who hath seen such things? The must holy virgin mother, therefore, escaped
entirely the manner of women even before she brought forth: doubtless, in order that the
Holy Spirit, betrothing her unto Himself, and sanctifying her, she might conceive without
intercourse with man. She hath brought forth her first-born Son, even the only-begotten
Son of God, Him, I say, who in the heavens above shone forth as the only-begotten, without
mother, from out His Father’s substance, and preserved the virginity of His natural unity
undivided and inseparable; and who on earth, in the virgin’s nuptial chamber, joined to
Himself the nature of Adam, like a bridegroom, by an inalienable union, and preserved His
mother’s purity uncorrupt and uninjured—Him, in short, who in heaven was begotten
without corruption, and on earth brought forth in a manner quite unspeakable. But to return
to our subject.</p>
<p>IV. Therefore the prophet brought the virgin from Nazareth, in order that she might
give birth at Bethlehem to her salvation-bestowing child, and brought her back again to
Nazareth, in order to make manifest to the world the hope of life. Hence it was that the ark
of God removed from the inn at Bethlehem, for there He paid to the law that debt of the
forty days, due not to justice but to grace, and rested upon the mountains of Sion, and receiving
into His pure bosom as upon a lofty throne, and one transcending the nature of
man, the Monarch of all,3014 she presented Him there to God the Father, as the joint-partner
of His throne and inseparable from His nature, together with that pure and undefiled flesh
which he had of her substance assumed. The holy mother goes up to the temple to exhibit
to the law a new and strange wonder, even that child long expected, who opened the virgin’s
womb, and yet did not burst the barriers of virginity; that child, superior to the law, who
yet fulfilled the law; that child that was at once before the law, and yet after it; that child, in
short, who was of her incarnate beyond the law of nature.3015 For in other cases every womb
being first opened by connection with a man, and, being impregnated by his seed, receives

the beginning of conception, and by the pangs which make perfect parturition, doth at
length bring forth to light its offspring endowed with reason, and with its nature consistent,
in accordance with the wise provision of God its Creator. For God said, “Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth.” But the womb of this virgin, without being opened before,
or being impregnated with seed, gave birth to an offspring that transcended nature, while
at the same time it was cognate to it, and that without detriment to the indivisible unity, so
that the miracle was the more stupendous, the prerogative of virginity likewise remaining
intact. She goes up, therefore to the temple, she who was more exalted than the temple,
clothed with a double glory—the glory, I say, of undefiled virginity, and that of ineffable
fecundity, the benediction of the law, and the sanctification of grace. Wherefore he says
who saw it: “And the whole house was full of His glory, and the seraphim stood round about
him; and one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole
earth is full of His glory.”3016 As also the blessed prophet Habakkuk has charmingly sung,
saying, “In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known: as the years draw nigh
thou shalt be recognised—when the time is come thou shalt be shown forth.”3017 See, I pray
you, the exceeding accuracy of the Spirit. He speaks of knowledge, recognition, showing
forth. As to the first of these: “In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known,”3018
he refers to that overshadowing of the divine glory which, in the time of the law, rested in
the Holy of holies upon the covering of the ark, between the typical cherubim, as He says
to Moses, “There will I be known to thee.”3019 But He refers likewise to that concourse of
angels, which hath now come to meet us, by the divine and ever adorable manifestation of
the Saviour Himself in the flesh, although He in His very nature cannot be beheld by us, as
Isaiah has even before declared. But when He says, “As the years draw nigh, thou shalt be
recognised,” He means, as has been said before, that glorious recognition of our Saviour,
God in the flesh, who is otherwise invisible to mortal eye; as somewhere Paul, that great
interpreter of sacred mysteries, says: “But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent
forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the
law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.”3020 And then, as to that which is subjoined,
“When the time is come, Thou shalt be shown forth,” what exposition doth this require, if
a man diligently direct the eye of his mind to the festival which we are now celebrating?
“For then shalt Thou be shown forth,” He says, “as upon a kingly charger, by Thy pure and
chaste mother, in the temple, and that in the grace and beauty of the flesh assumed by Thee.”

All these things the prophet, summing up for the sake of greater clearness, exclaims in brief:
“The Lord is in His holy temple;”3021 “Fear before Him all the earth.”3022</p>
<p>V. Tremendous, verily, is the mystery connected with thee, O virgin mother, thou
spiritual throne, glorified and made worthy of God.3023 Thou hast brought forth, before
the eyes of those in heaven and earth, a pre-eminent wonder. And it is a proof of this, and
an irrefragable argument, that at the novelty of thy supernatural child-bearing, the angels
sang on earth, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men,”3024
by their threefold song bringing in a threefold holiness.3025 Blessed art thou among the
generations of women, O thou of God most blessed, for by thee the earth has been filled
with that divine glory of God; as in the Psalms it is sung: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen. Amen.”3026 And the posts of the
door, says the prophet, moved at the voice of him that cried, by which is signified the veil
of the temple drawn before the ark of the covenant, which typified thee, that the truth might
be laid open to me, and also that I might be taught, by the types and figures which went
before, to approach with reverence and trembling to do honour to the sacred mystery which
is connected with thee; and that by means of this prior shadow-painting of the law I might
be restrained from boldly and irreverently contemplating with fixed gaze Him who, in His
incomprehensibility, is seated far above all.3027 For if to the ark, which was the image and
type of thy sanctity, such honour was paid of God that to no one but to the priestly order
only was the access to it open, or ingress allowed to behold it, the veil separating it off, and
keeping the vestibule as that of a queen, what, and what sort of veneration is due to thee
from us who are of creation the least, to thee who art indeed a queen; to thee, the living ark
of God, the Lawgiver; to thee, the heaven that contains Him who can be contained of none?

brought forth the Sun of Righteousness, that hateful horror of darkness has been chased
away; the power of the tyrant has been broken, death hath been destroyed, hell swallowed
up, and all enmity dissolved before the face of peace; noxious diseases depart now that salvation

flee away.”3029 Since then, the God of gods hath appeared in Sion, and the splendour of His
beauty hath appeared in Jerusalem; and “a light has sprung up for the righteous, and joy for
those who are true of heart.”3030 According to the blessed David, the Perfecter and Lord of
the perfected3031 hath, by the Holy Spirit, called the teacher and minister of the law to
minister and testify of those things which were done.</p>
<p>VI. Hence the aged Simeon, putting off the weakness of the flesh, and putting on the
strength of hope, in the face of the law hastened to receive the Minister of the law, the
Teacher3032 with authority, the God of Abraham, the Protector of Isaac, the Holy One of
Israel, the Instructor of Moses; Him, I say, who promised to show him His divine incarnation,
as it were His hinder parts;3033 Him who, in the midst of poverty, was rich; Him who in
infancy was before the ages; Him who, though seen, was invisible; Him who in comprehension
was incomprehensible; Him who, though in littleness, yet surpassed all magnitude—at
one and the same time in the temple and in the highest heavens—on a royal throne, and on
the chariot of the cherubim Him who is both above and below continuously; Him who is
in the form of a servant, and in the form of God the Father; a subject, and yet King of all.
He was entirely given up to desire, to hope, to joy; he was no longer his own, but His who
had been looked for. The Holy Spirit had announced to him the joyful tidings, and before
he reached the temple, carried aloft by the eyes of his understanding, as if even now he
possessed what he had longed for, he exulted with joy. Being thus led on, and in his haste
treading the air with his steps, he reaches the shrine hitherto held sacred; but, not heeding
the temple, he stretches out his holy arms to the Ruler of the temple, chanting forth in song
such strains as become the joyous occasion: I long for Thee, O Lord God of my fathers, and
Lord of mercy, who hast deigned, of Thine own glory and goodness, which provides for all,
of Thy gracious condescension, with which Thou inclinest towards us, as a Mediator
bringing peace, to establish harmony between earth and heaven. I seek Thee, the Great

joy, that which had before been spoken of in a figure by the prophet Isaiah, the holy mother

living and ineffable, with man’s flesh invested, in the embrace of her sacred hands, as it were
with the tongs, she held Him out to that just one, addressing and exhorting him, as it seems

receive the Lord, and reap the full fruition of that hope of thine which is not left widowed
and desolate. Receive, thou of men the most illustrious, the unfailing treasure, and those
riches which can never be taken away. Take to thine embrace, O thou of men most wise,
that unspeakable might, that unsearchable power, which can alone support thee. Embrace,
thou minister of the temple, the Greatness infinite, and the Strength incomparable. Fold
thyself around Him who is the very life itself, and live, O thou of men most venerable. Cling
closely to incorruption and be renewed, O thou of men most righteous. Not too bold is the
attempt; shrink not from it then, O thou of men most holy. Satiate thyself with Him thou
hast longed for, and take thy delight in Him who has been given, or rather who gives Himself
to thee, O thou of men most divine. Joyfully draw thy light, O thou of men most pious, from
the Sun of Righteousness, that gleams around thee through the unsullied mirror of the flesh.
Fear not His gentleness, nor let His clemency terrify thee, O thou of men most blessed. Be
not afraid of His lenity, nor shrink from His kindness, O thou of men most modest. Join
thyself to Him with alacrity, and delay not to obey Him. That which is spoken to thee, and
held out to thee, savours not of over-boldness. Be not then reluctant, O thou of men the
most decorous. The flame of the grace of my Lord does not consume, but illuminates thee,
O thou of men most just.3044 Let the bush which set forth me in type, with respect to the
verity of that fire which yet had no subsistence, teach thee this, O thou who art in the law
the best instructed.3045 Let that furnace which was as it were a breeze distilling dew persuade
thee, O master, of the dispensation of this mystery. Then, beside all this, let my womb be a
proof to thee, in which He was contained, who in nought else was ever contained, of the
substance of which the incarnate Word yet deigned to become incarnate. The blast3046 of
the trumpet does not now terrify those who approach, nor a second time does the mountain
all on smoke cause terror to those who draw nigh, nor indeed does the law punish relentlessly3047
those who would boldly touch. What is here present speaks of love to man; what

is here apparent, of the Divine condescension. Thankfully, then, receive the God who comes
to thee, for He shall take away thine iniquities, and thoroughly purge thy sins. In thee, let
the cleansing of the world first, as in type, have place. In thee, and by thee, let that justification
which is of grace become known beforehand to the Gentiles. Thou art worthy of the quickening
first-fruits. Thou hast made good use of the law. Use grace henceforth. With the letter
thou hast grown weary; in the spirit be renewed. Put off that which is old, and clothe thyself
with that which is new. For of these matters I think not that thou art ignorant.</p>
<p>VIII. Upon all this that righteous man, waxing bold and yielding to the exhortation of
the mother of God, who is the handmaid of God in regard to the things which pertain to
men, received into his aged arms Him who in infancy was yet the Ancient of days, and
blessed God, and said, “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to
Thy word: for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face
of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.”3048 I have
received from Thee a joy unmixed with pain. Do thou, O Lord, receive me rejoicing, and
singing of Thy mercy and compassion. Thou hast given unto me this joy of heart. I render
unto Thee with gladness my tribute of thanksgiving. I have known the power of the love of
God. Since, for my sake, God of Thee begotten, in a manner ineffable, and without corruption,
has become man. I have known the inexplicable greatness of Thy love and care for us, for
Thou hast sent forth Thine own bowels to come to our deliverance. Now, at length, I understand
what I had from Solomon learned: “Strong as death is love: for by it shall the sting of
death be done away, by it shall the dead see life, by it shall even death learn what death is,
being made to cease from that dominion which over us he exercised. By it, also, shall the
serpent, the author of our evils, be taken captive and overwhelmed.”3049 Thou hast made
known to us, O Lord, Thy salvation,3050 causing to spring up for us the plant of peace, and
we shall no longer wander in error. Thou hast made known to us, O Lord, that Thou hast
not unto the end overlooked Thy servants; neither hast Thou, O beneficent One, forgotten
entirely the works of Thine hands. For out of Thy compassion for our low estate Thou hast
shed forth upon us abundantly that goodness of Thine which is inexhaustible, and with Thy
very nature cognate, having redeemed us by Thine only begotten Son, who is unchangeably
like to Thee, and of one substance with Thee; judging it unworthy of Thy majesty and
goodness to entrust to a servant the work of saving and benefiting Thy servants, or to cause
that those who had offended should be reconciled by a minister. But by means of that light,
which is of one substance with Thee, Thou hast given light to those that sat in darkness3051

<pb n="882"/>
and in the shadow of death, in order that in Thy light they might see the light of knowledge;
3052 and it has seemed good to Thee, by means of our Lord and Creator, to fashion
us again unto immortality; and Thou hast graciously given unto us a return to Paradise by
means of Him who separated us from the joys of Paradise; and by means of Him who hath
power to forgive sins Thou hast3053 blotted out the handwriting which was against us.3054
Lastly, by means of Him who is a partaker of Thy throne and who cannot be separated from
Thy divine nature, Thou hast given unto us the gift of reconciliation and access unto Thee
with confidence in order that, by the Lord who recognises the sovereign authority of none,
by the true and omnipotent God, the subscribed sanction, as it were, of so many and such
great blessings might constitute the justifying gifts of grace to be certain and indubitable
rights to those who have obtained mercy. And this very thing the prophet before had announced
in the words: No ambassador, nor angel, but the Lord Himself saved them; because
He loved them, and spared them, and He took them up, and exalted them.3055 And all this
was, not of works of righteousness3056 which we have done, nor because we loved Thee,—for
our first earthly forefather, who was honourably entertained, in the delightful abode of
Paradise, despised Thy divine and saving commandment, and was judged unworthy of that
life-giving place, and mingling his seed with the bastard off-shoots of sin, he rendered it
very weak;—but Thou, O Lord, of Thine own self, and of Thine ineffable love toward the
creature of Thine hands, hast confirmed Thy mercy toward us, and, pitying our estrangement
from Thee, hast moved Thyself at the sight of our degradation3057 to take us into compassion.
Hence, for the future, a joyous festival is established for us of the race of Adam, because the
first Creator of Adam of His own free-will has become the Second Adam. And the brightness
of the Lord our God hath come down to sojourn with us, so that we see God face to face,
and are saved. Therefore, O Lord, I seek of Thee to be allowed to depart. I have seen Thy
salvation; let me be delivered from the bent yoke of the letter. I have seen the King Eternal,
to whom no other succeeds; let me be set free from this servile and burdensome chain. I
have seen Him who is by nature my Lord and Deliverer; may I obtain, then, His decree for
my deliverance. Set me free from the yoke of condemnation, and place me under the yoke
of justification. Deliver me from the yoke of the curse, and of the letter that killeth;3058 and

<p>IX. Let then, says he, what I have thus far said in brief, suffice for the present as my offering
of thanks to God. But what shall I say to thee, O mother-virgin and virgin-mother?
For the praise even of her who is not man’s work exceeds the power of man. Wherefore the
dimness of my poverty I will make bright with the splendour of the gifts of the spirits that
around thee shine, and offering to thee of thine own, from the immortal meadows I will
pluck a garland for thy sacred and divinely crowned head. With thine ancestral hymns will
I greet thee, O daughter of David, and mother of the Lord and God of David. For it were
both base and inauspicious to adorn thee, who in thine own glory excellest with that which
belongeth unto another. Receive, therefore, O lady most benignant, gifts precious, and such
as are fitted to thee alone, O thou who art exalted above all generations, and who, amongst
all created things, both visible and invisible, shinest forth as the most honourable. Blessed
is the root of Jesse, and thrice blessed is the house of David, in which thou hast sprung
up.3059 God is in the midst of thee, and thou shalt not be moved, for the Most High hath
made holy the place of His tabernacle. For in thee the covenants and oaths made of God
unto the fathers have received a most glorious fulfilment, since by thee the Lord hath appeared,
the God of hosts with us. That bush which could not be touched,3060 which beforehand
shadowed forth thy figure endowed with divine majesty, bare God without being
consumed, who manifested Himself to the prophet just so far as He willed to be seen. Then,
again, that hard and rugged rock,3061 which imaged forth the grace and refreshment which
has sprung out from thee for all the world, brought forth abundantly in the desert out of its
thirsty sides a healing draught for the fainting people. Yea, moreover, the rod of the priest
which, without culture, blossomed forth in fruit,3062 the pledge and earnest of a perpetual
priesthood, furnished no contemptible symbol of thy supernatural child-bearing.3063 What,
moreover? Hath not the mighty Moses expressly declared, that on account of these types of
thee, hard to be understood,3064 he delayed longer on the mountain, in order that he might
learn, O holy one, the mysteries that with thee are connected? For being commanded to
build the ark as a sign and similitude of this thing, he was not negligent in obeying the
command, although a tragic occurrence happened on his descent from the mount; but
having made it in size five cubits and a half, he appointed it to be the receptacle of the law,

and covered it with the wings of the cherubim, most evidently pre-signifying thee, the
mother of God, who hast conceived Him without corruption, and in an ineffable manner
brought forth Him who is Himself, as it were, the very consistence of incorruption, and that
within the limits of the five and a half circles of the world. On thy account, and the undefiled
Incarnation of God, the Word, which by thee had place for the sake of that flesh which immutably
and indivisibly remains with Him for ever.3065 The golden pot also, as a most certain
type, preserved the manna contained in it, which in other cases was changed day by day,
unchanged, and keeping fresh for ages. The prophet Elijah3066 likewise, as prescient of thy
chastity, and being emulous of it through the Spirit, bound around him the crown of that
fiery life, being by the divine decree adjudged superior to death. Thee also, prefiguring his
successor Elisha,3067 having been instructed by a wise master, and anticipating thy presence
who wast not yet born, by certain sure indications of the things that would have place
hereafter,3068 ministered help and healing to those who were in need of it, which was of a
virtue beyond nature; now with a new cruse, which contained healing salt, curing the deadly
waters, to show that the world was to be recreated by the mystery manifested in thee; now
with unleavened meal, in type responding to thy child-bearing, without being defiled by the
seed of man, banishing from the food the bitterness of death; and then again, by efforts
which transcended nature, rising superior to the natural elements in the Jordan, and thus
exhibiting, in signs beforehand, the descent of our Lord into Hades, and His wonderful deliverance
of those who were held fast in corruption. For all things yielded and succumbed
to that divine image which prefigured thee.</p>
<p>X. But why do I digress, and lengthen out my discourse, giving it the rein with these
varied illustrations, and that when the truth of thy matter stands like a column before the
eye, in which it were better and more profitable to luxuriate and delight in? Wherefore,
bidding adieu to the spiritual narrations and wondrous deeds of the saints throughout all
ages, I pass on to thee who art always to be had in remembrance, and who holdest the helm,
as it were, of this festival.3069</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, all-blessed, and to be desired of all. Blessed of the Lord is thy name,
full of divine grace, and grateful exceedingly to God, mother of God, thou that givest light

to the faithful. Thou art the circumscription, so to speak, of Him who cannot be circumscribed;
the root3070 of the most beautiful flower; the mother of the Creator; the nurse of
the Nourisher; the circumference of Him who embraces all things; the upholder of Him3071

than this? What than this is more sublime? He who fills earth and heaven,3078 whose are all
things, has become in need of thee, for thou hast lent to God that flesh which He had not.
Thou hast clad the Mighty One with that beauteous panoply of the body by which it has
become possible for Him to be seen by mine eyes. And I, in order that I might freely approach
to behold Him, have received that by which all the fiery darts of the wicked shall be
quenched.3079 Hail! hail! mother and handmaid of God. Hail! hail! thou to whom the great

have glorified with a divine honour her whom He, as being without a father, even as she
was without a husband, Himself has written down as mother. Even so must these things be.

For the hymns3081 which we offer to thee, O thou most holy and admirable habitation of
God, are no merely useless and ornamental words. Nor, again, is thy spiritual laudation
mere secular trifling, or the shoutings of a false flattery, O thou who of God art praised; thou
who to God gavest suck; who by nativity givest unto mortals their beginning of being, but
they are of clear and evident truth. But the time would fail us, ages and succeeding generations
too, to render unto thee thy fitting salutation as the mother of the King Eternal,3082 even
as somewhere the illustrious prophet says, teaching us how incomprehensible thou art.3083
How great is the house of God, and how large is the place of His possession! Great, and hath
none end, high and unmeasurable. For verily, verily, this prophetic oracle, and most true
saying, is concerning thy majesty; for thou alone hast been thought worthy to share with
God the things of God; who hast alone borne in the flesh Him, who of God the Father was
the Eternally and Only-Begotten. So do they truly believe who hold fast to the pure faith.3084</p>
<p>XI. But for the time that remains, my most attentive hearers, let us take up the old man,
the receiver of God, and our pious teacher, who hath put in here, as it were, in safety from
that virginal sea, and let us refresh him, both satisfied as to his divine longing, and conveying
to us this most blessed theology; and let us ourselves follow out the rest of our discourse,
directing our course unerringly with reference to our prescribed end, and that under the
guidance of God the Almighty, so shall we not be found altogether unfruitful and unprofitable
as to what is required of us. When, then, to these sacred rites, prophecy and the priesthood
had been jointly called, and that pair of just ones elected of God—Simeon, I mean, and
Anna, bearing in themselves most evidently the images of both peoples—had taken their
station by the side of that glorious and virginal throne,—for by the old man was represented
the people of Israel, and the law now waxing old; whilst the widow represents the Church
of the Gentiles, which had been up to this point a widow,—the old man, indeed, as personating
the law, seeks dismissal; but the widow, as personating the Church, brought her joyous
confession of faith3085 and spake of Him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem,
even as the things that were spoken of both have been appositely and excellently recorded,
and quite in harmony with the sacred festival. For it was fitting and necessary that the old
man who knew so accurately that decree of the law, in which it is said: Hear Him, and every
soul that will not hearken unto Him shall be cut off from His people,3086 should seek a

peaceful discharge from the tutorship of the law; for in truth it were insolence and presumption,
when the king is present and addressing the people, for one of his attendants to make
a speech over against him, and that to this man his subjects should incline their ears. It was
necessary, too, that the widow who had been increased with gifts beyond measure, should
in festal strains return her thanks to God; and so the things which there took place were
agreeable to the law. But, for what remains, it is necessary to inquire how, since the prophetic
types and figures bear, as has been shown, a certain analogy and relation to this prominent
feast, it is said that the house was filled with smoke. Nor does the prophet say this incidentally,
but with significance, speaking of that cry of the Thrice-Holy,3087 uttered by the
heavenly seraphs. You will discover the meaning of this, my attentive hearer, if you do but
take up and examine what follows upon this narration: For hearing, he says, ye shall hear,
and shall not understand; and seeing, ye shall see, and not perceive.3088 When, therefore,
the foolish Jewish children had seen the glorious wonders which, as David sang, the Lord
had performed in the earth, and had seen the sign from the depth3089 and from the height
meeting together, without division or confusion; as also Isaiah had before declared, namely,
a mother beyond nature, and an offspring beyond reason; an earthly mother and a heavenly
son; a new taking of man’s nature, I say, by God, and a child-bearing without marriage;
what in creation’s circuit could be more glorious and more to be spoken of than this! yet
when they had seen this it was all one as if they had not seen it; they closed their eyes, and
in respect of praise were supine. Therefore the house in which they boasted was filled with
smoke.</p>
<p>XII. And in addition to this, when besides the spectacle, and even beyond the spectacle,
they heard an old man, very righteous, very worthy of credit, worthy also of emulation, inspired
by the Holy Spirit, a teacher of the law, honoured with the priesthood, illustrious in
the gift of prophecy, by the hope which he had conceived of Christ, extending the limits of
life, and putting off the debt of death—when they saw him, I say, leaping for joy, speaking
words of good omen, quite transformed with gladness of heart, entirely rapt in a divine and
holy ecstasy; who from a man had been changed into an angel by a godly change, and, for
the immensity of his joy, chanted his hymn of thanksgiving, and openly proclaimed the
“Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.”3090 Not even then were
they willing to hear what was placed within their hearing, and held in veneration by the
heavenly beings themselves; wherefore the house in which they boasted was filled with
smoke. Now smoke is a sign and sure evidence of wrath; as it is written, “There went up a

smoke in His anger, and fire from His countenance devoured;”3091 and in another place,
“Amongst the disobedient people shall the fire burn,”3092 which plainly, in the revered
Gospels, our Lord signified, when He said to the Jews, “Behold your house is left unto you
desolate.”3093 Also, in another place, “The king sent forth his armies, and destroyed those
murderers, and burnt up their city.”3094 Of such a nature was the adverse reward of the Jews
for their unbelief, which caused them to refuse to pay to the Trinity the tribute of praise.
For after that the ends of the earth were sanctified, and the mighty house of the Church was
filled, by the proclamation of the Thrice Holy, with the glory of the Lord, as the great waters
cover the seas,3095 there happened to them the things which before had been declared, and
the beginning of prophecy was confirmed by its issue, the preacher of truth signifying, as
has been said, by the Holy Spirit, as it were in an example, the dreadful destruction which
was to come upon them, in the words: “In the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the
Lord”—Uzziah, doubtless, as an apostate, being taken as the representative of the whole
apostate body—the head of which he certainly was—who also, paying the penalty due to
his presumption, carried on his forehead, as upon a brazen statue, the divine vengeance
engraved, by the loathsomeness of leprosy, exhibiting to all the retribution of their loathsome
impiety. Wherefore with divine wisdom did he, who had foreknowledge of these events,
oppose the bringing in of the thankful Anna to the casting out of the ungrateful synagogue.
Her very name also pre-signifies the Church, that by the grace of Christ and God is justified
in baptism. For Anna is, by interpretation, grace.</p>

reef the sails of our oration, in order that it may be with itself commensurate. Only first, in

is come, the Light Eternal, the Light for ever enduring, the Light Supreme, the Light Immaterial,
the Light of one substance with God and the Father, the Light which is in the Spirit,
and in which is the Father; the Light which illumines the ages; the Light which gives light

That Lord, I say, who in His simple and immaterial Deity, entered our nature, and of the
virgin’s womb became ineffably incarnate; that Lord, who was partaker of nothing else save
the lump of Adam, who was by the serpent tripped up. For the Lord laid not hold of the
seed of angels3099—those, I say, who fell not away from that beauteous order and rank that
was assigned to them from the beginning. To us He condescended, that Word who was always
with the Father co-existent God. Nor, again, did He come into the world to restore; nor will
He restore, as has been imagined by some impious advocates of the devil, those wicked
demons who once fell from light; but when the Creator and Framer of all things had, as the
most divine Paul says, laid hold of the seed of Abraham, and through him of the whole human
race, He was made man for ever, and without change, in order that by His fellowship with
us, and our joining on to Him, the ingress of sin into us might be stopped, its strength being
broken by degrees, and itself as wax being melted, by that fire which the Lord, when He
came, sent upon the earth.3100 Hail to thee, thou Catholic Church,3101 which hast been
planted in all the earth, and do thou rejoice with us. Fear not, little flock, the storms of the
enemy,3102 for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom, and that you should
tread upon the necks of your enemies.3103 Hail, and rejoice, thou that wast once barren,
and without seed unto godliness, but who hast now many children of faith.3104 Hail, thou
people of the Lord, thou chosen generation, thou royal priesthood, thou holy nation, thou
peculiar people—show forth His praises who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous

<p>XIV. Hail to thee for ever, thou virgin mother of God, our unceasing joy, for unto thee
do I again return.3106 Thou art the beginning of our feast; thou art its middle and end;3107
the pearl of great price that belongest unto the kingdom; the fat of every victim, the living
altar of the bread of life. Hail, thou treasure of the love of God. Hail, thou fount of the Son’s
love for man. Hail, thou overshadowing mount3108 of the Holy Ghost. Thou gleamedst,
sweet gift-bestowing mother, of the light of the sun; thou gleamedst with the insupportable
fires of a most fervent charity, bringing forth in the end that which was conceived of thee
before the beginning, making manifest the mystery hidden and unspeakable, the invisible
Son of the Father—the Prince of Peace, who in a marvellous manner showed Himself as
less than all littleness. Wherefore, we pray thee, the most excellent among women, who
boastest in the confidence of thy maternal honours, that thou wouldest unceasingly keep
us in remembrance. O holy mother of God, remember us, I say, who make our boast in thee,
and who in hymns august celebrate the memory, which will ever live, and never fade away.
And do thou also, O honoured and venerable Simeon, thou earliest host of our holy religion,
and teacher of the resurrection of the faithful, be our patron and advocate with that Saviour
God, whom thou wast deemed worthy to receive into thine arms. We, together with thee,
sing our praises to Christ, who has the power of life and death, saying, Thou art the true
Light, proceeding from the true Light; the true God, begotten of the true God; the one Lord,
before Thine assumption of the humanity; that One nevertheless, after Thine assumption
of it, which is ever to be adored; God of Thine own self and not by grace, but for our sakes
also perfect man; in Thine own nature the King absolute and sovereign, but for us and for
our salvation existing also in the form of a servant, yet immaculately and without defilement.
For Thou who art incorruption hast come to set corruption free, that Thou mightest render
all things uncorrupt. For Thine is the glory, and the power, and the greatness, and the
majesty, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Oration on the Palms.3109</head>
<p>I. Blessed be God; let us proceed, brethren, from wonders to the miracles of the Lord,
and as it were, from strength to strength.3110 For just as in a golden chain the links are so
intimately joined and connected together, as that the one holds the other, and is fitted on
to it, and so carries on the chain—even so the miracles that have been handed down by the
holy Gospels, one after the other, lead on the Church of God, which delights in festivity,
and refresh it, not with the meat that perisheth, but with that which endureth unto everlasting
life.3111 Come then, beloved, and let us, too, with prepared hearts, and with ears intent,
listen to what the Lord our God shall say unto us out of the prophets and Gospels concerning
this most sacred feast. Verily, He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints, and
to those which turn their hearts unto Him. To-day,3112 the trumpet-blast of the prophets
have roused the world, and have made glad and filled with joyfulness the churches of God
that are everywhere amongst the nations. And, summoning the faithful from the exercise
of holy fasting, and from the palæstra, wherein they struggle against the lusts of the flesh,
they have taught them to sing a new hymn of conquest and a new song of peace to Christ
who giveth the victory. Come then, every one, and let us rejoice in the Lord; O come, all ye
people, and let us clap our hands, and make a joyful noise to God our Saviour, with the voice
of melody.3113 Let no one be without portion in this grace; let no one come short of this
calling; for the seed of the disobedient is appointed to destruction.—Let no one neglect to
meet the King, lest he be shut out from the Bridegroom’s chamber.—Let no one amongst
us be found to receive Him with a sad countenance, lest he be condemned with those wicked
citizens—the citizens, I mean, who refused to receive the Lord as King over them.3114 Let
us all come together cheerfully; let us all receive Him gladly, and hold our feast with all
honesty. Instead of our garments, let us strew our hearts before Him.3115 In psalms and
hymns, let us raise to Him our shouts of thanksgiving; and, without ceasing, let us exclaim,
“Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord;”3116 for blessed are they that bless Him,

and cursed are they that curse Him.3117 Again I will say it, nor will I cease exhorting you to
good, Come, beloved, let us bless Him who is blessed, that we may be ourselves blessed of
Him. Every age and condition does this discourse summon to praise the Lord; kings of the
earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth; both young men and maidens3118—
and what is new in this miracle, the tender and innocent age of babes and sucklings
hath obtained the first place in raising to God with thankful confession the hymn which
was of God taught them in the strains in which Moses sang before to the people when they
came forth out of Egypt—namely, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.”</p>
<p>II. To-day, holy David rejoices with great joy, being by babes despoiled of his lyre, with
whom also, in spirit, leading the dance, and rejoicing together, as of old, before the ark of
God,3119 he mingles musical harmony, and sweetly lisps out in stammering voice, Blessed
is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. Of whom shall we inquire? Tell us, O prophet,
who is this that cometh in the name of the Lord? He will say it is not my part to-day to teach
you, for He hath consecrated the school to infants, who hath out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings perfected praise to destroy the enemy and the avenger,3120 in order that by the
miracle of these the hearts of the fathers might be turned to the children, and the disobedient
unto the wisdom of the just.3121 Tell us, then, O children, whence is this, your beautiful and
graceful contest of song? Who taught it you? Who instructed you? Who brought you together?
What were your tablets? Who were your teachers? Do but you, they say, join us as our
companions in this song and festivity, and you will learn the things which were by Moses
and the prophet earnestly longed for.3122 Since then the children have invited us, and have
given unto us the right hand of fellowship,3123 let us come, beloved, and ourselves emulate
that holy chorus, and with the apostles, let us make way for Him who ascends over the
heaven of heavens towards the East,3124 and who, of His good pleasure, is upon the earth
mounted upon an ass’s colt. Let us, with the children, raise the branches aloft, and with the
olive branches make glad applaud, that upon us also the Holy Spirit may breathe, and that
in due order we may raise the God-taught strain: “Blessed is He that cometh in the name
of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”3125 To-day, also, the patriarch Jacob keeps feast in

spirit, seeing his prophecy brought to a fulfilment, and with the faithful adores the Father,
seeing Him who bound his foal to the vine3126 mounted upon an ass’s colt. To-day the foal
is made ready, the irrational exemplar of the Gentiles, who before were irrational, to signify
the subjection of the people of the Gentiles; and the babes declare their former state of
childhood, in respect of the knowledge of God, and their after perfecting, by the worship of
God and the exercise of the true religion. To-day, according to the prophet,3127 is the King
of Glory glorified upon earth, and makes us, the inhabitants of earth, partakers of the
heavenly feast, that He may show himself to be the Lord of both, even as He is hymned with
the common praises of both. Therefore it was that the heavenly hosts sang, announcing
salvation upon earth, “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of
His glory.”3128 And those below, joining in harmony with the joyous hymns of heaven,
cried: “Hosanna in the highest; Hosanna to the Son of David.” In heaven the doxology was
raised, “Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place;”3129 and on earth was this caught
up in the words, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.”</p>
<p>III. But while these things were doing, and the disciples were rejoicing and praising God
with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, Blessed be the King
that cometh in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest;3130 the city
began to inquire, saying, Who is this?3131 stirring up its hardened and inveterate envy against
the glory of the Lord. But when thou hearest me say the city, understand the ancient and
disorderly multitude of the synagogue. They ungratefully and malignantly ask, Who is this?
as if they had never yet seen their Benefactor, and Him whom divine miracles, beyond the
power of man, had made famous and renowned; for the darkness comprehended not3132
that unsetting light which shone in upon it. Hence quite appositely with respect to them
hath the prophet Isaiah exclaimed, saying, Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may
see. And who is blind, but my children? and deaf, but they that have the dominion over
them?3133 And the servants of the Lord have become blind; ye have often seen, but ye observed
not; your ears are opened, yet ye hear not. See, beloved, how accurate are these words;
how the Divine Spirit, who Himself sees beforehand into the future, has by His saints foretold
of things future as if they were present. For these thankless men saw, and by means of His

miracles handled the wonder-working God, and yet remained in unbelief.3134 They saw a
man, blind from his birth, proclaiming to them the God who had restored his sight. They
saw a paralytic, who had grown up, as it were, and become one with his infirmity, at His
bidding loosed from his disease.3135 They saw Lazarus, who was made an exile from the
region of death.3136 They heard that He had walked on the sea.3137 They heard of the wine
that, without previous culture, was ministered;3138 of the bread that was eaten at that
spontaneous banquet;3139 they heard that the demons had been put to flight; the sick restored
to health.3140 Their very streets proclaimed His deeds of wonder; their roads declared His
healing power to those who journeyed on them. All Judea was filled with His benefit; yet
now, when they hear the divine praises, they inquire, Who is this? O the madness of these
falsely-named teachers! O incredulous fathers! O foolish seniors! O seed of the shameless
Canaan, and not of Judah the devout!3141 The children acknowledge their Creator, but their
unbelieving parents said, Who is this? The age that was young and inexperienced sang
praises to God, while they that had waxen old in wickedness inquired, Who is this? Sucklings
praise His Divinity, while seniors utter blasphemies; children piously offer the sacrifice of
praise, whilst profane priests are impiously indignant.3142</p>
<p>IV. O ye disobedient as regards the wisdom of the just,3143 turn your hearts to your
children. Learn the mysteries of God; the very thing itself which is being done bears witness
that it is God that is thus hymned by uninstructed tongues. Search the Scriptures, as ye have
heard3144 from the Lord; for they are they which testify of Him, and be not ignorant of this
miracle. Hear ye men without grace, and thankless, what good tidings the prophet
Zechariah brings to you. He says, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; behold thy King
cometh unto thee: just and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon the foal of an ass.3145
Why do ye repel the joy? Why, when the sun shineth, do ye love darkness? Why do ye against
unconquerable peace meditate war? If, therefore, ye be the sons of Zion, join in the dance

together with your children. Let the religious service of your children be to you a pretext
for joy. Learn from them who was their Teacher; who called them together; whence was the
doctrine; what means this new theology and old prophecy. And if no man hath taught them
this, but of their own accord they raise the hymn of praise, then recognise the work of God,
even as it is written in the law: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected
praise.”3146 Redouble, therefore, your joy, that you have been made the fathers of such
children who, under the teaching of God, have celebrated with their praises things unknown
to their seniors. Turn your hearts to your children,3147 and close not your eyes against the
truth. But if you remain the same, and hearing, hear not, and seeing, perceive not,3148 and
to no purpose dissent from your children, then shall they be your judges3149 according to
the Saviour’s word. Well, therefore, even this thing also, together with others, has the
prophet Isaiah spoken before of you, saying, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall
his face now wax pale. But when they see their children doing my works, they shall for me
sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. They
also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn
obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace.3150 Seest thou, O foolish
Jew, how from the beginning of his discourse, the prophet declares confusion to you because
of your unbelief. Learn even from him how he proclaims the God-inspired hymn of praise
that is raised by your children, even as the blessed David hath declared beforehand; saying,
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise. Either then,—as is
right,—claim the piety of your children for your own, or devoutly give your children unto
us. We with them will lead the dance, and to the new glory will sing in concert the divinelyinspired
hymn.</p>
<p>V. Once, indeed, the aged Simeon met the Saviour3151 and received in his arms, as an
infant, the Creator of the world, and proclaimed Him to be Lord and God; but now, in the
place of foolish elders, children meet the Saviour, even as Simeon did, and instead of their
arms, strew under Him the branches of trees, and bless the Lord God seated upon a colt, as
upon the cherubim, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name
of the Lord; and together with these let us also exclaim, Blessed is He that cometh, God the
King of Glory, who, for our sakes, became poor, yet, in His own proper estate, being ignorant
of poverty, that with His bounty He might make us rich. Blessed is He who once came in

humility, and who will hereafter come again in glory: at the first, lowly, and seated upon an
ass’s colt, and by infants extolled in order that it might be fulfilled which was written: Thy
goings have been seen, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary; but
at the second time seated on the clouds, in terrible majesty, by angels and powers attended.
O the mellifluous tongue of the children! O the sincere doctrine of those who are well
pleasing to God! David in prophecy hid the spirit under the letter; children, opening their
treasures, brought forth riches upon their tongues, and, in language full of grace, invited
clearly all men to enjoy them. Therefore let us with them draw forth the unfading riches.
In our bosoms insatiate, and in treasure-houses which cannot be filled, let us lay up the divine
gifts. Let us exclaim without ceasing, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!
Very God, in the name of the Very God, the Omnipotent from the Omnipotent, the Son in
the name of the Father. The true King from the true King, whose kingdom, even as His who
begat Him, is with eternity, coeval and pre-existent to it. For this is common to both; nor
does the Scripture attribute this honour to the Son, as if it came from another source, nor
as if it had a beginning, or could be added to or diminished—away with the thought!—but
as that which is His of right by nature, and by a true and proper possession. For the kingdom
of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is one, even as their substance is one and
their dominion one. Whence also, with one and the same adoration, we worship the one
Deity in three Persons, subsisting without beginning, uncreate, without end, and to which
there is no successor. For neither will the Father ever cease to be the Father, nor again the
Son to be the Son and King, nor the Holy Ghost to be what in substance and personality He
is. For nothing of the Trinity will suffer diminution, either in respect of eternity, or of
communion, or of sovereignty. For not on that account is the Son of God called king, because
for our sakes He was made man, and in the flesh cast down the tyrant that was against us,
having, by taking this upon Him, obtained the victory over its cruel enemy, but because He
is always Lord and God; therefore it is that now, both after His assumption of the flesh and
for ever, He remains a king, even as He who begat Him. Speak not, O heretic, against the
kingdom of Christ, lest thou dishonour Him who begat Him. If thou art faithful, in faith
approach Christ, our very God, and not as using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness.
If thou art a servant, with trembling be subject unto thy Master; for he who fights against
the Word is not a well-disposed servant, but a manifest enemy, as it is written: He that
honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent Him.</p>
<p>VI. But let us, beloved, return in our discourse to that point whence we digressed, exclaiming,
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: that good and kind Shepherd,
voluntarily to lay down His life for His sheep. That just as hunters take by a sheep the wolves
that devour sheep, even so the Chief Shepherd,3152 offering Himself as man to the spiritual

<pb n="897"/>
wolves and those who destroy the soul, may make His prey of the destroyers by means of
that Adam who was once preyed on by them. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord: God against the devil; not manifestly in His might, which cannot be looked on, but
in the weakness of the flesh, to bind the strong man3153 that is against us. Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord: the King against the tyrant; not with omnipotent power
and wisdom, but with that which is accounted the foolishness3154 of the cross, which hath
reft his spoils from the serpent who is wise in wickedness. Blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord: the True One against the liar; the Saviour against the destroyer; the Prince
of Peace3155 against him who stirs up wars; the Lover of mankind against the hater of
mankind. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the Lord to have mercy upon
the creature of His hands. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the Lord to
save man who had wandered in error; to put away error; to give light to those who are in
darkness; to abolish the imposture of idols; in its place to bring in the saving knowledge of
God; to sanctify the world; to drive away the abomination and misery of the worship of false
gods. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the one for the many; to deliver
the poor3156 out of the hands of them that are too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy
from him that spoileth him. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, to pour wine
and oil upon him who had fallen amongst thieves,3157 and had been passed by. Blessed is
He that cometh in the name of the Lord: to save us by Himself, as says the prophet; no ambassador,
nor angel, but the Lord Himself saved us.3158 Therefore we also bless Thee, O
Lord; Thou with the Father and the Holy Spirit art blessed before the worlds and for ever.
Before the world, indeed, and until now being devoid of body, but now and for ever henceforth
possessed of that divine humanity which cannot be changed, and from which Thou
art never divided.</p>
<p>VII. Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine evangelist? When the
Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees saw the wonderful things that He did, and the
children crying, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord,3159 they brooked not this honour that was paid Him, and therefore they
came to Him, and thus spake, Hearest Thou not what these say? As if they said, Art Thou

not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which befit God, and God alone? Has
not God of old made it manifest by the prophet, “My glory will I not give unto another;”3160
and how dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God?3161 But what to this answers the longsuffering
One, He who is abundant in mercy,3162 and slow to wrath?3163 He bears with
these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their wrath in check; in His turn He calls the
Scriptures to their remembrance; He brings forward testimony to what is done, and shrinks
not from inquiry. Wherefore He says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then
shall ye know that I am He that doth speak?3164 nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the
enemy and the avenger? Which without doubt are ye, who give heed unto the law, and read
the prophets, while yet ye despise Me who, both by the law and the prophets, have been
beforehand proclaimed. Ye think, indeed, under a pretence of piety, to avenge the glory of
God, not understanding that he that despiseth Me despiseth My Father also.3165 I came
forth from God, and am come into the world,3166 and My glory is the glory of My Father
also. Even thus these foolish ones, being convinced by our Saviour-God, ceased to answer
Him again, the truth stopping their mouths; but adopting a new and foolish device, they
took counsel against Him. But let us sing, Great is our Lord, and great is His power;3167 and
of His understanding there is no number. For all this was done that the Lamb and Son of
God, that taketh away the sins of the world, might, of His own will, and for us, come to His
saving Passion, and might be recognised, as it were, in the market and place of selling; and
that those who bought Him might for thirty pieces of silver covenant for Him who, with
His life-giving blood, was to redeem the world; and that Christ, our passover, might be
sacrificed for us, in order that those who were sprinkled with His precious blood, and sealed
on their lips, as the posts of the door,3168 might escape from the darts of the destroyer; and
that Christ having thus suffered in the flesh, and having risen again the third day, might,
with equal honour and glory with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be by all created things
equally adored; for to Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth,3169 sending up glory to Him, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

adds, “The style of Methodius is Asiatic, diffuse, swelling, and abounding in epithet. His
expressions are figurative, and the turn of his sentences artificial. He is full of similitudes
and far-fetched allegories. His thoughts are mysterious, and he uses many words to say a
few things.” His doctrine, apart from these faults, is sound, and free from some errors
common to the ancients: such faults as I have frequently apologized for in Origen, whom
Methodius so generally condemns.</p>

<head>Three Fragments from the Homily on the Cross and
Passion of Christ.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>I.3172</head>
<p>Methodius, Bishop, to those who say: What doth it profit us that the Son of God was
crucified upon earth, and made man? And wherefore did He endure to suffer in the manner
of the cross, and not by some other punishment? And what was the advantage of the cross?</p>
<p>Christ, the Son of God, by the command of the Father, became conversant with the
visible creature, in order that, by overturning the dominion of the tyrants, the demons, that
is, He might deliver our souls from their dreadful bondage, by reason of which our whole
nature, intoxicated by the draughts of iniquity, had become full of tumult and disorder, and
could by no means return to the remembrance of good and useful things. Wherefore, also,
it was the more easily carried away to idols, inasmuch as evil had overwhelmed it entirely,
and had spread over all generations, on account of the change which had come over our
fleshy tabernacles in consequence of disobedience; until Christ, the Lord, by the flesh in
which He lived and appeared, weakened the force of Pleasure’s onslaughts, by means of
which the infernal powers that were in arms against us reduced our minds to slavery, and
freed mankind from all their evils. For with this end the Lord Jesus both wore our flesh, and
became man, and by the divine dispensation was nailed to the cross; in order that by the
flesh in which the demons had proudly and falsely feigned themselves gods, having carried
our souls captive unto death by deceitful wiles, even by this they might be overturned, and
discovered to be no gods. For he prevented their arrogance from raising itself higher, by
becoming man; in order that by the body in which the race possessed of reason had become
estranged from the worship of the true God, and had suffered injury, even by the same receiving
into itself in an ineffable manner the Word of Wisdom, the enemy might be discovered
to be the destroyers and not the benefactors of our souls. For it had not been wonderful
if Christ, by the terror of His divinity, and the greatness of His invincible power, had
reduced to weakness the adverse nature of the demons. But since this was to cause them
greater grief and torment, for they would have preferred to be overcome by one stronger
than themselves, therefore it was that by a man He procured the safety of the race; in order

from Dupin as follows: “The Père Combefis has collected some other fragments, attributed to Methodius, cited
by St. John Damascene and by Nicetas as drawn out of his books against Porphyry. But, besides that, we cannot
depend upon the authority of these two authors, who are not very exact; these fragments have nothing considerable
and we think it not worth while to say anything more concerning them.”]</note>

that men, after that very Life and Truth had entered into them in bodily form, might be able
to return to the form and light of the Word, overcoming the power of the enticements of
sin; and that the demons, being conquered by one weaker than they, and thus brought into
contempt, might desist from their over-bold confidence, their hellish wrath being repressed.
It was for this mainly that the cross was brought in, being erected as a trophy against iniquity,
and a deterrent from it, that henceforth man might be no longer subject to wrath, after that
he had made up for the defeat which, by his disobedience, he had received, and had lawfully
conquered the infernal powers, and by the gift of God had been set free from every debt.
Since, therefore, the first-born Word of God thus fortified the manhood in which He tabernacled
with the armour of righteousness, He overcame, as has been said, the powers that
enslaved us by the figure of the cross, and showed forth man, who had been oppressed by
corruption, as by a tyrant power, to be free, with unfettered hands. For the cross, if you wish
to define it, is the confirmation of the victory, the way by which God to man descended, the
trophy against material spirits, the repulsion of death, the foundation of the ascent to the
true day; and the ladder for those who are hastening to enjoy the light that is there, the engine
by which those who are fitted for the edifice of the Church are raised up from below, like a
stone four square, to be compacted on to the divine Word. Hence it is that our kings, perceiving
that the figure of the cross is used for the dissipating of every evil, have made vexillas,
as they are called in the Latin language. Hence the sea, yielding to this figure, makes itself
navigable to men. For every creature, so to speak, has, for the sake of liberty, been marked
with this sign; for the birds which fly aloft, form the figure of the cross by the expansion of
their wings; and man himself, also, with his hands outstretched, represents the same. Hence,
when the Lord had fashioned him in this form, in which He had from the beginning framed
him, He joined on his body to the Deity, in order that it might be henceforth an instrument
consecrated to God, freed from all discord and want of harmony. For man cannot, after that
he has been formed for the worship of God, and hath sung, as it were, the incorruptible song
of truth, and by this hath been made capable of holding the Deity, being fitted to the lyre of
life as the chords and strings, he cannot, I say, return to discord and corruption.</p>

<head>II.3173</head>
<p>The Same Methodius to Those Who are Ashamed of the Cross of Christ.</p>
<p>Some think that God also, whom they measure with the measure of their own feelings,
judges the same thing that wicked and foolish men judge to be subjects of praise and blame,
and that He uses the opinions of men as His rule and measure, not taking into account the
fact that, by reason of the ignorance that is in them, every creature falls short of the beauty
of God. For He draws all things to life by His Word, from their universal substance and
nature. For whether He would have good, He Himself is the Very Good, and remains in
Himself; or, whether the beautiful is pleasing to Him, since He Himself is the Only Beautiful,
He beholds Himself, holding in no estimation the things which move the admiration of
men. That, verily, is to be accounted as in reality the most beautiful and praiseworthy, which
God Himself esteems to be beautiful, even though it be contemned and despised by all
else—not that which men fancy to be beautiful. Whence it is, that although by this figure
He hath willed to deliver the soul from corrupt affections, to the signal putting to shame of
the demons, we ought to receive it, and not to speak evil of it, as being that which was given
us to deliver us, and set us free from the chains which for our disobedience we incurred.
For the Word suffered, being in the flesh affixed to the cross, that He might bring man, who
had been deceived by error, to His supreme and godlike majesty, restoring him to that divine
life from which he had become alienated. By this figure, in truth, the passions are blunted;
the passion of the passions having taken place by the Passion, and the death of death by the
death of Christ, He not having been subdued by death, nor overcome by the pains of the
Passion. For neither did the Passion cast Him down from His equanimity, nor did death
hurt Him, but He was in the passible remaining impassible, and in the mortal remaining
immortal, comprehending all that the air, and this middle state, and the heaven above contained,
and attempering the mortal to the immortal divinity. Death was vanquished entirely;
the flesh being crucified to draw forth its immortality.</p>

<p>The Same Methodius: How Christ the Son of God, in a Brief and Definite Time,
Being Enclosed by the Body, and Existing Impassible, Became Obnoxious to the
Passion.</p>
<p>For since this virtue was in Him, now it is of the essence of power to be contracted in a
small space, and to be diminished, and again to be expanded in a large space, and to be increased.
But if it is possible for Him to be with the larger extended, and to be made equal,
and yet not with the smaller to be contracted and diminished, then power is not in Him.
For if you say that this is possible to power, and that impossible, you deny it to be power;
as being infirm and incapable with regard to the things which it cannot do. Nor again, further,
will it ever contain any excellence of divinity with respect to those things which suffer change.
For both man and the other animals, with respect to those things which they can effect,
energise; but with respect to those things which they cannot perform, are weak, and fade
away. Wherefore for this cause the Son of God was in the manhood enclosed, because this
was not impossible to Him. For with power He suffered, remaining impassible; and He died,
bestowing the gift of immortality upon mortals. Since the body, when struck or cut by a
body, is just so far struck or cut as the striker strikes it, or he that cuts it cut it. For according
to the rebound of the thing struck, the blow reflects upon the striker, since it is necessary
that the two must suffer equally, both the agent and the sufferer. If, in truth, that which is
cut, from its small size, does not correspond to that which cuts it, it will not be able to cut
it at all. For if the subject body does not resist the blow of the sword, but rather yields to it,
the operation will be void of effect, even as one sees in the thin and subtle bodies of fire and
air; for in such cases the impetus of the more solid bodies is relaxed, and remains without
effect. But if fire, or air, or stone, or iron, or anything which men use against themselves for
the purposes of mutual destruction—if it is not possible to pierce or divide these, because
of the subtle nature which they possess, why should not rather Wisdom remain invulnerable
and impassible, in nothing injured by anything, even though it were conjoined to the body
which was pierced and transfixed with nails, inasmuch as it is purer and more excellent than
any other nature, if you except only that of God who begat Him?</p>

<head>Some Other Fragments of the Same Methodius.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>I.3175</head>
<p>But, perhaps, since the friends of Job imagined that they understood the reason why he
suffered such things, that just man, using a long speech to them, confesses that the wisdom
of the divine judgment is incomprehensible, not only to him, but also to every man, and
declares that this earthly region is not the fitting place for understanding the knowledge of
the divine counsels. One might say, that perfect and absolute piety—a thing plainly divine,
and of God alone given to man, is in this place called wisdom. But the sense of the words is
as follows: God, he says, hath given great things unto men, sowing, as it were, in their nature
the power of discovery, together with wisdom, and the faculty of art. And men having received
this, dig metals out of the earth, and cultivate it; but that wisdom which is conjoined
with piety, it is not possible in any place to discover. Man cannot obtain it from his own
resources, nor can he give it unto others. Hence it was that the wise men of the Greeks, who
in their own strength sought to search out piety, and the worship of the Deity, did not attain
their end. For it is a thing, as we have said, which exceeds human strength, the gift and the
grace of God; and therefore from the beginning, partly by visions, partly by the intervention
of angels, partly by the discourses of the divinely-inspired prophets, God instructed man in
the principles of true religion. Nay, moreover, that contemplative wisdom by which we are
impelled to the arts, and to other pursuits, and with which we are all in common, just and
unjust, alike endued, is the gift of God: if we have been made rational creatures, we have
received this. Wherefore, also, in a former place it was said, as of a thing that is of God bestowed,
“Is it not the Lord who teacheth understanding and knowledge?”3176</p>

<p>Observe that the Lord was not wont from the beginning to speak with man; but after
that the soul was prepared, and exercised in many ways, and had ascended into the height
by contemplation, so far as it is possible for human nature to ascend, then is it His wont to
speak, and to reveal His Word unto those who have attained unto this elevation. But since
the whirlwind is the producer of the tempests, and Job, in the tempest of his afflictions, had
not made shipwreck of his faith, but his constancy shone forth the rather; therefore it was
that He who gave him an answer answered him by the whirlwind, to signify the tempest of
calamity which had befallen him; but, because He changed the stormy condition of his affairs
into one of serene tranquillity, He spoke to him not only by the whirlwind, but in clouds
also.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Arnobius.</head>
<p>[a.d. 297–303.] Arnobius appears before us, not as did the earlier apologists, but as a
token that the great struggle was nearing its triumphant close. He is a witness that Minucius
Felix and Tertullian had not preceded him in vain. He is a representative character, and
stands forth boldly to avow convictions which were, doubtless, now struggling into light
from the hearts of every reflecting pagan in the empire. In all probability it was the alarm
occasioned by tokens that could not be suppressed—of a spreading and deepening sense of
the nothingness of Polytheism—that stimulated the OEcumenical rage of Diocletian, and
his frantic efforts to crush the Church, or, rather, to overwhelm it in a deluge of flame and
blood.</p>
<p>In our author rises before us another contributor to Latin Christianity, which was still
North-African in its literature, all but exclusively. He had learned of Tertullian and Cyprian
what he was to impart to his brilliant pupil Lactantius. Thus the way was prepared for Augustine,
by whom and in whom Latin Christianity was made distinctly Occidental, and
prepared for the influence it has exerted, to this day, under the mighty prestiges of his single
name.</p>
<p>And yet Arnobius, like Boethius afterwards, is much discredited, and has even been
grudged the name of a Christian. Coleridge is one of the many who have disparaged Arnobius,
but he always talked like an inspired madman, and often contradicted himself. Enough
to say, that, emerging from gross heathenism in mature life, and forced to learn as he could
what is now taught to Christian children, our author is a witness to the diffusion of truth
in his day. He shows also such a faculty of assimilation, that, as a practical Christian, Coleridge
himself does not shine in comparison; and if, as is probable, he closed his life in martyrdom,
we may well be ashamed to deny him our gratitude and the tribute of our praise. Our author
is an interesting painter of many features of paganism in conflict with the Church, which
we gain from no one else. Economizing Clement of Alexandria, he advances to an assured
position and form of assault. He persistently impeaches Jove himself in a daring confidence
that men will feel his terrible charges to be true, and that the victory over heathenism is
more than half gained already.3192 I doubt not that, as a heathen, he was influenced by a
dream to study Christianity. As a believer, he discarded dreams as vain. Converted late in

<pb n="918"/>
life, we need not wonder at some tokens of imperfect knowledge; but, on the whole, he seems
a well-informed disciple, and shows how thoroughly the catechumens were trained. But
what does he prove? In short, he gives us a most fascinating insight into the mental processes
by which he, and probably Constantine soon after him, came to the conclusion that heathenism
was outworn and must disappear. He proves that the Church was salt that had not “lost
its savour.” It is true, that, reasoning with pagans, he does not freely cite the Scriptures,
which had no force with them; yet his references to the facts of Scripture show that he had
studied them conscientiously, and could present the truths of the Gospel clearly and with
power. Lardner has demonstrated3193 this in a fair spirit and with conclusive evidence. Referring
the reader to his admirable criticisms, I am glad to say that a full and satisfactory
outline of his career is presented in the following:—
<lg>
<l>Translator’s Introductory Notice.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>1. Arnobius has been most unjustly neglected in modern times; but some excuse for
this may be found in the fact that even less attention seems to have been paid to him in the
ages immediately succeeding his own. We find no mention of him in any author except
Jerome; and even Jerome has left only a few lines about him, which convey very little information.</p>
<p>In his list of ecclesiastical writers he says,3194 “During the reign of Diocletian, Arnobius
taught rhetoric with the greatest success, at Sicca, in Africa, and wrote against the heathen
the books extant;” and again speaks of this work more particularly when he says,3195 “Arnobius
published seven books against the heathen.” In his Chronicon, however, he writes
under the year 2342,3196 “Arnobius is considered a distinguished rhetorician in Africa, who,
while engaged at Sicca in teaching young men rhetoric, was led by visions to the faith; and
not being received by the bishop as hitherto a persistent enemy to Christ, composed very
excellent books against his former belief.” It must at once be seen that there is here a mistake,
for Arnobius is put some twenty-three years later than in the former passage. Jerome himself
shows us that the former date is the one he meant, for elsewhere3197 he speaks of Lactantius
as the disciple of Arnobius. Lactantius, in extreme old age,3198 was appointed tutor of
Constantine’s son Crispus; and this, we are told in the Chronicon,3199 was in the year 317.</p>

<pb n="919"/>
<p>No one will suppose that if the disciple was a very old man in 317, his master could have
been in his prime in 326. It is certain, therefore, that this date is not correct; and it seems
very probable that Oehler’s conjecture is true, who supposes that Jerome accidentally
transposed his words from the year 303 to the place where we find them, misled by noticing
the vicenalia of Constantine when he was looking for those of Diocletian.</p>
<p>It is with some difficulty that we can believe that Arnobius was led to embrace Christianity
by dreams, as he speaks of these with little respect,3200—which he could hardly have
done if by them the whole course of his life had been changed; but in our utter ignorance
we cannot say that this may not have been to some extent the case. The further statement,
that his apology for Christianity was submitted as a proof of his sincerity to the bishop of
Sicca, is even less credible,—for these two reasons, that it is evidently the fruit not of a few
weeks’ but of protracted labour, and that it is hardly likely that any bishop would have allowed
some parts of it to pass into circulation. It is just possible that the first or third books may
have been so presented; but it is not credible that any pledge would be required of a man
seeking to cast in his lot with the persecuted and terrified Church referred to in the fourth.</p>
<p>2. If we learn but little from external sources as to the life of Arnobius, we are not more
fortunate when we turn to his own writings. One or two facts, however, are made clear; and
these are of some importance. “But lately,” he says, “O blindness, I worshipped images just
brought from the furnaces, gods made on anvils and forged with hammers: now, led by so
great a teacher into the ways of truth, I know what all these things are.”3201 We have thus
his own assurance of his conversion from heathenism. He speaks of himself, however, as
actually a Christian,—not as a waverer, not as one purposing to forsake the ancient superstitions
and embrace the new religion, but as a firm believer, whose faith is already established,
and whose side has been taken and stedfastly maintained. In a word, he refers to himself as
once lost in error, but now a true Christian.</p>
<p>Again, in different passages he marks pretty accurately the time or times at which he
wrote. Thus, in the first book3202 he speaks of about three hundred years as the time during
which Christianity had existed; and in the second,3203 of a thousand and fifty, or not many
less, having elapsed since the foundation of Rome. There has been much discussion as to
what era is here referred to; and it has been pretty generally assumed that the Fabian must
be intended,—in which case 303 would be the year meant. If it is observed, however, that
Arnobius shows an intimate acquaintance with Varro, and great admiration for him, it will
probably be admitted that it is most likely that the Varronian, or common, era was adopted

by him; and in this case the year referred to will be 297 a.d. This coincides sufficiently with
the passage in the first book, and is in harmony with the idea which is there predominant,—
the thought, that is, of the accusation so frequently on the lips of the heathen, that
Christianity was the cause of the many and terrible afflictions with which the empire was
visited. These accusations, ever becoming more bitter and threatening, would naturally be
observed with care and attention by thoughtful Christians towards the close of the third
century; and accordingly we find that the words with which Arnobius begins his apology,
express the feeling of awakening anxiety with which he viewed the growth of this fear and
hatred in the minds of the heathen. He declares, in effect, that one great object—indeed the
main object—which he had proposed to himself, was to show that it was not because of the
Christians that fresh evils and terrible calamities were continually assailing the state. And
it must be remembered that we cannot refer such a proposal to a later period than that assigned.
It would certainly not have occurred to a Christian in the midst of persecution, with
death overhanging him, and danger on every side, to come forward and attempt calmly to
show the heathen that there was no reason for their complaints against the Christians. In
the later books there is a change in tone, upon which we cannot now dwell, although it is
marked. In one passage he asks indignantly,3204 “Why should our writings be given to the
flames, our meetings be cruelly broken up, in which prayer is offered to the supreme God,
peace and pardon are asked for all in authority, for soldiers, kings, friends, enemies?” In the
calm tranquillity of the last half of the third century these words could hardly have been
written, but they are a striking testimony to the terms of the imperial edict issued in the year
303 a.d. So, too, the popular expression of anger and disgust at the anti-pagan character of
some of Cicero’s works3205 belongs to the incipient stages of persecution.</p>
<p>Nor must it be supposed that the whole work may be referred to the era which ensued
after the abdication of Diocletian, in 305. From this time an apology for Christianity with
such a design would have been an anachronism, for it was no longer necessary to disarm
the fears of the heathen by showing that the gods could not be enraged at the Christians. It
has further to be noticed, that although it is perfectly clear that Arnobius spent much time
on his apology, it has never been thoroughly revised, and does not seem to have been ever
finished.3206</p>
<p>We surely have in all this sufficient reason to assign the composition of these books
adversus Gentes to the end of the third and beginning of the fourth centuries. Beyond this
we cannot go, for we have no data from which to derive further inferences.</p>

<pb n="921"/>
<p>3. We have seen that the facts transmitted to us are very few and scanty indeed; but, few
as they are, they suggest an interesting picture. Arnobius comes before us in Sicca; we are
made spectators of two scenes of his life there, and the rest—the beginning and the end—are
shrouded in darkness. Sicca Veneria was an important town, lying on the Numidian border,
to the south-west of Carthage. As its name signifies, it was a seat of that vile worship of the
goddess of lust, which was dear to the Phoenician race. The same cultus was found there
which disgraced Corinth; and in the temple of the goddess the maidens of the town were
wont to procure for themselves, by the sacrifice of their chastity, the dowries which the
poverty of their parents could not provide.</p>
<p>In the midst of traditions of such bestial foulness Arnobius found himself,—whether
as a native, or as one who had been led to settle there. He has told us himself how true an
idolater he was, how thoroughly he complied with the ceremonial demands of superstition;
but the frequency and the vehemence of language with which his abhorrence of the sensuality
of heathenism is expressed, tell us as plainly that practices so horrible had much to do
in preparing his mind to receive another faith.</p>
<p>In strong contrast to the filthy indulgences with which paganism gratified its adherents,
must have appeared the strict purity of life which was enjoined by Christianity and aimed
at by its followers; and perhaps it was in such a place as Sicca that considerations of this
nature would have most influence. There, too, the story of Cyprian’s martyrdom must have
been well known,—may indeed have been told in the nursery of the young Arnobius,—and
many traditions must have been handed down about the persistency with which those of
the new religion had held fast their faith, in spite of exile, torture, and death. However distorted
such tales might be, there would always remain in them the evidence of so exalted
nobility of spirit, that every disclosure of the meanness and baseness of the old superstition
must have induced an uneasy feeling as to whether that could be impiety which ennobled
men,—that piety which degraded them lower than the brutes.</p>
<p>For some time all went well with Arnobius. He was not too pure for the world, and his
learning and eloquence won him fame and success in his profession. But in some way, we
know not how, a higher learning was communicated to him, and the admired rhetorician
became first a suspected, then a persecuted Christian. He has left us in no doubt as to the
reason of the change. Upon his darkness, he says, there shone out a heavenly light,3207 a
great teacher appeared to him and pointed out the way of truth; and he who had been an
earnest worshipper of images, of stones, of unknown gods, was now as earnest, as zealous
in his service of the true God. Of the trials which he must have endured we know nothing.
A terrible persecution swept over the world, and many a Christian perished in it. Such a
man as Arnobius must have been among the first to be assailed, but we hear of him no more.
<note type="footnote">3207 [Conf. Constantine’s “vision.”]</note>

<pb n="922"/>
With his learning and talents he could not have failed to make himself a name in the Church,
or outside its pale, if he had lived. The conclusion seems inevitable, that he was one of the
victims of that last fiery trial to which Christians under the Roman empire were exposed.</p>
<p>4. The vast range of learning shown in this apology has been admitted on all sides. Even
Jerome says that it should at times be read on account of the learning displayed in it.3208 In
another passage Jerome says,3209 “Arnobius is unequal and prolix, confused from want of
arrangement.” This may be admitted to a certain extent; but although such defects are to
be found in his work, they are certainly not characteristic of Arnobius. So, too, many passages
may be found strangely involved and mystical, and it is at times hard to understand what
is really meant. Solecisms and barbarisms are also met with, as Nourry has objected, so that
it cannot be said that Arnobius writes pure Latin. Still we must not be misled into supposing
that by enumerating these defects we have a fair idea of his style.</p>
<p>If we remember that no man can wholly escape the influences of his age, and that Arnobius
was so warm an admirer of Varro and Lucretius that he imitated their style and adopted
their vocabulary, we shall be able to understand in what way he may be fairly spoken of as
a good writer, although not free from defects. His style is, in point of fact, clear and lucid,
rising at times into genuine eloquence; and its obscurity and harshness are generally caused
by an attempt to express a vague and indefinite idea. Indeed very considerable power of
expression is manifested in the philosophical reasonings of the second book, the keen satire
of the fourth and fifth, and the vigorous argument of the sixth and seventh.</p>
<p>Jerome’s last stricture is scarcely applicable. Arnobius wrote adversus Gentes; he addressed
himself to meet the taunts and accusations of the heathen, and in so doing he retorts
upon them the charges which they preferred against the Christians. His work must therefore
be criticised from this standpoint, not as a systematic exposition or vindication of Christianity.
Christianity is indeed defended, but it is by attacking heathenism. We must consider,
also, that evidently the work was not revised as a whole, and that the last book would have
been considerably altered had Arnobius lived or found opportunity to correct it.3210 If we
remember these things, we shall find little to object to in the arrangement.</p>
<p>After making all deductions, it may be said fairly that in Arnobius the African Church
found no unfitting champion. Living amidst impurity and corruption, and seeing on every
side the effects of a superstitious and sensual faith, he stands forward to proclaim that man
has a nobler ideal set before him than the worship of the foul imaginations of his depraved
fancy, to call his fellows to a purer life, and to point out that the Leader who claims that men

<pb n="923"/>
should follow Him is both worthy and able to guide. This he does with enthusiasm, vigour,
and effect; and in doing this he accomplishes his end.</p>
<p>5. Various opinions have been entertained as to the position which Arnobius occupied
with regard to the Bible. We cannot here enter into a discussion of these, and shall merely
present a brief statement of facts.</p>
<p>It is evident that with regard to the Jews and the Old Testament Arnobius was in a state
of perfect ignorance; for he confounds the Sadducees with the Pharisees,3211 makes no allusion
to the history of the Israelites, and shows that he was not acquainted with their forms
of sacrifice.3212</p>
<p>He was evidently well acquainted with the life of Christ and the history of the Church,
and alludes at times to well-known Christian sayings; but how far in so doing he quotes the
Gospels and Epistles, is not easily determined. Thus it has been supposed, and with some
probability, that in referring to the miracles of Christ he must allude to the Gospels as recording
them. But it must be observed that he ascribes to Christ a miracle of which the New
Testament makes no mention,—of being understood by men of different nations, as though
He spoke in several languages at the same moment.3213 So, too, his account3214 of the passion
differs from that of the New Testament. On the other hand, we find that he speaks of Christ
as having taught men “not to return evil for evil,”3215 as “the way of salvation, the door of
life, by whom alone there is access to the light,”3216 and as having been seen by “countless
numbers of men” after His resurrection.3217 Still further, he makes frequent references to
accounts of Christ written by the apostles and handed down to their followers,3218 and asks
why their writings should be burned.3219 In one place,3220 also, he asks, “Have the wellknown
words never rung in your ears, that the wisdom of man is foolishness with God?”
where the reference seems to be very distinct;3221 but he nowhere says that he is quoting,
or mentions any books.</p>

<p>This is, however, less remarkable when we take into account his mode of dealing with
Clemens Alexandrinus and Cicero. The fourth, fifth, and sixth books are based on these
two authors, and from Clement, in particular, whole sentences are taken unchanged.3222
Yet the only reference made to either is the very general allusion in the third and fourth
books.3223</p>
<p>On the other hand, he quotes frequently and refers distinctly to many authors, and is
especially careful to show that he has good authority for his statements, as will be seen by
observing the number of books to which he refers on the mysteries and temples. If we bear
this in mind, the principle which guided him seems to have been, that when he has occasion
to quote an author once or twice, he does so by name, but that he takes it for granted that
every one knows what are the great sources of information, and that it is therefore unnecessary
to specify in each case what is the particular authority.</p>
<p>There are many interesting questions connected with his subject, but these we must for
the present leave untouched.</p>
<p>6. No other works by Arnobius have been preserved, and only two mss. are known to
exist. Of these, the one in Brussels is merely a transcript of that preserved in the public library
at Paris, on which all editions have been based. This is a ms. of the ninth or tenth century,
and contains the Octavius of Minucius Felix immediately after the seventh book adversus
Gentes, in consequence of which that treatise was at first printed as the eighth book of
Arnobius. Although it has been collated several times, we are still in doubt as to its true
readings,—Hildebrand, who last examined it, having done so with too little care.</p>
<p>The first3224 edition was printed at Rome in 1542, and was followed by that of Gelenius,
3225 in which much was done for the emendation of the text; but arbitrary conjectures
were too frequently admitted. Next in order follow those of Canterus,3226 who did especial
service by pointing out what use Arnobius has made of Clement, Ursinus,3227 Elmenhorst,
3228 Stewechius,3229 Heraldus,3230 and the Leyden3231 variorum edition, based on a

recension of the text by Salmasius.3232 The later editions are those of Oberthür,3233 whose
text is adopted by Orelli,3234 Hildebrand,3235 and Oehler.3236 Oberthür’s edition is of little
importance, and that of Orelli is valuable solely as a collection of notes gathered from many
sources into a crude and undigested mass. Hildebrand seems to have taken too little pains
with his work; and Oehler, whose critical sagacity and industry might have given us a most
satisfactory edition, was unfortunately hampered by want of space.</p>
<p>No edition of Arnobius has been published in England; and the one Englishman who
has taken any pains with this author seems to be John Jones, who, under the pseudonym of
Leander de St. Martino, prepared summaries, which were added to a reprint of Stewechius
at Douay, 1634. As this edition has not come into our hands, we are unable to speak of it
more particularly.</p>
<p>7. It will be observed that adversus Gentes is the title of this work in all editions except
those of Hildebrand and Oehler, in which it is adversus Nationes. The difference is very
slight, but it may be well to mention that neither can be said with certainty to be correct.
The first is the form used by Jerome in two passages of his writings;3237 and as he must have
seen earlier mss. than that now extant, he is supposed to give the title which he found in
them. In the Paris ms., however, at the end of the second book, the subscription is, “The
second book of Arnobius adversus Nationes ends;” and it has been argued that, as the
copyist would hardly have gone so far astray, while it is quite possible that Jerome did not
attempt to do more than indicate generally the purpose of the book without quoting its
titlepage, this must be the true title. The first page of the existing ms. is torn away, and the
question remains therefore undecided: fortunately its decision is not of the slightest importance.</p>
<p>8. This translation of Arnobius was begun in the hope that it would be possible to adhere
throughout to the text of Orelli, and that very little attention to the various readings would
be found necessary. This was, however, found to be impossible, not merely because
Hildebrand’s collation of the Paris ms. showed how frequently liberties had been taken with
the text, but on account of the corrupt state of the text itself.</p>

<p>It has therefore been thought advisable to lay before the reader a close translation
founded on the ms., so far as known. A conjectural reading has in no case been adopted
without notice.</p>
<p>Throughout the Work use has been made of four editions,—Oehler’s, Orelli’s,
Hildebrand’s, and that of Leyden; other editions being consulted only for special reasons.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that our knowledge of the single ms. of Arnobius is still incomplete;
but it is hoped that this will soon be remedied, by the publication of a revised text, based
upon a fresh collation of the ms., with a complete apparatus and a carefully digested body
of notes.3238</p>

<p>1. Since I have found some who deem themselves very wise in their opinions, acting as
if they were inspired,3239 and announcing with all the authority of an oracle,3240 that from
the time when the Christian people began to exist in the world the universe has gone to ruin,
that the human race has been visited with ills of many kinds, that even the very gods,
abandoning their accustomed charge, in virtue of which they were wont in former days to
regard with interest our affairs, have been driven from the regions of earth,—I have resolved,
so far as my capacity and my humble power of language will allow, to oppose public prejudice,
and to refute calumnious accusations; lest, on the one hand, those persons should imagine
that they are declaring some weighty matter, when they are merely retailing vulgar rumours;
3241 and on the other, lest, if we refrain from such a contest, they should suppose
that they have gained a cause, lost by its own inherent demerits, not abandoned by the silence
of its advocates. For I should not deny that that charge is a most serious one, and that we
fully deserve the hatred attaching to public enemies,3242 if it should appear that to us are
attributable causes by reason of which the universe has deviated from its laws, the gods have
been driven far away, and such swarms of miseries have been inflicted on the generations
of men.</p>
<note type="footnote">3239 The words insanire, bacchari, refer to the appearance of the ancient seers when under the influence of

is, that they make their asseverations with all the confidence of a seer when filled, as he pretended, with the influence

<p>2. Let us therefore examine carefully the real significance of that opinion, and what is
the nature of the allegation; and laying aside all desire for wrangling,3243 by which the calm
view of subjects is wont to be dimmed, and even intercepted, let us test, by fairly balancing
the considerations on both sides, whether that which is alleged be true. For it will assuredly
be proved by an array of convincing arguments, not that we are discovered to be more impious,
but that they themselves are convicted of that charge who profess to be worshippers
of the deities, and devotees of an antiquated superstition. And, in the first place, we ask this
of them in friendly and calm language: Since the name of the Christian religion began to be
used on the earth, what phenomenon, unseen before,3244 unheard of before, what event
contrary to the laws established in the beginning, has the so-called “Nature of Things” felt
or suffered? Have these first elements, from which it is agreed that all things were compacted,
been altered into elements of an opposite character? Has the fabric of this machine and mass
of the universe, by which we are all covered, and in which we are held enclosed, relaxed in
any part, or broken up? Has the revolution of the globe, to which we are accustomed, departing
from the rate of its primal motion, begun either to move too slowly, or to be hurried
onward in headlong rotation? Have the stars begun to rise in the west, and the setting of
the constellations to take place in the east? Has the sun himself, the chief of the heavenly
bodies, with whose light all things are clothed, and by whose heat all things are vivified,
blazed forth with increased vehemence? has he become less warm, and has he altered for
the worse into opposite conditions that well-regulated temperature by which he is wont to
act upon the earth? Has the moon ceased to shape herself anew, and to change into former
phases by the constant recurrence of fresh ones? Has the cold of winter, has the heat of
summer, has the moderate warmth of spring and autumn, been modified by reason of the
intermixture of ill-assorted seasons? Has the winter begun to have long days? has the night
begun to recall the very tardy twilights of summer? Have the winds at all exhausted their
violence? Is the sky not collected3245 into clouds by reason of the blasts having lost their
force, and do the fields when moistened by the showers not prosper? Does the earth refuse
to receive the seed committed to it, or will not the trees assume their foliage? Has the flavour
of excellent fruits altered, or has the vine changed in its juice? Is foul blood pressed forth
from the olive berries, and is oil no longer supplied to the lamp, now extinguished? Have
animals of the land and of the sea no sexual desires, and do they not conceive young? Do
they not guard, according to their own habits and their own instinct, the offspring generated
in their wombs? In fine, do men themselves, whom an active energy with its first impulses
has scattered over habitable lands, not form marriages with due rites? Do they not beget

dear children? do they not attend to public, to individual, and to family concerns? Do they

<p>3. Since this is so, and since no strange influence has suddenly manifested itself to break
the continuous course of events by interrupting their succession, what is the ground of the
allegation, that a plague was brought upon the earth after the Christian religion came into
the world, and after it revealed the mysteries of hidden truth? But pestilences, say my opponents,
and droughts, wars, famines, locusts, mice, and hailstones, and other hurtful things,
by which the property of men is assailed, the gods bring upon us, incensed as they are by
your wrong-doings and by your transgressions. If it were not a mark of stupidity to linger
on matters which are already clear, and which require no defence, I should certainly show,
by unfolding the history of past ages, that those ills which you speak of were not unknown,
were not sudden in their visitation; and that the plagues did not burst upon us, and the affairs
of men begin to be attacked by a variety of dangers, from the time that our sect3246 won the
honour3247 of this appellation. For if we are to blame, and if these plagues have been devised
against our sin, whence did antiquity know these names for misfortunes? Whence did she
give a designation to wars? By what conception could she indicate pestilence and hailstorms,
or how could she introduce these terms among her words, by which speech was rendered
plain? For if these ills are entirely new, and if they derive their origin from recent transgressions,
how could it be that the ancients coined terms for these things, which, on the one
hand, they knew that they themselves had never experienced, and which, on the other, they
had not heard of as occurring in the time of their ancestors? Scarcity of produce, say my
opponents, and short supplies of grain, press more heavily on us. For, I would ask, were the
former generations, even the most ancient, at any period wholly free from such an inevitable
calamity? Do not the very words by which these ills are characterized bear evidence and
proclaim loudly that no mortal ever escaped from them with entire immunity? But if the
matter were difficult of belief, we might urge, on the testimony of authors, how great nations,
and what individual nations, and how often such nations experienced dreadful famine, and
perished by accumulated devastation. Very many hailstorms fall upon and assail all things.
For do we not find it contained and deliberately stated in ancient literature, that even showers
of stones3248 often ruined entire districts? Violent rains cause the crops to perish, and proclaim
barrenness to countries:—were the ancients, indeed, free from these ills, when we

The contagious influences of pestilence consume the human race:—ransack the records of
history written in various languages, and you will find that all countries have often been
desolated and deprived of their inhabitants. Every kind of crop is consumed, and devoured
by locusts and by mice:—go through your own annals, and you will be taught by these
plagues how often former ages were visited by them, and how often they were brought to
the wretchedness of poverty. Cities shaken by powerful earthquakes totter to their destruction:—

from the island which is called the Atlantis of Neptune,3254 as Plato tells us, and utterly
ruined and blotted out countless tribes? Did this form a prejudice against us, that between
the Assyrians and Bactrians, under the leadership of Ninus and Zoroaster of old, a struggle
was maintained not only by the sword and by physical power, but also by magicians, and
by the mysterious learning of the Chaldeans? Is it to be laid to the charge of our religion,
that Helen was carried off under the guidance and at the instigation of the gods, and that
she became a direful destiny to her own and to after times? Was it because of our name,
that that mad-cap Xerxes let the ocean in upon the land, and that he marched over the sea
on foot? Did we produce and stir into action the causes, by reason of which one youth,
starting from Macedonia, subjected the kingdoms and peoples of the East to captivity and
to bondage? Did we, forsooth, urge the deities into frenzy, so that the Romans lately, like
some swollen torrent, overthrew all nations, and swept them beneath the flood? But if there
is no man who would dare to attribute to our times those things which took place long ago,
how can we be the causes of the present misfortunes, when nothing new is occurring, but
all things are old, and were unknown to none of the ancients?</p>
<note type="footnote">3254 In the Timæus of Plato, c. vi. st. p. 24, an old priest of Saïs, in Egypt, is represented as telling Solon that
in times long gone by the Athenians were a very peaceful and very brave people, and that 9,000 years before that
time they had overcome a mighty host which came rushing from the Atlantic Sea, and which threatened to
subjugate all Europe and Asia. The sea was then navigable, and in front of the pillars of Hercules (Strait of
Gibraltar) lay an island larger than Africa and Asia together: from it travellers could pass to other islands, and
from these again to the opposite continent. In this island great kings arose, who made themselves masters of
the whole island, as well as of other islands, and parts of the continent. Having already possessions in Libya and
Europe, which they wished to increase, they gathered an immense host; but it was repelled by the Athenians.
Great earthquakes and storms ensued, in which the island of Atlantis was submerged, and the sea ever after
rendered impassable by shoals of mud produced by the sunken island. For other forms of this legend, and explanations

of our religion, it would not be difficult to prove, that after the name of Christ was heard in
the world, not only were they not increased, but they were even in great measure diminished
by the restraining of furious passions. For since we, a numerous band of men as we are,
have learned from His teaching and His laws that evil ought not to be requited with evil,3255
that it is better to suffer wrong than to inflict it, that we should rather shed our own blood
than stain our hands and our conscience with that of another, an ungrateful world is now
for a long period enjoying a benefit from Christ, inasmuch as by His means the rage of
savage ferocity has been softened, and has begun to withhold hostile hands from the blood
of a fellow-creature. But if all without exception, who feel that they are men not in form of
body but in power of reason, would lend an ear for a little to His salutary and peaceful rules,
and would not, in the pride and arrogance of enlightenment, trust to their own senses rather
than to His admonitions, the whole world, having turned the use of steel into more peaceful
occupations, would now be living in the most placid tranquillity, and would unite in blessed
harmony, maintaining inviolate the sanctity of treaties.</p>

those evils by which wretched mortals are now oppressed and overwhelmed? You ask of
me a decided statement,3256 which is by no means necessary to this cause. For no immediate
and prepared discussion regarding it has been undertaken by me, for the purpose of showing
or proving from what causes and for what reasons each event took place; but in order to
demonstrate that the reproaches of so grave a charge are far removed from our door. And
if I prove this, if by examples and3257 by powerful arguments the truth of the matter is made

not appear when asked to have nothing to offer, I may say, What if the primal matter which
has been diffused through the four elements of the universe, contains the causes of all
miseries inherent in its own constitution? What if the movements of the heavenly bodies
produce these evils in certain signs, regions, seasons, and tracts, and impose upon things
placed under them the necessity of various dangers? What if, at stated intervals, changes
take place in the universe, and, as in the tides of the sea, prosperity at one time flows, at
another time ebbs, evils alternating with it? What if those impurities of matter which we
tread under our feet have this condition imposed upon them, that they give forth the most
noxious exhalations, by means of which this our atmosphere is corrupted, and brings pestilence
on our bodies, and weakens the human race? What if—and this seems nearest the
truth—whatever appears to us adverse, is in reality not an evil to the world itself? And what
if, measuring by our own advantages all things which take place, we blame the results of
nature through ill-formed judgments? Plato, that sublime head and pillar of philosophers,
has declared in his writings, that those cruel floods and those conflagrations of the world
are a purification of the earth; nor did that wise man dread to call the overthrow of the human
race, its destruction, ruin, and death, a renewal of things, and to affirm that a youthfulness,
as it were, was secured by this renewed strength.3258</p>

to bask himself in the sun, and thus to acquire dryness of body, similarly complains
that by the clouds the pleasure of serene weather is taken away? Should the clouds, therefore,
be said to hang over with an injurious veil, because idle lust is not permitted to scorch itself

success, it is not to be set down forthwith as an evil, and as a pernicious thing. The world
rains or does not rain: for itself it rains or does not rain; and, though you perhaps are ignorant
of it, it either diminishes excessive moisture by a burning drought, or by the outpouring of
rain moderates the dryness extending over a very long period. It raises pestilences, diseases,
famines, and other baneful forms of plagues: how can you tell whether it does not thus remove
that which is in excess, and whether, through loss to themselves, it does not fix a limit to

interferes with your lawful, perhaps even your unlawful pleasures, would you say that it is
pernicious and adverse? What, then, because cold is disagreeable to your members, and is
wont to chill3260 the warmth of your blood, ought not winter on that account to exist in the
world? And because you are unable3261 to endure the hottest rays of the sun, is summer to
be removed from the year, and a different course of nature to be instituted under different
laws? Hellebore is poison to men; should it therefore not grow? The wolf lies in wait by the
sheepfolds; is nature at all in fault, because she has produced a beast most dangerous to
sheep? The serpent by his bite takes away life; a reproach, forsooth, to creation, because it

constitution. Wherefore, if you wish that your complaints should have a basis, you must

and ruin is brought on our crops by the heavenly deities. I ask when you say these things,
do you not see that you are accusing us with bare-faced effrontery, with palpable and clearly
proved falsehoods? It is almost three hundred years3262—something less or more—since
we Christians3263 began to exist, and to be taken account of in the world. During all these
years, have wars been incessant, has there been a yearly failure of the crops, has there been
no peace on earth, has there been no season of cheapness and abundance of all things? For
this must first be proved by him who accuses us, that these calamities have been endless and
incessant, that men have never had a breathing time at all, and that without any relaxation3264
they have undergone dangers of many forms.</p>

innumerable have been gained from the conquered enemy,—that the boundaries of the
empire have been extended, and that nations whose names we had not previously heard,
have been brought under our power,—that very often there have been the most plentiful
yields of grain, seasons of cheapness, and such abundance of commodities, that all commerce
was paralyzed, being prostrated by the standard of prices? For in what manner could affairs
be carried on, and how could the human race have existed3265 even to this time, had not
the productiveness of nature continued to supply all things which use demanded?</p>

of plenty. Again, certain wars were carried on contrary to our wishes.3266 But they were afterwards
compensated by victories and successes. What shall we say, then?—that the gods
at one time bore in mind our acts of wrong-doing, at another time again forgot them? If,
when there is a famine, the gods are said to be enraged at us, it follows that in time of plenty
they are not wroth, and ill-to-be-appeased; and so the matter comes to this, that they both
lay aside and resume anger with sportive whim, and always renew their wrath afresh by the
recollection of the causes of offence.</p>
<note type="footnote">3266 That is, unsuccessfully.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">

<p>16. Yet one cannot discover by any rational process of reasoning, what is the meaning
of these statements. If the gods willed that the Alemanni3267 and the Persians should be
overcome because Christians dwelt among their tribes, how did they grant victory to the
Romans when Christians dwelt among their peoples also? If they willed that mice and locusts
should swarm forth in prodigious numbers in Asia and in Syria because Christians dwelt
among their tribes too, why was there at the same time no such phenomenon in Spain and
in Gaul, although innumerable Christians lived in those provinces also?3268 If among the
Gætuli and the Tinguitani3269 they sent dryness and aridity on the crops on account of this
circumstance, why did they in that very year give the most bountiful harvest to the Moors
and to the Nomads, when a similar religion had its abode in these regions as well? If in any
one state whatever they have caused many to die with hunger, through disgust at our name,
why have they in the same state made wealthier, ay, very rich, by the high price of corn, not
only men not of our body, but even Christians themselves? Accordingly, either all should
have had no blessing if we are the cause of the evils, for we are in all nations; or when you
see blessings mixed with misfortunes, cease to attribute to us that which damages your interests,
when we in no respect interfere with your blessings and prosperity. For if I cause it
to be ill with you, why do I not prevent it from being well with you? If my name is the cause
of a great dearth, why am I powerless to prevent the greatest productiveness? If I am said
to bring the ill luck of a wound being received in war, why, when the enemy are slain, am I
not an evil augury; and why am I not set forth against good hopes, through the ill luck of a
bad omen?</p>

those most holy gods are enraged at Christian communities, do you not likewise perceive,
do you not see what base feelings, what unseemly frenzies, you attribute to your deities?
For, to be angry, what else is it than to be insane, to rave, to be urged to the lust of vengeance,
and to revel in the troubles of another’s grief, through the madness of a savage disposition?
Your great gods, then, know, are subject to and feel that which wild beasts, which monstrous
brutes experience, which the deadly plant natrix contains in its poisoned roots. That nature
which is superior to others, and which is based on the firm foundation of unwavering virtue,
experiences, as you allege, the instability which is in man, the faults which are in the animals
of earth. And what therefore follows of necessity, but that from their eyes flashes dart, flames
burst forth, a panting breast emits a hurried breathing from their mouth, and by reason of
their burning words their parched lips become pale?</p>

that the gods boil with rage, and that an impulse of this kind agitates the divinities with excitement,
on the one hand they are not immortal, and on the other they are not to be reckoned
as at all partaking of divinity. For wherever, as the philosophers hold, there is any agitation,
there of necessity passion must exist. Where passion is situated, it is reasonable that mental
excitement follow. Where there is mental excitement, there grief and sorrow exist. Where
grief and sorrow exist, there is already room for weakening and decay; and if these two
harass them, extinction is at hand, viz., death, which ends all things, and takes away life
from every sentient being.</p>

what all agree is far removed from the character of deity, as unfair in their dealings, as wrongdoers,
and, in fine, as possessing positively no amount of even moderate fairness. For what
is a greater wrong than to be angry with some, and to injure others, to complain of human
beings, and to ravage the harmless corn crops, to hate the Christian name, and to ruin the

your own private wounds, you may rise up for their vengeance? It seems, then, that the gods
seek the help of mortals; and were they not protected by your strenuous advocacy, they are
not able of themselves to repel and to avenge3271 the insults offered them. Nay rather, if it
be true that they burn with anger, give them an opportunity of defending themselves, and
let them put forth and make trial of their innate powers, to take vengeance for their offended
dignity. By heat, by hurtful cold, by noxious winds, by the most occult diseases, they can
slay us, they can consume3272 us, and they can drive us entirely from all intercourse with

devices what may be hurtful to another party. For verily it is profane, and surpasses all acts
of sacrilege, to believe that that wise and most blessed nature is uplifted in mind if one
prostrates himself before it in humble adoration; and if this adoration be not paid, that it
deems itself despised, and regards itself as fallen from the pinnacle of its glory. It is childish,

they, fearing that their own arts be brought to nought, and that they may extort but scanty
contributions from the devotees, now few and infrequent, whenever they have found you
to be willing3276 that their craft should come into disrepute, cry aloud, The gods are neglected,

powers of heaven whet against us the stings of passionate indignation, on account of which
you yourselves, whenever the savage desire has seized you, spoil us of our goods, drive us
from the homes of our fathers, inflict upon us capital punishment, torture, mangle, burn
us, and at the last expose us to wild beasts, and give us to be torn by monsters? Whosoever
condemns that in us, or considers that it should be laid against us as a charge, is he deserving
either to be called by the name of man, though he seem so to himself? or is he to be believed
a god, although he declare himself to be so by the mouth of a thousand3278 prophets? Does
Trophonius,3279 or Jupiter of Dodona, pronounce us to be wicked? And will he himself be
called god, and be reckoned among the number of the deities, who either fixes the charge
of impiety on those who serve the King Supreme, or is racked with envy because His majesty
and His worship are preferred to his own?</p>
<p>Is Apollo, whether called Delian or Clarian, Didymean, Philesian, or Pythian, to be
reckoned divine, who either knows not the Supreme Ruler, or who is not aware that He is
entreated by us in daily prayers? And although he knew not the secrets of our hearts, and
though he did not discover what we hold in our inmost thoughts, yet he might either know
by his ear, or might perceive by the very tone of voice which we use in prayer, that we invoke
God Supreme, and that we beg from Him what we require.</p>

what is their power, what their knowledge, why they tremble at the mention of Christ, why
they regard his disciples as enemies and as hateful persons; but with regard to ourselves to
state expressly to those who will exercise common reason, in terms applicable to all of us
alike,—We Christians are nothing else than worshippers of the Supreme King and Head,
under our Master, Christ. If you examine carefully, you will find that nothing else is implied
in that religion. This is the sum of all that we do; this is the proposed end and limit of sacred
duties. Before Him we all prostrate ourselves, according to our custom; Him we adore in
joint prayers; from Him we beg things just and honourable, and worthy of His ear. Not that
He needs our supplications, or loves to see the homage of so many thousands laid at His
feet. This is our benefit, and has a regard to our advantage. For since we are prone to err,
and to yield to various lusts and appetites through the fault of our innate weakness, He allows
Himself at all times to be comprehended in our thoughts, that whilst we entreat Him and
strive to merit His bounties, we may receive a desire for purity, and may free ourselves from
every stain by the removal of all our shortcomings.3280</p>

and distress? They, too, seem to you wary, wise, most sagacious, and not worthy of any
blame, who revere Fauni and Fatuæ, and the genii of states,3284 who worship Pausi and
Bellonæ:—we are pronounced dull, doltish, fatuous, stupid, and senseless, who have given
ourselves up to God, at whose nod and pleasure everything which exists has its being, and
remains immoveable by His eternal decree. Do you put forth this opinion? Have you ordained
this law? Do you publish this decree, that he be crowned with the highest honours who shall
worship your slaves? that he merit the extreme penalty of the cross who shall offer prayers
to you yourselves, his masters? In the greatest states, and in the most powerful nations,
sacred rites are performed in the public name to harlots, who in old days earned the wages
of impurity, and prostituted themselves to the lust of all;3285 and yet for this there are no
swellings of indignation on the part of the deities. Temples have been erected with lofty
roofs to cats, to beetles, and to heifers:3286—the powers of the deities thus insulted are silent;
nor are they affected with any feeling of envy because they see the sacred attributes of vile
animals put in rivalry with them. Are the deities inimical to us alone? To us are they most
unrelenting, because we worship their Author, by whom, if they do exist, they began to be,
and to have the essence of their power and their majesty, from whom, having obtained their
very divinity, so to speak, they feel that they exist, and realize that they are reckoned among
things that be, at whose will and at whose behest they are able both to perish and be dissolved,
and not to be dissolved and not to perish?3287 For if we all grant that there is only one great

the spring of their existence from the great source of things. And if they are created and
brought forth, they are also doubtless liable to annihilation and to dangers; but yet they are
believed to be immortal, ever-existent, and subject to no extinction. This is also a gift from

Are we therefore charged before you with an impious religion? and because we approach
the Head and Pillar3290 of the universe with worshipful service, are we to be considered—to
use the terms employed by you in reproaching us—as persons to be shunned, and as godless
ones? And who would more properly bear the odium of these names than he who either
knows, or inquires after, or believes any other god rather than this of ours? To Him do we
not owe this first, that we exist, that we are said to be men, that, being either sent forth from
Him, or having fallen from Him, we are confined in the darkness of this body?3291 Does it
not come from Him that we walk, that we breathe and live? and by the very power of living,
does He not cause us to exist and to move with the activity of animated being? From this
do not causes emanate, through which our health is sustained by the bountiful supply of
various pleasures? Whose is that world in which you live? or who hath authorized you to
retain its produce and its possession? Who hath given that common light, enabling us to
see distinctly all things lying beneath it, to handle them, and to examine them? Who has
ordained that the fires of the sun should exist for the growth of things, lest elements pregnant
with life should be numbed by settling down in the torpor of inactivity? When you believe
that the sun is a deity, do you not ask who is his founder, who has fashioned him? Since the
moon is a goddess in your estimation, do you in like manner care to know who is her author
and framer?</p>

that they were born on earth, and that at a fixed period they received vital perceptions? For
if the world preceded them in the long lapse of time, and if before they were born nature
already experienced rains and storms, those who were born later have no right of rain-giving,

and who art incomprehensible! Thou art worthy, Thou art verily worthy—if only mortal
tongue may speak of Thee—that all breathing and intelligent nature should never cease to
feel and to return thanks; that it should throughout the whole of life fall on bended knee,
and offer supplication with never-ceasing prayers. For Thou art the first cause; in Thee
created things exist, and Thou art the space in which rest the foundations of all things,
whatever they be. Thou art illimitable, unbegotten, immortal, enduring for aye, God Thyself
alone, whom no bodily shape may represent, no outline delineate; of virtues inexpressible,
of greatness indefinable; unrestricted as to locality, movement, and condition, concerning
whom nothing can be clearly expressed by the significance of man’s words. That Thou
mayest be understood, we must be silent; and that erring conjecture may track Thee through
the shady cloud, no word must be uttered. Grant pardon, O King Supreme, to those who
persecute Thy servants; and in virtue of Thy benign nature, forgive those who fly from the
worship of Thy name and the observance of Thy religion. It is not to be wondered at if Thou
art unknown; it is a cause of greater astonishment if Thou art clearly comprehended.3293</p>
<p>But perchance some one dares—for this remains for frantic madness to do—to be uncertain,
and to express doubt whether that God exists or not; whether He is believed in on
the proved truth of reliable evidence, or on the imaginings of empty rumour. For of those
who have given themselves to philosophizing, we have heard that some3294 deny the existence
of any divine power, that others3295 inquire daily whether there be or not; that others3296
construct the whole fabric of the universe by chance accidents and by random collision, and
fashion it by the concourse of atoms of different shapes; with whom we by no means intend
to enter at this time on a discussion of such perverse convictions.3297 For those who think

Far hence be such madness; and, as the phrase is, let the folly, say I, be averted from

as it is to wish to discover by reasoning of this kind that He exists. It is a matter of indifference

native instinct, that He is King and Lord, the ruler of all things that be? In fine, if the dumb
animals even could stammer forth their thoughts, if they were able to use our languages;
nay, if trees, if the clods of the earth, if stones animated by vital perceptions were able to
produce vocal sounds, and to utter articulate speech, would they not in that case, with nature

if we deny that there is a deity of a higher kind, since Jupiter is by us both called and esteemed
the best and the greatest; and since we have dedicated to him the most sacred abodes, and
have raised huge Capitols. You are endeavouring to connect together things which are dissimilar,
and to force them into one class, thereby introducing confusion. For by the unanimous
judgment of all, and by the common consent of the human race, the omnipotent God
is regarded as having never been born, as having never been brought forth to new light, and
as not having begun to exist at any time or century. For He Himself is the source of all things,
the Father of ages and of seasons. For they do not exist of themselves, but from His everlasting
perpetuity they move on in unbroken and ever endless flow. Yet Jupiter indeed, as you allege,
has both father and mother, grandfathers, grandmothers, and brothers: now lately conceived
in the womb of his mother, being completely formed and perfected in ten months, he burst
with vital sensations into light unknown to him before. If, then, this is so, how can Jupiter
be God supreme, when it is evident that He is everlasting, and the former is represented by
you as having had a natal day, and as having uttered a mournful cry, through terror at the

or why do you contend that the gods are friendly to you, but inimical, aye, most hostile
to us, though our relations to them are the same? For if one religion is common to us and
to you, the anger of the gods is stayed;3298 but if they are hostile to us alone it is plain that

you believe that He still lives, and because you worship Him in daily supplications. If it is

of Christ by us has a tendency to injure them? Is it Janus, the founder of the Janiculum, and
Saturn, the author of the Saturnian state? Is it Fauna Fatua,3299 the wife of Faunus, who is
called the Good Goddess, but who is better and more deserving of praise in the drinking of
wine? Is it those gods Indigetes who swim in the river, and live in the channels of the Numicius,
in company with frogs and little fishes? Is it Æsculapius and father Bacchus, the former
born of Coronis, and the other dashed by lightning from his mother’s womb? Is it Mercury,
son of Maia, and what is more divine, Maia the beautiful? Is it the bow-bearing deities Diana
and Apollo, who were companions of their mother’s wanderings, and who were scarcely
safe in floating islands? Is it Venus, daughter of Dione, paramour of a man of Trojan family,
and the prostituter of her secret charms? Is it Ceres, born in Sicilian territory, and Proserpine,
surprised while gathering flowers? Is it the Theban or the Phoenician Hercules,—the latter
buried in Spanish territory, the other burned by fire on Mount OEta? Is it the brothers Castor
and Pollux, sons of Tyndareus,—the one accustomed to tame horses, the other an excellent
boxer, and unconquerable with the untanned gauntlet? Is it the Titans and the Bocchores
of the Moors, and the Syrian3300 deities, the offspring of eggs? Is it Apis, born in the Peloponnese,
and in Egypt called Serapis? Is it Isis, tanned by Ethiopian suns, lamenting her lost
son and husband torn limb from limb? Passing on, we omit the royal offspring of Ops, which
your writers have in their books set forth for your instruction, telling you both who they
are, and of what character. Do these, then, hear with offended ears that Christ is worshipped,
and that He is accepted by us and regarded as a divine person? And being forgetful of the
grade and state in which they recently were, are they unwilling to share with another that
which has been granted to themselves? Is this the justice of the heavenly deities? Is this the

water-serpents of many heads,—with how great distinctions is He to be honoured by us,

were straying everywhere, as if blind and without a guide, withdrew us from precipitous
and devious paths, and set our feet on more smooth places; who has pointed out what is

authority. Is Christ, then, not to be regarded by us as God? and is He, who in other respects
may be deemed the very greatest, not to be honoured with divine worship, from whom we
have already received while alive so great gifts, and from whom, when the day comes, we
expect greater ones?</p>
<note type="footnote">3309 It was a common practice with the Romans to hang the spoils of an enemy on a tree, which was thus
consecrated to some deity. Hence such trees were sacred, and remained unhurt even to old age. Some have
supposed that the epithet “old” is applied from the fact that the heathen used to offer to their gods objects no
longer of use to themselves; thus it was only old trees, past bearing fruit, which were generally selected to hang
the spoila upon.</note>

kind and disgrace of the death change His words or deeds, nor will the weight of His
teaching appear less; because He freed Himself from the shackles of the body, not by a natural
separation, but departed by reason of violence offered to Him. Pythagoras of Samos
was burned to death in a temple, under an unjust suspicion of aiming at sovereign power.
Did his doctrines lose their peculiar influence, because he breathed forth his life not willingly,
but in consequence of a savage assault? In like manner Socrates, condemned by the decision
of his fellow-citizens, suffered capital punishment: have his discussions on morals, on virtues,
and on duties been rendered vain, because he was unjustly hurried from life? Others without
number, conspicuous by their renown, their merit, and their public character, have experienced
the most cruel forums of death, as Aquilius, Trebonius, and Regulus: were they on
that account adjudged base after death, because they perished not by the common law of
the fates, but after being mangled and tortured in the most cruel kind of death? No innocent
person foully slain is ever disgraced thereby; nor is he stained by the mark of any baseness,
who suffers severe punishment, not from his own deserts, but by reason of the savage nature
of his persecutor.3312</p>
<note type="footnote">3312 So all the later edd.; but in the ms., 1st and 2d Roman edd., and in those of Gelenius and Canterus, this

do not ye too, by consecrating shrines to him, honour father Liber, who was torn limb from
limb by the Titans? Have you not, after his punishment and his death by lightning, named
Æsculapius, the discoverer of medicines, as the guardian and protector of health, of strength,
and of safety? Do you not invoke the great Hercules himself by offerings, by victims, and
by kindled frankincense, whom you yourselves allege to have been burned alive after his
punishment,3313 and to have been consumed on the fatal pyres? Do you not, with the unanimous
approbation of the Gauls, invoke as a propitious3314 and as a holy god, in the temples
of the Great Mother,3315 that Phrygian Atys3316 who was mangled and deprived of his virility?
Father Romulus himself, who was torn in pieces by the hands of a hundred senators,
do you not call Quirinus Martius, and do you not honour him with priests and with gorgeous
couches,3317 and do you not worship him in most spacious temples; and in addition to all
this, do you not affirm that he has ascended into heaven? Either, therefore, you too are to

<p>42. You worship, says my opponent, one who was born a mere human being. Even if
that were true, as has been already said in former passages, yet, in consideration of the many
liberal gifts which He has bestowed on us, He ought to be called and be addressed as God.
But since He is God in reality and without any shadow of doubt, do you think that we will
deny that He is worshipped by us with all the fervour we are capable of, and assumed as the
guardian of our body? Is that Christ of yours a god, then? some raving, wrathful, and excited
man will say. A god, we will reply, and the god of the inner powers;3318 and—what may still
further torture unbelievers with the most bitter pains—He was sent to us by the King Supreme
for a purpose of the very highest moment. My opponent, becoming more mad and more
frantic, will perhaps ask whether the matter can be proved, as we allege. There is no greater
proof than the credibility of the acts done by Him, than the unwonted excellence of the
virtues He exhibited, than the conquest and the abrogation of all those deadly ordinances
which peoples and tribes saw executed in the light of day,3319 with no objecting voice; and
even they whose ancient laws or whose country’s laws He shows to be full of vanity and of
the most senseless superstition, (even they) dare not allege these things to be false.</p>
<note type="footnote">3318 The phrase potentiarum interiorum is not easily understood. Orelli is of opinion that it means those
powers which in the Bible are called the “powers of heaven,” the “army of heaven,” i.e., the angels. The Jews and
the early Fathers of the Church divided the heaven into circles or zones, each inhabited by its peculiar powers
or intelligent natures, differing in dignity and in might. The central place was assigned to God Himself, and to
Christ, who sat on His right hand, and who is called by the Fathers of the Church the “Angel of the Church,”
and the “Angel of the New Covenant.” Next in order came “Thrones,” “Archangels,” “Cherubim and Seraphim,”
and most remote from God’s throne the “Chorus of Angels,” the tutelar genii of men. The system of zones and
powers seems to have been derived from the Chaldeans, who made a similar division of the heavens. According
to this idea, Arnobius speaks of Christ as nearest to the Father, and God of the “inner powers,” who enjoyed
God’s immediate presence. Reference is perhaps made to some recondite doctrine of the Gnostics. It may mean,
however, the more subtile powers of nature, as affecting both the souls of men and the physical universe.</note>
<note type="footnote">3319 So Orelli with most edd., following Ursinus, for the ms. suo ge-ne-ri-s sub limine, which might, however,
be retained, as if the sense were that these ordinances were coeval with man’s origin, and translated, “tribes saw
at the beginning of their race.”</note>

<p>43. My opponent will perhaps meet me with many other slanderous and childish charges
which are commonly urged. Jesus was a Magian;3320 He effected all these things by secret
arts. From the shrines of the Egyptians He stole the names of angels of might,3321 and the
religious system of a remote country. Why, O witlings, do you speak of things which you
have not examined, and which are unknown to you, prating with the garrulity of a rash
tongue? Were, then, those things which were done, the freaks of demons, and the tricks of
magical arts? Can you specify and point out to me any one of all those magicians who have
ever existed in past ages, that did anything similar, in the thousandth degree, to Christ?
Who has done this without any power of incantations, without the juice of herbs and of
grasses, without any anxious watching of sacrifices, of libations, or of seasons? For we do
not press it, and inquire what they profess to do, nor in what kind of acts all their learning
and experience are wont to be comprised. For who is not aware that these men either study
to know beforehand things impending, which, whether they will or not, come of necessity
as they have been ordained? or to inflict a deadly and wasting disease on whom they choose;
or to sever the affections of relatives; or to open without keys places which are locked; or to
seal the month in silence; or in the chariot race to weaken, urge on, or retard horses; or to
inspire in wives, and in the children of strangers, whether they be males or females, the
flames and mad desires of illicit love?3322 Or if they seem to attempt anything useful, to be
able to do it not by their own power, but by the might of those deities whom they invoke.</p>
<note type="footnote">3320 Magus, almost equivalent to sorcerer.</note>
<note type="footnote">3321 Arnobius uses nomina, “names,” with special significance, because the Magi in their incantations used
barbarous and fearful names of angels and of powers, by whose influence they thought strange and unusual
things were brought to pass.</note>
<note type="footnote">3322 All these different effects the magicians of old attempted to produce: to break family ties by bringing
plagues into houses, or by poisons; open doors and unbind chains by charms (Orig., contra Cels., ii.); affect
horses in the race—of which Hieronymus in his Life of Hilarion gives an example; and use philters and love
potions to kindle excessive and unlawful desires.</note>

without any aid from external things, without the observance of any ceremonial, without
any definite mode of procedure, but solely by the inherent might of His authority; and as
was the proper duty of the true God, as was consistent with His nature, as was worthy of
Him, in the generosity of His bounteous power He bestowed nothing hurtful or injurious,
but only that which is helpful, beneficial, and full of blessings good3323 for men.</p>

command, at whose voice, raised in the utterance of audible and intelligible words,3325 infirmities,
diseases, fevers, and other ailments of the body fled away? Was He one of us, whose

to bear, and terrified by the strange power, fled away? Was He one of us, to whose order the
foul leprosy, at once checked, was obedient, and left sameness of colour to bodies formerly
spotted? Was He one of us, at whose light touch the issues of blood were stanched, and
stopped their excessive flow?3326 Was He one of us, whose hands the waters of the lethargic
dropsy fled from, and that searching3327 fluid avoided; and did the swelling body, assuming
a healthy dryness, find relief? Was He one of us, who bade the lame run? Was it His work,
too, that the maimed stretched forth their hands, and the joints relaxed the rigidity3328 acquired

maddened seas were still, the whirlwinds and tempests were lulled; who walked over the
deepest pools with unwet foot; who trod the ridges of the deep, the very waves being astonished,
and nature coming under bondage; who with five loaves satisfied five thousand of
His followers: and who, lest it might appear to the unbelieving and hard of heart to be an
illusion, filled twelve capacious baskets with the fragments that remained? Was He one of
us, who ordered the breath that had departed to return to the body, persons buried to come
forth from the tomb, and after three days to be loosed from the swathings of the undertaker?
Was He one of us, who saw clearly in the hearts of the silent what each was pondering,3329
what each had in his secret thoughts? Was He one of us, who, when He uttered a single
word, was thought by nations far removed from one another and of different speech to be
using well-known sounds, and the peculiar language of each?3330 Was He one of us, who,
when He was teaching His followers the duties of a religion that could not be gainsaid,
suddenly filled the whole world, and showed how great He was and who He was, by unveiling
the boundlessness of His authority? Was He one of us, who, after His body had been laid
in the tomb, manifested Himself in open day to countless numbers of men; who spoke to
them, and listened to them; who taught them, reproved and admonished them; who, lest
they should imagine that they were deceived by unsubstantial fancies, showed Himself once,
a second time, aye frequently, in familiar conversation; who appears even now to righteous
men of unpolluted mind who love Him, not in airy dreams, but in a form of pure simplicity;
3331 whose name, when heard, puts to flight evil spirits, imposes silence on soothsayers,
prevents men from consulting the augurs, causes the efforts of arrogant magicians to be

<p>47. These facts set forth in sanctuary we have put forward, not on the supposition that
the greatness of the agent was to be seen in these virtues alone.3332 For however great these
things be, how excessively petty and trifling will they be found to be, if it shall be revealed
from what realms He has come, of what God He is the minister! But with regard to the acts
which were done by Him, they were performed, indeed, not that He might boast Himself
into empty ostentation, but that hardened and unbelieving men might be assured that what
was professed was not deceptive, and that they might now learn to imagine, from the beneficence
of His works, what a true god was. At the same time we wish this also to be known,3333
when, as was said, an enumeration of His acts has been given in summary, that Christ was
able to do not only those things which He did, but that He could even overcome the decrees
of fate. For if, as is evident, and as is agreed by all, infirmities and bodily sufferings, if deafness,
deformity, and dumbness, if shrivelling of the sinews and the loss of sight happen to us, and
are brought on us by the decrees of fate and if Christ alone has corrected this, has restored
and cured man, it is clearer than the sun himself that He was more powerful than the fates
are when He has loosened and overpowered those things which were bound with everlasting
knots, and fixed by unalterable necessity.</p>

<p>48. But, says some one, you in vain claim so much for Christ, when we now know, and
have in past times known, of other gods both giving remedies to many who were sick, and
healing the diseases and the infirmities of many men. I do not inquire, I do not demand,
what god did so, or at what time; whom he relieved, or what shattered frame he restored to
sound health: this only I long to hear, whether, without the addition of any substance—that
is, of any medical application—he ordered diseases to fly away from men at a touch;
whether he commanded and compelled the cause of ill health to be eradicated, and the
bodies of the weak to return to their natural strength. For it is known that Christ, either by
applying His hand to the parts affected, or by the command of His voice only, opened the
ears of the deaf, drove away blindness from the eyes, gave speech to the dumb, loosened the
rigidity of the joints, gave the power of walking to the shrivelled,—was wont to heal by a
word and by an order, leprosies, agues, dropsies, and all other kinds of ailments, which some
fell power3334 has willed that the bodies of men should endure. What act like these have all
these gods done, by whom you allege that help has been brought to the sick and the imperilled?
for if they have at any time ordered, as is reported, either that medicine or a special
diet be given to some,3335 or that a draught be drunk off, or that the juices of plants and of
blades be placed3336 on that which causes uneasiness or have ordered that persons should
walk, remain at rest, or abstain from something hurtful,—and that this is no great matter,
and deserves no great admiration, is evident, if you will attentively examine it—a similar
mode of treatment is followed by physicians also, a creature earth-born and not relying on
true science, but founding on a system of conjecture, and wavering in estimating probabilities.
Now there is no special merit in removing by remedies those ailments which affect
men: the healing qualities belong to the drugs—not virtues inherent in him who applies
them; and though it is praiseworthy to know by what medicine or by what method it may
be suitable for persons to be treated, there is room for this credit being assigned to man, but
not to the deity. For it is, at least, no discredit that he3337 should have improved the health
of man by things taken from without: it is a disgrace to a god that he is not able to effect it
of himself, but that he gives soundness and safety only by the aid of external objects.</p>

stowed, how many thousands of infirm persons do you wish to be shown to you by us; how
many persons affected with wasting diseases, whom no appliances whatever restored, although
they went as suppliants through all the temples, although they prostrated themselves
before the gods, and swept the very thresholds with their lips—though, as long as life remained,
they wearied with prayers, and importuned with most piteous vows Æsculapius
himself, the health-giver, as they call him? Do we not know that some died of their ailments?
that others grew old by the torturing pain of their diseases? that others began to live a more
abandoned life after they had wasted their days3338 and nights in incessant prayers, and in
expectation of mercy?3339 Of what avail is it, then, to point to one or another who may have
been healed, when so many thousands have been left unaided, and the shrines are full of all
the wretched and the unfortunate? Unless, perchance, you say that the gods help the good,
but that the miseries of the wicked are overlooked. And yet Christ assisted the good and the
bad alike; nor was there any one rejected by Him, who in adversity sought help against violence
and the ills of fortune. For this is the mark of a true god and of kingly power, to deny
his bounty to none, and not to consider who merits it or who does not; since natural infirmity
and not the choice of his desire, or of his sober judgment, makes a sinner. To say, moreover,
that aid is given by the gods to the deserving when in distress, is to leave undecided and
render doubtful what you assert: so that both he who has been made whole may seem to
have been preserved by chance, and he who is not may appear to have been unable to banish
infirmity, not because of his demerit, but by reason of a heaven-sent weakness.3340</p>

have been detailed by us in summary, and not as the importance of the matter demanded;
but, what was more sublime, He has permitted many others to attempt them, and to perform
them by the use of His name. For when He foresaw that you were to be the detractors of
His deeds and of His divine work, in order that no lurking suspicion might remain of His
having lavished these gifts and bounties by magic arts, from the immense multitude of
people, which with admiring wonder strove to gain His favour, He chose fishermen, artisans,
rustics, and unskilled persons of a similar kind, that they being sent through various nations
should perform all those miracles without any deceit and without any material aids. By a
word He assuaged the racking pains of the aching members; and by a word they checked
the writhings of maddening sufferings. By one command He drove demons from the body,
and restored their senses to the lifeless; they, too, by no different command, restored to
health and to soundness of mind those labouring under the inflictions of these demons.3341
By the application of His hand He removed the marks of leprosy; they, too, restored to the
body its natural skin by a touch not dissimilar. He ordered the dropsical and swollen flesh
to recover its natural dryness; and His servants in the same manner stayed the wandering
waters, and ordered them to glide through their own channels, avoiding injury to the frame.
Sores of immense size, refusing to admit of healing, He restrained from further feeding on
the flesh, by the interposition of one word; and they in like manner, by restricting its ravages,
compelled the obstinate and merciless cancer to confine itself to a scar. To the lame He gave
the power of walking, to the dark eyes sight, the dead He recalled to life; and not less surely
did they, too, relax the tightened nerves, fill the eyes with light already lost, and order the
dead to return from the tombs, reversing the ceremonies of the funeral rites. Nor was anything
calling forth the bewildered admiration of all done by Him, which He did not freely
allow, to be performed by those humble and rustic men, and which He did not put in their
power.</p>

Capitolinus of yours give to any human being power of this kind? Did he endow with this
right any priest of a curia, the Pontifex Maximus, nay, even the Dialis, in whose name he is
revealed as the god of life?3342 I shall not say, did he impart power to raise the dead, to give
light to the blind, restore the normal condition of their members to the weakened and the
paralyzed, but did he even enable any one to check a pustule, a hang-nail, a pimple, either
by the word of his mouth or the touch of his hand? Was this, then, a power natural to man,
or could such a right be granted, could such a licence be given by the mouth of one reared
on the vulgar produce of earth; and was it not a divine and sacred gift? or if the matter admits
of any hyperbole, was it not more than divine and sacred? For if you do that which you are
able to do, and what is compatible with your strength and your ability, there is no ground
for the expression of astonishment; for you will have done that which you were able, and
which your power was bound to accomplish, in order that there should be a perfect correspondence3343
between the deed and the doer. To be able to transfer to a man your own
power, share with the frailest being the ability to perform that which you alone are able to
do, is a proof of power supreme over all, and holding in subjection the causes of all things,
and the natural laws of methods and of means.</p>
<note type="footnote">3342 So understood by Orelli, who reads quo Dius est, adopting the explanation of Dialis given by Festus. The
ms., however, according to Crusius, reads, Dialem, quod ejus est, flaminem isto jure donavit; in which case, from
the position of the quod, the meaning might be, “which term is his,” or possibly, “because he (i.e., the priest) is
his,” only that in the latter case a pronoun would be expected: the commentators generally refer it to the succeeding
jure, with this “right” which is his. Canterus reads, quod majus est, i.e., than the Pontifex Maximus. [Compare

<note type="footnote">3344 This passage has furnished occasion for much discussion as to text and interpretation. In the text Orelli’s
punctuation has been followed, who regards Arnobius as mentioning four Zoroasters—the Assyrian or Chaldean,
the Bactrian (cf. c. 5 of this book), the Armenian, and finally the Pamphylian, or Pamphilos, who, according to
Clem. Alex. (Strom. [vol. ii. p. 469]), is referred to in Plato’s Republic, book x., under the name Er; Meursius and
Salmasius, however, regarding the whole as one sentence, consider that only three persons are so referred to,
the first being either Libyan or Bactrian, and the others as with Orelli. To seek to determine which view is most
plausible even, would be a fruitless task, as will be evident on considering what is said in the index under
Zoroaster. [Jowett’s Plato, ii. 121.]</note>

per—“let there come, I pray you, through,” etc., from the ms. quæ super; while Heraldus would change the last
three words into Azonaces, the name of the supposed teacher of Zoroaster. By the “fiery zone” Salmasius would
understand Libya; but the legends should be borne in mind which spoke of Zoroaster as having shown himself
to a wondering multitude from a hill blazing with fire, that he might teach them new ceremonies of worship,
or as being otherwise distinguished in connection with fire. [Plato, Rep., p. 446, Jowett’s trans.]</note>

<p>53. Cease in your ignorance to receive such great deeds with abusive language, which
will in no wise injure him who did them, but which will bring danger to yourselves—danger,
I say, by no means small, but one dealing with matters of great,3347 aye, even the greatest
importance, since beyond a doubt the soul is a precious thing, and nothing can be found
dearer to a man than himself. There was nothing magical, as you suppose, nothing human,
delusive, or crafty in Christ; no deceit lurked in Him,3348 although you smile in derision,
as your wont is, and though you split with roars of laughter. He was God on high, God in
His inmost nature, God from unknown realms, and was sent by the Ruler of all as a Saviour
God; whom neither the sun himself, nor any stars, if they have powers of perception, not
the rulers and princes of the world, nor, in fine, the great gods, or those who, feigning
themselves so, terrify the whole human race, were able to know or to guess whence and who
He was—and naturally so. But3349 when, freed from the body, which He carried about as
but a very small part of Himself, He allowed Himself to be seen, and let it be known how
great He was, all the elements of the universe bewildered by the strange events were thrown
into confusion. An earthquake shook the world, the sea was heaved up from its depths, the
heaven was shrouded in darkness, the sun’s fiery blaze was checked, and his heat became
moderate;3350 for what else could occur when He was discovered to be God who heretofore
was reckoned one of us?</p>
<note type="footnote">3347 So the edd., reading in rebus eximiis for the ms. exi-gu-is, which would, of course, give an opposite and
wholly unsuitable meaning.</note>

who saw them done before their eyes—the very best vouchers and the most trustworthy
authorities—both believed them themselves, and transmitted them to us who follow them,
to be believed with no scanty measure of confidence. Who are these? you perhaps ask. Tribes,
peoples, nations, and that incredulous human race; but3351 if the matter were not plain,
and, as the saying is, clearer than day itself, they would never grant their assent with so ready
belief to events of such a kind. But shall we say that the men of that time were untrustworthy,
false, stupid, and brutish to such a degree that they pretended to have seen what they never
had seen, and that they put forth under false evidence, or alleged with childish asseveration
things which never took place, and that when they were able to live in harmony and to
maintain friendly relations with you, they wantonly incurred hatred, and were held in execration?</p>

They have been prevailed upon, say my opponents, by mere assertions, been led into vain
hopes; and in their reckless madness have chosen to incur voluntarily the risks of death, although
they had hitherto seen nothing of such a kind as could by its wonderful and strange
character induce them to adopt this manner of worship. Nay, because they saw all these
things to be done by Christ Himself and by His apostles, who being sent throughout the
whole world carried with them the blessings of the Father, which they dispensed in benefiting3353
as well the minds as the bodies of men; overcome by the force of the very truth itself
they both devoted themselves to God, and reckoned it as but a small sacrifice to surrender

they have extolled3354 small matters to an inordinate degree, and have magnified trivial affairs
with most pretentious boastfulness. And3355 would that all things could have been reduced
to writing,—both those which were done by Himself, and those which were accomplished
by His apostles with equal authority and power. Such an assemblage of miracles, however,
would make you more incredulous; and perhaps you might be able to discover a passage
from which3356 it would seem very probable, both that additions were made to facts, and
that falsehoods were inserted in writings and commentaries. But in nations which were
unknown to the writers, and which themselves knew not the use of letters, all that was done
could not have been embraced in the records or even have reached the ears of all men; or,
if any were committed to written and connected narrative, some insertions and additions
would have been made by the malevolence of the demons and of men like to them, whose
care and study it is to obstruct3357 the progress of this truth: there would have been some
changes and mutilations of words and of syllables, at once to mar the faith of the cautious
and to impair the moral effect of the deeds. But it will never avail them that it be gathered
from written testimony only who and what Christ was; for His cause has been put on such
a basis, that if what we say be admitted to be true, He is by the confession of all proved to
have been God.</p>

<p>57. You do not believe our writings, and we do not believe yours. We devise falsehoods
concerning Christ, you say; and you put forth baseless and false statements concerning your
gods: for no god has descended from heaven, or in his own person and life has sketched out
your system, or in a similar way thrown discredit on our system and our ceremonies. These
were written by men; those, too, were written by men—set forth in human speech; and
whatever you seek to say concerning our writers, remember that about yours, too, you will
find these things said with equal force. What is contained in your writings you wish to be
treated as true; those things, also, which are attested in our books, you must of necessity
confess to be true. You accuse our system of falsehood; we, too, accuse yours of falsehood.
But ours is more ancient, say you, therefore most credible and trustworthy; as if, indeed,
antiquity were not the most fertile source of errors, and did not herself put forth those things
which in discreditable fables have attached the utmost infamy to the gods. For could not
falsehoods have been both spoken and believed ten thousand years ago, or is it not most
probable that that which is near to our own time should be more credible than that which
is separated by a long term of years? For these of ours are brought forward on the faith of
witnesses, those of yours on the ground of opinions; and it is much more natural that there
should be less invention in matters of recent occurrence, than in those far removed in the

readily believed. See that this be not rather a stronger reason for believing that they have
not been adulterated by any false statements, but were put forth by men of simple mind,
who knew not how to trick out their tales with meretricious ornaments. But the language
is mean and vulgar. For truth never seeks deceitful polish, nor in that which is well ascertained
and certain does it allow itself to be led away into excessive prolixity. Syllogisms, enthymemes,
definitions, and all those ornaments by which men seek to establish their statements, aid
those groping for the truth, but do not clearly mark its great features. But he who really
knows the subject under discussion, neither defines, nor deduces, nor seeks the other tricks

<p>59. Your narratives, my opponent says, are overrun with barbarisms and solecisms, and
disfigured by monstrous blunders. A censure, truly, which shows a childish and petty spirit;
for if we allow that it is reasonable, let us cease to use certain kinds of fruit because they
grow with prickles on them, and other growths useless for food, which on the one hand
cannot support us, and yet do not on the other hinder us from enjoying that which specially
excels, and which nature has designed to be most wholesome for us. For how, I pray you,
does it interfere with or retard the comprehension of a statement, whether anything be
pronounced smoothly3358 or with uncouth roughness? whether that have the grave accent
which ought to have the acute, or that have the acute which ought to have the grave? Or
how is the truth of a statement diminished, if an error is made in number or case, in preposition,
participle, or conjunction? Let that pomposity of style and strictly regulated diction
be reserved for public assemblies, for lawsuits, for the forum and the courts of justice, and
by all means be handed over to those who, striving after the soothing influences of pleasant
sensations, bestow all their care upon splendour of language. But when we are discussing
matters far removed from mere display, we should consider what is said, not with what
charm it is said nor how it tickles the ears, but what benefits it confers on the hearers, especially
since we know that some even who devoted themselves to philosophy, not only disregarded
refinement of style, but also purposely adopted a vulgar meanness when they might
have spoken with greater elegance and richness, lest forsooth they might impair the stern
gravity of speech and revel rather in the pretentious show of the Sophists. For indeed it
evidences a worthless heart to seek enjoyment in matters of importance; and when you have
to deal with those who are sick and diseased, to pour into their ears dulcet sounds, not to
apply a remedy to their wounds. Yet, if you consider the true state of the case, no language
is naturally perfect, and in like manner none is faulty. For what natural reason is there, or
what law written in the constitution of the world, that paries should be called hic,3359 and
sella hæc?—since neither have they sex distinguished by male and female, nor can the most
learned man tell me what hic and hæc are, or why one of them denotes the male sex while
the other is applied to the female. These conventionalities are man’s, and certainly are not
indispensable to all persons for the use of forming their language; for paries might perhaps
have been called hæc, and sella hic, without any fault being found, if it had been agreed upon
at first that they should be so called, and if this practice had been maintained by following
generations in their daily conversation. And yet, O you who charge our writings with disgraceful
blemishes, have you not these solecisms in those most perfect and wonderful books
of yours? Does not one of you make the plur. of uter, utria? another utres?3360 Do you not

pane andhic panis, hic sanguis and hoc sanguen? Are not candelabrum and jugulum in like
manner written jugulus and candelaber? For if each noun cannot have more than one gender,
and if the same word cannot be of this gender and of that, for one gender cannot pass into
the other, he commits as great a blunder who utters masculine genders under the laws of
feminines, as he who applies masculine articles to feminine genders. And yet we see you
using masculines as feminines, and feminines as masculines, and those which you call neuter
both in this way and in that, without any distinction. Either, therefore, it is no blunder to
employ them indifferently, and in that case it is vain for you to say that our works are disfigured
with monstrous solecisms; or if the way in which each ought to be employed is unalterably
fixed, you also are involved in similar errors, although you have on your side all
the Epicadi, Cæsellii, Verrii, Scauri, and Nisi.</p>

<p>60. But, say my opponents, if Christ was God, why did He appear in human shape, and
why was He cut off by death after the manner of men? Could that power which is invisible,
and which has no bodily substance, have come upon earth and adapted itself to the world
and mixed in human society, otherwise than by taking to itself some covering of a more
solid substance, which might bear the gaze of the eyes, and on which the look of the least
observant might fix itself? For what mortal is there who could have seen Him, who could
have distinguished Him, if He had decreed to come upon the earth such as He is in His own
primitive nature, and such as He has chosen to be in His own proper character and divinity?
He took upon Him, therefore, the form of man; and under the guise of our race He im-
prisoned His power, so that He could be seen and carefully regarded, might speak and teach,
and without encroaching on the sovereignty and government of the King Supreme, might
carry out all those objects for the accomplishment of which He had come into the world.</p>

those things which He had ordained to be done in the world, without feigning Himself a
man? If it were necessary to do as you say, He perhaps would have done so; because it was
not necessary, He acted otherwise. The reasons why He chose to do it in this way, and did
not choose to do it in that, are unknown, being involved in so great obscurity, and comprehensible
by scarcely any; but these you might perhaps have understood if you were not
already prepared not to understand, and were not shaping your course to brave unbelief,

<p>62. But, you will say, He was cut off by death as men are. Not Christ Himself; for it is
impossible either that death should befall what is divine, or that that should waste away and
disappear in death which is one in its substance, and not compounded, nor formed by
bringing together any parts. Who, then, you ask, was seen hanging on the cross? Who dead?
The human form,3361 I reply, which He had put on,3362 and which He bore about with Him.
It is a tale passing belief, you say, and wrapt in dark obscurity; if you will, it is not dark, and
is established by a very close analogy.3363 If the Sibyl, when she was uttering and pouring
forth her prophecies and oracular responses, was filled, as you say, with Apollo’s power,
had been cut down and slain by impious robbers,3364 would Apollo be said to have been
slain in her? If Bacis,3365 if Helenus, Marcius,3366 and other soothsayers, had been in like
manner robbed of life and light when raving as inspired, would any one say that those who,
speaking by their mouths, declared to inquirers what should be done,3367 had perished according
to the conditions of human life? The death of which you speak was that of the human
body which He had assumed,3368 not His own—of that which was borne, not of the bearer;
and not even this death would He3369 have stooped to suffer, were it not that a matter of
such importance was to be dealt with, and the inscrutable plan of fate3370 brought to light
in hidden mysteries.</p>

know, nor those even who are called gods of the world can in any wise reach by fancy and
conjecture; which none can discover,3371 except those whom Christ Himself has thought fit
to bestow the blessing of so great knowledge upon, and to lead into the secret recesses of
the inner treasury of wisdom? Do you then see that if He had determined that none should
do Him violence, He should have striven to the utmost to keep off from Him His enemies,
even by directing His power against them?3372 Could not He, then, who had restored their
sight to the blind, make His enemies blind if it were necessary? Was it hard or troublesome
for Him to make them weak, who had given strength to the feeble? Did He who bade3373
the lame walk, not know how to take from them all power to move their limbs,3374 by
making their sinews stiff?3375 Would it have been difficult for Him who drew the dead from
their tombs to inflict death on whom He would? But because reason required that those
things which had been resolved on should be done here also in the world itself, and in no
other fashion than was done, He, with gentleness passing understanding and belief, regarding
as but childish trifles the wrongs which men did Him, submitted to the violence of savage
and most hardened robbers;3376 nor did He think it worth while to take account of what
their daring had aimed at, if He only showed to His disciples what they were in duty bound
to look for from Him. For when many things about the perils of souls, many evils about

He spoke falsely, that He even held out hopes without the slightest foundation, not even in

Nay, if you were kind and gentle in spirit, you ought to esteem Him even for this alone, that
He promised to you things which you might well wish and hope for; that He was the bearer
of good news; that His message was such as to trouble no one’s mind, nay, rather to fill all

<p>65. Oh ungrateful and impious age, prepared3391 for its own destruction by its extraordinary
obstinacy! If there had come to you a physician from lands far distant and unknown to
you before, offering some medicine to keep off from you altogether every kind of disease
and sickness, would you not all eagerly hasten to him? Would you not with every kind of
flattery and honour receive him into your houses, and treat him kindly? Would you not
wish that that kind of medicine should be quite sure, and should be genuine, which promised
that even to the utmost limits of life you should be free from such countless bodily distresses?
And though it were a doubtful matter, you would yet entrust yourselves to him; nor would
you hesitate to drink the unknown draught, indited by the hope of health set before you
and by the love of safety.3392 Christ shone out and appeared to tell us news of the utmost
importance, bringing an omen of prosperity, and a message of safety to those who believe.
What, I pray you, means3393 this cruelty, what such barbarity, nay rather, to speak more
truly, scornful3394 pride, not only to harass the messenger and bearer of so great a gift with
taunting words; but even to assail Him with fierce hostility, and with all the weapons which
can be showered upon Him, and with all modes of destruction? Are His words displeasing,
and are you offended when you hear them? Count them as but a soothsayer’s empty tales.
Does He speak very stupidly, and promise foolish gifts? Laugh with scorn as wise men, and
leave Him in His folly3395 to be tossed about among His errors. What means this fierceness,
to repeat what has been said more than once; what a passion, so murderous? to declare implacable
hostility towards one who has done nothing to deserve it at your hands; to wish, if
it were allowed you, to tear Him limb from limb, who not only did no man any harm, but
with uniform kindness3396 told His enemies what salvation was being brought to them from

to suppose that -t has dropped off, and read diceret as above, with the two Roman editions and LB. Gelenius,
followed by Ursinus, emended omnibus docuerit—“with uniform kindness taught to all.” It may be well to give
here an instance of the very insufficient grounds on which supposed references to Scripture are sometimes based.

hate the name of Christ, turning aside for a little from the defence primarily set up:—If you
think it no dishonour to answer when asked a question, explain to us and say what is the
cause, what the reason, that you pursue Christ with so bitter hostility? or what offences you
remember which He did, that at the mention of His name you are roused to bursts of mad
and savage fury?3399 Did He ever, in claiming for Himself power as king, fill the whole world
with bands of the fiercest soldiers; and of nations at peace from the beginning, did He destroy
and put an end to some, and compel others to submit to His yoke and serve Him? Did He
ever, excited by grasping3400 avarice, claim as His own by right all that wealth to have
abundance of which men strive eagerly? Did He ever, transported with lustful passions,
break down by force the barriers of purity, or stealthily lie in wait for other men’s wives?
Did He ever, puffed up with haughty arrogance, inflict at random injuries and insults,
without any distinction of persons? (B) And if He was not worthy that you should listen to

<note type="footnote">3398 There has been much confusion in dealing with the first seven chapters of this book, owing to the leaves
of the ms. having been arranged in wrong order, as was pointed out at an early period by some one who noted
on the margin that there was some transposition. To this circumstance, however, Oehler alone seems to have
called attention; but the corruption was so manifest, that the various editors gave themselves full liberty to rearrange
and dispose the text more correctly. The first leaf of the ms. concludes with the words sine ullius personæ
discriminibus inrogavit, “without any distinction of person,” and is followed by one which begins with the words
(A, end of c. 5) et non omnium virtutum, “and (not) by an eager longing,” and ends tanta experiatur examina,
“undergoes such countless ills” (middle of c. 7). The third and fourth leaves begin with the words (B. end of c.
1) utrum in cunctos…amoverit? qui si dignos, “Now if He was not worthy” (see notes), and run on to end of c.
5, quadam dulcedine, “by some charm;” while the fifth (C, middle of c. 7) begins atque ne (or utrumne) illum,
“whether the earth,” and there is no further difficulty. This order is retained in the first ed., and also by Hildebrand,
who supposes three lacunæ at A, B, and C, to account for the abruptness and want of connection; but it is at
once seen that, on changing the order of the leaves, so that they shall run B A C, the argument and sense are
perfectly restored. This arrangement seems to have been first adopted in LB., and is followed by the later editors,

<p>2. But indeed, some one will say, He deserved our hatred because He has driven religion3404
from the world, because He has kept men back from seeking to honour the gods.3405
Is He then denounced as the destroyer of religion and promoter of impiety, who brought
true religion into the world, who opened the gates of piety to men blind and verily living in
impiety, and pointed out to whom they should bow themselves? Or is there any truer religion—
one more serviceable,3406 powerful, and right—than to have learned to know the
supreme God, to know how to pray to God Supreme, who alone is the source and fountain
of all good, the creator,3407 founder, and framer of all that endures, by whom all things on
earth and all in heaven are quickened, and filled with the stir of life, and without whom
there would assuredly be nothing to bear any name, and have any substance? But perhaps
you doubt whether there is that ruler of whom we speak, and rather incline to believe in the
existence of Apollo, Diana, Mercury, Mars. Give a true judgment;3408 and, looking round
on all these things which we see, any one will rather doubt whether all the other gods exist,
than hesitate with regard to the God whom we all know by nature, whether when we cry
out, O God, or when we make God the witness of wicked deeds,3409 and raise our face to
heaven as though He saw us.</p>
<note type="footnote">3404 Pl.</note>
<note type="footnote">3405 This seems the true rationale of the sentence, viewed in relation to the context. Immediately before,
Arnobius suggests that the hatred of Christ by the heathen is unjustifiable, because they had suffered nothing
at His hands; now an opponent is supposed to rejoin, “But He has deserved our hatred by assailing our religion.”
The introductory particles at enim fully bear this out, from their being regularly used to introduce a rejoinder.
Still, by Orelli and other editors the sentence is regarded as interrogative, and in that case would be, “Has He
indeed merited our hatred by driving out,” etc., which, however, not merely breaks away from what precedes,
but also makes the next sentence somewhat lame. The older editors, too, read it without any mark of interrogation.</note>
<note type="footnote">3406 i.e., according to Orelli, to the wants of men; but possibly it may here have the subjunctive meaning of
“more full of service,” i.e., to God.</note>
<note type="footnote">3407 So the ms., reading perpetuarum pater, fundator conditor rerum, but all the editions pa-ri-ter, “alike,”
which has helped to lead Orelli astray. He suggests et fons est perpetu-us pariter, etc., “perpetual fountain,…of
all things alike the founder and framer.” It has been also proposed by Oehler (to get rid of the difficulty felt here)
to transfer per metathesin, the idea of “enduring,” to God; but the reference is surely quite clear, viewed as a
distinction between the results of God’s working and that of all other beings.</note>
<note type="footnote">3408 So the ms. and almost all edd, reading da verum judicium, for which Heraldus suggested da naturæ, or
verum animæ judicium, “give the judgment of nature,” or “the true judgment of the soul,” as if appeal were made
to the inner sense; but in his later observations he proposed da puerum judicem, “give a boy as judge,” which is
adopted by Orelli. Meursius, merely transposing d-a, reads much more naturally ad—“at a true judgment.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3409 The ms. reading is illum testem d-e-um constituimus improbarum, retained in the edd. with the change
of -arum into -orum. Perhaps for deum should be read r-e-r-um, “make him witness of wicked things.” With
this passage compare iii. 31–33.</note>

<p>3. But He did not permit men to make supplication to the lesser gods. Do you, then,
know who are, or where are the lesser gods? Has mistrust of them, or the way in which they
were mentioned, ever touched you, so that you are justly indignant that their worship has
been done away with and deprived of all honour?3410 But if haughtiness of mind and arrogance,
3411 as it is called by the Greeks, did not stand in your way and hinder you, you might
long ago have been able to understand what He forbade to be done, or wherefore; within
what limits He would have true religion lie;3412 what danger arose to you from that which
you thought obedience? or from what evils you would escape if you broke away from your
dangerous delusion.</p>

<p>4. But all these things will be more clearly and distinctly noticed when we have proceeded
further. For we shall show that Christ did not teach the nations impiety, but delivered ignorant
and wretched men from those who most wickedly wronged them.3413 We do not believe,
you say, that what He says is true. What, then? Have you no doubt as to the things which3414
you say are not true, while, as they are only at hand, and not yet disclosed3415 they can by
no means be disproved? But He, too, does not prove what He promises. It is so; for, as I
said, there can be no proof of things still in the future. Since, then, the nature of the future
is such that it cannot be grasped and comprehended by any anticipation,3416 is it not more
rational,3417 of two things uncertain and hanging in doubtful suspense, rather to believe
that which carries with it some hopes, than that which brings none at all? For in the one case
there is no danger, if that which is said to be at hand should prove vain and groundless; in
the other there is the greatest loss, even3418 the loss of salvation, if, when the time has come,
it be shown that there was nothing false in what was declared.3419</p>

which to-day with perverse obstinacy you refuse to believe, time may too late show to be
true,3421 and ceaseless remorse punish you? Do not even these proofs at least give you faith

rhetoricians, lawyers, and physicians, those, too, who pry into the mysteries of philosophy,
seek to learn these things, despising those in which but now they trusted? that slaves choose
to be tortured by their masters as they please, wives to be divorced, children to be disinherited
by their parents, rather than be unfaithful to Christ and cast off the oaths of the warfare of
salvation? that although so terrible punishments have been denounced by you against those
who follow the precepts of this religion, it3424 increases even more, and a great host strives
more boldly against all threats and the terrors which would keep it back, and is roused to
zealous faith by the very attempt to hinder it? Do you indeed believe that these things happen
idly and at random? that these feelings are adopted on being met with by chance?3425 Is not
this, then, sacred and divine? Or do you believe that, without God’s grace, their minds are

envious power3439 brought forth, and formed so ignorant and proud, that, although we
know nothing at all, we yet deceive ourselves, and are uplifted by pride and arrogance so as
to suppose ourselves possessed of knowledge? For, to pass by divine things, and those plunged
in natural obscurity, can any man explain that which in the Phædrus3440 the well-known

manifold, of many kinds? for what purposes he was produced? by whose ingenuity he was

of some moisture;3441 or whether he received3442 these outlines of body, and this cast of
face, from the hand of some maker and framer? Can he, I say, know these things, which lie
open to all, and are recognisable by3443 the senses common to all,—by what causes we are

“cannot tell what man is,” Socrates at once proceeds to lead him to the required knowledge by the usual dialectic.

Pythagoras of Samos, and to Archytas? he who divides the soul, and sets up bodiless forms,

Heraclitus see things produced by the changes of fires? Thales, by the condensing of water?
3463 Did Pythagoras see them spring from number?3464 Did Plato see the bodiless forms?
Democritus, the meeting together of the atoms? Or do those who assert that nothing at all
can be comprehended by man, know whether what they say is true, so as to3465 understand
that the very proposition which they lay down is a declaration of truth?3466 Since, then, you
have discovered and learned nothing, and are led by credulity to assert all those things which
you write, and comprise in thousands of books; what kind of judgment, pray, is this, so
unjust that you mock at faith in us, while you see that you have it in common with our
readiness of belief?3467 But you say you believe wise men, well versed in all kinds of learning!—
those, forsooth, who know nothing, and agree in nothing which they say; who join
battle with their opponents on behalf of their own opinions, and are always contending
fiercely with obstinate hostility; who, overthrowing, refuting, and bringing to nought the
one the other’s doctrines, have made all things doubtful, and have shown from their very
want of agreement that nothing can he known.</p>

Thales is merely said to have referred the generation and maintenance of all things to moisture, although by
others he is represented as teaching the doctrine ascribed to him above. Cf. Cic., de Nat. Deor., i. 10, and Heraclides,

by Canterus as meaning “that numbers have understanding,” i.e., so as to be the cause of all. Gelenius, followed
by Canterus, reads -os scit—“does Pyth. know numbers,” which is absurdly out of place. Heraldus approved of
a reading in the margin of Ursinus (merely inserting o after c), “that numbers unite,” which seems very plausible.

believe and hearken to them in great measure;3468 and what reason is there either that you
should have more liberty in this respect, or that we should have less? You believe Plato,3469
Cronius,3470 Numenius, or any one you please; we believe and confide in Christ.3471 How
unreasonable it is, that when we both abide3472 by teachers, and have one and the same
thing, belief, in common, you should wish it to be granted to you to receive what is so3473
said by them, but should be unwilling to hear and see what is brought forward by Christ!
And yet, if we chose to compare cause with cause, we are better able to point out what we
have followed in Christ, than you to point out what you have followed in the philosophers.
And we, indeed, have followed in him these things—those glorious works and most potent
virtues which he manifested and displayed in diverse miracles, by which any one might be
led to feel the necessity of believing, and might decide with confidence that they were not
such as might be regarded as man’s, but such as showed some divine and unknown power.
What virtues did you follow in the philosophers, that it was more reasonable for you to believe
them than for us to believe Christ? Was any one of them ever able by one word, or by a
single command, I will not say to restrain, to check3474 the madness of the sea or the fury
of the storm; to restore their sight to the blind, or give it to men blind from their birth; to
call the dead back to life; to put an end to the sufferings of years; but—and this is much
easier3475—to heal by one rebuke a boil, a scab, or a thorn fixed in the skin? Not that we

I say this without displeasing Him—if Christ Himself were to use in the gatherings of the
nations, who would assent? who would listen? who would say that He decided3481 anything

pouring forth vain and baseless statements? His virtues have been made manifest to you,
and that unheard-of power over things, whether that which was openly exercised by Him
or that which was used3483 over the whole world by those who proclaimed Him: it has
subdued the fires of passion, and caused races, and peoples, and nations most diverse in

Macedonia, Epirus; in all islands and provinces on which the rising and setting sun shines;

by changing a single letter, reads in the earlier edd. pro-fer-etis—“Will you,” or, “You will bring forward,” etc.</note>

be quenched, into which we have learned that souls are cast by their foes and enemies?
What, does not your Plato also, in the book which he wrote on the immortality of the soul,
name the rivers Acheron, Styx,3503 Cocytus, and Pyriphlegethon, and assert that in them
souls are rolled along, engulphed, and burned up? But though a man of no little wisdom,3504
and of accurate judgment and discernment, he essays a problem which cannot be solved;
so that, while he says that the soul is immortal, everlasting, and without bodily substance,
he yet says that they are punished, and makes them suffer pain.3505 But what man does not
see that that which is immortal, which is simple,3506 cannot be subject to any pain; that that,
on the contrary, cannot be immortal which does suffer pain? And yet his opinion is not very
far from the truth. For although the gentle and kindly disposed man thought it inhuman
cruelty to condemn souls to death, he yet not unreasonably3507 supposed that they are cast
into rivers blazing with masses of flame, and loathsome from their foul abysses. For they
are cast in, and being annihilated, pass away vainly in3508 everlasting destruction. For theirs
is an intermediate3509 state, as has been learned from Christ’s teaching; and they are such
that they may on the one hand perish if they have not known God, and on the other be de-
livered from death if they have given heed to His threats3510 and proffered favours. And to
make manifest3511 what is unknown, this is man’s real death, this which leaves nothing behind.

hopes to us, which is said by some men till now unheard of,3517 and carried away by an extravagant
opinion of themselves, that souls are immortal, next in point of rank to the God
and ruler of the world, descended from that parent and sire, divine, wise, learned, and not
within reach of the body by contact.3518 Now, because this is true and certain, and because
we have been produced by Him who is perfect without flaw, we live unblameably, I suppose,
and therefore without blame; are good, just, and upright, in nothing depraved; no passion
overpowers, no lust degrades us; we maintain vigorously the unremitting practice of all the
virtues. And because all our souls have one origin, we therefore think exactly alike; we do
not differ in manners, we do not differ in beliefs; we all know God; and there are not as
many opinions as there are men in the world, nor are these divided in infinite variety.3519</p>

causes pursue us from the world’s circles,3521 through the working of which we become
bad, ay, most wicked; burn with lust and anger, spend our life in shameful deeds, and are
given over to the lust of all by the prostitution of our bodies for hire. And how can the material
unite with the immaterial? or how can that which God has made, be led by weaker
causes to degrade itself through the practice of vice? Will you lay aside your habitual arrogance,
3522 O men, who claim God as your Father, and maintain that you are immortal, just
as He is? Will you inquire, examine, search what you are yourselves, whose you are, of what
parentage you are supposed to be, what you do in the world, in what way you are born, how
you leap to life? Will you, laying aside all partiality, consider in the silence of your thoughts
that we are creatures either quite like the rest, or separated by no great difference? For what
is there to show that we do not resemble them? or what excellence is in us, such that we
scorn to be ranked as creatures? Their bodies are built up on bones, and bound closely together
by sinews; and our bodies are in like manner built up on bones, and bound closely
together by sinews. They inspire the air through nostrils, and in breathing expire it again;
and we in like manner drew in the air, and breathed it out with frequent respirations. They
have been arranged in classes, female and male; we, too, have been fashioned by our Creator
into the same sexes.3523 Their young are born from the womb, and are begotten through
union of the sexes; and we are born from sexual embraces, and are brought forth and sent
into life from our mothers’ wombs. They are supported by eating and drinking, and get rid
of the filth which remains by the lower parts; and we are supported by eating and drinking,
and that which nature refuses we deal with in the same way. Their care is to ward off deathbringing
famine, and of necessity to be on the watch for food. What else is our aim in the
business of life, which presses so much upon us,3524 but to seek the means by which the
danger of starvation may be avoided, and carking anxiety put away? They are exposed to
disease and hunger, and at last lose their strength by reason of age. What, then? are we not
exposed to these evils, and are we not in like manner weakened by noxious diseases, destroyed

I might believe that this was quite true, if all men lived rationally and wisely,
never swerved aside from their duty, abstained from what is forbidden, and withheld
themselves from baseness, and if no one through folly and the blindness of ignorance demanded
what is injurious and dangerous to himself. I should wish, however, to know what
this reason is, through which we are more excellent than all the tribes of animals. Is it because
we have made for ourselves houses, by which we can avoid the cold of winter and heat of
summer? What! do not the other animals show forethought in this respect? Do we not see
some build nests as dwellings for themselves in the most convenient situations; others
shelter and secure themselves in rocks and lofty crags; others burrow in the ground, and
prepare for themselves strongholds and lairs in the pits which they have dug out? But if
nature, which gave them life, had chosen to give to them also hands to help them, they too
would, without doubt, raise lofty buildings and strike out new works of art.3526 Yet, even
in those things which they make with beaks and claws, we see that there are many appearances
of reason and wisdom which we men are unable to copy, however much we ponder them,

nor, in fine, the other furniture which family life requires. These are not the gifts of science,
but the suggestions of most pressing necessity; nor did the arts descend with men’s souls
from the inmost heavens, but here on earth have they all been painfully sought out and
brought to light,3527 and gradually acquired in process of time by careful thought. But if
the soul3528 had in itself the knowledge which it is fitting that a race should have indeed
which is divine and immortal, all men would from the first know everything; nor would
there be an age unacquainted with any art, or not furnished with practical knowledge. But
now a life of want and in need of many things, noticing some things happen accidentally to
its advantage, while it imitates, experiments, and tries, while it fails, remoulds, changes,

<p>19. But if men either knew themselves thoroughly, or had the slightest knowledge of
God,3530 they would never claim as their own a divine and immortal nature; nor would they
think themselves something great because they have made for themselves gridirons, basins,
and bowls,3531 because they have made under-shirts, outer-shirts, cloaks, plaids, robes of
state, knives, cuirasses and swords, mattocks, hatchets, ploughs. Never, I say, carried away
by pride and arrogance, would they believe themselves to be deities of the first rank, and
fellows of the highest in his exaltation,3532 because they3533 had devised the arts of grammar,
music, oratory, and geometry. For we do not see what is so wonderful in these arts, that because
of their discovery the soul should be believed to be above the sun as well as all the
stars, to surpass both in grandeur and essence the whole universe, of which these are parts.
For what else do these assert that they can either declare or teach, than that we may learn
to know the rules and differences of nouns, the intervals in the sounds of different tones,
that we may speak persuasively in lawsuits, that we may measure the confines of the earth?
Now, if the soul had brought these arts with it from the celestial regions, and it were impossible
not to know them, all men would long before this be busied with them over all the
earth, nor would any race of men be found which would not be equally and similarly instructed
in them all. But now how few musicians, logicians, and geometricians are there in the
world! how few orators, poets, critics! From which it is clear, as has been said pretty frequently,
that these things were discovered under the pressure of time and circumstances,
and that the soul did not fly hither divinely3534 taught, because neither are all learned, nor
can all learn; and3535 there are very many among them somewhat deficient in shrewdness,
and stupid, and they are constrained to apply themselves to learning only by fear of stripes.
But if it were a fact that the things which we learn are but reminiscences3536—as has been
maintained in the systems of the ancients—as we start from the same truth, we should all
have learned alike, and remember alike—not have diverse, very numerous, and inconsistent

whom you believe to be very like the higher power, conceive this idea; and because it can
be done if we come into direct contact with it, let us conceive it just as if we came into contact.
Let us then imagine a place dug out in the earth, fit for dwelling in, formed into a chamber,
enclosed by a roof and walls, not cold in winter, not too warm in summer, but so regulated
and equable that we suffer neither cold3537 nor the violent heat of summer. To this let there
not come any sound or cry whatever,3538 of bird, of beast, of storm, of man—of any noise,
in fine, or of the thunder’s3539 terrible crash. Let us next devise a way in which it may be

or Pythagoras, or some one of those who are regarded as of superhuman wit, or have been
declared most wise by the oracles of the gods. And when this has been done, he must then
be nourished and brought up on suitable food. Let us therefore provide a nurse also, who
shall come to him always naked, ever silent, uttering not a word, and shall not open her
mouth and lips to speak at all, but after suckling him, and doing what else is necessary, shall
leave him fast asleep, and remain day and night before the closed doors; for it is usually
necessary that the nurse’s care should be near at hand, and that she should watch his varying
motions. But when the child begins to need to be supported by more substantial food, let it
be borne in by the same nurse, still undressed, and maintaining the same unbroken silence.
Let the food, too, which is carried in be always precisely the same, with no difference in the
material, and without being re-cooked by means of different flavours; but let it be either
pottage of millet, or bread of spelt, or, in imitation of the ancients, chestnuts roasted in the
hot ashes, or berries plucked from forest trees. Let him moreover, never learn to drink wine,
and let nothing else be used to quench his thirst than pure cold water from the spring, and

child, whom we have supposed to be brought up in this way, whether this is credible, or has

suppose, then, that he grows up, reared in a secluded, lonely spot, spending as many years

he has lived through forty years; and if it is true that he is a part of the divine essence, and3544

<p>24. Why, O Plato, do you in the Meno3561 put to a young slave certain questions relating
to the doctrines of number, and strive to prove by his answers that what we learn we do not
learn, but that we merely call back to memory those things which we knew in former times?
Now, if he answers you correctly,—for it would not be becoming that we should refuse
credit to what you say,—he is led to do so not by his real knowledge,3562 but by his intelligence;
and it results from his having some acquaintance with numbers, through using them
every day, that when questioned he follows your meaning, and that the very process of
multiplication always prompts him. But if you are really assured that the souls of men are
immortal and endowed with knowledge when they fly hither, cease to question that youth
whom you see to be ignorant3563 and accustomed to the ways of men;3564 call to you that
man of forty years, and ask of him, not anything out of the way or obscure about triangles,
about squares, not what a cube is, or a second power,3565 the ratio of nine to eight, or finally,
of four to three; but ask him that with which all are acquainted—what twice two are, or
twice three. We wish to see, we wish to know, what answer he gives when questioned—whether
he solves the desired problem. In such a case will he perceive, although his ears are open,
whether you are saying anything, or asking anything, or requiring some answer from him?
and will he not stand like a stock, or the Marpesian rock,3566 as the saying is, dumb and
speechless, not understanding or knowing even this—whether you are talking with him or
with another, conversing with another or with him;3567 whether that is intelligible speech
which you utter, or merely a cry having no meaning, but drawn out and protracted to no
purpose?</p>

the bonds of the body. But when he goes to school, you say, and is instructed by the teaching
of masters, he is made wise, learned, and lays aside the ignorance which till now clung to
him. And an ass, and an ox as well, if compelled by constant practice, learn to plough and

were dæmons, while men stood next. To this Orelli supposes that Arnobius here refers.</note>

<p>26. But when I hear the soul spoken of as something extraordinary, as akin and very
nigh to God, and as coming hither knowing all about past times, I would have it teach, not
learn; and not go back to the rudiments, as the saying is, after being advanced in knowledge,
but hold fast the truths it has learned when it enters its earthly body.3573 For unless it were
so, how could it be discerned whether the soul recalls to memory or learns for the first time
that which it hears; seeing that it is much easier to believe that it learns what it is unacquainted
with, than that it has forgot what it knew but a little before, and that its power of recalling
former things is lost through the interposition of the body? And what becomes of the doctrine
that souls, being bodiless, do not have substance? For that which is not connected with3574
any bodily form is not hampered by the opposition of another, nor can anything be led3575
to destroy that which cannot be touched by what is set against it. For as a proportion established
in bodies remains unaffected and secure, though it be lost to sight in a thousand cases;
so must souls, if they are not material, as is asserted, retain their knowledge3576 of the past,
however thoroughly they may have been enclosed in bodies.3577 Moreover, the same reasoning
not only shows that they are not incorporeal, but deprives them of all3578 immortality
even, and refers them to the limits within which life is usually closed. For whatever is led
by some inducement to change and alter itself, so that it cannot retain its natural state, must
of necessity be considered essentially passive. But that which is liable and exposed to suffering,
is declared to be corruptible by that very capacity of suffering.</p>

<p>27. So then, if souls lose all their knowledge on being fettered with the body, they must
experience something of such a nature that it makes them become blindly forgetful.3579 For
they cannot, without becoming subject to anything whatever, either lay aside their knowledge
while they maintain their natural state, or without change in themselves pass into a different
state. Nay, we rather think that what is one, immortal, simple, in whatever it may be, must
always retain its own nature, and that it neither should nor could be subject to anything, if
indeed it purposes to endure and abide within the limits of true immortality. For all suffering
is a passage for death and destruction, a way leading to the grave, and bringing an end of
life which may not be escaped from; and if souls are liable to it, and yield to its influence
and assaults, they indeed have life given to them only for present use, not as a secured possession,

with regard to so important a matter.</p>

<p>28. And yet, that we may not be as ignorant when we leave you as before, let us hear
from you3581 how you say that the soul, on being enwrapt in an earthly body, has no recollection
of the past; while, after being actually placed in the body itself, and rendered almost
senseless by union with it, it holds tenaciously and faithfully the things which many years
before, eighty if you choose to say so, or even more, it either did, or suffered, or said, or
heard. For if, through being hampered by the body, it does not remember those things which
it knew long ago, and before it came into this world,3582 there is more reason that it should
forget those things which it has done from time to time since being shut up in the body,
than those which it did before entering it,3583 while not yet connected with men. For the
same body which3584 deprives of memory the soul which enters it,3585 should cause what
is done within itself also to be wholly forgotten; for one cause cannot bring about two results,
and these opposed to each other, so as to make some things to be forgotten, and allow others
to be remembered by him who did them. But if souls, as you call them, are prevented and
hindered by their fleshly members from recalling their former knowledge,3586 how do they
remember what has been arranged3587 in these very bodies, and know that they are spirits,
and have no bodily substance, being exalted by their condition as immortal beings?3588 how
do they know what rank they hold in the universe, in what order they have been set apart
from other beings? how they have come to these, the lowest parts of the universe? what
properties they acquired, and from what circles,3589 in gliding along towards these regions?

at immense values. Cease to place man in the upper ranks, since he is of the lowest; and in
the highest orders, seeing that his person only is taken account of,3592 that he is needy,
poverty-stricken in his house and dwelling,3593 and was never entitled to be declared of illustrious

worse—you have also added causes by which vice should increase, and wickedness remain
incorrigible. For what man is there, although of a disposition which ever shuns what is of
bad repute and shameful, who, when he hears it said by very wise men that the soul is immortal,
and not subject to the decrees of the fates,3595 would not throw himself headlong
into all kinds of vice, and fearlessly3596 engage in and set about unlawful things? who would
not, in short, gratify his desires in all things demanded by his unbridled lust, strengthened
even further by its security and freedom from punishment?3597 For what will hinder him
from doing so? The fear of a power above and divine judgment? And how shall he be overcome
by any fear or dread who has been persuaded that he is immortal, just as the supreme
God Himself, and that no sentence can be pronounced upon him by God, seeing that there
is the same immortality in both, and that the one immortal being cannot be troubled by the

assuming also, as they do, many forms of torture? And who3600 will be so senseless and ignorant
of consequences,3601 as to believe that to imperishable spirits either the darkness of
Tartarus, or rivers of fire, or marshes with miry abysses, or wheels sent whirling through
the air,3602 can in any wise do harm? For that which is beyond reach, and not subject to the
laws of destruction, though it be surrounded by all the flames of the raging streams, be rolled
in the mire, overwhelmed by the fall of overhanging rocks and by the overthrow of huge
mountains, must remain safe and untouched without suffering any deadly harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, that conviction not only leads on to wickedness, from the very freedom to
sin which it suggests, but even takes away the ground of philosophy itself, and asserts that it
is vain to undertake its study, because of the difficulty of the work, which leads to no result.
For if it is true that souls know no end, and are ever3603 advancing with all generations,
what danger is there in giving themselves up to the pleasures of sense—despising and neglecting
the virtues by regard to which life is more stinted in its pleasures, and becomes less
attractive—and in letting loose their boundless lust to range eagerly and unchecked
through3604 all kinds of debauchery? Is it the danger of being worn out by such pleasures,
and corrupted by vicious effeminacy? And how can that be corrupted which is immortal,
which always exists, and is subject to no suffering? Is it the danger of being polluted by foul
and base deeds? And how can that be defiled which has no corporeal substance; or where
can corruption seat itself, where there is no place on which the mark of this very corruption
should fasten?</p>

<p>31. A certain neutral character, then, and undecided and doubtful nature of the soul,
has made room for philosophy, and found out a reason for its being sought after: while, that
is, that fellow3611 is full of dread because of evil deeds of which he is guilty; another conceives
great hopes if he shall do no evil, and pass his life in obedience to3612 duty and justice.
Thence it is that among learned men, and men endowed with excellent abilities, there is
strife as to the nature of the soul, and some say that it is subject to death, and cannot take
upon itself the divine substance; while others maintain that it is immortal, and cannot sink
under the power of death.3613 But this is brought about by the law ofthe soul’s neutral
character:3614 because, on the one hand, arguments present themselves to the one party by
which it is found that the soul3615 is capable of suffering, and perishable; and, on the other
hand, are not wanting to their opponents, by which it is shown that the soul is divine and
immortal.</p>

after death, and these only till the conflagration (Stob., Ecl. Phys., p. 372) which awaits the world, and ends the

know Him,—for the knowledge of Him is a kind of vital leaven3617 and cement to bind together
that which would otherwise fly apart,—let them,3618 then, laying aside their savage

beliefs, and entertain the same hopes? If we are thought deserving of ridicule because we
hold out to ourselves such a hope, the same ridicule awaits you too, who claim for yourselves
the hope of immortality. If you hold and follow a rational course, grant to us also a share in
it. If Plato in the Phædrus,3635 or another of this band of philosophers, had promised these
joys to us—that is, a way to escape death, or were able to provide it and bring us to the end
which he had promised,3636 it would have been fitting that we should seek to honour him
from whom we look for so great a gift and favour. Now, since Christ has not only promised
it, but also shown by His virtues, which were so great, that it can be made good, what strange
thing do we do, and on what grounds are we charged with folly, if we bow down and worship
His name3637 and majesty from whom we expect to receive both these blessings, that we may

<p>35. But, say my opponents, if souls are mortal and3639 of neutral character, how can they
from their neutral properties become immortal? If we should say that we do not know this,
and only believe it because said by3640 One mightier than we, when will our readiness of
belief seem mistaken if we believe3641 that to the almighty King nothing is hard, nothing
difficult, and that3642 what is impossible to us is possible to Him and at His command?3643
For is there anything which may withstand His will, or does it not follow3644 of necessity
that what He has willed must be done? Are we to infer from our distinctions what either
can or cannot be done; and are we not to consider that our reason is as mortal as we ourselves
are, and is of no importance with the Supreme? And yet, O ye who do not believe that the
soul is of a neutral character, and that it is held on the line midway between life and death,
are not all whatever whom fancy supposes to exist, gods, angels, dæmons, or whatever else
is their name, themselves too of a neutral character, and liable to change3645 in the uncertainty
of their future?3646 For if we all agree that there is one Father of all, who alone is immortal
and unbegotten, and if nothing at all is found before Him which could be named,3647 it
follows as a consequence that all these whom the imagination of men believes to be gods,
have been either begotten by Him or produced at His bidding. Are they3648 produced and
begotten? they are also later in order and time: if later in order and time, they must have an
origin, and beginning of birth and life; but that which has an entrance into and beginning

<p>36. But the gods are said to be immortal. Not by nature, then, but by the good-will and
favour of God their Father. In the same way, then, in which the boon3649 of immortality is
God’s gift to these who were assuredly produced,3650 will He deign to confer eternal life
upon souls also, although fell death seems able to cut them off and blot them out of existence
in utter annihilation.3651 The divine Plato, many of whose thoughts are worthy of God, and
not such as the vulgar hold, in that discussion and treatise entitled the Timæus, says that
the gods and the world are corruptible by nature, and in no wise beyond the reach of death,
but that their being is ever maintained3652 by the will of God, their King and Prince;3653 for
that that even which has been duly clasped and bound together by the surest bands is pre-
served only by God’s goodness; and that by no other than3654 by Him who bound their elements
together can they both be dissolved if necessary, and have the command given which
preserves their being.3655 If this is the case, then, and it is not fitting to think or believe
otherwise, why do you wonder that we speak of the soul as neutral in its character, when
Plato says that it is so even with the deities,3656 but that their life is kept up by God’s3657
grace, without break or end? For if by chance you knew it not, and because of its novelty it
was unknown to you before, now, though late, receive and learn from Him who knows and
has made it known, Christ, that souls are not the children of the Supreme Ruler, and did
not begin to be self-conscious, and to be spoken of in their own special character after being
created by Him;3658 but that some other is their parent, far enough removed from the chief

<p>37. But if souls were, as is said, the Lord’s children, and begotten by3659 the Supreme
Power, nothing would have been wanting to make them perfect, as they would have been
born with the most perfect excellence: they would all have had one mind, and been of one
accord; they would always dwell in the royal palace; and would not, passing by the seats of
bliss in which they had learned and kept in mind the noblest teachings, rashly seek these
regions of earth, that3660 they might live enclosed in gloomy bodies amid phlegm and blood,
among these bags of filth and most disgusting3661 vessels of urine. But, an opponent will
say, it was necessary that these parts too should be peopled, and therefore Almighty God
sent souls hither to form some colonies, as it were. And of what use are men to the world,
and on account of what are they necessary,3662 so that they may not be believed to have
been destined to live here and be the tenants of an earthly body for no purpose? They have
a share, my opponent says, in perfecting the completeness of this immense mass, and without
their addition this whole universe is incomplete and imperfect. What then? If there were
not men, would the world cease to discharge its functions? would the stars not go through
their changes? would there not be summers and winters? would the blasts of the winds be
lulled? and from the clouds gathered and hanging overhead would not the showers come
down upon the earth to temper droughts? But now3663 all things must go on in their own
courses, and not give up following the arrangement established by nature, even if there
should be no name of man heard in the world, and this earth should be still with the silence
of an unpeopled desert. How then is it alleged that it was necessary that an inhabitant should
be given to these regions, since it is clear that by man comes nothing to aid in perfecting
the world, and that all his exertions regard his private convenience always, and never cease
to aim at his own advantage?</p>

God in man, that He should have created him? In doing this, it seems not to have been observed that the question

<p>39. But perhaps, some one will urge, the Ruler of the world sent hither souls sprung from
Himself for this purpose—a very rash thing for a man to say3669—that they which had been
divine3670 with Him, not coming into contact with the body and earthly limits,3671 should
be buried in the germs of men, spring from the womb, burst into and keep up the silliest
wailings, draw the breasts in sucking, besmear and bedaub themselves with their own filth,
then be hushed by the swaying3672 of the frightened nurse and by the sound of rattles.3673
Did He send souls hither for this reason, that they which had been but now sincere and of
blameless virtue should learn as3674 men to feign, to dissemble, to lie, to cheat,3675 to deceive,
to entrap with a flatterer’s abjectness; to conceal one thing in the heart,3676 express another

of building houses for themselves at very great expense and with never-ending toils,
preparing coverings for their limbs, making different kinds of furniture for the wants3685
of daily life, borrowing help for3686 their weakness from the dumb creatures; using violence

should dig up lofty mountains, and turn the unknown bowels of the earth into materials,

His arrangement. These things are unworthy of3730 Him, and weaken the force of His
greatness; and so far from His being believed to be their author, whoever imagines that man
is sprung from Him is guilty of blasphemous impiety, man, a being miserable and wretched,
who is sorry that he exists, hates and laments his state, and understands that he was produced

begotten, and how have they been produced? If you wish to hear unvarnished statements
not spun out with vain ostentation of words, we, too,3733 admit that we are ignorant of this,
do not know it;3734 and we hold that, to know so great a matter, is not only beyond the reach
of our weakness and frailty, but beyond that also of all the powers which are in the world,
and which have usurped the place of deities in men’s belief. But are we bound to show whose
they are, because we deny that they are God’s? That by no means3735 follows necessarily;
for if we were to deny that flies, beetles, and bugs, dormice, weevils, and moths,3736 are
made by the Almighty King, we should not be required in consequence to say who made
and formed them; for without incurring any censure, we may not know who, indeed, gave
them being, and yet assert that not by the Supreme3737 Deity were creatures produced so

it does not necessarily follow that we are bound to declare from what parent they have
sprung, and by what causes they have been produced. For who prevents us from being either
ignorant of the source from which they issued and came, or aware that they are not God’s
descendants? By what method, you say, in what way? Because it is most true and certain3739
that, as has been pretty frequently said, nothing is effected, made, determined by the Supreme,
except that which it is right and fitting should be done; except that which is complete and
entire, and wholly perfect in its3740 integrity. But further, we see that men, that is, these very
souls—for what are men but souls bound to bodies?—themselves show by perversely falling
into3741 vice, times without number, that they belong to no patrician race, but have sprung
from insignificant families. For we see some harsh, vicious, presumptuous, rash, reckless,
blinded, false, dissemblers, liars, proud, overbearing, covetous, greedy, lustful, fickle, weak,
and unable to observe their own precepts; but they would assuredly not be so, if their original

and purest morals. We raise no question as to whether there ever were any such, in whom
this very integrity which is spoken of was in nothing imperfect. Even if they are very honourable
men, and have been worthy of praise, have reached the utmost height of perfection,
and their life has never wavered and sunk into sin, yet we would have you tell us how many
there are, or have been, that we may judge from their number whether a comparison3743

hundred, yet are they at least limited in number, and it may be within the reach of names.3745
But it is fitting that the human race should be rated and weighed, not by a very few good
men, but by all the rest as well. For the part is in the whole, not the whole in a part; and that
which is the whole should draw to it its parts, not the whole be brought to its parts. For what
if you were to say that a man, robbed of the use of all his limbs, and shrieking in bitter
agony,3746 was quite well, because in3747 one little nail he suffered no pain? or that the earth
is made of gold, because in one hillock there are a few small grains from which, when dissolved,
gold is produced, and wonder excited at it when formed into a lump?3748 The whole
mass shows the nature of an element, not particles fine as air; nor does the sea become
forthwith sweet, if you cast or throw into it a few drops of less bitter water, for that small
quantity is swallowed up in its immense mass; and it must be esteemed, not merely of little

them with the very wicked, we may be led3749 to believe that there are. Who are they, pray?
Tell us. The philosophers, I suppose, who3750 assert that they alone are most wise, and who
have been uplifted with pride from the meaning attached to this name,3751—those, forsooth,
who are striving with their passions every day, and struggling to drive out, to expel deeplyrooted
passions from their minds by the persistent3752 opposition of their better qualities;
who, that it may be impossible for them to be led into wickedness at the suggestion of some
opportunity, shun riches and inheritances, that they may remove3753 from themselves occasions
of stumbling; but in doing this, and being solicitous about it, they show very clearly
that their souls are, through their weakness, ready and prone to fall into vice. In our opinion,
however, that which is good naturally, does not require to be either corrected or reproved;3754
nay more, it should not know what evil is, if the nature of each kind would abide in its own
integrity, for neither can two contraries be implanted in each other, nor can equality be
contained in inequality, nor sweetness in bitterness. He, then, who struggles to amend the

<p>51. But you laugh at our reply, because, while we deny that souls are of royal descent,
we do not, on the other hand, say in turn from what causes and beginnings they have sprung.
But what kind of crime is it either to be ignorant of anything, or to confess quite openly that
you do not know that of which you are ignorant? or whether does he rather seem to you
most deserving of ridicule who assumes to himself no knowledge of some dark subject; or
he who thinks that he3756 knows most clearly that which transcends human knowledge,
and which has been involved in dark obscurity? If the nature of everything were thoroughly
considered, you too are in a position like that which you censure in our case. For you do
not say anything which has been ascertained and set most clearly in the light of truth, because
you say that souls descend from the Supreme Ruler Himself, and enter into the forms of
men. For you conjecture, do not perceive3757 this; surmise, do not actually know it; for if
to know is to retain in the mind that which you have yourself seen or known, not one of
those things which you affirm can you say that you have ever seen—that is, that souls descend
from the abodes and regions above. You are therefore making use of conjecture, not trusting
clear information. But what is conjecture, except a doubtful imagining of things, and directing
of the mind upon nothing accessible? He, then, who conjectures, does not comprehend,3758
nor does he walk in the3759 light of knowledge. But if this is true and certain in the opinion
of proper and very wise judges, your conjectures, too, in which you trust, must be regarded
as showing your ignorance.</p>

<p>52. And yet, lest you should suppose that none but yourselves can make use of conjectures
and surmises, we too are able to bring them forward as well,3760 as your question is appropriate
to either side.3761 Whence, you say, are men; and what or whence are the souls of
these men? Whence, we will ask, are elephants, bulls, stags, mules,3762 asses? Whence lions,
horses, dogs, wolves, panthers; and what or whence are the souls of these creatures? For it
is not credible that from that Platonic cup,3763 which Timæus prepares and mixes, either
their souls came, or that the locust,3764 mouse, shrew, cockroach, frog, centipede, should
be believed to have been quickened and to live, because3765 they have a cause and origin of
birth in3766 the elements themselves, if there are in these secret and very little known
means3767 for producing the creatures which live in each of them. For we see that some of
the wise say that the earth is mother of men, that others join with it water,3768 that others
add to these breath of air, but that some say that the sun is their framer, and that, having
been quickened by his rays, they are filled with the stir of life.3769 What if it is not these,
and is something else, another cause, another method, another power, in fine, unheard of
and unknown to us by name, which may have fashioned the human race, and connected it
with things as established;3770 may it not be that men sprang up in this way, and that the
cause of their birth does not go back to the Supreme God? For what reason do we suppose
that the great Plato had—a man reverent and scrupulous in his wisdom—when he withdrew
the fashioning of man from the highest God, and transferred it to some lesser deities, and

noticed in ch. 36 (cf. p. 447, n. 20). There the Creator assures the gods He has made of immortality through His
grace; now His further invitation that they in turn should form men is alluded to. That they might accomplish
this task, the dregs still left in the cup, in which had been mixed the elements of the world’s soul, are diluted and

and that they are gifted with immortality, if3773 they rest their hope of so great a gift on God
Supreme, who alone has power to grant such blessings, by putting away corruption. But this,
you say, we are stupid in believing. What is that to you? In so believing, we act most absurdly,
sillily. In what do we injure you, or what wrong do we do or inflict upon you, if we trust

consider carefully, and examine with no little pains, lest, while we think that we are honouring
God3776 by such a question, we fall into the opposite sin, doing despite to His supreme
majesty. In what way, you ask, on what ground? Because, if all things are brought about by
His will, and nothing in the world can either succeed or fail contrary to His pleasure, it follows
of necessity that it should be understood that3777 all evils, too, arise by His will. But if, on
the contrary, we chose to say that He is privy to and produces no evil, not referring to Him
the causes of very wicked deeds, the worst things will begin to seem to be done either against
His will, or, a monstrous thing to say, while He knows it not, but is ignorant and unaware
of them. But, again, if we choose to say that there are no evils, as we find some have believed
and held, all races will cry out against us and all nations together, showing us their sufferings,
and the various kinds of dangers with which the human race is every moment3778 distressed
and afflicted. Then they will ask of us, Why, if there are no evils, do you refrain from certain
deeds and actions? Why do you not do all that eager lust has required or demanded? Why,
finally, do you establish punishments by terrible laws for the guilty? For what more monstrous3779
act of folly can be found than to assert that there are no evils, and at the same
time to kill and condemn the erring as though they were evil?3780</p>

that all human affairs are full of them, they will next ask, Why, then, the Almighty God does
not take away these evils, but suffers them to exist and to go on without ceasing through all
the ages?3782 If we have learned of God the Supreme Ruler, and have resolved not to wander
in a maze of impious and mad conjectures, we must answer that we do not know these
things, and have never sought and striven to know things which could be grasped by no
powers which we have, and that we, even thinking it3783 preferable, rather remain in ignorance
and want of knowledge than say that without God nothing is made, so that it should
be understood that by His will3784 He is at once both the source of evil3785 and the occasion
of countless miseries. Whence then, you will say, are all these evils? From the elements, say
the wise, and from their dissimilarity; but how it is possible that things which have not
feeling and judgment should be held to be wicked or criminal; or that he should not rather
be wicked and criminal, who, to bring about some result, took what was afterwards to become
very bad and hurtful,3786—is for them to consider, who make the assertion. What, then, do
we say? whence? There is no necessity that we should answer, for whether we are able to
say whence evil springs, or our power fails us, and we are unable, in either case it is a small
matter in our opinion; nor do we hold it of much importance either to know or to be ignorant
of it, being content to have laid down but one thing,—that nothing proceeds from God Supreme
which is hurtful and pernicious. This we are assured of, this we know, on this one
truth of knowledge and science we take our stand,—that nothing is made by Him except
that which is for the well-being of all, which is agreeable, which is very full of love and joy
and gladness, which has unbounded and imperishable pleasures, which every one may ask

and do not consider that they have been connected and associated with that which we desire

destroy,3790 from love of contradiction, although that which they attempt to invalidate is
unobjectionable3791 and manifest, and evidently bears the stamp of truth? Or what, again,
can they not maintain with plausible arguments, although it may be very manifestly untrue,
although it may be a plain and evident falsehood? For when a man has persuaded himself
that there is or is not something, he likes to affirm what he thinks, and to show greater
subtlety than others, especially if the subject discussed is out of the ordinary track, and by
nature abstruse and obscure.3792 Some of the wise think that the world was not created, and
will never perish;3793 some that it is immortal, although they say that it was created and
made;3794 while a third party have chosen to say that it both was created and made, and will

world is composed of four elements, others of two,3796 a third party of one; some say that
it is composed of none of these, and that atoms are that from which it is formed,3797 and its
primary origin. And since of these opinions only one is true, but3798 not one of them certain,
here too, in like manner, arguments present themselves to all with which they may both
establish the truth of what they say, and show that there are some things false3799 in the
others’ opinions. So, too, some utterly deny the existence of the gods; others say that they
are lost in doubt as to whether they exist anywhere; others, however, say that they do exist,
but do not trouble themselves about human things; nay others maintain that they both take
part in the affairs of men, and guide the course of earthly events.3800</p>
<note type="footnote">3796 Orelli thinks that there is here a confusion of the parts of the world with its elements, because he can
nowhere find that any philosopher has fixed the number of the elements either above or below four. The Stoics,
however (Diog. Lært., vii. 134), said “that the elements (ἀρχάς of the world are two—the active and passive;”

<p>57. While, then, this is the case, and it cannot but be that only one of all these opinions
is true, they all nevertheless make use of arguments in striving with each other,—and not
one of them is without something plausible to say, whether in affirming his own views, or
objecting to the opinions of others. In exactly the same way is the condition of souls discussed.
For this one thinks that they both are immortal, and survive the end of our earthly life; that
one believes that they do not survive, but perish with the bodies themselves: the opinion of
another, however, is that they suffer nothing immediately, but that, after the form of man
has been laid aside, they are allowed to live a little longer,3801 and then come under the
power of death. And while all these opinions cannot be alike true, yet all who hold them so
support their case by strong and very weighty arguments, that you cannot find out anything
which seems false to you, although on every side you see that things are being said altogether
at variance with each other, and inconsistent from their opposition to each other;3802 which
assuredly would not happen, if man s curiosity could reach any certainty, or if that which
seemed to one to have been really discovered, was attested by the approval of all the others.
It is therefore wholly3803 vain, a useless task, to bring forward something as though you
knew it, or to wish to assert that you know that which, although it should be true, you see
can be refuted; or to receive that as true which it may be is not, and is brought forward as
if by men raving. And it is rightly so, for we do not weigh and guess at3804 divine things by
divine, but by human methods; and just as we think that anything should have been made,
so we assert that it must be.</p>

that water is held suspended in the regions above and in mid-air, although by nature it is
apt to glide away, and so ready to flow and run downwards. Explain, I say, and tell what it
is which sends the hail whirling through the air, which makes the rain fall drop by drop,
which has spread out rain and feathery flakes of snow and sheets of lightning;3812 whence
the wind rises, and what it is; why the changes of the seasons were established, when it might
have been ordained that there should be only one, and one kind of climate, so that there
should be nothing wanting to the world’s completeness. What is the cause, what the reason,
that the waters of the sea are salt;3813 or that, of those on land, some are sweet, others bitter

things, escapes you yourselves also, and that you can neither say nor explain what has been
made, nor why and wherefore it should not have been otherwise, do you assail and attack
our timidity, who confess that we do not know that which cannot be known, and who do
not care to seek out and inquire into those things which it is quite clear cannot be understood,
although human conjecture should extend and spread itself through a thousand hearts?
And therefore Christ the divine,—although you are unwilling to allow it,—Christ the divine,
I repeat, for this must be said often, that the ears of unbelievers may burst and be rent
asunder, speaking in the form of man by command of the Supreme God, because He knew
that men are naturally3817 blind, and cannot grasp the truth at all, or regard as sure and
certain what they might have persuaded themselves as to things set before their eyes, and
do not hesitate, for the sake of their3818 conjectures, to raise and bring up questions that
cause much strife,—bade us abandon and disregard all these things of which you speak, and
not waste our thoughts upon things which have been removed far from our knowledge, but,
as much as possible, seek the Lord of the universe with the whole mind and spirit; be raised
above these subjects, and give over to Him our hearts, as yet hesitating whither to turn;3819
be ever mindful of Him; and although no imagination can set Him forth as He is,3820 yet
form some faint conception of Him. For Christ said that, of all who are comprehended in
the vague notion of what is sacred and divine,3821 He alone is beyond the reach of doubt,
alone true, and one about whom only a raving and reckless madman can be in doubt; to
know whom is enough, although you have learned nothing besides; and if by knowledge
you have indeed been related to3822 God, the head of the world, you have gained the true

what is the origin of souls; who devised the causes of ills; whether the sun is larger than the
earth, or measures only a foot in breadth:3824 whether the moon shines with borrowed light,
or from her own brightness,—things which there is neither profit in knowing, nor loss in
not knowing? Leave these things to God, and allow Him to know what is, wherefore, or
whence; whether it must have been or not; whether something always existed,3825 or
whether it was produced at the first; whether it should be annihilated or preserved, consumed,
destroyed, or restored in fresh vigour. Your reason is not permitted to involve you in such
questions, and to be busied to no purpose about things so much out of reach. Your interests

that after death as men, they are restored without hindrance, as if to their father’s abode;

which some powers make the way easy to those who are striving to mount to heaven; nor
by that which Etruria holds out in the Acherontic books,3829 that souls become divine, and
are freed from the law3830 of death, if the blood of certain animals is offered to certain
deities. These are empty delusions, and excite vain desires. None but the Almighty God can
preserve souls; nor is there any one besides who can give them length of days, and grant to
them also a spirit which shall never die,3831 except He who alone is immortal and everlasting,
and restricted by no limit of time. For since all the gods, whether those who are real, or those
who are merely said to be from hearsay and conjecture, are immortal and everlasting by His
good-will and free gift, how can it be that others3832 are able to give that which they themselves
have,3833 while they have it as the gift of another, bestowed by a greater power? Let
Etruria sacrifice what victims it may, let the wise deny themselves all the pleasures of life,3834
let the Magi soften and soothe all lesser powers, yet, unless souls have received from the
Lord of all things that which reason demands, and does so by His command, it3835 will

all alike who invites all alike? or does He thrust back or repel any one from the kindness of
the Supreme who gives to all alike the power of coming to Him,—to men of high rank, to
the meanest slaves, to women, to boys? To all, He says, the fountain of life is open,3846 and
no one is hindered or kept back from drinking.3847 If you are so fastidious as to spurn the
kindly3848 offered gift, nay, more, if your wisdom is so great that you term those things
which are offered by Christ ridiculous and absurd, why should He keep on inviting3849 you,
while His only duty is to make the enjoyment of His bounty depend upon your own free
choice?3850 God, Plato says, does not cause any one to choose his lot in life;3851 nor can
another’s choice be rightly attributed to any one, since freedom of choice was put in His
power who made it. Must you be even implored to deign to accept the gift of salvation from
God; and must God’s gracious mercy be poured into your bosom while you reject it with
disdain, and flee very far from it? Do you choose to take what is offered, and turn it to your
own advantage? You will in that case have consulted your own interests. Do you reject with

<p>65. Nay, my opponent says, if God is powerful, merciful, willing to save us, let Him
change our dispositions, and compel us to trust in His promises. This, then, is violence, not
kindness nor the bounty of the Supreme God, but a childish and vain3854 strife in seeking
to get the mastery. For what is so unjust as to force men who are reluctant and unwilling,
to reverse their inclinations; to impress forcibly on their minds what they are unwilling to
receive, and shrink from; to injure before benefiting, and to bring to another way of thinking
and feeling, by taking away the former? You who wish yourself to be changed,3855 and to
suffer violence, that you may do and may be compelled to take to yourself that which you
do not wish, why do you refuse of your own accord to select that which you wish to do,
when changed and transformed? I am unwilling, He says, and have no wish. What, then,
do you blame God as though He failed you? do you wish Him to bring you help,3856 whose
gifts and bounties you not only reject and shun, but term empty3857 words, and assail with
jocose witticisms? Unless, then, my opponent says, I shall be a Christian, I cannot hope for
salvation. It is just as you yourself say. For, to bring salvation and impart to souls what
should be bestowed and must be added, Christ alone has had given into His charge and entrusted3858
to Him by God the Father, the remote and more secret causes being so disposed.
For, as with you, certain gods have fixed offices, privileges, powers, and you do not ask from
any of them what is not in his power and permitted to him, so it is the right of3859 Christ
alone to give salvation to souls, and assign them everlasting life. For if you believe that
father Bacchus can give a good vintage, but cannot give relief from sickness; if you believe

won over and charmed3863 those powers not to shut the ways against you and bar your
passage when returning to heaven, by no efforts will you be able to reach the prize of immortality,
unless by Christ’s gift you have perceived what constitutes this very immortality, and
have been allowed to enter on the true life. For as to that with which you have been in the
habit of taunting us, that our religion is new,3864 and arose a few days ago, almost, and that
you could not abandon the ancient faith which you had inherited from your fathers, and
pass over to barbarous and foreign rites, this is urged wholly without reason. For what if in
this way we chose to blame the preceding, even the most ancient ages, because when they
discovered how to raise crops,3865 they despised acorns, and rejected with scorn the wild
strawberry; because they ceased to be covered with the bark of trees and clad in the hides
of wild beasts, after that garments of cloth were devised, more useful and convenient in
wearing; or because, when houses were built, and more comfortable dwellings erected, they
did not cling to their ancient huts, and did not prefer to remain under rocks and caves like
the beasts of the field? It is a disposition possessed by all, and impressed on us almost from
our cradles even, to prefer good things to bad, useful to useless things, and to pursue and
seek that with more pleasure which has been generally regarded3866 as more than usually
precious, and to set on that our hopes for prosperity and favourable circumstances.</p>

you what we have left, but observe especially what we have followed. For if it is a fault or
crime to change an opinion, and pass from ancient customs to new conditions and desires,
this accusation holds against you too, who have so often changed your habits and mode of
life, who have gone over to other customs and ceremonies, so that you are condemned
by3868 past ages as well as we. Do you indeed have the people distributed into five3869 classes,
as your ancestors once had? Do you ever elect magistrates by vote of the people? Do you
know what military, urban, and common3870 comitia are? Do you watch the sky, or put an
end to public business because evil omens are announced? When you are preparing for
war,3871 do you hang out a flag from the citadel, or practise the forms of the Fetiales, solemnly3872
demanding the return of what has been carried off? or, when encountering the
dangers of war, do you begin to hope also, because of favourable omens from the points of
the spears?3873 In entering on office, do you still observe the laws fixing the proper times?
with regard to gifts and presents to advocates, do you observe the Cincian and the sumptuary
laws in restricting your expenses? Do you maintain fires, ever burning, in gloomy sanctuaries?
3874 Do you consecrate tables by putting on them salt-cellars and images of the gods?
When you marry, do you spread the couch with a toga, and invoke the genii of husbands?
do you arrange the hair of brides with the hasta cælibaris? do you bear the maidens’ garments
to the temple of Fortuna Virginalis? Do your matrons work in the halls of your houses,
showing their industry openly do they refrain from drinking wine? are their friends and
relations allowed to kiss them, in order to show that they are sober and temperate?</p>

by decree of the senate, that reddish ones may be offered? While during the reigns of Romulus
and Pompilius the inner parts, having been quite thoroughly cooked and softened, were
burnt up in sacrificing to the gods, did you not begin, under king Tullius,3875 to hold them
out half-raw and slightly warm, paying no regard to the former usage? While before the arrival

the other arts by which social life has been built up and refined,—were these born with men,
and did they not rather begin to be pursued, understood, and practised lately, nay, rather,
but a short time since? Before the Etruscan Tages saw the3878 light, did any one know or
trouble himself to know and learn what meaning there was in the fall of thunderbolts, or in
the veins of the victims sacrificed?3879 When did the motion of the stars or the art of calculating

<p>70. But why do I speak of these trivial things? The immortal gods themselves, whose
temples you now enter with reverence, whose deity you suppliantly adore, did they not at
certain times, as is handed down by your writings and traditions, begin to be, to be known
and to be invoked by names and titles which were given to them? For if it is true that Jupiter
with his brothers was born of Saturn and his wife, before Ops was married and bore children
Jupiter had not existed both the Supreme and the Stygian,3881 no, nor the lord of the sea,
nor Juno, nay more, no one inhabited the heavenly seats except the two parents; but from
their union the other gods were conceived and born, and breathed the breath of life. So, then,
at a certain time the god Jupiter began to be, at a certain time to merit worship and sacrifices,
at a certain time to be set above his brothers in power.3882 But, again, if Liber, Venus, Diana,
Mercury, Apollo, Hercules, the Muses, the Tyndarian brothers,3883 and Vulcan the lord of
fire, were begotten by father Jupiter, and born of a parent sprung from Saturn, before that
Memory, Alcmena, Maia, Juno, Latona, Leda, Dione, and Semele also bore children to Dies
piter; these deities, too, were nowhere in the world, nor in any part of the universe, but by
Jupiter’s embraces they were begotten and born, and began to have some sense of their own
existence. So then, these, too, began to be at a certain time, and to be summoned among the
gods to the sacred rites. This we say, in like manner, of Minerva. For if, as you assert, she
burst forth from Jupiter’s head ungenerated,3884 before Jupiter was begotten, and received
in his mother’s womb the shape and outline of his body,3885 it is quite certain that Minerva
did not exist, and was not reckoned among things or as existing at all; but from Jove’s head
she was born, and began to have a real existence. She therefore has an origin at the first, and
began to be called a goddess at a certain time, to be set up in temples, and to be consecrated
by the inviolable obligations of religion. Now as this is the case, when you talk of the novelty
of our religion, does your own not come into your thoughts, and do you not take care to
examine when your gods sprung up,—what origins, what causes they have, or from what
stocks they have burst forth and sprung? But how shameful, how shameless it is to censure
that in another which you see that you do yourself,—to take occasion to revile and accuse
others for things which can be retorted upon you in turn!</p>

<p>71. But our rites are3886 new; yours are ancient, and of excessive antiquity, we are told.
And what help does that give you, or how does it damage our cause and argument? The
belief3887 which we hold is new; some day even it, too, will become old: yours is old; but
when it arose, it was new and unheard of. The credibility of a religion, however, must not
be determined by its age, but by its divinity; and you should consider not when, but what
you began to worship. Four hundred years ago, my opponent says, your religion did not
exist. And two thousand years ago, I reply, your gods did not exist. By what reckoning, you
ask, or by what calculations, can that be inferred? They are not difficult, not intricate, but
can be seen by any one who will take them in hand even, as the saying is. Who begot Jupiter
and his brothers? Saturn with Ops, as you relate, sprung from Coelus and Hecate. Who begot
Picus, the father of Faunus and grandfather of Latinus? Saturn, as you again hand down by
your books and teachers? Therefore, if this is the case, Picus and Jupiter are in consequence
united by the bond of kinship, inasmuch as they are sprung from one stock and race. It is
clear, then, that what we say is true. How many steps are there in coming down3888 from
Jupiter and Picus to Latinus? Three, as the line of succession shows. Will you suppose
Faunus, Latinus, and Picus to have each lived a hundred and twenty years, for beyond this
it is that man’s life cannot be prolonged? The estimation is well grounded and clear. There
are, then, three hundred and sixty years after these?3889 It is just as the calculation shows.
Whose father-in-law was Latinus? Æneas’. Whose father was he?3890 He was father of the
founder of the town Alba. How many years did kings reign in Alba? Four hundred and
twenty almost. Of what age is the city Rome shown to be in the annals? It reckons ten3891
hundred and fifty years, or not much less. So, then, from Jupiter, who is the brother of Picus
and father of the other and lesser gods, down to the present time, there are nearly, or to add
a little to the time, altogether, two thousand years. Now since this cannot be contradicted,
not only is the religion to which you adhere shown to have sprung up lately; but it is also
shown that the gods themselves, to whom you heap up bulls and other victims at the risk of

it has been supported by the authority of antiquity. And of what avail is it that it should
precede ours as many years as you please, since it began at a certain time? or what3893 are
two thousand years, compared with so many thousands of ages? And yet, lest we should
seem to betray our cause by so long neglect, say, if it does not annoy you, does the Almighty
and Supreme God seem to you to be something new; and do those who adore and worship
Him seem to you to support and introduce an unheard-of, unknown, and upstart religion?
Is there anything older than Him? or can anything be found preceding Him in being,3894
time, name? Is not He alone uncreated, immortal, and everlasting? Who is the head3895 and
fountain of things? is not He? To whom does eternity owe its name? is it not to Him? Is it
not because He is everlasting, that the ages go on without end? This is beyond doubt, and
true: the religion which we follow is not new, then, but we have been late in learning what
we should follow and revere, or where we should both fix our hope of salvation, and employ
the aid given to save us. For He had not yet shone forth who was to point out the way to

<p>73. But are we alone in this position?3896 What! have you not introduced into the
number of your gods the Egyptian deities named Serapis and Isis, since the consulship of
Piso and Gabinius?3897 What! did you not begin both to know and be acquainted with, and
to worship with remarkable honours, the Phrygian mother—who, it is said, was first set up
as a goddess by Midas or Dardanus—when Hannibal, the Carthaginian, was plundering
Italy and aiming at the empire of the world?3898 Are not the sacred rites of mother Ceres,
which were adopted but a little while ago, called Græca because they were unknown to you,
their name bearing witness to their novelty? Is it not said3899 in the writings of the learned,
that the rituals of Numa Pompilius do not contain the name of Apollo? Now it is clear and
manifest from this, that he, too, was unknown to you, but that at some time afterwards he
began to be known also. If any one, therefore, should ask you why you have so lately begun
to worship those deities whom we mentioned just now, it is certain that you will reply, either
because we were till lately not aware that they were gods, or because we have now been
warned by the seers, or because, in very trying circumstances, we have been preserved by
their favour and help. But if you think that this is well said by you, you must consider that,
on our part, a similar reply has been made. Our religion has sprung up just now; for now
He has arrived who was sent to declare it to us, to bring us to its truth; to show what God
is; to summon us from mere conjectures, to His worship.</p>

<p>74. And why, my opponent says, did God, the Ruler and Lord of the universe, determine
that a Saviour, Christ, should be sent to you from the heights of heaven a few hours ago, as
it is said? We ask you too, on the other hand, what cause, what reason is there that the seasons
sometimes do not recur at their own months, but that winter, summer, and autumn come
too late? why, after the crops have been dried up and the corn3900 has perished, showers
sometimes fall which should have dropped on them while yet uninjured, and made provision
for the wants of the time? Nay, this we rather ask, why, if it were fitting that Hercules should
be born, Æsculapius, Mercury, Liber, and some others, that they might be both added to
the assemblies of the gods, and might do men some service,—why they were produced so
late by Jupiter, that only later ages should know them, while the past ages3901 of those who
went before knew them not? You will say that there was some reason. There was then some
reason here also that the Saviour of our race came not lately, but to-day. What, then, you
ask, is the reason? We do not deny that we do not know. For it is not within the power of
any one to see the mind of God, or the way in which He has arranged His plans.3902 Man,
a blind creature, and not knowing himself even, can3903 in no way learn what should happen,
when, or what its nature is: the Father Himself, the Governor and Lord of all, alone knows.
Nor, if I have been unable to disclose to you the causes why something is done in this way
or that, does it straightway follow, that what has been done becomes not done, and that a
thing becomes incredible, which has been shown to be beyond doubt by such3904 virtues

<p>75. You may object and rejoin, Why was the Saviour sent forth so late? In unbounded,
eternal ages, we reply, nothing whatever should be spoken of as late. For where there is no
end and no beginning, nothing is too soon,3906 nothing too late. For time is perceived from
its beginnings and endings, which an unbroken line and endless3907 succession of ages
cannot have. For what if the things themselves to which it was necessary to bring help, required
that as a fitting time? For what if the condition of antiquity was different from that
of later times? What if it was necessary to give help to the men of old in one way, to provide
for their descendants in another? Do ye not hear your own writings read, telling that there
were once men who were demi-gods, heroes with immense and huge bodies? Do you not
read that infants on their mothers’ breasts shrieked like Stentors,3908 whose bones, when
dug up in different parts of the earth, have made the discoverers almost doubt that they
were the remains of human limbs? So, then, it may be that Almighty God, the only God,
sent forth Christ then indeed, after that the human race, becoming feebler, weaker, began
to be such as we are. If that which has been done now could have been done thousands of
years ago, the Supreme Ruler would have done it; or if it had been proper, that what has
been done now should be accomplished as many thousands after this, nothing compelled
God to anticipate the necessary lapse3909 of time. His plans3910 are executed in fixed ways;

your safety and salvation, why does He suffer you to be exposed to such storms of persecution,
and to undergo all kinds of punishments and tortures? Let us, too, ask in reply, why, seeing
that you worship so great and so innumerable gods, and build temples to them, fashion

pestilences, barrenness, loss of children, and confiscation of goods, discords, wars, enmities,
captures of cities, and the slavery of those who are robbed of their rights of free birth?3913
But, my opponent says, in such mischances we, too, are in no wise helped by God. The cause
is plain and manifest. For no hope has been held out to us with respect to this life, nor has
any help been promised or3914 aid decreed us for what belongs to the husk of this flesh,—nay,
more, we have been taught to esteem and value lightly all the threats of fortune, whatever
they be; and if ever any very grievous calamity has assailed us, to count as pleasant in that

not persecution, and our ill-treatment will not bring evil upon us, but will lead us to the
light of liberty. As if some senseless and stupid fellow were to think that he never punished
a man who had been put into prison3917 with severity and cruelty, unless he were to rage
against the very prison, break its stones in pieces, and burn its roof, its wall, its doors; and
strip, overthrow, and dash to the ground its other parts, not knowing that thus he was giving
light to him whom he seemed to be injuring, and was taking from him the accursed darkness:
in like manner, you too, by the flames, banishments, tortures, and monsters with which you
tear in pieces and rend asunder our bodies, do not rob us of life, but relieve us of our skins,
not knowing that, as far as you assault and seek to rage against these our shadows and forms,

nor should you, if anything is otherwise than you think, trust your own opinions rather
than that which should be reverenced.3918 The times, full of dangers, urge us, and fatal
penalties threaten us; let us flee for safety to God our Saviour, without demanding the
reason of the offered gift. When that at stake is our souls’ salvation and our own interests,
something must be done even without reason, as Arrhianus approves of Epictetus having
said.3919 We doubt, we hesitate, and suspect the credibility of what is said; let us commit
ourselves to God, and let not our incredulity prevail more with us than the greatness of His
name and power, lest, while we are seeking out arguments for ourselves, through which that

answered with sufficient fulness and accuracy by men of distinction in this respect, and
worthy to have learned the truth; and not one point of any inquiry has been passed over,
without being determined in a thousand ways, and on the strongest grounds. We need not,
therefore, linger further on this part of the case. For neither is the Christian religion unable
to stand though it found no advocates, nor will it be therefore proved true if it found many
to agree with it, and gained weight through its adherents.3920 Its own strength is sufficient
for it, and it rests on the foundations of its own truth, without losing its power, though there

that our defence may not, through its being too long broken off, be said to have given our
detractors cause to triumph in the establishing of their charge. For they propose these
questions: If you are in earnest about religion, why do you not serve and worship the other
gods with us, or share your sacred rites with your fellows, and put the ceremonies of the
different religions on an equality? We may say for the present: In essaying to approach the
divine, the Supreme Deity3922 suffices us,—the Deity, I say, who is supreme, the Creator
and Lord of the universe, who orders and rules all things: in Him we serve all that requires
our service; in Him we worship all that should be adored,—venerate3923 that which demands
the homage of our reverence. For as we lay hold of the source of the divine itself from which
the very divinity of all gods whatever is derived,3924 we think it an idle task to approach
each personally, since we neither know who they are, nor the names by which they are called;
and are further unable to learn, and discover, and establish their number.</p>

to those who form the royal family as well as to the sovereigns, but whatever honour
belongs to them is found to be tacitly3925 implied in the homage offered to the kings themselves;
in just the same way, these gods, whoever they be, for whose existence you vouch, if
they are a royal race, and spring from the Supreme Ruler, even though we do not expressly
do them reverence, yet feel that they are honoured in common with their Lord, and share
in the reverence shown to Him. Now it must be remembered that we have made this statement,
on the hypothesis only that it is clear and undeniable, that besides the Ruler and Lord
Himself, there are still other beings,3926 who, when arranged and disposed in order, form,
as it were, a kind of plebeian mass. But do not seek to point out to us pictures instead of
gods in your temples, and the images which you set up, for you too know, but are unwilling
and refuse to admit, that these are formed of most worthless clay, and are childish figures
made by mechanics. And when we converse with you on religion, we ask you to prove this,
that there are other gods than the one Supreme Deity in nature, power, name, not as we see
them manifested in images, but in such a substance as it might fittingly be supposed that

assail the doubtful and uncertain positions you hold. This, however, we demand, and ask
you to tell us, whence you have discovered, or how you have learned, whether there are
these gods,3927 whom you believe to be in heaven and serve, or some others unknown by
reputation and name? For it may be that beings exist whom you do not believe to do so;
and that those of whose existence you feel assured, are found nowhere in the universe. For
you have at no time been borne aloft to the stars of heaven, at no time have seen the face
and countenance of each; and then established here the worship of the same gods, whom
you remembered to be there, as having been known and seen by you. But this, too, we again
would learn from you, whether they have received these names by which you call them, or
assumed them themselves on the days of purification.3928 If these are divine and celestial
names, who reported them to you? But if, on the other hand, these names have been applied
to them by you, how could you give names to those whom you never saw, and whose character
or circumstances you in no wise3929 knew?</p>

the list of gods under these names?3932 have any ever become familiar and known to others
with whose names you were not acquainted?3933 For it cannot be easily known whether
their numerous body is settled and fixed in number; or whether their multitude cannot be
summed up and limited by the numbers of any computation. For let us suppose that you
do reverence to a thousand, or rather five thousand gods; but in the universe it may perhaps
be that there are a hundred thousand; there may be even more than this,—nay, as we said
a little before, it may not be possible to compute the number of the gods, or limit them by
a definite number. Either, then, you are yourselves impious who serve a few gods, but disregard
the duties which you owe to the rest;3934 or if you claim that your ignorance of the

<p>6. And yet let no one think that we are perversely determined not to submit to3936 the
other deities, whoever they are! For we lift up pious minds, and stretch forth our hands in
prayer,3937 and do not refuse to draw near whithersoever you may have summoned us; if
only we learn who those divine beings are whom you press upon us, and with whom it may
be right to share the reverence which we show to the king and prince who is over all. It is
Saturn, my opponent says, and Janus, Minerva, Juno, Apollo, Venus, Triptolemus, Hercules,
Æsculapius, and all the others, to whom the reverence of antiquity dedicated magnificent
temples in almost every city. You might, perhaps, have been able to attract us to the worship
of these deities you mention, had you not been yourselves the first, with foul and unseemly
fancies, to devise such tales about them as not merely to stain their honour, but, by the
natures assigned to them, to prove that they did not exist at all. For, in the first place, we
cannot be led to believe this,—that that immortal and supreme nature has been divided by
sexes, and that there are some male, others female. But this point, indeed, has been long ago
fully treated of by men of ardent genius, both in Latin and Greek; and Tullius, the most
eloquent among the Romans, without dreading the vexatiousness of a charge of impiety,
has above all, with greater piety,3938 declared—boldly, firmly, and frankly—what he thought
of such a fancy; and if you would proceed to receive from him opinions written with true

we believed God whom we worship to be male,—for this reason, that is, that when we speak
of Him we use a masculine word,—let him understand that it is not sex which is expressed,
but His name, and its meaning according to custom, and the way in which we are in the
habit of using words.3944 For the Deity is not male, but His name is of the masculine gender:
but in your ceremonies you cannot say the same; for in your prayers you have been wont
to say whether thou art god or goddess,3945 and this uncertain description shows, even by
their opposition, that you attribute sex to the gods. We cannot, then, be prevailed on to believe
that the divine is embodied; for bodies must needs be distinguished by difference of sex, if
they are male and female. For who, however mean his capacity,3946 does not know that the
sexes of different gender have been ordained and formed by the Creator of the creatures of
earth, only that, by intercourse and union of bodies, that which is fleeting and transient may
endure being ever renewed and maintained?3947</p>

they have received organs of generation, that they might be able to raise up offspring, and
that, as each new race springs up, a substitution, regularly occurring,3949 should make up
for all which had been swept away by the preceding age? If, then, it is so,—that is, if the gods
above beget other gods, and are subject to these conditions of sex,3950 and are immortal,
and are not worn out, by the chills of age,—it follows, as a consequence, that the world3951
should be full of gods, and that countless heavens could not contain their multitude, inasmuch
as they are both themselves ever begetting, and the countless multitude of their descendants,
always being increased, is augmented by means of their offspring; or if, as is fitting, the gods
are not degraded by being subjected to sexual impulses,3952 what cause or reason will be
pointed out for their being distinguished by those members by which the sexes are wont to
recognise each other at the suggestion of their own desires? For it is not likely that they have
these members without a purpose, or that nature had wished in them to make sport of its
own improvidence,3953 in providing them with members for which there would be no use.
For as the hands, feet, eyes, and other members which form our body,3954 have been arranged
for certain uses, each for its own end, so we may well3955 believe that these members have
been provided to discharge their office; or it must be confessed that there is something

<p>10. What say you, ye holy and pure guardians of religion? Have the gods, then, sexes;
and are they disfigured by those parts, the very mention of whose names by modest lips is
disgraceful? What, then, now remains, but to believe that they, as unclean beasts, are transported
with violent passions, rush with maddened desires into mutual embraces, and at last,
with shattered and ruined bodies, are enfeebled by their sensuality? And since some things
are peculiar to the female sex, we must believe that the goddesses, too, submit to these conditions
at the proper time, conceive and become pregnant with loathing, miscarry, carry
the full time, and sometimes are prematurely delivered. O divinity, pure, holy, free from
and unstained by any dishonourable blot! The mind longs3956 and burns to see, in the great
halls and palaces of heaven, gods and goddesses, with bodies uncovered and bare, the fullbreasted
Ceres nursing Iacchus,3957 as the muse of Lucretius sings, the Hellespontian Priapus
bearing about among the goddesses, virgin and matron, those parts3958 ever prepared for
encounter. It longs, I say, to see goddesses pregnant, goddesses with child, and, as they daily
increase in size, faltering in their steps, through the irksomeness of the burden they bear
about with them; others, after long delay, bringing to birth, and seeking the midwife’s aid;
others, shrieking as they are attacked by keen pangs and grievous pains, tormented,3959 and,
under all these influences, imploring the aid of Juno Lucina. Is it not much better to abuse,
revile, and otherwise insult the gods, than, with pious pretence, unworthily to entertain such
monstrous beliefs about them?</p>

found that the ground of offence is most clearly in yourselves, and that it is not occasioned
by the insult which you think3960 we offer them. For if the gods are, as you say, moved by
anger, and burn with rage in their minds, why should we not suppose that they take it amiss,
even in the highest degree, that you attribute to them sexes, as dogs and swine have been
created, and that, since this is your belief, they are so represented, and openly exposed in a
disgraceful manner? This, then, being the case, you are the cause of all troubles—you lead
the gods, you rouse them to harass the earth with every ill, and every day to devise all kinds
of fresh misfortunes, that so they may avenge themselves, being irritated at suffering so
many wrongs and insults from you. By your insults and affronts, I say, partly in the vile
stories, partly in the shameful beliefs which your theologians, your poets, you yourselves
too, celebrate in disgraceful ceremonies, you will find that the affairs of men have been
ruined, and that the gods have thrown away the helm, if indeed it is by their care that the
fortunes of men are guided and arranged. For with us, indeed, they have no reason to be
angry, whom they see and perceive neither to mock, as it is said, nor worship them, and to

<p>12. Thus far of sex. Now let us come to the appearance and shapes by which you believe
that the gods above have been represented, with which, indeed, you fashion, and set them
up in their most splendid abodes, your temples. And let no one here bring up against us
Jewish fables and those of the sect of the Sadducees,3962 as though we, too, attribute to the
Deity forms;3963 for this is supposed to be taught in their writings, and asserted as if with
assurance and authority. For these stories either do not concern us, and have nothing at all
in common with us, or if they are shared in by us, as you believe, you must seek out teachers
of greater wisdom, through whom you may be able to learn how best to overcome the dark
and recondite sayings of those writings. Our opinion on the subject is as follows:—that the
whole divine nature, since it neither came into existence at any time, nor will ever come to
an end of life, is devoid of bodily features, and does not have anything like the forms with
which the termination of the several members usually. completes the union of parts.3964
For whatever is of this character, we think mortal and perishable; nor do we believe that
that can endure for ever which an inevitable end shuts in, though the boundaries enclosing
it be the remotest.</p>
<note type="footnote">3962 It is evident that Arnobius here confuses the sceptical Sadducees with their opponents the Pharisees,
and the Talmudists.</note>
<note type="footnote">3963 The ms. reads tribuant et nos unintelligibly, for which LB. and Hild. read et os—“as though they attribute

<p>13. But it is not enough that you limit the gods by forms:—you even confine them to
the human figure, and with even less decency enclose them in earthly bodies. What shall
we say then? that the gods have a head modelled with perfect symmetry,3965 bound fast by
sinews to the back and breast, and that, to allow the necessary bending of the neck, it is
supported by combinations of vertebræ, and by an osseous foundation? But if we believe
this to be true, it follows that they have ears also, pierced by crooked windings; rolling eyeballs,
overshadowed by the edges of the eyebrows; a nose, placed as a channel,3966 through
which waste fluids and a current of air might easily pass; teeth to masticate food, of three
kinds, and adapted to three services; hands to do their work, moving easily by means of
joints, fingers, and flexible elbows; feet to support their bodies, regulate their steps, and
prompt the first motions in walking. But if the gods bear these things which are seen, it is
fitting that they should bear those also which the skin conceals under the framework of the
ribs, and the membranes enclosing the viscera; windpipes, stomachs, spleens, lungs, bladders,
livers, the long-entwined intestines, and the veins of purple blood, joined with the air-passages,
3967 coursing through the whole viscera.</p>

the food of men, are we to believe that, like children, they are toothless, and, having no internal
parts, as if they were inflated bladders, are without strength, owing to the hollowness
of their swollen bodies? Further, if this is the case, you must see whether the gods are all
alike, or are marked by a difference in the contour of their forms. For if each and all have
one and the same likeness of shape, there is nothing ridiculous in believing that they err,
and are deceived in recognising each other.3968 But if, on the other hand, they are distinguished
by their countenances, we should, consequently, understand that these differences
have been implanted for no other reason than that they might individually be able to recognise
themselves by the peculiarites of the different marks. We should therefore say that some
have big heads, prominent brows, broad brows, thick lips; that others of them have long
chins, moles, and high noses; that these have dilated nostrils, those are snub-nosed; some
chubby from a swelling of their jaws or growth of their cheeks, dwarfed, tall, of middle size,
lean, sleek, fat; some with crisped and curled hair, others shaven, with bald and smooth
heads. Now your workshops show and point out that our opinions are not false, inasmuch
as, when you form and fashion gods, you represent some with long hair, others smooth and
bare, as old, as youths, as boys, swarthy, grey-eyed, yellow, half-naked, bare; or, that cold
may not annoy them, covered with flowing garments thrown over them.</p>

<p>15. Does any man at all possessed of judgment, believe that hairs and down grow on
the bodies of the gods? that among them age is distinguished? and that they go about clad
in dresses and garments of various shapes, and shield themselves from heat and cold? But
if any one believes that, he must receive this also as true, that some gods are fullers, some
barbers; the former to cleanse the sacred garments, the latter to thin their locks when matted
with a thick growth of hair. Is not this really degrading, most impious, and insulting, to attribute
to the gods the features of a frail and perishing animal? to furnish them with those
members which no modest person would dare to recount, and describe, or represent in his
own imagination, without shuddering at the excessive indecency? Is this the contempt you
entertain,—this the proud wisdom with which you spurn us as ignorant, and think that all
knowledge of religion is yours? You mock the mysteries of the Egyptians, because they ingrafted
the forms of dumb animals upon their divine causes, and because they worship these
very images with much incense, and whatever else is used in such rites: you yourselves adore
images of men, as though they were powerful gods, and are not ashamed to give to these
the countenance of an earthly creature, to blame others for their mistaken folly, and to be
detected in a similarly vicious error.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<pb n="1114"/>
<p>16. But you will, perhaps, say that the gods have indeed other forms, and that you have
given the appearance of men to them merely by way of honour, and for form’s sake3969
which is much more insulting than to have fallen into any error through ignorance. For if
you confessed that you had ascribed to the divine forms that which you had supposed and
believed, your error, originating in prejudice, would not be so blameable. But now, when
you believe one thing and fashion another, you both dishonour those to whom you ascribe
that which you confess does not belong to them, and show your impiety in adoring that
which you fashion, not that which you think really is, and which is in very truth. If asses,
dogs, pigs,3970 had any human wisdom and skill in contrivance, and wished to do us honour
also by some kind of worship, and to show respect by dedicating statues to us, with what
rage would they inflame us, what a tempest of passion would they excite, if they determined
that our images should bear and assume the fashion of their own bodies? How would they,
I repeat, fill us with rage, and rouse our passions, if the founder of Rome, Romulus, were to
be set up with an ass’s face, the revered Pompilius with that of a dog, if under the image of
a pig were written Cato’s or Marcus Cicero’s name? So, then, do you think that your stupidity
is not laughed at by your deities, if they laugh at all? or, since you believe that they may be
enraged, do you think that they are not roused, maddened to fury, and that they do not wish
to be revenged for so great wrongs and insults, and to hurl on you the punishments usually
dictated by chagrin, and devised by bitter hatred? How much better it had been to give to
them the forms of elephants, panthers, or tigers, bulls, and horses! For what is there beautiful
in man,—what, I pray you, worthy of admiration, or comely,—unless that which, some
poet3971 has maintained, he possesses in common with the ape?</p>

<p>17. But, they say, if you are not satisfied with our opinion, do you point out, tell us
yourselves, what is the Deity’s form. If you wish to hear the truth, either the Deity has no
form; or if He is embodied in one, we indeed know not what it is. Moreover, we think it no
disgrace to be ignorant of that which we never saw; nor are we therefore prevented from
disproving the opinions of others, because on this we have no opinion of our own to bring
forward. For as, if the earth be said to be of glass, silver, iron, or gathered together and made
from brittle clay, we cannot hesitate to maintain that this is untrue, although we do not
know of what it is made; so, when the form of God is discussed, we show that it is not what
you maintain, even if we are still less able to explain what it is.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">

<p>18. What, then, some one will say, does the Deity not hear? does He not speak? does He
not see what is put before Him? has He not sight? He may in His own, but not in our way.
But in so great a matter we cannot know the truth at all, or reach it by speculations; for these
are, it is clear, in our case, baseless, deceitful, and like vain dreams. For if we said that He
sees in the same way as ourselves, it follows that it should be understood that He has eyelids
placed as coverings on the pupils of the eyes, that He closes them, winks, sees by rays or
images, or, as is the case in all eyes, can see nothing at all without the presence of other light.
So we must in like manner say of hearing, and form of speech, and utterance of words. If
He hears by means of ears, these, too, we must say, He has, penetrated by winding paths,
through which the sound may steal, bearing the meaning of the discourse; or if His words
are poured forth from a mouth, that He has lips and teeth, by the contact and various
movement of which His tongue utters sounds distinctly.</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">

<p>19. If you are willing to hear our conclusions, then learn that we are so far from attributing
bodily shape to the Deity, that we fear to ascribe to so great a being even mental graces,
and the very excellences by which a few have been allowed with difficulty to distinguish
themselves. For who will say that God is brave, firm, good, wise? who will say that He has
integrity, is temperate, even that He has knowledge, understanding, forethought? that He
directs towards fixed moral ends the actions on which He determines? These things are
good in man; and being opposed to vices, have deserved the great reputation which they
have gained. But who is so foolish, so senseless, as to say that God is great by merely human
excellences? or that He is above all in the greatness of His name, because He is not disgraced
by vice? Whatever you say, whatever in unspoken thought you imagine concerning God,
passes and is corrupted into a human sense, and does not carry its own meaning, because
it is spoken in the words which we use, and which are suited only to human affairs. There
is but one thing man can be assured of regarding God’s nature, to know and perceive that
nothing can be revealed in human language concerning God.</p>

<p>20. This, then, this matter of forms and sexes, is the first affront which you, noble advocates
in sooth, and pious writers, offer to your deities. But what is the next, that you represent
to us3972 the gods, some as artificers, some physicians, others working in wool, as sailors,3973
players on the harp and flute, hunters, shepherds, and, as there was nothing more, rustics?
And that god, he says, is a musician, and this other can divine; for the other gods cannot,3974
and do not know how to foretell what will come to pass, owing to their want of skill and
ignorance of the future. One is instructed in obstetric arts, another trained up in the science
of medicine. Is each, then, powerful in his own department; and can they give no assistance,
if their aid is asked, in what belongs to another? This one is eloquent in speech, and ready
in linking words together; for the others are stupid, and can say nothing skilfully, if they
must speak.</p>

<p>21. And, I ask, what reason is there, what unavoidable necessity, what occasion for the
gods knowing and being acquainted with these handicrafts as though they were worthless
mechanics? For, are songs sung and music played in heaven, that the nine sisters may
gracefully combine and harmonize pauses and rhythms of tones? Are there on the mountains3975
of the stars, forests, woods, groves, that3976 Diana may be esteemed very mighty
in hunting expeditions? Are the gods ignorant of the immediate future; and do they live
and pass the time according to the lots assigned them by fate, that the inspired son of Latona
may explain and declare what the morrow or the next hour bears to each? Is he himself inspired
by another god, and is he urged and roused by the power of a greater divinity, so that
he may be rightly said and esteemed to be divinely inspired? Are the gods liable to be seized
by diseases; and is there anything by which they may be wounded and hurt, so that, when
there is occasion, he3977 of Epidaurus may come to their assistance? Do they labour, do they
bring forth, that Juno may soothe, and Lucina abridge the terrible pangs of childbirth? Do
they engage in agriculture, or are they concerned with the duties of war, that Vulcan, the
lord of fire, may form for them swords, or forge their rustic implements? Do they need to
be covered with garments, that the Tritonian3978 maid may, with nice skill,3979 spin, weave
cloth for them, and make3980 them tunics to suit the season, either triple-twilled, or of silken
fabric? Do they make accusations and refute them, that the descendant3981 of Atlas may

<p>22. You err, my opponent says, and are deceived; for the gods are not themselves artificers,
but suggest these arts to ingenious men, and teach mortals what they should know, that
their mode of life may be more civilized. But he who gives any instruction to the ignorant
and unwilling, and strives to make him intelligently expert in some kind of work, must
himself first know that which he sets the other to practise. For no one can be capable of
teaching a science without knowing the rules of that which he teaches, and having grasped
its method most thoroughly. The gods are, then, the first artificers; whether because they
inform the minds of men with knowledge, as you say yourselves, or because, being immortal
and unbegotten, they surpass the whole race of earth by their length of life.3982 This, then,
is the question; there being no occasion for these arts among the gods, neither their necessities
nor nature requiring in them any ingenuity or mechanical skill, why you should say
that they are skilled,3983 one in one craft, another in another, and that individuals are preeminently
expert3984 in particular departments in which they are distinguished by acquaintance
with the several branches of science?</p>

<p>23. But you will, perhaps, say that the gods are not artificers, but that they preside over
these arts, and have their oversight; nay, that under their care all things have been placed,
which we manage and conduct, and that their providence sees to the happy and fortunate
issue of these. Now this would certainly appear to be said justly, and with some probability,
if all we engage in, all we do, or all we attempt in human affairs, sped as we wished and
purposed. But since every day the reverse is the case, and the results of actions do not correspond
to the purpose of the will, it is trifling to say that we have, set as guardians over us,
gods invented by our superstitious fancy, not grasped with assured certainty. Portunus3985
gives to the sailor perfect safety in traversing the seas; but why has the raging sea cast up so
many cruelly-shattered wrecks? Consus suggests to our minds courses safe and serviceable;
and why does an unexpected change perpetually issue in results other than were looked for?
Pales and Inuus3986 are set as guardians over the flocks and herds; why do they, with hurtful
laziness,3987 not take care to avert from the herds in their summer pastures, cruel, infectious,
and destructive diseases? The harlot Flora,3988 venerated in lewd sports, sees well to it that
the fields blossom; and why are buds and tender plants daily nipt and destroyed by most
hurtful frost? Juno presides over childbirth, and aids travailing mothers; and why are a
thousand mothers every day cut off in murderous throes? Fire is under Vulcan’s care, and
its source is placed under his control; and why does he, very often, suffer temples and parts
of cities to fall into ashes devoured by flames? The soothsayers receive the knowledge of
their art from the Pythian god; and why does he so often give and afford answers equivocal,
doubtful, steeped in darkness and obscurity? Æsculapius presides over the duties and arts
of medicine; and why cannot men in more kinds of disease and sickness be restored to health
and soundness of body? while, on the contrary, they become worse under the hands of the
physician. Mercury is occupied with3989 combats, and presides over boxing and wrestling
matches; and why does he not make all invincible who are in his charge? why, when appointed
to one office, does he enable some to win the victory, while he suffers others to be ridiculed
for their disgraceful weakness?</p>
<note type="footnote">3985 According to Oehler, Portunus (Portumnus or Palæmon—“the god who protects harbours”) does not

therefore withhold their usual favours and help. Cannot the gods, then, do good, except
they receive incense and consecrated offerings?3990 and do they quit and renounce their
posts, unless they see their altars anointed with the blood of cattle? And yet I thought but
now that the kindness of the gods was of their own free will, and that the unlooked-for gifts
of benevolence flowed unsought from them. Is, then, the King of the universe solicited by
any libation or sacrifice to grant to the races of men all the comforts of life? Does the Deity
not impart the sun’s fertilizing warmth, and the season of night, the winds, the rains, the
fruits, to all alike,—the good and the bad, the unjust and the just,3991 the free-born and the
slave, the poor and the rich? For this belongs to the true and mighty God, to show kindness,
unasked, to that which is weary and feeble, and always encompassed by misery, of many
kinds. For to grant your prayers on the offering of sacrifices, is not to bring help to those
who ask it, but to sell the riches of their beneficence. We men trifle, and are foolish in so

over wars; whether to quell those which are raging, or to revive them when interrupted, and
kindle them in time of peace? For if he claims the madness of war, why do wars rage every
day? but if he is their author, we shall then say that the god, to satisfy his own inclination,
involves the whole world in strife; sows the seeds of discord and variance between far-distant
peoples; gathers so many thousand men from different quarters, and speedily heaps up the
field with dead bodies; makes the streams flow with blood, sweeps away the most firmlyfounded
empires, lays cities in the dust, robs the free of their liberty, and makes them slaves;

too often betray their own reputation into the hands of worthless harlots; that the firm bonds
of marriage are broken; that near relations burn with incestuous lust; that mothers have
their passions madly kindled towards their children; that fathers turn to themselves their

they reach3999 the height of perfection, and the highest wisdom also? or, why should we

of wicked falsehoods, if it were not that you yourselves, in bringing forward many things
about the gods so inconsistent and mutually destructive, compel us to withhold our minds
from assenting. For when you strive individually to excel each other in reputation for more
recondite knowledge, you both overthrow the very gods in whom you believe, and replace
them by others who have clearly no existence; and different men give different opinions on
the same subjects,4001 and you write that those whom general consent has ever received as
single persons are infinite in number. Let us, too, begin duty, then, with father Janus, whom
certain of you have declared to be the world, others the year, some the sun. But if we are to
believe that this is true, it follows as a consequence, that it should be understood that there
never was any Janus, who, they say, being sprung from Coelus and Hecate, reigned first in
Italy, founded the town Janiculum, was the father of Fons,4002 the son-in-law of Vulturnus,
the husband of Juturna; and thus you erase the name of the god to whom in all prayers you
give the first place, and whom you believe to procure for you a hearing from the gods. But,
again, if Janus be the year, neither thus can he be a god. For who does not know that the
year is a fixed space4003 of time, and that there is nothing divine in that which is formed4004
by the duration of months and lapse of days? Now this very argument may, in like manner,
be applied to Saturn. For if time is meant under this title, as the expounders of Grecian ideas
think, so that that is regarded as Kronos,4005 which is chronos,4006 there is no such deity
as Saturn. For who is so senseless as to say that time is a god, when it is but a certain space
measured off4007 in the unending succession of eternity? And thus will be removed from
the rank of the immortals that deity too, whom the men of old declared, and handed down
to their posterity, to be born of father Coelus, the progenitor of the dii magni, the planter of
the vine, the bearer of the pruning-knife.4008</p>

certain, there is, then, according to you, no Jupiter at all; who, born of Saturn his father and
Ops his mother, is reported to have been concealed in the Cretan territory, that he might
escape his father’s rage. But now, does not a similar mode of thought remove Juno from the

<p>31. Aristotle, a man of most powerful intellect, and distinguished for learning, as
Granius tells, shows by plausible arguments that Minerva is the moon, and proves it by the
authority of learned men. Others have said that this very goddess is the depth of ether, and
utmost height; some have maintained that she is memory, whence her name even, Minerva,
has arisen, as if she were some goddess of memory. But if this is credited, it follows that
there is no daughter of Mens, no daughter of Victory, no discoverer of the Olive, born from
the head of Jupiter, no goddess skilled in the knowledge of the arts, and in different branches
of learning. Neptune, they say, has received his name and title because he covers the earth
with water. If, then, by the use of this name is meant the outspread water, there is no god
Neptune at all; and thus is put away, and removed from us, the full brother of Pluto and
Jupiter, armed with the iron trident, lord of the fish, great and small, king of the depths of
the sea, and shaker of the trembling earth.4014</p>

conversation passes between two speakers, and is exchanged by them, that which is expressed
by this name has been produced.4015 If this, then, is the case, Mercury is not the name of a
god, but of speech and words exchanged by two persons; and in this way is blotted out and
annihilated the noted Cyllenian bearer of the caduceus, born on the cold mountain top,4016
contriver of words and names, the god who presides over markets, and over the exchange
of goods and commercial intercourse. Some of you have said that the earth is the Great
Mother,4017 because it provides all things living with food; others declare that the same
earth is Ceres, because it brings forth crops of useful fruits;4018 while some maintain that it
is Vesta, because it alone in the universe is at rest, its other members being, by their constitution,
ever in motion. Now if this is propounded and maintained on sure grounds, in like
manner, on your interpretation, three deities have no existence: neither Ceres nor Vesta are
to be reckoned in the number4019 of the gods; nor, in fine, can the mother of the gods herself,
whom Nigidius thinks to have been married to Saturn, be rightly declared a goddess, if indeed
these are all names of the one earth, and it alone is signified by these titles.</p>

with one consenting voice. We pass by Venus, named because lust assails all, and Proserpina,
named because plants steal gradually forth into the light,—where, again, you do away with
three deities; if indeed the first is the name of an element, and does not signify a living power;
the second, of a desire common to all living creatures; while the third refers to seeds rising
above ground, and the upward movements4020 of growing crops. What! when you maintain
that Bacchus, Apollo, the Sun, are one deity, increased in number by the use of three names,
is not the number of the gods lessened, and their vaunted reputation overthrown, by your
opinions? For if it is true that the sun is also Bacchus and Apollo, there can consequently
be in the universe no Apollo or Bacchus; and thus, by yourselves, the son of Semele and the

and that there are not three distinct persons, as there are three different names; that in all
these Luna is invoked, and that the others are a series of surnames added to her name. But
if this is sure, if this is certain, and the facts of the case show it to be so, again is Ceres but
an empty name, and Diana: and thus the discussion is brought to this issue, that you lead
and advise us to believe that she whom you maintain to be the discoverer of the earth’s fruits

<p>35. Men worthy to be remembered in the study of philosophy, who have been raised by
your praises to its highest place, declare, with commendable earnestness, as their conclusion,
that the whole mass of the world, by whose folds we all are encompassed, covered, and upheld,
is one animal4024 possessed of wisdom and reason; yet if this is a true, sure, and certain
opinion,4025 they also will forthwith cease to be gods whom you set up a little ago in its parts
without change of name.4026 For as one man cannot, while his body remains entire, be divided
into many men; nor can many men, while they continue to be distinct and separate
from each other,4027 be fused into one sentient individual: so, if the world is a single animal,
and moves from the impulse of one mind, neither can it be dispersed in several deities; nor,
if the gods are parts of it, can they be brought together and changed into one living creature,
with unity of feeling throughout all its parts. The moon, the sun, the earth, the ether, the
stars, are members and parts of the world; but if they are parts and members, they are certainly
not themselves4028 living creatures; for in no thing can parts be the very thing which
the whole is, or think and feel for themselves, for this cannot be effected by their own actions,
without the whole creature’s joining in; and this being established and settled, the whole
matter comes back to this, that neither Sol, nor Luna, nor Æther, Tellus, and the rest, are
gods. For they are parts of the world, not the proper names of deities; and thus it is brought
about that, by your disturbing and confusing all divine things, the world is set up as the sole
god in the universe, while all the rest are cast aside, and that as having been set up vainly,
uselessly, and without any reality.</p>

others that they were matrons. For now we wish to touch briefly on the points where you

<p>38. How, then, can you give to religion its whole power, when you fall into error about
the gods themselves? or summon us to their solemn worship, while you give us no definite
information how to conceive of the deities themselves? For, to take no notice of the other4037
authors, either the first4038 makes away with and destroys six divine Muses, if they are certainly
nine; or the last4039 adds six who have no existence to the three who alone really are;
so that it cannot be known or understood what should be added, what taken away; and in
the performance of religious rites we are in danger4040 of either worshipping that which
does not exist, or passing that by which, it may be, does exist. Piso believes that the Novensiles
are nine gods, set up among the Sabines at Trebia.4041 Granius thinks that they are the
Muses, agreeing with Ælius; Varro teaches that they are nine,4042 because, in doing anything,
that number is always reputed most powerful and greatest; Cornificius,4043 that they watch
over the renewing of things,4044 because, by their care, all things are afresh renewed in
strength, and endure; Manilius, that they are the nine gods to whom alone Jupiter gave
power to wield his thunder.4045 Cincius declares them to be deities brought from abroad,
named from their very newness, because the Romans were in the habit of sometimes individually
introducing into their families the rites4046 of conquered cities, while some they
publicly consecrated; and lest, from their great number, or in ignorance, any god should be
passed by, all alike were briefly and compendiously invoked under one name—Novensiles.</p>

<p>39. There are some, besides, who assert that those who from being men became gods,
are denoted by this name,—as Hercules, Romulus, Æsculapius, Liber, Æneas. These are all,
as is clear, different opinions; and it cannot be, in the nature of things, that those who differ
in opinion can be regarded as teachers of one truth. For if Piso’s opinion is true, Ælius and
Granius say what is false; if what they say is certain, Varro, with all his skill,4047 is mistaken,
who substitutes things most frivolous and vain for those which really exist. If they are named
Novensiles because their number is nine,4048 Cornificius is shown to stumble, who, giving
them might and power not their own, makes them the divine overseers of renovation.4049
But if Cornificius is right in his belief, Cincius is found to be not wise, who connects with
the power of the dii Novensiles the gods of conquered cities. But if they are those whom
Cincius asserts them to be, Manilius will be found to speak falsely, who comprehends those
who wield another’s thunder under this name.4050 But if that which Manilius holds is true
and certain, they are utterly mistaken who suppose that those raised to divine honours, and
deified mortals, are thus named because of the novelty of their rank. But if the Novensiles
are those who have deserved to be raised to the stars after passing through the life of men,4051
there are no dii Novensiles at all. For as slaves, soldiers, masters, are not names of persons
comprehended under them,4052 but of officers, ranks, and duties, so, when we say that
Novensiles is the name4053 of gods who by their virtues have become4054 gods from being

<p>40. Nigidius taught that the dii Penates were Neptune and Apollo, who once, on fixed
terms, girt Ilium4055 with walls. He himself again, in his sixteenth book, following Etruscan
teaching, shows that there are four kinds of Penates; and that one of these pertains to Jupiter,
another to Neptune, the third to the shades below, the fourth to mortal men, making some
unintelligible assertion. Cæsius himself, also, following this teaching, thinks that they are
Fortune, and Ceres, the genius Jovialis,4056 and Pales, but not the female deity commonly
received,4057 but some male attendant and steward of Jupiter. Varro thinks that they are
the gods of whom we speak who are within, and in the inmost recesses of heaven, and that
neither their number nor names are known. The Etruscans say that these are the Consentes
and Complices,4058 and name them because they rise and fall together, six of them being
male, and as many female, with unknown names and pitiless dispositions,4059 but they are
considered the counsellors and princes of Jove supreme. There were some, too, who said
that Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were the dii Penates, without whom we cannot live and be
wise, and by whom we are ruled within in reason, passion, and thought. As you see, even
here, too, nothing is said harmoniously, nothing is settled with the consent of all, nor is
there anything reliable on which the mind can take its stand, drawing by conjecture very
near to the truth. For their opinions are so doubtful, and one supposition so discredited4060

amid so many different statements.</p>

with this, the words una oriantur et occidant una might be translated “rise and sit down together,” i.e., at the
council table. But then, the names and number of these are known; while Arnobius says, immediately after, that
the names of the dii Consentes are not known and has already quoted Varro, to the effect that neither names
nor number are known. Schelling (über die Gotth. v. Samothr , quoted by Orelli) adopts the reading (see following
note), “of whom very little mention is made,” i.e., in prayers or rites, because they are merely Jove’s councillors,
and exercise no power over men, and identifies them with the Samothracian Cabiri—Κάβειροι and Consentes

to be the gods of streets and ways, because the Greeks name streets lauræ. In different parts
of his writings, Nigidius speaks of them now as the guardians of houses and dwellings; now
as the Curetes, who are said to have once concealed, by the clashing of cymbals,4061 the infantile
cries of Jupiter; now the five Digiti Samothracii, who, the Greeks tell us, were named
Idæi Dactyli. Varro, with like hesitation, says at one time that they are the Manes,4062 and
therefore the mother of the Lares was named Mania; at another time, again, he maintains
that they are gods of the air, and are termed heroes; at another, following the opinion of the
ancients, he says that the Lares are ghosts, as it were a kind of tutelary demon, spirits of

even from your religious books that you neither hold nor believe that there is any god concerning
whom you have not4064 brought forward doubtful and inconsistent statements,
expressing a thousand different beliefs. But, to be brief, and avoid prolixity,4065 it is enough
to have said what has been said; it is, further, too troublesome to gather together many
things into one mass, since it is made manifest and evident in different ways that you waver,
and say nothing with certainty of these things which you assert. But you will perhaps say,
Even if we have no personal knowledge of the Lares, Novensiles, Penates, still the very
agreement of our authors proves their existence, and that such a race4066 takes rank among
the celestial gods. And how can it be known whether there is any god, if what he is shall be
wholly unknown?4067 or how can it avail even to ask for benefits, if it is not settled and determined
who should be invoked at each inquiry?4068 For every one who seeks to obtain an
answer from any deity, should of necessity know to whom he makes supplication, on whom

4073 the other relieves distresses,—may it not be of some importance whether the one
or the other is Novensilis, since ignorance of the facts and confusion of persons displeases
the gods, and leads necessarily to the contraction of guilt? For suppose that I myself, to avoid
some inconvenience and peril, make supplication to any one of these deities, saying, Be

clemency turn away all these evils, by which I am annoyed,4074 troubled, and tormented:
will there be any hope that I shall receive help from them, if Ceres, Pales, Fortune, or the

discord, forgetfulness, injustice, impiety, baseness of spirit, and unfortunate4086
weakness of body. For as these things happen accidentally, and4087 depend on human acts

gods, we cannot determine whether you do that seriously, and from a belief in its certainty;
or, merely playing with empty fictions, abandon yourselves to an unbridled imagination.
The goddess Luperca, you tell us on the authority of Varro, was named because the fierce
wolf spared the exposed children. Was that goddess, then, disclosed, not by her own power,
but by the course of events? and was it only after the wild beast restrained its cruel teeth,
that she both began to be herself and was marked by4090 her name? or if she was already a
goddess long before the birth of Romulus and his brother, show us what was her name and
title. Præstana was named, according to you, because, in throwing the javelin, Quirinus excelled
all in strength;4091 and the goddess Panda, or Pantica, was named because Titus Tatius
was allowed to open up and make passable a road, that he might take the Capitoline. Before
these events, then, had the deities never existed? and if Romulus had not held the first place
in casting the javelin, and if the Sabine king had been unable to take the Tarpeian rock,
would there be no Pantica, no Præstana? And if you say that they4092 existed before that
which gave rise to their name, a question which has been discussed in a preceding section,4093

Opposing armies meet, and fighting together, hand to hand, decide the battle; and
to one this side, to another that, is hostile. Whom, then, will Pellonia turn to flight, since
on both sides there will be fighting? or in favour of whom will she incline, seeing that she
should afford to both sides the might and services of her name? But if she indeed4094 did
so, that is, if she gave her good-will and favour to both sides, she would destroy the meaning
of her name, which was formed with regard to the beating back of one side. But you will
perhaps say, She is goddess of the Romans only, and, being on the side of the Quirites alone,
is ever ready graciously to help them.4095 We wish, indeed, that it were so, for we like the
name; but it is a very doubtful matter. What! do the Romans have gods to themselves, who
do not help4096 other nations? and how can they be gods, if they do not exercise their divine
power impartially towards all nations everywhere? and where, I pray you, was this goddess
Pellonia long ago, when the national honour was brought under the yoke at the Caudine
Forks? when at the Trasimene lake the streams ran with blood? when the plains of
Diomede4097 were heaped up with dead Romans when a thousand other blows were sustained

<p>5. The sinister deities preside over the regions on the left hand only, and are opposed
to those4099 on the right. But with what reason this is said, or with what meaning, we do
not understand ourselves; and we are sure that you cannot in any degree cause it to be clearly
and generally understood.4100 For in the first place, indeed, the world itself has in itself
neither right nor left, neither upper nor under regions, neither fore nor after parts. For
whatever is round, and bounded on every side by the circumference4101 of a solid sphere,
has no beginning, no end; where there is no end and beginning, no part can have4102 its
own name and form the beginning. Therefore, when we say, This is the right, and that the
left side, we do not refer to anything4103 in the world, which is everywhere very much the
same, but to our own place and position, we being4104 so formed that we speak of some
things as on our right hand, of others as on our left; and yet these very things which we
name left, and the others which we name right, have in us no continuance, no fixedness, but
take their forms from our sides, just as chance, and the accident of the moment, may have
placed us. If I look towards the rising sun, the north pole and the north are on my left hand;
and if I turn my face thither, the west will be on my left, for it will be regarded as behind the
sun’s back. But, again, if I turn my eyes to the region of the west, the wind and country of
the south are now said to be on4105 my left. And if I am turned to this side by the necessary
business of the moment, the result is, that the east is said to be on the left, owing to a further
change of position,4106—from which it can be very easily seen that nothing is either on our
right or on our left by nature, but from position, time,4107 and according as our bodily position
with regard to surrounding objects has been taken up. But in this case, by what means,
in what way, will there be gods of the regions of the left, when it is clear that the same regions
are at one time on the right, at another on the left? or what have the regions of the right
done to the immortal gods, to deserve that they should be without any to care for them,
while they have ordained that these should be fortunate, and ever accompanied by lucky
omens?</p>

<p>6. Lateranus,4108 as you say, is the god and genius of hearths, and received this name
because men build that kind of fireplace of unbaked bricks. What then? if hearths were made
of baked clay, or any other material whatever, will they have no genii? and will Lateranus,
whoever he is, abandon his duty as guardian, because the kingdom which he possesses has
not been formed of bricks of clay? And for what purpose,4109 I ask, has that god received
the charge of hearths? He runs about the kitchens of men, examining and discovering with
what kinds of wood the heat in their fires is produced; he gives strength4110 to earthen vessels
that they may not fly in pieces, overcome by the violence of the flames; he sees that the flavour
of unspoilt dainties reaches the taste of the palate with their own pleasantness, and acts the
part of a taster, and tries whether the sauces have been rightly prepared. Is not this unseemly,
nay—to speak with more truth—disgraceful, impious, to introduce some pretended deities

who presides over the marriage4114 couch? Is there also Tutunus, on whose huge members4115
and horrent fascinum you think it auspicious, and desire, that your matrons should
be borne? But if facts themselves have very little effect in suggesting to you a right understanding
of the truth, are you not able, even from the very names, to understand that these
are the inventions of a most meaningless superstition, and the false gods of fancy?4116 Puta,
you say, presides over the pruning of trees, Peta over prayers; Nemestrinus4117 is the god
of groves; Patellana is a deity, and Patella, of whom the one has been set over things brought
to light, the other over those yet to be disclosed. Nodutis is spoken of as a god, because
he4118 brings that which has been sown to the knots: and she who presides over the treading
out of grain, Noduterensis;4119 the goddess Upibilia4120 delivers from straying from the
right paths; parents bereaved of their children are under the care of Orbona,—those very
near to death, under that of Nænia. Again,4121 Ossilago herself is mentioned as she who

<p>8. Say, I pray you,—that Peta, Puta, Patella may graciously favour you,—if there were
no4122 bees at all on the earth then, or if we men were born without bones, like some worms,
would there be no goddess Mellonia;4123 or would Ossilago, who gives bones their solidity,
be without a name of her own? I ask truly, and eagerly inquire whether you think that gods,
or men, or bees, fruits, twigs, and the rest, are the more ancient in nature, time, long duration?
No man will doubt that you say that the gods precede all things whatever by countless ages
and generations. But if it is so, how, in the nature of things, can it be that, from things produced
afterwards, they received those names which are earlier in point of time? or that the
gods were charged with the care4124 of those things which were not yet produced, and assigned
to be of use to men? Or were the gods long without names; and was it only after
things began to spring up, and be on the earth, that you thought it right that they should be
called by these names4125 and titles? And whence could you have known what name to give
to each, since you were wholly ignorant of their existence; or that they possessed any fixed
powers, seeing that you were equally unaware which of them had any power, and over what
he should be placed to suit his divine might?</p>

<p>9. What then? you say; do you declare that these gods exist nowhere in the world, and
have been created by unreal fancies? Not we alone, but truth itself, and reason, say so, and
that common-sense in which all men share. For who there who believes that there are gods
of gain, and that they preside over the getting of it, seeing that it springs very often from the
basest employments, and is always at the expense of others? Who believes that Libentina,
who that Burnus,4126 is set over those lusts which wisdom bids us avoid, and which, in a
thousand ways, vile and filthy wretches4127 attempt and practise? Who that Limentinus and
Lima have the care of thresholds, and do the duties of their keepers, when every day we see
the thresholds of temples and private houses destroyed and overthrown, and that the infamous
approaches to stews are not without them? Who believes that the Limi4128 watch over obliquities?
who that Saturnus presides over the sown crops? who that Montinus is the
guardian of mountains; Murcia,4129 of the slothful? Who, finally, would believe that Money
is a goddess, whom your writings declare, as though she were the greatest deity, to give

things which we have either run over rapidly, or, to avoid prolixity, passed by altogether,
have4131 their own peculiar guardians, we may in like manner introduce a thousand other
gods, who should care for and guard innumerable things. For why should a god have charge
of honey only, and not of gourds, rape, cunila, cress, figs, beets, cabbages? Why should the
bones alone have found protection, and not the nails, hair, and all the other things which
are placed in the hidden parts and members of which we feel ashamed, and are exposed to
very many accidents, and stand more in need of the care and attention of the gods? Or if
you say that these parts, too, act under the care of their own tutelar deities, there will begin

born and buried4152 in the island of Crete. They speak of five Suns and five Mercuries,—of
whom, as they relate, the first Sun is called the son of Jupiter, and is regarded as grandson
of Æther; the second is also Jupiter’s son, and the mother who bore him Hyperiona;4153 the
third the son of Vulcan, not Vulcan of Lemnos, but the son of the Nile; the fourth, whom
Acantho bore at Rhodes in the heroic age, was the father of Ialysus; while the fifth is regarded
as the son of a Scythian king and subtle Circe. Again, the first Mercury, who is said to have
lusted after Proserpina,4154 is son of Coelus, who is above all. Under the earth is the second,
who boasts that he is Trophonius. The third was born of Maia, his mother, and the third
Jove;4155 the fourth is the offspring of the Nile, whose name the people of Egypt dread and
fear to utter. The fifth is the slayer of Argus, a fugitive and exile, and the inventor of letters
in Egypt. But there are five Minervas also, they say, just as there are five Suns and Mercuries;
the first of whom is no virgin but the mother of Apollo by Vulcan; the second, the offspring
of the Nile, who is asserted to be the Egyptian Sais; the third is descended from Saturn, and
is the one who devised the use of arms; the fourth is sprung from Jove, and the Messenians
name her Coryphasia; and the fifth is she who slew her lustful4156 father, Pallas.</p>
<note type="footnote">4152 Lit., “committed to sepulture and born in,” etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">4153 Arnobius repeats this statement in ch. 22, or the name would have been regarded as corrupt, no other
author making mention of such a goddess; while Cicero speaks of one Sun as born of Hyperion. It would appear,
therefore, to be very probable that Arnobius, in writing from memory or otherwise, has been here in some
confusion as to what Cicero did say, and thus wrote the name as we have it. It has also been proposed to read
“born of Regina” (or, with Gelenius, Rhea), “and his father Hyperion,” because Cybele is termed βασίλεια; for
which reading there seems no good reason.—Immediately below, Ialysus is made the son, instead of, as in Cicero,
the grandson of the fourth; and again, Circe is said to be mother, while Cicero speaks of her as the daughter of
the fifth Sun. These variations, viewed along with the general adherence to Cicero’s statements (de N. D., iii. 21
sqq.), seem to give good grounds for adopting the explanation given above.</note>

the same theologians say that there are four Vulcans and three Dianas, as many Æsculapii
and five Dionysi, six Hercules and four Venuses, three sets of Castors and the same number
of Muses, three winged Cupids, and four named Apollo;4157 whose fathers they mention
in like manner, in like manner their mothers, and the places where they were born, and
point out the origin and family of each. But if it is true and certain, and is told in earnest as
a well-known matter, either they are not all gods, inasmuch as there cannot be several under
the same name, as we have been taught; or if there is one of them, he will not be known and
recognised, because he is obscured by the confusion of very similar names. And thus it results
from your own action, however unwilling you may be that it should be so, that religion is
brought into difficulty and confusion, and has no fixed end to which it can turn itself, without
being made the sport of equivocal illusions.</p>

fear of you,4158 to worship Minerva, for example, with the rights you deem sacred, and the
usual ceremony: if, when we prepare sacrifices, and approach to make the offerings appointed
for her on the flaming altars, all the Minervas shall fly thither, and striving for the right to
that name, each demand that the offerings prepared be given to herself; what drawn-out
animal shall we place among them, or to whom shall we direct the sacred offices which are
our duty?4159 For the first one of whom we spoke will perhaps say: “The name Minerva is
mine, mine4160 the divine majesty, who bore Apollo and Diana, and by the fruit of my womb
enriched heaven with deities, and multiplied the number of the gods.” “Nay, Minerva,” the
fifth will say, “are you speaking,4161 who, being a wife, and so often a mother, have lost the
sanctity of spotless purity? Do you not see that in all temples4162 the images of Minervas
are those of virgins, and that all artists refrain from giving to them the figures of matrons?4163
Cease, therefore, to appropriate to yourself a name not rightfully4164 yours. For that I am
Minerva, begotten of father Pallas, the whole band of poets bear witness, who call me Pallas,
the surname being derived from my father.” The second will cry on hearing this: “What say
you? Do you, then, bear the name of Minerva, an impudent parricide, and one defiled by
the pollution of lewd lust, who, decking yourself with rouge and a harlot’s arts, roused upon
yourself even your father’s passions, full of maddening desires? Go further, then, seek for
yourself another name; for this belongs to me, whom the Nile, greatest of rivers, begot from

then, do we suppose will be the result? Will she indeed cease to say that she is Minerva, who
is named Coryphasia, either to mark her mother, or because she sprung forth from the top
of Jove’s head, bearing a shield, and girt with the terror of arms? Or are we to suppose that
she who is third will quietly surrender the name? and not argue4167 and resist the assumption
of the first two with such words as these: “Do you thus dare to assume the honour of my
name, O Sais,4168 sprung from the mud and eddies of a stream, and formed in miry places?
Or do you usurp4169 another’s rank, who falsely say that you were born a goddess from the
head of Jupiter, and persuade very silly men that you are reason? Does he conceive and
bring forth children from his head? That the arms you bear might be forged and formed,
was there even in the hollow of his head a smith’s workshop? were there anvils, hammers,
furnaces, bellows, coals, and pincers? Or if, as you maintain, it is true that you are reason,
cease to claim for yourself the name which is mine; for reason, of which you speak, is not a
certain form of deity, but the understanding of difficult questions.” If, then, as we have said,
five Minervas should meet us when we essay to sacrifice,4170 and contending as to whose
this name is, each demand that either fumigations of incense be offered to her, or sacrificial
wines poured out from golden cups; by what arbiter, by what judge, shall we dispose of so
great a dispute? or what examiner will there be, what umpire of so great boldness as to attempt,
with such personages, either to give a just decision, or to declare their causes not
founded on right? Will he not rather go home, and, keeping himself apart from such matters,

have written what is certain and well known, or set forth a wanton fiction,4172 as they thought
and judged? That has nothing to do with the matter; nor does the reasonableness of your
argument depend upon this,—whether the facts are as the writings of the theologians state,
or are otherwise and markedly different. For to us it is enough to speak of things which
come before the public; and we need not inquire what is true, but only confute and disprove
that which lies open to all, and which men’s thoughts have generally received. But if they
are liars, declare yourselves what is the truth, and disclose the unassailable mystery. And
how can it be done when the services of men of letters are set aside? For what is there which
can be said about the immortal gods that has not reached men’s thoughts from what has
been written by men on these subjects?4173 Or can you relate anything yourselves about
their rights and ceremonies, which has not been recorded in books, and made known by
what authors have written? Or if you think these of no importance, let all the books be destroyed
which have been composed about the gods for you by theologians, pontiffs, and even
some devoted to the study of philosophy; nay, let us rather suppose that from the foundation
of the world no man ever wrote4174 anything about the gods: we wish to find out, and desire
to know, whether you can mutter or murmur in mentioning the gods,4175 or conceive those
in thought to whom no idea4176 from any book gave shape in your minds. But when it is

what proof, by what evidence, will it be shown? For since both parties are men, both those
who have said the one thing and those who have said the other, and on both sides the discussion
was of doubtful matters, it is arrogant to say that that is true which seems so to you,
but that that which offends your feelings manifests wantonness and falsehood. By the laws

offend the gods themselves, whoever they are, because you believe that it is owing to filthy
intercourse…4180 that they have reached the light they knew not of, thanks to lewdness?
For we, lest any one should chance to think that we are ignorant of, do not know, what befits
the majesty of that name, assuredly4181 think that the gods should not know birth; or if they
are born at all, we hold and esteem that the Lord and Prince of the universe, by ways which

nurse, and in the next place maintained the life given to him by nourishment drawn from
a foreign4193 breast? What say you, O men? Did, then, shall I repeat, the god who makes the
thunder crash, lightens and hurls the thunderbolt, and draws together terrible clouds, drink
in the streams of the breast, wail as an infant, creep about, and, that he might be persuaded
to cease his crying most foolishly protracted, was he made silent by the noise of rattles,4194

defended; of him and Semele, Liber, who is named Bromius, and was born a second time

of the harmless snakes. Can any greater insult be put upon your Jupiter, or is there anything
else which will destroy and ruin the reputation of the chief of the gods, further than that
you believe him to have been at times overcome by vicious pleasures, and to have glowed
with the passion of a heart roused to lust after women? And what had the Saturnian king
to do with strange nuptials? Did Juno not suffice him; and could he not stay the force of his
desires on the queen of the deities, although so great excellence graced her, such beauty,
majesty of countenance, and snowy and marble whiteness of arms? Or did he, not content
with one wife, taking pleasure in concubines, mistresses, and courtezans, a lustful god,
show4201 his incontinence in all directions, as is the custom with dissolute4202 youths; and
in old age, after intercourse with numberless persons, did he renew his eagerness for pleasures
now losing their zest? What say you, profane ones; or what vile thoughts do you fashion

endured slavery, as Hercules at Sardis4215 for lust and wantonness; as the Delian Apollo,
who served Admetus, as Jove’s brother, who served the Trojan Laomedon, whom the Pythian
alsoserved, but with his uncle; as Minerva, who gives light, and trims the lamps to secret
lovers? Is not he one of your poets, who represented Mars and Venus as wounded by men’s
hands? Is not Panyassis one of you, who relates that father Dis and queenly Juno were
wounded by Hercules? Do not the writings of your Polemo say that Pallas4216 was slain,4217
covered with her own blood, overwhelmed by Ornytus? Does not Sosibius declare that
Hercules himself was afflicted by the wound and pain he suffered at the hands of Hipocoon’s
children? Is it related at our instance that Jupiter was committed to the grave in the island
of Crete? Do we say that the brothers,4218 who were united in their cradle, were buried in

<p>26. But what shall I say of the desires with which it is written in your books, and contained
in your writers, that the holy immortals lusted after women? For is it by us that the
king of the sea is asserted in the heat of maddened passion to have robbed of their virgin
purity Amphitrite,4221 Hippothoe, Amymone, Menalippe, Alope?4222 that the spotless
Apollo, Latona’s son, most chaste and pure, with the passions of a breast not governed by
reason, desired Arsinoe, Æthusa, Hypsipyle, Marpessa, Zeuxippe, and Prothoe, Daphne,
and Sterope?4223 Is it shown in our poems that the aged Saturn, already long covered with
grey hair, and now cooled by weight of years, being taken by his wife in adultery, put on the
form of one of the lower animals, and neighing loudly, escaped in the shape of a beast? Do
you not accuse Jupiter himself of having assumed countless forms, and concealed by mean
deceptions the ardour of his wanton lust? Have we ever written that he obtained his desires
by deceit, at one time changing into gold, at another into a sportive satyr; into a serpent, a
bird, a bull; and, to pass beyond all limits of disgrace, into a little ant, that he might, forsooth,
make Clitor’s daughter the mother of Myrmidon, in Thessaly? Who represented him as
having watched over Alcmena for nine nights without ceasing? was it not you?—that he
indolently abandoned himself to his lusts, forsaking his post in heaven? was it not you? And,
indeed, you ascribe4224 to him no mean favours; since, in your opinion, the god Hercules
was born to exceed and surpass in such matters his father’s powers. He in nine nights begot4225
with difficulty one son; but Hercules, a holy god, in one night taught the fifty
daughters of Thestius at once to lay aside their virginal title, and to bear a mother’s burden.
Moreover, not content to have ascribed to the gods love of women, do you also say that they
lusted after men? Some one loves Hylas; another is engaged with Hyacinthus; that one burns
with desire for Pelops; this one sighs more ardently for Chrysippus; Catamitus is carried off
to be a favourite and cup-bearer; and Fabius, that he may be called Jove’s darling, is branded
on the soft parts, and marked in the hinder.</p>

Adonis; her mother, Ceres, after some rustic Jasion, and afterwards Vulcan, Phaeton,4227
Mars; Venus herself, the mother of Æneas, and founder of the Roman power, to marry
Anchises? While, therefore, you accuse, without making any exception, not one only by
name, but the whole of the gods alike, in whose existence you believe, of such acts of extraordinary
shamefulness and baseness, do you dare, without violation of modesty, to say
either that we are impious, or that you are pious, although they receive from you much
greater occasion for offence on account of all the shameful acts which you heap up to their
reproach, than in connection with the service and duties required by their majesty, honour,

lessening their credit and reputation; and it is in that case a matter quite deserving,

<p>28. For where there are weddings, marriages, births, nurses, arts,4228 and weaknesses;
where there are liberty and slavery; where there are wounds, slaughter, and shedding of
blood; where there are lusts, desires, sensual pleasures; where there is every mental passion
arising from disgusting emotions,—there must of necessity be nothing godlike there; nor
can that cleave to a superior nature which belongs to a fleeting race, and to the frailty of
earth. For who, if only he recognises and perceives what the nature of that power is, can
believe either that a deity had the generative members, and was deprived of them by a very
base operation; or that he at one time cut off the children sprung from himself, and was
punished by suffering imprisonment; or that he, in a way, made civil war upon his father,
and deprived him of the right of governing; or that he, filled with fear of one younger when
overcome, turned to flight, and hid in remote solitudes, like a fugitive and exile? Who, I say,
can believe that the deity reclined at men’s tables, was troubled on account of his avarice,
deceived his suppliants by an ambiguous reply, excelled in the tricks of thieves, committed
adultery, acted as a slave, was wounded, and in love, and submitted to the seduction of impure
desires in all the forms of lust? But yet you declare all these things both were, and are, in
your gods; and you pass by no form of vice, wickedness, error, without bringing it forward,
in the wantonness of your fancies, to the reproach of the gods. You must, therefore, either
seek out other gods, to whom all these reproaches shall not apply, for they are a human and

have declared, by your beliefs you do away with them: for all the things of which you speak

<p>30. But in the discussion which we at present maintain, we do not undertake this trouble
or service, to show and declare who all these were. But this is what we proposed to ourselves,
that as you call us impious and irreligious, and, on the other hand, maintain that you are
pious and serve the gods, we should prove and make manifest that by no men are they
treated with less respect than by you. But if it is proved by the very insults that it is so, it
must, as a consequence, be understood that it is you who rouse the gods to fierce and terrible
rage, because you either listen to or believe, or yourselves invent about them, stories so degrading.
For it is not he who is anxiously thinking of religious rites,4235 and slays spotless
victims, who gives piles of incense to be burned with fire, not he must be thought to worship
the deities, or alone discharge the duties of religion. True worship is in the heart, and a belief
worthy of the gods; nor does it at all avail to bring blood and gore, if you believe about them
things which are not only far remote from and unlike their nature, but even to some extent
stain and disgrace both their dignity and virtue.</p>

you think it a greater offence to sacrifice to them no victims, because you think that so great
a being neither wishes nor desires these; or, with foul beliefs, to hold opinions about them
so degrading, that they might rouse any one’s spirit to a mad desire for revenge? If the relative
importance of the matters be weighed, you will find no judge so prejudiced as not to believe
it a greater crime to defame by manifest insults any one’s reputation, than to treat it with
silent neglect. For this, perhaps, may be held and believed from deference to reason; but the
other course manifests an impious spirit, and a blindness despaired of in fiction. If in your
ceremonies and rites neglected sacrifices and expiatory offerings may be demanded, guilt
is said to have been contracted; if by a momentary forgetfulness4236 any one has erred either
in speaking or in pouring wine;4237 or again,4238 if at the solemn games and sacred races
the dancer has halted, or the musician suddenly become silent,—you all cry out immediately
that something has been done contrary to the sacredness of the ceremonies; or if the boy
termed patrimus let go the thong in ignorance,4239 or could not hold to the earth:4240 and

<p>32. But all these things, they say, are the fictions of poets, and games arranged for
pleasure. It is not credible, indeed, that men by no means thoughtless, who sought to trace
out the character of the remotest antiquity, either did not4241 insert in their poems the fables
which survived in men’s minds4242 and common conversation;4243 or that they would have
assumed to themselves so great licence as to foolishly feign what was almost sheer madness,
and might give them reason to be afraid of the gods, and bring them into danger with men.
But let us grant that the poets are, as you say, the inventors and authors of tales so disgraceful;
you are not, however, even thus free from the guilt of dishonouring the gods, who either
are remiss in punishing such offences, or have not, by passing laws, and by severity of pun-
ishments, opposed such indiscretion, and determined4244 that no man should henceforth
say that which tended to the dishonour,4245 or was unworthy of the glory of the gods.4246
For whoever allows the wrongdoer to sin, strengthens his audacity; and it is more insulting
to brand and mark any one with false accusations, than to bring forward and upbraid their
real offences. For to be called what you are, and what you feel yourself to be, is less offensive,
because your resentment is checked by the evidence supplied against you on privately reviewing
your life;4247 but that wounds very keenly which brands the innocent, and defames a

earthly bodies are supported, and which are sought after by ears enervated by the frivolity

you say that those who have uttered so marvellous things are chiefs and kings among poets
endowed with godlike genius, that they are persons most holy; and so utterly have you lost
sight of your duty in the matters of religion which you bring forward, that words are of
more importance, in your opinion, than the profaned majesty of the immortals. So then, if
only you felt any fear of the gods, or believed with confident and unhesitating assurance
that they existed at all, should you not, by bills, by popular votes, by fear of the senate’s decrees,
have hindered, prevented, and forbidden any one to speak at random of the gods
otherwise than in a pious manner?4253 Nor have they obtained this honour even at your
hands, that you should repel insults offered to them by the same laws by which you ward
them off from yourselves. They are accused of treason among you who have whispered any
evil about your kings. To degrade a magistrate, or use insulting language to a senator, you
have made by decree a crime, followed by the severest punishment. To write a satirical poem,
by which a slur is cast upon the reputation and character of another, you determined, by

ears with too wanton abuse, you established formulæ4254 for severe affronts. With you only
the gods are unhonoured, contemptible, vile; against whom you allow any one liberty to say
what he will, to accuse them of the deeds of baseness which his lust has invented and devised.

farces also, and scurrilous plays. And that the idle onlookers may be excited to laughter and
jollity, the deities are hit at in jocular quips, the spectators shout and rise up, the whole pit

<p>37. But this is the state of the case, that as you are exceedingly strong in war and in
military power, you think you excel in knowledge of the truth also, and are pious before the
gods,4271 whose might you have been the first to besmirch with foul imaginings. Here, if
your fierceness allows, and madness suffers, we ask you to answer us this: Whether you
think that anger finds a place in the divine nature, or that the divine blessedness is far removed
from such passions? For if they are subject to passions so furious,4272 and are excited
by feelings of rage as your imaginings suggest,—for you say that they have often shaken the
earth with their roaring,4273 and bringing woful misery on men, corrupted with pestilential
contagion the character of the times,4274 both because their games had been celebrated with
too little care, and because their priests were not received with favour, and because some
small spaces were desecrated, and because their rites were not duly performed,—it must
consequently be understood that they feel no little wrath on account of the opinions which
have been mentioned. But if, as follows of necessity, it is admitted that all these miseries
with which men have long been overwhelmed flow from such fictions, if the anger of the
deities is excited by these causes, you are the occasion of so terrible misfortunes, because
you never cease to jar upon the feelings of the gods, and excite them to a fierce desire for
vengeance. But if, on the other hand, the gods are not subject to such passions, and do not
know at all what it is to be enraged, then indeed there is no ground for saying that they who
know not what anger is are angry with us, * and they are free from its presence,4275 and the
disorder4276 it causes. For it cannot be, in the nature of things, that what is one should become
two; and that unity, which is naturally uncompounded, should divide and go apart into
separate things.4277</p>

place. Orelli transposes them to ch. 13, as was noticed there, although he regards them as an interpolation. The
clause is certainly a very strange one, and has a kind of affected abstractness, which makes it seem out of place;
but it must be remembered that similarly confused and perplexing sentences are by no means rare in Arnobius.
If the clause is to be retained, as good sense can be made from it here as anywhere else. The general meaning
would be: The gods, if angry, are angry with the pagans; but if they are not subject to passion, it would be idle
to speak of them as angry with the Christians, seeing that they cannot possibly at once be incapable of feeling
anger, and yet at the same time be angry with them. [See cap. 13, note 4, p. 480, supra.]</note>

<p>1. Admitting that all these things which do the immortal gods dishonour, have been
put forth by poets merely in sport, what of those found in grave, serious, and careful histories,
and handed down by you in hidden mysteries? have they been invented by the licentious
fancy of the poets? Now if they seemed4278 to you stories of such absurdity, some of them
you would neither retain in their constant use, nor celebrate as solemn festivals from year
to year, nor would you maintain them among your sacred rites as shadows of real events.
With strict moderation, I shall adduce only one of these stories which are so numerous; that
in which Jupiter himself is brought on the stage as stupid and inconsiderate, being tricked
by the ambiguity of words. In the second book of Antias—lest any one should think, perchance,
that we are fabricating charges calumniously—the following story is written:—</p>
<p>The famous king Numa, not knowing how to avert evil portended by thunder, and being
eager to learn, by advice of Egeria concealed beside a fountain twelve chaste youths provided
with chains; so that when Faunus and Martius4279 Picus came to this place4280 to drink,—for
hither they were wont to come4281 to draw water,—they might rush on them, seize and bind
them. But, that this might be done more speedily, the king filled many4282 cups with wine
and with mead,4283 and placed them about the approaches to the fountain, where they would
be seen—a crafty snare for those who should come. They, as was their usual custom, when
overcome by thirst, came to their well-known haunts. But when they had perceived cups
with sweetly smelling liquors, they preferred the new to the old; rushed eagerly upon them;
charmed with the sweetness of the draught, drank too much; and becoming drunk, fell fast
asleep. Then the twelve youths threw themselves upon the sleepers, and cast chains round
them, lying soaked with wine; and they,4284 when roused, immediately taught the king by
what methods and sacrifices Jupiter could be called down to earth. With this knowledge the
king performed the sacred ceremony on the Aventine, drew down Jupiter to the earth, and
asked from him the due form of expiation. Jupiter having long hesitated, said, “Thou shalt

onion.”4286 Jupiter again, “With a man’s.” The king returned, “But with hair.”4287 The deity
in turn, “With the life.4288 With a fish,”4289 rejoined Pompilius. Then Jupiter, being ensnared
by the ambiguous terms used, uttered these words: “Thou hast overreached me, Numa; for
I had determined that evils portended by thunder should be averted with sacrifices of human
heads, not4290 with hair and an onion. Since, however, your craft has outwitted me, have
the mode which you wished; and always undertake the expiation of thunder-portents with

<p>2. What the mind should take up first, what last, or what it should pass by silently, it is
not easy to say, nor is it made clear by any amount of reflection; for all have been so devised
and fitted to be laughed at, that you should strive that they may be believed to be false—even
if they are true—rather than pass current as true, and suggest as it were something extraordinary,
and bring contempt upon deity itself. What, then, do you say, O you—? Are we to believe4291
that that Faunus and Martius Picus—if they are of the number of the gods, and of
that everlasting and immortal substance—were once parched with thirst, and sought the
gushing fountains, that they might be able to cool with water their heated veins? Are we to
believe that, ensnared by wine, and beguiled by the sweetness of mead, they dipped so long
into the treacherous cups, that they even got into danger of becoming drunk? Are we to
believe that, being fast asleep, and plunged in the forgetfulness of most profound slumbers,
they gave to creatures of earth an opportunity to bind them? On what parts, then, were those
bonds and chains flung? Did they have any solid substance, or had their hands been formed
of hard bones, so that it might be possible to bind them with halters and hold them fast by
tightly drawn knots? For I do not ask, I do not inquire whether they could have said anything
when swaying to and fro in their drunken maunderings; or whether, while Jupiter was unwilling,
or rather unwitting, any one could have made known the way to bring him down
to earth. This only do I wish to hear, why, if Faunus and Picus are of divine origin and power,
they did not rather themselves declare to Numa, as he questioned them, that which he desired
to learn from Jove himself at a greater risk? Or4292 did Jupiter alone have knowledge of
this—for from him the thunderbolts fall—how training in some kind of knowledge should
avert impending dangers? Or, while he himself hurls these fiery bolts, is it the business of
others to know in what way it is fitting to allay his wrath and indignation? For truly it would
be most absurd to suppose that he himself appoints4293 the means by which may be averted
that which he has determined should befall men through the hurling of his thunderbolts.
For this is to say, By such ceremonies you will turn aside my wrath; and if I shall at any time
have foreshown by flashes of lightning that some evil is close at hand, do this and that, so
that4294 what I have determined should be done may be done altogether in vain, and may
pass away idly through the force4295 of these rites.</p>

<p>3. But let us admit that, as is said, Jupiter has himself appointed against himself ways
and means by which his own declared purposes might fittingly be opposed: are we also to
believe that a deity of so great majesty was dragged down to earth, and, standing on a petty
hillock with a mannikin, entered into a wrangling dispute? And what, I ask, was the charm
which forced Jupiter to leave the all-important4296 direction of the universe, and appear at
the bidding of mortals? the sacrificial meal, incense, blood, the scent of burning laurelboughs,
4297 and muttering of spells? And were all these more powerful than Jupiter, so that
they compelled him to do unwillingly what was enjoined, or to give himself up of his own
accord to their crafty tricks? What! will what follows be believed, that the son of Saturn had
so little foresight, that he either proposed terms by the ambiguity of which he was himself
ensnared, or did not know what was going to happen, how the craft and cunning of a mortal
would overreach him? You shall make expiation, he says, with a head when thunderbolts
have fallen. The phrase is still incomplete, and the meaning is not fully expressed and defined;
for it was necessarily right to know whether Diespiter ordains that this expiation be effected
with the head of a wether, a sow, an ox, or any other animal. Now, as he had not yet fixed
this specifically, and his decision was still uncertain and not yet determined, how could
Numa know that Jupiter would say the head of a man, so as to4298 anticipate and prevent
him, and turn his uncertain and ambiguous words4299 into “an onion’s head?”</p>

<p>4. But you will perhaps say that the king was a diviner. Could he be more so than Jupiter
himself? But for a mortal’s anticipating4300 what Jupiter—whom4301 he overreached—was
going to say, could the god not know in what ways a man was preparing to overreach him?
Is it not, then, clear and manifest that these are puerile and fanciful inventions, by which,
while a lively wit is assigned4302 to Numa, the greatest want of foresight is imputed to Jupiter?
For what shows so little foresight as to confess that you have been ensnared by the subtlety
of a man’s intellect, and while you are vexed at being deceived, to give way to the wishes of
him who has overcome you, and to lay aside the means which you had proposed? For if
there was reason and some natural fitness that4303 expiatory sacrifice for that which was
struck with lightning should have been made with a man’s head, I do not see why the proposal
of an onion’s was made by the king; but if it could be performed with an onion also,
there was a greedy lust for human blood. And both parts are made to contradict themselves:
so that, on the one hand, Numa is shown not to have wished to know what he did wish; and,
on the other, Jupiter is shown to have been merciless, because he said that he wished expiation
to be made with the heads of men, which could have been done by Numa with an onion’s
head</p>

<p>5. In Timotheus, who was no mean mythologist, and also in others equally well informed,
the birth of the Great Mother of the gods, and the origin of her rites, are thus detailed, being
derived—as he himself writes and suggests—from learned books of antiquities, and from
his acquaintance with the most secret mysteries:—Within the confines of Phrygia, he says,
there is a rock of unheard-of wildness in every respect, the name of which is Agdus, so
named by the natives of that district. Stones taken from it, as Themis by her oracle4304 had
enjoined, Deucalion and Pyrrha threw upon the earth, at that time emptied of men; from
which this Great Mother, too, as she is called, was fashioned along with the others, and animated
by the deity. Her, given over to rest and sleep on the very summit of the rock, Jupiter
assailed with lewdest4305 desires. But when, after long strife, he could not accomplish what
he had proposed to himself, he, baffled, spent his lust on the stone. This the rock received,
and with many groanings Acdestis4306 is born in the tenth month, being named from his
mother rock. In him there had been resistless might, and a fierceness of disposition beyond
control, a lust made furious, and derived from both sexes.4307 He violently plundered and
laid waste; he scattered destruction wherever the ferocity of his disposition had led him; he
regarded not gods nor men, nor did he think anything more powerful than himself; he
contemned earth, heaven, and the stars.</p>
<note type="footnote">4304 So Ovid also (Metam., i. 321), and others, speak of Themis as the first to give oracular responses,</note>

<p>6. Now, when it had been often considered in the councils of the gods, by what means
it might be possible either to weaken or to curb his audacity, Liber, the rest hanging back,
takes upon himself this task. With the strongest wine he drugs a spring much resorted to
by Acdestis4308 where he had been wont to assuage the heat and burning thirst4309 roused
in him by sport and hunting. Hither runs Acdestis to drink when he felt the need;4310 he
gulps down the draught too greedily into his gaping veins. Overcome by what he is quite
unaccustomed to, he is in consequence sent fast asleep. Liber is near the snare which he had
set; over his foot he throws one end of a halter4311 formed of hairs, woven together very
skilfully; with the other end he lays hold of his privy members. When the fumes of the wine
passed off, Acdestis starts up furiously, and his foot dragging the noose, by his own strength
he robs himself of his4312 sex; with the tearing asunder of these parts there is an immense
flow of blood; both4313 are carried off and swallowed up by the earth; from them there
suddenly springs up, covered with fruit, a pomegranate tree, seeing the beauty of which,
with admiration, Nana,4314 daughter of the king or river Sangarius, gathers and places in
her bosom some of the fruit. By this she becomes pregnant; her father shuts her up, supposing
that she had been4315 debauched, and seeks to have her starved to death; she is kept alive

intimacy, resolves to give him his own daughter in marriage, and caused the gates of the
town to be closed, that no one of evil omen might disturb their marriage joys. But the
mother of the gods, knowing the fate of the youth, and that he would live among men in
safety only so long as he was free from the ties of marriage, that no disaster might occur,
enters the closed city, raising its walls with her head, which began to be crowned with towers
in consequence. Acdestis, bursting with rage because of the boy’s being torn from himself,
and brought to seek a wife, fills all the guests with frenzied madness:4321 the Phrygians
shriek aloud, panic-stricken at the appearance of the gods;4322 a daughter of adulterous4323

frenzy; and he, too, now filled with furious passion, raving frantically and tossed about,
throws himself down at last, and under a pine tree mutilates himself, saying, “Take these,4324
Acdestis, for which you have stirred up so great and terribly perilous commotions.”4325
With the streaming blood his life flies; but the Great Mother of the gods gathers the parts

wrapped4326 them in the garment of the dead. From the blood which had flowed springs a

whereby you even now veil and wreath with flowers the sacred pine. The virgin who had

his hairs should always grow, that the least of his fingers should live, and should be kept

him, and expose you to hatred and dislike, accompanied by implacable resentment? From
the stones, you say, which Deucalion and Pyrrha threw, was produced the mother of the
gods. What do you say, O theologians? what, ye priests of the heavenly powers? Did the
mother of the gods, then, not exist at all for the sake of the deluge? and would there be no
cause or beginning of her birth, had not violent storms of rain swept away the whole race
of men? It is through man, then, that she feels herself to exist, and she owes it to Pyrrha’s
kindness that she sees herself addressed as a real being;4337 but if that is indeed true, this
too will of necessity not be false, that she was human, not divine. For if it is certain that men
are sprung originally from the casting of stones, it must be believed that she too was one of
us, since she was produced by means of the same causes. For it cannot be, for nature would
not suffer it,4338 that from one kind of stones, and from the same mode of throwing them,
some should be formed to rank among the immortals, others with the condition of men.
Varro, that famous Roman, distinguished by the diversity of his learning, and unwearied
in his researches into ancient times, in the first of four books which he has left in writing
on the race of the Roman people, shows by careful calculations, that from the time of the
deluge, which we mentioned before, down to the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa,4339 there
are not quite two thousand years; and if he is to be believed, the Great Mother, too, must
be said to have her whole life bounded by the limits of this number. And thus the matter is
brought to this issue, that she who is said to be parent of all the deities is not their mother,
but their daughter; nay, rather a mere child, a little girl, since we admit that in the neverending
series of ages neither beginning nor end has been ascribed to the gods.</p>

<p>9. But why do we speak of your having bemired the Great Mother of the gods with the
filth of earth, when you have not been able for but a little time even to keep from speaking
evil of Jupiter himself? While the mother of the gods was then sleeping on the highest peak
of Agdus, her son, you say, tried stealthily to surprise her chastity while she slept. After
robbing of their chastity virgins and matrons without number, did Jupiter hope to gratify
his detestable passion upon his mother? and could he not be turned from his fierce desire
by the horror which nature itself has excited not only in men, but in some other animals
also, and by common4340 feeling? Was he then regardless of piety4341 and honour, who is
chief in the temples? and could he neither reconsider nor perceive how wicked was his desire,
his mind being madly agitated? But, as it is, forgetting his majesty and dignity, he crept
forward to steal those vile pleasures, trembling and quaking with fear, holding his breath,
walking in terror on tiptoe, and, between hope and fear, touched her secret parts, trying
how soundly his mother slept, and what she would suffer.4342 Oh, shameful representation!
oh, disgraceful plight of Jupiter, prepared to attempt a filthy contest! Did the ruler of the
world, then, turn to force, when, in his heedlessness and haste, he was prevented from
stealing on by surprise;4343 and when he was unable to snatch his pleasure by cunning craft,
did he assail his mother with violence, and begin without any concealment to destroy the
chastity which he should have revered? Then, having striven for a very long time when she
is unwilling, did he go off conquered, vanquished, and overcome? and did his spent lust
part him whom piety was unable to hold back from execrable lust after his mother?</p>

<p>10. But you will perhaps say the human race shuns and execrates such unions;4344 among
the gods there is no incest. And why, then, did his mother resist with the greatest vehemence
her son when he offered her violence? Why did she flee from his embraces, as if she were
avoiding unlawful approaches? For if there was nothing wrong in so doing, she should have
gratified him without any reluctance, just as he eagerly wished to satisfy the cravings of his
lust. And here, indeed, very thrifty men, and frugal even about shameful works, that that
sacred seed may not seem to have been poured forth in vain—the rock, one says, drank up
Jupiter’s foul incontinence. What followed next, I ask? Tell. In the very heart of the rock,
and in that flinty hardness, a child was formed and quickened to be the offspring of great
Jupiter. It is not easy to object to conceptions so unnatural and so wonderful. For as the
human race is said by you to have sprung and proceeded from stones, it must be believed
that the stones both had genital parts, and drank in the seed cast on them, and when their
time was full were pregnant,4345 and at last brought forth, travailing in distress as women
do. That impels our curiosity to inquire, since you say that the birth occurred after ten
months, in what womb of the rock was he enclosed at that time? with what food, with what
juices, was he supplied? or what could he have drawn to support him from the hard stone,
as unborn infants usually receive from their mothers! He had not yet reached the light, my
informant says; and already bellowing and imitating his father’s thunderings, he reproduced
their sound.4346 And after it was given him to see the sky and the light of day, attacking all
things which lay in his way, he made havoc of them, and assured himself that he was able
to thrust down from heaven the gods themselves. O cautious and foreseeing mother of the
gods, who, that she might not undergo the ill-will of so4347 arrogant a son, or that his bellowing
while still unborn might not disturb her slumbers or break her repose, withdrew
herself, and sent far from her that most hurtful seed, and gave it to the rough rock.</p>

<p>11. There was doubt in the councils of the gods how that unyielding and fierce violence
was to be subdued; and when there was no other way, they had recourse to one means, that
he should be soaked with much wine, and bereft of his members, by their being cut off. As
if, indeed, those who have suffered the loss of these parts become less arrogant, and as if we
do not daily see those who have cut them away from themselves become more wanton, and,
neglecting all the restraints of chastity and modesty, throw themselves headlong into filthy
vileness, making known abroad their shameful deeds. I should like, however, to see—were
it granted me to be born at those times—father Liber, who overcame the fierceness of
Acdestis, having glided down from the peaks of heaven after the very venerable meetings
of the gods, cropping the tails of horses,4348 plaiting pliant halters, drugging the waters
harmless while pure with much strong wine, and after that drunkenness sprung from
drinking, to have carefully introduced his hands, handled the members of the sleeper, and
directed his care skilfully4349 to the parts which were to perish, so that the hold of the nooses
placed round them might surround them all.</p>

<p>12. Would any one say this about the gods who had even a very low opinion of them?
or, if they were taken up with such affairs, considerations, cares, would any man of wisdom
either believe that they are gods, or reckon them among men even? Was that Acdestis, pray,
the lopping off of whose lewd members was to give a sense of security to the immortals, was
he one of the creatures of earth, or one of the gods, and possessed of4350 immortality? For
if he was thought to be of our lot and in the condition of men, why did he cause the deities
so much terror? But if he was a god, how could he be deceived, or how could anything be
cut off from a divine body?4351 But we raise no issue on this point: he may have been of divine
birth, or one of us, if you think it more correct to say so. Did a pomegranate tree, also, spring
from the blood which flowed and from the parts which were cut off? or at the time when4352
that member was concealed in the bosom of the earth, did it lay hold of the ground with a
root, and spring up into a mighty tree, put forth branches loaded with blossoms,4353 and
in a moment bare mellow fruit perfectly and completely ripe? And because these sprang
from red blood, is their colour therefore bright purple, with a dash of yellow? Say further
that they are juicy also, that they have the taste of wine, because they spring from the blood
of one filled with it, and you have finished your story consistently. O Abdera, Abdera, what
occasions for mocking you would give4354 to men, if such a tale had been devised by you!

<p>13. Through her bosom, we are told,4356 Nana conceived a son by an apple. The opinion
is self-consistent; for where rocks and hard stones bring forth, there apples must have their
time of generating.4357 The Berecyntian goddess fed the imprisoned maiden with nuts4358
and figs, fitly and rightly; for it was right that she should live on apples who had been made
a mother by an apple. After her offspring was born, it was ordered by Sangarius to be cast
far away: that which he believed to be divinely conceived long before, he would not have4359
called the offspring of his child. The infant was brought up on he-goats’ milk. O story ever
opposed and most inimical to the male sex, in which not only do men lay aside their virile
powers, but beasts even which were males become mothers!4360 He was famous for his
beauty, and distinguished by his remarkable4361 comeliness. It is wonderful enough that
the noisome stench of goats did not cause him to be avoided and fled from. The Great
Mother loved him—if as a grandmother her grandson, there is nothing wrong; but if as the
theatres tell, her love is infamous and disgraceful. Acdestis, too, loved him above all, enriching
him with a hunter’s gifts. There could be no danger to his purity from one emasculated, you
say; but it is not easy to guess what Midas dreaded? The Mother entered bearing4362 the
very walls. Here we wondered, indeed, at the might and strength of the deity; but again4363we
blame her carelessness, because when she remembered the decree of fate,4364 she heedlessly
laid open the city to its enemies. Acdestis cites to fury and madness those celebrating the
nuptial vows. If King Midas had displeased him who was binding the youth to a wife, of
what had Gallus been guilty, and his concubine’s daughter, that he should rob himself of
his manhood, she herself of her breasts? “Take and keep these,” says he,4365 “because of
which you have excited such commotions to the overwhelming of our minds with fear.” We
should none of us yet know what the frenzied Acdestis had desired in his paramour’s body,

<p>14. What say you, O races and nations, given up to such beliefs? When these things are
brought forward, are you not ashamed and confounded to say things so indecent? We wish
to hear or learn from you something befitting the gods; but you, on the contrary, bring
forward to us the cutting off of breasts, the lopping off of men’s members, ragings, blood,
frenzies, the self-destruction of maidens, and flowers and trees begotten from the blood of
the dead. Say, again, did the mother of the gods, then, with careful diligence herself gather
in her grief the scattered genitals with the shed blood?4367 With her own sacred, her own
divine4368 hands, did she touch and lift up the instruments of a disgraceful and indecent
office? Did she also commit them to the earth to be hid from sight; and lest in this case they
should, being uncovered, be dispersed in the bosom of the earth, did she indeed wash and
anoint them with fragrant gums before wrapping and covering them with his dress? For
whence could the violet’s sweet scent have come had not the addition of those ointments
modified the putrefying smell of the member? Pray, when you read such tales, do you not
seem to yourselves to hear either girls at the loom wiling away their tedious working hours,
or old women seeking diversions for credulous children,4369 and to be declaring manifold
fictions under the guise of truth? Acdestis appealed to4370 Jupiter to restore life to his
paramour: Jupiter would not consent, because he was hindered by the fates more powerful
than himself; and that he might not be in every respect very hard-hearted, he granted one
favour—that the body should not decay through any corruption; that the hair should always
grow; that the least of his fingers alone in his body should live, alone keep always in motion.
Would any one grant this, or support it with an unhesitating assent, that hair grows on a

<p>15. We might long ago have urged you to ponder this, were it not foolish to ask proofs
of such things, as well as to say4372 them. But this story is false, and is wholly untrue. It is
no matter to us, indeed, because of whom you maintain that the gods have been driven from
the earth, whether it is consistent and rests on a sure foundation,4373 or is, on the contrary,
framed and devised in utter falsehood. For to us it is enough—who have proposed this day
to make it plain—that those deities whom you bring for ward, if they are anywhere on earth,
and glow with the fires of anger, are not more excited to furious hatred by us than by you;
and that that story, has been classed as an event and committed to writing by you, and is
willingly read over by you every day, and handed down in order for the edifying of later
times. Now, if this story is indeed true, we see that there is no reason in it why the celestial
gods should be asserted to be angry with us, since we have neither declared things so much
to their disgrace, nor committed them to writing at all, nor brought them publicly to light4374
by the celebration of sacred rites; but if, as you think, it is untrue, and made up of delusive
falsehoods, no man can doubt that you are the cause of offence, who have either allowed

you celebrate throughout the year testify that you believe these things to be true, and consider
them perfectly trustworthy? For what is the meaning of that pine4375 which on fixed days
you always bring into the sanctuary of the mother of the gods? Is it not in imitation of that
tree, beneath which the raging and ill-fated youth laid hands upon himself, and which the
parent of the gods consecrated to relieve her sorrow?4376 What mean the fleeces of wool
with which you bind and surround the trunk of the tree? Is it not to recall the wools with
which Ia4377 covered the dying youth, and thought that she could procure some warmth
for his limbs fast stiffening with cold? What mean the branches of the tree girt round and
decked with wreaths of violets? Do they not mark this, how the Mother adorned with early
flowers the pine which indicates and bears witness to the sad mishap? What mean the
Galli4378 with dishevelled hair beating their breasts with their palms? Do they not recall to
memory those lamentations with which the tower-bearing Mother, along with the weeping
Acdestis, wailing aloud,4379 followed the boy? What means the abstinence from eating bread
which you have named castus? Is it not in imitation of the time when the goddess abstained
from Ceres’ fruit in her vehement sorrow?</p>

that we should in like manner hunt up the other forms of baseness, whether those which
the histories of antiquity record, or those contained in the sacred mysteries named initia,4382

Let us pass by Fauna4385 Fatua, therefore, who is called Bona Dea, whom Sextus
Clodius, in his sixth book in Greek on the gods, declares to have been scourged to death
with rods of myrtle, because she drank a whole jar of wine without her husband’s knowledge;
and this is a proof, that when women show her divine honour a jar of wine is placed there,
but covered from sight, and that it is not lawful to bring in twigs of myrtle, as Butas4386
mentions in his Causalia. But let us pass by with similar neglect4387 the dii conserentes,
whom Flaccus and others relate to have buried themselves, changed in humani penis similitudinem
in the cinders under a pot of exta.4388 And when Tanaquil, skilled in the arts of
Etruria,4389 disturbed these, the gods erected themselves, and became rigid. She then commanded
a captive woman from Corniculum to learn and understand what was the meaning
of this: Ocrisia, a woman of the greatest wisdom divos inseruisse genitali, explicuisse motus

in which with seeming frenzy and the loss of your senses you twine snakes about you; and,
to show yourselves full of the divinity and majesty of the god, tear in pieces with gory mouths
the flesh of loudly-bleating goats. Those hidden mysteries of Cyprian Venus we pass by also,
whose founder is said to have been King Cinyras,4391 in which being initiated, they bring
stated fees as to a harlot, and carry away phalli, given as signs of the propitious deity. Let
the rites of the Corybantes also be consigned to oblivion, in which is revealed that sacred
mystery, a brother slain by his brothers, parsley sprung from the blood of the murdered
one, that vegetable forbidden to be placed on tables, lest the manes of the dead should be
unappeasably offended. But those other Bacchanalia also we refuse to proclaim, in which
there is revealed and taught to the initiated a secret not to be spoken; how Liber, when taken
up with boyish sports, was torn asunder by the Titans; how he was cut up limb by limb by
them also, and thrown into pots that he might be cooked; how Jupiter, allured by the sweet
savour, rushed unbidden to the meal, and discovering what had been done, overwhelmed
the revellers with his terrible thunder, and hurled them to the lowest part of Tartarus. As

by them, would not suffer us to pass cursorily by the wrongs and insults offered to him; not
that we feel any pleasure in discussing4393 mysteries so filthy, but that it may be made clear
to you again and again what wrong you heap upon those whose guardians, champions,
worshippers, you profess to be. Once upon a time, they say, Diespiter, burning after his
mother Ceres with evil passions and forbidden desires, for she is said by the natives of that
district to be Jupiter’s mother, and yet not daring to seek by open4394 force that for which
he had conceived a shameless longing, hits upon a clever trick by which to rob of her chastity
his mother, who feared nothing of the sort. Instead of a god, he becomes a bull; and concealing
his purpose and daring under the appearance of a beast lying in wait,4395 he rushes

<p>21. Jupiter is troubled enough, being overwhelmed with fear, and cannot find means to
soothe the rage of his violated mother. He pours forth prayers, and makes supplication; her
ears are closed by grief. The whole order of the gods is sent to seek his pardon; no one has
weight enough to win a hearing. At last, the son seeking how to make satisfaction, devises
this means: Arietem nobilem bene grandibus cum testiculis deligit, exsecat hos ipse et lanato
exuit ex folliculi tegmine. Approaching his mother sadly and with downcast looks, and as if
by his own decision he had condemned himself, he casts and throws these4398 into her
bosom. When she saw what his pledge was,4399 she is somewhat softened, and allows herself
to be recalled to the care of the offspring which she had conceived.4400 After the tenth month
she bears a daughter, of beautiful form, whom later ages have called now Libera, now
Proserpine; whom when Jupiter Verveceus4401 saw to be strong, plump, and blooming,
forgetting what evils and what wickedness, and how great recklessness, he had a little before
fallen into,4402 he returns to his former practices; and because it seemed too4403 wicked that
a father openly be joined as in marriage with his daughter, he passes into the terrible form
of a dragon: he winds his huge coils round the terrified maiden, and under a fierce appearance
sports and caresses her in softest embraces. She, too, is in consequence filled with the seed
of the most powerful Jupiter, but not as her mother was, for she4404 bore a daughter like
herself; but from the maiden was born something like a bull, to testify to her seduction by
Jupiter. If any one asks4405 who narrates this, then we shall quote the well-known senarian
verse of a Tarentine poet which antiquity sings,4406 saying: “The bull begot a dragon, and
the dragon a bull.” Lastly, the sacred rites themselves, and the ceremony of initiation even,
named Sebadia,4407 might attest the truth; for in them a golden snake is let down into the
bosom of the initiated, and taken away again from the lower parts.</p>

<p>22. I do not think it necessary here also with many words to go through each part, and
show how many base and unseemly things there are in each particular. For what mortal is
there, with but little sense even of what becomes a man, who does not himself see clearly
the character of all these things, how wicked they are, how vile, and what disgrace is brought
upon the gods by the very ceremonies of their mysteries, and by the unseemly origin of their
rites? Jupiter, it is said, lusted after Ceres. Why, I ask, has Jupiter deserved so ill of you, that
there is no kind of disgrace, no infamous adultery, which you do not heap upon his head,
as if on some vile and worthless person? Leda was unfaithful to her nuptial vow; Jupiter is
said to be the cause of the fault. Danae could not keep her virginity; the theft is said to have
been Jupiter’s. Europa hastened to the name of woman; he is again declared to have been
the assailant of her chastity. Alcmena, Electra, Latona, Laodamia, a thousand other virgins,
and a thousand matrons, and with them the boy Catamitus, were robbed of their honour
and4408 chastity. It is the same story everywhere—Jupiter. Nor is there any kind of baseness
in which you do not join and associate his name with passionate lusts; so that the wretched
being seems to have been born for no other reason at all except that he might be a field fertile
in4409 crimes, an occasion of evil-speaking, a kind of open place into which should gather
all filthiness from the impurities of the stage.4410 And yet if you were to say that he had intercourse
with strange women, it would indeed be impious, but the wrong done in
slandering him might be bearable. Did he lust4411 after his mother also, after his daughter
too, with furious desires; and could no sacredness in his parent, no reverence for her, no
shrinking even from the child which had sprung from himself, withhold him from conceiving
so detestable a plan?</p>

<p>23. I should wish, therefore, to see Jupiter, the father of the gods, who ever controls the
world and men,4412 adorned with the horns of an ox, shaking his hairy ears, with his feet
contracted into hoofs, chewing green grass, and having behind him4413 a tail, hams,4414
and ankles smeared over with soft excrement,4415 and bedaubed with the filth cast forth. I
should wish, I say,—for it must be said over and over again,—to see him who turns the stars
in their courses, and who terrifies and overthrows nations pale with fear, pursuing the flocks
of wethers, inspicientem testiculos aretinos, snatching these away with that severe4416 and
divine hand with which he was wont to launch the gleaming lightnings and to hurl in his
rage the thunderbolt.4417 Then, indeed, I should like to see him ransacking their inmost
parts with glowing knife;4418 and all witnesses being removed, tearing away the membranes
circumjectas prolibus, and bringing them to his mother, still hot with rage, as a kind of fillet4419
to draw forth her pity, with downcast countenance, pale, wounded,4420 pretending
to be in agony; and to make this believed, defiled with the blood of the ram, and covering
his pretended wound with bands of wool and linen. Is it possible that this can be heard and
read in this world,4421 and that those who discuss these things wish themselves to be thought
pious, holy, and defenders of religion? Is there any greater sacrilege than this, or can any
mind4422 be found so imbued with impious ideas as to believe such stories, or receive them,
or hand them down in the most secret mysteries of the sacred rites? If that Jupiter of whom

<p>24. But, my opponent says, these are not the rites of our state. Who, pray, says this, or
who repeats it? Is he Roman, Gaul, Spaniard, African, German, or Sicilian? And what does
it avail your cause if these stories are not yours, while those who compose them are on your
side? Or of what importance is it whether you approve of them or not, since what you
yourselves say4426 are found to be either just as foul, or of even greater baseness? For do
you wish that we should consider the mysteries and those ceremonies which are named by
the Greeks Thesmophoria,4427 in which those holy vigils and solemn watchings were consecrated
to the goddess by the Athenians? Do you wish us, I say, to see what beginnings they
have, what causes, that we may prove that Athens itself also, distinguished in the arts and
pursuits of civilization, says things as insulting to the gods as others, and that stories are
there publicly related under the mask of religion just as disgraceful as are thrown in our way
by the rest of you? Once, they say, when Proserpine, not yet a woman and still a maiden,
was gathering purple flowers in the meadows of Sicily, and when her eagerness to gather
them was leading her hither and thither in all directions, the king of the shades, springing
forth through an opening of unknown depth, seizes and bears away with him the maiden,
and conceals himself again in the bowels4428 of the earth. Now when Ceres did not know
what had happened, and had no idea where in the world her daughter was, she set herself
to seek the lost one all over the4429 world. She snatches up two torches lit at the fires of
<note type="footnote">4426 Lit., “what are your proper things.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4427 Every one since Salmasius (ad solinum, p. 750) has supposed Arnobius to have here fallen into a gross
error, by confounding the Eleusinian mysteries with the Thesmophoria; an error the less accountable, because
they are carefully distinguished by Clemens Alexandrinus, whom Arnobius evidently had before him, as usual.
There seems to be no sufficient reason, however, for charging Arnobius with such a blunder, although in the
end of ch. 26 he refers to the story just related as showing the base character of the Eleusinia (Eleusiniorum
vestrorum notas); as he here speaks of mysteria(i.e., Eleusinia, cf. Nepos, Alc., 3, 16) et illa divina quæ Thesmophoria
nominantur a Græcis. It should be remembered also that there was much in common between these
mysteries: the story of Ceres’ wanderings was the subject of both; in both there was a season of fasting to recall
her sadness; both had indecent allusions to the way in which that sadness was dispelled; and both celebrated
with some freedom the recovery of cheerfulness by the goddess, the great distinguishing feature of the Thesmophoria
being that only women could take part in its rites. Now, as it is to the points in which the two sets of
mysteries were at one that allusion is made in the passage which follows, it was only natural that Arnobius should
not be very careful to distinguish the one from the other, seeing that he was concerned not with their differences,
but with their coincidence. It seems difficult, therefore, to maintain that Arnobius has here convicted himself
of so utter ignorance and so gross carelessness as his critics have imagined. [Vol. ii. p. 176.]</note>

<p>25. In her wanderings on that quest, she reaches the confines of Eleusis as well as other
countries4431—that is the name of a canton in Attica. At that time these parts were inhabited
by aborigines4432 named Baubo, Triptolemus, Eubuleus, Eumolpus,4433 Dysaules:
Triptolemus, who yoked oxen; Dysaules, a keeper of goats; Eubuleus, of swine; Eumolpus,
of sheep,4434 from whom also flows the race of Eumolpidæ, and from whom is derived that
name famous among the Athenians,4435 and those who afterwards flourished as caduceatores,
4436 hierophants, and criers. So, then, that Baubo who, we have said, dwelt in
the canton of Eleusis, receives hospitably Ceres, worn out with ills of many kinds, hangs
about her with pleasing attentions, beseeches her not to neglect to refresh her body, brings
to quench her thirst wine thickened with spelt,4437 which the Greeks term cyceon. The
goddess in her sorrow turns away from the kindly offered services,4438 and rejects them;
nor does her misfortune suffer her to remember what the body always requires.4439 Baubo,
on the other hand, begs and exhorts her—as is usual in such calamities—not to despise her
humanity; Ceres remains utterly immoveable, and tenaciously maintains an invincible
austerity. But when this was done several times, and her fixed purpose could not be worn
out by any attentions, Baubo changes her plans, and determines to make merry by strange
jests her whom she could not win by earnestness. That part of the body by which women
both bear children and obtain the name of mothers,4440 this she frees from longer neglect:
she makes it assume a purer appearance, and become smooth like a child, not yet hard and
rough with hair. In this wise she returns4441 to the sorrowing goddess; and while trying the
common expedients by which it is usual to break the force of grief, and moderate it, she
uncovers herself, and baring her groins, displays all the parts which decency hides;4442 and
then the goddess fixes her eyes upon these,4443 and is pleased with the strange form of

hooks of the Thracian soothsayer,4444 which you speak of as of divine antiquity; and he will
find that we are neither cunningly inventing anything, nor seeking means to bring the
holiness of the gods into ridicule, and doing so: for we shall bring forward the very verses
which the son of Calliope uttered in Greek,4445 and published abroad in his songs to the
human race throughout all ages:—

<l>And exposed to view formatas inguinibus res,</l>
<l>Which Baubo grasping4446 with hollow hand, for</l>
<l>Their appearance was infantile, strikes, touches gently.</l>
<l>Then the goddess, fixing her orbs of august light,</l>
<l>Being softened, lays aside for a little the sadness of her mind;</l>

because, like the poets of that age, he paid little heed to questions of quantity. Whether Arnobius has merely

it is done. Whoever is ignorant of this, let him learn, and, wondering at what is so important,
ever keep it with reverent care in a pure heart.4463 While Liber, born at Nysa,4464 and son
of Semele, was still among men, the story goes, he wished to become acquainted with the
shades below, and to inquire into what went on in Tartarus; but this wish was hindered by
some difficulties, because, from ignorance of the route, he did not know by what way to go
and proceed. One Prosumnus starts up, a base lover of the god, and a fellow too prone to
wicked lusts, who promises to point out the gate of Dis, and the approaches to Acheron, if
the god will gratify him, and suffer uxorias voluptates ex se carpi. The god, without reluctance,
swears to put himself4465 in his power and at his disposal, but only immediately on his return
from the lower regions, having obtained his wish and desire.4466 Prosumnus politely tells
him the way, and sets him on the very threshold of the lower regions. In the meantime,
while Liber is inspecting4467 and examining carefully Styx, Cerberus, the Furies, and all
other things, the informer passed from the number of the living, and was buried according
to the manner of men. Evius4468 comes up from the lower regions, and learns that his guide

<p>29. Now, to prevent any one from thinking that we have devised what is so impious, we
do not call upon him to believe Heraclitus as a witness, nor to receive from his account what
he felt about such mysteries. Let him4469 ask the whole of Greece what is the meaning of
these phalli which ancient custom erects and worships throughout the country, throughout
the towns: he will find that the causes are those which we say; or if they are ashamed to declare
the truth honestly, of what avail will it be to obscure, to conceal the cause and origin of the
rite, while4470 the accusation holds good against the very act of worship? What say you, O
peoples? what, ye nations busied with the services of the temples, and given up to them? Is
it to these rites you drive us by flames, banishment, slaughter, and any other kind of punishments,
and by fear of cruel torture? Are these the gods whom you bring to us, whom you
thrust and impose upon us, like whom you would neither wish yourselves to be, nor any
one related to you by blood and friendship?4471 Can you declare to your beardless sons, still
wearing the dress of boys, the agreements which Liber formed with his lovers? Can you urge
your daughters-in-law, nay, even your own wives, to show the modesty of Baubo, and enjoy
the chaste pleasures of Ceres? Do you wish your young men to know, hear, and learn what
even Jupiter showed himself to more matrons than one? Would you wish your grown-up
maidens and still lusty fathers to learn how the same deity sported with his daughter? Do
you wish full brothers, already hot with passion, and sisters sprung from the same parents,
to hear that he again did not spurn the embraces, the couch of his sister? Should we not
then flee far from such gods; and should not our ears be stopped altogether, that the filthiness
of so impure a religion may not creep into the mind? For what man is there who has been
reared with morals so pure, that the example of the gods does not excite him to similar
madness? or who can keep back his desires from his kinsfolk, and those of whom he should
stand in awe, when he sees that among the gods above nothing is held sacred in the confusion
caused by4472 their lusts? For when it is certain that the first and perfect nature has not been
able to restrain its passion within right limits, why should not man give himself up to his
desires without distinction, being both borne on headlong by his innate frailty, and aided
by the teaching of the holy deities?4473</p>

been accustomed to wonder that you dare to speak of those as atheists,4474 impious, sacrilegious,
who either deny that there are any gods at all, or doubt their existence, or assert that
they were men, and have been numbered among the gods for the sake of some power and
good desert; since, if a true examination be made, it is fitting that none should be called by
such names, more than yourselves, who, under the pretence of showing them reverence,
heap up in so doing4475 more abuse and accusation, than if you had conceived the idea of
doing this openly with avowed abuse. He who doubts the existence of the gods, or denies it
altogether, although he may seem to adopt monstrous opinions from the audacity of his
conjectures, yet refuses to credit what is obscure without insulting any one; and he who asserts
that they were mortals, although he brings them down from the exalted place of inhabitants
of heaven, yet heaps upon them other4476 honours, since he supposes that they have been

with your abuse? or is there any kind of insult so damnable in the eyes of all, that you have
been afraid to use it upon them, even though hindered4479 by the dignity of their name?
Who declared that the gods loved frail and mortal bodies? was it not you? Who that they
perpetrated those most charming thefts on the couches of others? was it not you? Who that
children had intercourse with their mothers; and on the other hand, fathers with their virgin
daughters? was it not you? Who that pretty boys, and even grown-up men of very fine appearance,
were wrongfully lusted after? was it not you? Who declared that they4480 were
mutilated, debauched,4481 skilled in dissimulation, thieves, held in bonds and chains, finally
assailed with thunderbolts, and wounded, that they died, and even found graves on earth?
was it not you? While, then, so many and grievous charges have been raised by you to the
injury of the gods, do you dare to assert that the gods have been displeased because of us,
while it has long been clear that you are the guilty causes of such anger, and the occasion of

<p>32. But you err, says my opponent, and are mistaken, and show, even in criticising these
things, that you are rather ignorant, unlearned, and boorish. For all those stories which
seem to you disgraceful, and tending to the discredit of the gods, contain in them holy
mysteries, theories wonderful and profound, and not such as any one can easily become
acquainted with by force of understanding. For that is not meant and said which has been
written and placed on the surface of the story; but all these things are understood in allegorical
senses, and by means of secret explanations privately supplied.4482 Therefore he who
says4483 Jupiter lay with his mother, does not mean the incestuous or shameful embraces
of Venus, but names Jupiter instead of rain, and Ceres instead of the earth. And he, again,
who says that he4484 dealt lasciviously with his daughter, speaks of no filthy pleasures, but
puts Jupiter for the name of a shower, and by his daughter means4485 the crop sown. So,
too, he who says that Proserpina was carried off by father Dis, does not say, as you suppose,
4486 that the maiden was carried off to gratify the basest desires; but because we cover
the seed with clods, he signifies that the goddess has sunk under the earth, and unites with
Orcus to bring forth fruit. In like manner in the other stories also one thing indeed is said,
but something else is understood; and under a commonplace openness of expression there
lurks a secret doctrine, and a dark profundity of mystery.</p>

<p>33. These are all quirks, as is evident, and quibbles with which they are wont to bolster
up weak cases before a jury; nay, rather, to speak more truly, they are pretences, such as are
used in4487 sophistical reasonings, by which not the truth is sought after, but always the
image, and appearance, and shadow of the truth. For because it is shameful and unbecoming
to receive as true the correct accounts, you have had recourse4488 to this expedient, that one
thing should be substituted for another, and that what was in itself shameful should, in being
explained, be forced into the semblance of decency. But what is it to us whether other senses
and other meanings underlie these vain stories? For we who assert that the gods are treated
by you wickedly and impiously, need only4489 receive what is written, what is said,4490 and
need not care as to what is kept secret, since the insult to the deities consists not in the idea
hidden in its meanings,4491 but in what is signified by the words as they stand out. And yet,
that we may not seem unwilling to examine what you say, we ask this first of you, if only
you will bear with us, from whom have you learned, or by whom has it been made known,
either that these things were written allegorically, or that they should be understood in the
same way? Did the writers summon you to take counsel with them? or did you lie hid in
their bosoms at the time4492 when they put one thing for another, without regard to truth?
Then, if they chose, from religions awe4493 and fear on any account, to wrap those mysteries
in dark obscurity, what audacity it shows in you to wish to understand what they did not
wish, to know yourselves and make all acquainted with that which they vainly attempted to

<p>34. But, agreeing with you that in all these stories stags are spoken of instead of
Iphigenias, yet, how are you sure, when you either explain or unfold these allegories, that
you give the same explanations or have the same ideas which were entertained by the writers
themselves in the silence of their thoughts, but expressed by words not adapted4494 to what
was meant, but to something else? You say that the falling of rain into the bosom of the
earth was spoken of as the union of Jupiter and Ceres; another may both devise with greater
subtlety, and conjecture with some probability, something else; a third, a fourth may do the
same; and as the characteristics of the minds of the thinkers show themselves, so each thing
may be explained in an infinite number of ways. For since all that allegory, as it is called, is
taken from narratives expressly made obscure,4495 and has no certain limit within which
the meaning of the story,4496 as it is called, should be firmly fixed and unchangeable, it is
open to every one to put the meaning into it which he pleases, and to assert that that has
been adopted4497 to which his thoughts and surmises4498 led him. But this being the case,
how can you obtain certainty from what is doubtful, and attach one sense only to an expression

<p>35. Finally, if you think it right, returning to our inquiry, we ask this of you, whether
you think that all stories about the gods,4500 that is, without any exception,4501 have been
written throughout with a double meaning and sense, and in a way4502 admitting of several
interpretations; or that some parts of them are not ambiguous at all, while, on the contrary,
others have many meanings, and are enveloped in the veil of allegory which has been thrown
round them? For if the whole structure and arrangement of the narrative have been surrounded
with a veil of allegory from beginning to end, explain to us, tell us, what we should put
and substitute for each thing which every story says, and to what other things and meanings
we should refer4503 each. For as, to take an example, you wish Jupiter to be said instead of
the rain, Ceres for the earth, and for Libera4504 and father Dis the sinking and casting of
seed into the earth, so you ought to say what we should understand for the bull, what for
the wrath and anger of Ceres; what the word Brimo4505 means; what the anxious prayer of
Jupiter; what the gods sent to make intercession for him, but not listened to; what the castrated
ram; what the parts4506 of the castrated ram; what the satisfaction made with these;
what the further dealings with his daughter, still more unseemly in their lustfulness; so, in
the other story also, what the grove and flowers of Henna are; what the fire taken from Ætna,
and the torches lit with it; what the travelling through the world with these; what the Attic
country, the canton of Eleusin, the hut of Baubo, and her rustic hospitality; what the drought
of cyceon4507means, the refusal of it, the shaving and disclosure of the privy parts, the
shameful charm of the sight, and the forgetfulness of her bereavement produced by such
means. Now, if you point out what should be put in the place of all these, changing the one
for the other,4508 we shall admit your assertion; but if you can neither present another
supposition in each case, nor appeal to4509 the context as a whole, why do you make that

<p>36. But you will perhaps say that these allegories are not found in the whole body of the
story, but that some parts are written so as to be understood by all, while others have a
double meaning, and are veiled in ambiguity. That is refined subtlety, and can be seen
through by the dullest. For because it is very difficult for you to transpose, reverse, and divert
to other meanings all that has been said, you choose out some things which suit your purpose,
and by means of these you strive to maintain that false and spurious versions were thrown
about the truth which is under them.4511 But yet, supposing that we should grant to you
that it is just as you say, how do you know, or whence do you learn, which part of the story
is written without any double meaning,4512 which, on the other hand, has been covered
with jarring and alien senses? For it may be that what you believe to be so4513 is otherwise,
that what you believe to be otherwise4514 has been produced with different, and even opposite
modes of expression. For where, in a consistent whole, one part is said to be written allegorically,
the other in plain and trustworthy language, while there is no sign in the thing itself
to point out the difference between what is said ambiguously and what is said simply, that
which is simple may as well be thought to have a double meaning, as what has been written
ambiguously be believed to be wrapt in obscurity.4515 But, indeed, we confess that we do

<pb n="1227"/>
<p>37. Let us examine, then, what is said in this way. In the grove of Henna, my opponent
says, the maiden Proserpine was once gathering flowers: this is as yet uncorrupted, and has
been told in a straightforward manner, for all know without any doubt what a grove and
flowers are, what Proserpine is, and a maiden. Summanus sprung forth from the earth,
borne along in a four-horse chariot: this, too, is just as simple, for a team of four horses, a
chariot, and Summanus need no interpreter. Suddenly he carried off Proserpine, and bore
her with himself under the earth: the burying of the seed, my opponent says, is meant by
the rape of Proserpine. What has happened, pray, that the story should be suddenly turned
to something else? that Proserpine should be called the seed? that she who was for a long
time held to be a maiden gathering flowers, after that she was taken away and carried off by
violence, should begin to signify the seed sown? Jupiter, my opponent says, having turned
himself into a bull, longed to have intercourse with his mother Ceres: as was explained before,
under these names the earth and falling rain are spoken of. I see the law of allegory expressed
in the dark and ambiguous terms. Ceres was enraged and angry, and received the parts4517
of a ram as the penalty demanded by4518 vengeance: this again I see to be expressed in
common language, for both anger and (testes and) satisfaction are spoken of in their usual
circumstances.4519 What, then, happened here,—that from Jupiter, who was named for the
rain, and Ceres, who was named for the earth, the story passed to the true Jove, and to a
most straightforward account of events?</p>

<p>38. Either, then, they must all have been written and put forward allegorically, and the
whole should be pointed out to us; or nothing has been so written, since what is supposed
to be allegorical does not seem as if it were part of the narrative.4520 These are all written
allegorically, you say. This seems by no means certain. Do you ask for what reason, for what
cause? Because, I answer, all that has taken place and has been set down distinctly in any
book cannot be turned into an allegory, for neither can that be undone which has been done,
nor can the character of an event change into one which is utterly different. Can the Trojan
war be turned into the condemnation of Socrates? or the battle of Cannæ become the cruel
proscription of Sulla? A proscription may indeed, as Tullius says4521 in jest, be spoken of
as a battle, and be called that of Cannæ; but what has already taken place, cannot be at the
same time a battle and a proscription; for neither, as I have said, can that which has taken
place be anything else than what has taken place; nor can that pass over into a substance
foreign to it which has been fixed down firmly in its own nature and peculiar condition.</p>

<p>39. Whence, then, do we prove that all these narratives are records of events? From the
solemn rites and mysteries of initiation, it is clear, whether those which are celebrated at
fixed times and on set days, or those which are taught secretly by the heathen without allowing
the observance of their usages to be interrupted. For it is not to be believed that these
have no origin, are practised without reason or meaning, and have no causes connected
with their first beginnings. That pine which is regularly born into the sanctuary of the Great
Mother,4522 is it not in imitation of that tree beneath which Attis mutilated and unmanned
himself, which also, they relate, the goddess consecrated to relieve her grief? That erecting
of phalli and fascina, which Greece worships and celebrates in rites every year, does it not
recall the deed by which Liber4523 paid his debt? Of what do those Eleusinian mysteries and
secret rites contain a narrative? Is it not of that wandering in which Ceres, worn out in
seeking for her daughter, when she came to the confines of Attica, brought wheat with her,
graced with a hind’s skin the family of the Nebridæ4524 and laughed at that most wonderful
sight in Baubo’s groins? Or if there is another cause, that is nothing to us, so long as they
are all produced by some cause. For it is not credible that these things were set on foot
without being preceded by any causes, or the inhabitants of Attica must be considered mad
to have received4525 a religious ceremony got up without any reason. But if this is clear and
certain, that is, if the causes and origins of the mysteries are traceable to past events, by no
change can they be turned into the figures of allegory; for that which has been done, which
has taken place, cannot, in the nature of things, be undone.4526</p>

seers, do you not observe in this case, do you not see how dishonouring, how insulting to

made in the interpretation,—the intercourse of Jupiter and Ceres? and to signify the descent
of rain from the sky, and the moistening of the earth, by charges against the gods? Can
anything be either thought or believed more impious than that the rape of Proserpine speaks
of seeds buried in the earth, or anything else,—for in like manner it is of no importance,—and
that it speaks of the pursuit of agriculture to4529 the dishonour of father Dis? Is it not a
thousand times more desirable to become mute and speechless, and to lose that flow of

<p>41. It was once usual, in speaking allegorically, to conceal under perfectly decent ideas,
and clothe4531 with the respectability of decency, what was base and horrible to speak of
openly; but now venerable things are at your instance vilely spoken of, and what is quite
pure4532 is related4533 in filthy language, so that that which vice4534 formerly concealed
from shame, is now meanly and basely spoken of, the mode of speech which was fitting4535
being changed. In speaking of Mars and Venus as having been taken in adultery by Vulcan’s
art, we speak of lust, says my opponent, and anger, as restrained by the force and purpose
of reason. What, then, hindered, what prevented you from expressing each thing by the
words and terms proper to it? nay, more, what necessity was there, when you had resolved4536
to declare something or other, by means of treatises and writings, to resolve that that should
not be the meaning to which you point, and in one narrative to take up at the same time
opposite positions—the eagerness of one wishing to teach, the niggardliness of one reluctant
to make public?4537 Was there no risk in speaking of the gods as unchaste? The mention of
lust and anger, my opponent says, was likely to defile the tongue and mouth with foul contagion.
4538 But, assuredly, if this were done,4539 and the veil of allegorical obscurity were removed,
the matter would be easily understood, and by the same the dignity of the gods
would be maintained unimpaired. But now, indeed, when the restraining of vices is said to
be signified by the binding of Mars and Venus, two most inconsistent4540 things are done
at the very same time; so that, on the one hand, a description of something vile suggests an
honourable meaning, and on the other, the baseness occupies the mind before any regard

<p>42. But you will perhaps say, for this only is left which you may think4541 can be brought
forward by you, that the gods do not wish their mysteries to be known by men, and that the
narratives were therefore written with allegorical ambiguity. And whence have you
learned4542 that the gods above do not wish their mysteries to be made public? whence have
you become acquainted with these? or why are you anxious to unravel them by explaining
them as allegories? Lastly, and finally, what do the gods mean, that while they do not wish
honourable, they allow unseemly, even the basest things, to be said about them? When we
name Attis, says my opponent, we mean and speak of the sun; but if Attis is the sun, as you
reckon him and say, who will that Attis be whom your books record and declare to have
been born in Phrygia, to have suffered certain things, to have done certain things also, whom
all the theatres know in the scenic shows, to whom every year we see divine honours paid
expressly by name amongst the other religious ceremonies? Whether was this name made
to pass from the sun to a man, or from a man to the sun? For if that name is derived in the
first instance from the sun, what, pray, has the golden sun done to you, that you should
make that name to belong to him in common with an emasculated person? But if it is derived
from a goat, and is Phrygian, of what has the sire of Phaethon, the father of this light and
brightness, been guilty, that he should seem worthy to be named from a mutilated man, and
should become more venerable when designated by the name of an emasculated body?</p>

<p>44. But if you come to the conclusion that these fables have been written allegorically,
what is to be done with the rest, which we see cannot be forced into such changes of sense?
For what are we to substitute for the wrigglings4547 into which the lustful heat4548 of Semele’s
offspring forced him upon the sepulchral mound? and what for those Ganymedes who were
carried off4549 and set to preside over lustful practices? what for that conversion of an ant
into which Jupiter, the greatest of the gods, contracted the outlines of his huge body?4550
what for swans and satyrs? what for golden showers, which the same seductive god put on
with perfidious guile, amusing himself by changes of form? And that we may not seem to
speak of Jupiter only, what allegories can there be in the loves of the other deities? what in
their circumstances as hired servants and slaves? what in their bonds, bereavements, lamentations?
what in their agonies, wounds, sepulchres? Now, while in this you might be held
guilty in one respect for writing in such wise about the gods, you have added to your guilt
beyond measure4551 in calling base things by the names of deities, and again in defaming
the gods by giving to them the names of infamous things. But if you believed without any
doubt4552 that they were here close at hand, or anywhere at all, fear would check you in
making mention of them, and your beliefs and unchanged thoughts should have been exactly4553
as if they were listening to you and heard your words. For among men devoted to
the services of religion, not only the gods themselves, but even the names of the gods should
be reverenced, and there should be quite as much grandeur in their names as there is in

think that they—if only they are true gods, that the same things may be said again till you
are wearied hearing them4566—should have all the virtues in perfection, should be wise,
upright, venerable,—if only our heaping upon them human honours is not a crime,—strong
in excellences within themselves, and should not give themselves4567 up to external props,
because the completeness of their unbroken bliss is made perfect; should be free from all
agitating and disturbing passions; should not burn with anger, should not be excited by any
desires; should send misfortune to none, should not find a cruel pleasure in the ills of men;
should not terrify by portents, should not show prodigies to cause fear; should not hold men
responsible and liable to be punished for the vows which they owe, nor demand expiatory
sacrifices by threatening omens; should not bring on pestilences and diseases by corrupting
the air, should not burn up the fruits with droughts; should take no part in the slaughter of
war and devastation of cities; should not wish ill to one party, and be favourable to the success
of another; but, as becomes great minds, should weigh all in a just balance, and show kindness
impartially to all. For it belongs to a mortal race and human weakness to act otherwise;4568
and the maxims and declarations of wise men state distinctly, that those who are touched
by passion live a life of suffering,4569 and are weakened by grief,4570 and that it cannot be
but that those who have been given over to disquieting feelings, have been bound by the
laws of mortality. Now, since this is the case, how can we be supposed to hold the gods in

<p>3. But, we are told, we rear no temples to them, and do not worship their images; we do
not slay victims in sacrifice, we do not offer incense4571 and libations of wine. And what
greater honour or dignity can we ascribe to them, than that we put them in the same position
as the Head and Lord of the universe, to whom the gods owe it in common with us,4572 that
they are conscious that they exist, and have a living being?4573 For do we honour Him with
shrines, and by building temples?4574 Do we even slay victims to Him? Do we give Him the
other things, to take which and pour them forth in libation shows not a careful regard to
reason, but heed to a practice maintained4575 merely by usage? For it is perfect folly to
measure greater powers by your necessities, and to give the things useful to yourself to the
gods who give all things, and to think this an honour, not an insult. We ask, therefore, to
do what service to the gods, or to meet what want, do you say that temples have been
reared,4576 and think that they should be again built? Do they feel the cold of4577 winter,
or are they scorched by summer suns? Do storms of rain flow over them, or whirlwinds
shake them? Are they in danger of being exposed to the onset of enemies, or the furious attacks
of wild beasts, so that it is right and becoming to shut them up in places of security,4578

Though these, then, should be built of heaps of marble, or shine resplendent with ceilings
fretted with gold, though precious stones sparkle here, and gleam like stars set at varying
intervals, all these things are made up of earth, and of the lowest dregs of even baser matter.
For not even, if you value these more highly, is it to be believed that the gods take pleasure
in them, or that they do not refuse and scorn to shut themselves up, and be confined within
these barriers. This, my opponent says, is the temple of Mars, this that of Juno and of Venus,
this that of Hercules, of Apollo, of Dis. What is this but to say this is the house of Mars, this
of Juno and Venus,4584 Apollo dwells here, in this abides Hercules, in that Summanus? Is
it not, then, the very4585 greatest affront to hold the gods kept fast4586 in habitations, to give
to them little huts, to build lockfast places and cells, and to think that the things are4587

<p>4. But, says my opponent, it is not for this reason that we assign temples to the gods as
though we wished to ward off from them drenching storms of rain, winds, showers, or the
rays of the sun; but in order that we may be able to see them in person and close at hand,
to come near and address them, and impart to them, when in a measure present, the expressions
of our reverent feelings. For if they are invoked under the open heaven, and the canopy
of ether, they hear nothing, I suppose; and unless prayers are addressed to them near at hand,
they will stand deaf and immoveable as if nothing were said. And yet we think that every
god whatever—if only he has the power of this name—should hear what every one said
from every part of the world, just as if he were present; nay, more, should foresee, without
waiting to be told4588 what every one conceived in his secret and silent4589 thoughts. And
as the stars, the sun, the moon, while they wander above the earth, are steadily and everywhere
in sight of all those who gaze at them without any exception; so, too,4590 it is fitting that the
ears of the gods should be closed against no tongue, and should be ever within reach, although
voices should flow together to them from widely separated regions. For this it is that belongs
specially to the gods,—to fill all things with their power, to be not partly at any place, but
all everywhere, not to go to dine with the Æthiopians, and return after twelve days to their
own dwellings.4591</p>

whether you are heard4592 by the gods or not, if ever you perform the sacred rites with due
ceremonies. For, to make it clear,4593 let us suppose that there is a temple of some deity in
the Canary Islands, another of the same deity in remotest Thyle, also among the Seres, among
the tawny Garamantes, and any others4594 who are debarred from knowing each other by
seas, mountains, forests, and the four quarters of the world. If they all at one time beg of the
deity with sacrifices what their wants compel each one to think about,4595 what hope, pray,
will there be to all of obtaining the benefit, if the god does not hear the cry sent up to him
everywhere, and if there shall be any distance to which the words of the suppliant for help
cannot penetrate? For either he will be nowhere present, if he may at times not be anywhere,
4596 or he will be at one place only, since he cannot give his attention generally, and
without making any distinction. And thus it is brought about, that either the god helps none
at all, if being busy with something he has been unable to hasten to give ear to their cries,
or one only goes away with his prayers heard, while the rest have effected nothing.</p>

<p>6. What can you say as to this, that it is attested by the writings of authors, that many
of these temples which have been raised with golden domes and lofty roofs cover bones and
ashes, and are sepulchres of the dead? Is it not plain and manifest, either that you worship
dead men for immortal gods, or that an inexpiable affront is cast upon the deities, whose
shrines and temples have been built over the tombs of the dead? Antiochus,4597 in the ninth
book of his Histories, relates that Cecrops was buried in the temple of Minerva,4598 at Athens;
again, in the temple of the same goddess, which is in the citadel of Larissa,4599 it is related
and declared that Acrisius was laid, and in the sanctuary of Polias,4600 Erichthonius; while
the brothers Dairas and Immarnachus were buried in the enclosure of Eleusin, which lies
near the city. What say you as to the virgin daughters of Celeus? are they not said to be
buried4601 in the temple of Ceres at Eleusin? and in the shrine of Diana, which was set up
in the temple of the Delian Apollo, are not Hyperoche and Laodice buried, who are said to
have been brought thither from the country of the Hyperboreans? In the Milesian
Didymæon,4602 Leandrius says that Cleochus had the last honours of burial paid to him.
Zeno of Myndus openly relates that the monument of Leucophryne is in the sanctuary of
Diana at Magnesia. Under the altar of Apollo, which is seen in the city of Telmessus, is it
not invariably declared by writings that the prophet Telmessus lies buried? Ptolemæus, the
son of Agesarchus, in the first book of the History of Philopator4603 which he published,
affirms, on the authority of literature, that Cinyras, king of Paphos, was interred in the
temple of Venus with all his family, nay, more, with all his stock. It would be4604 an endless

to be unwilling to make this public—what was done with his head when cut off, or in what
place it was shut up, and the whole affair carefully concealed, in order that the omen which
the gods had attested might stand without interruption,4614 unalterable, and sure. Now,
while it was proper that this story should be suppressed, and concealed, and forgotten in
the lapse of time, the composition of the name published it, and, by a testimony which could
not be got rid of, caused it to remain in men’s minds, together with its causes, so long as it
endured itself;4615 and the state which is greatest of all, and worships all deities, did not
blush in giving a name to the temple, to name it from the head of Olus4616 Capitolium rather
than from the name of Jupiter.</p>

<p>8. We have therefore—as I suppose—shown sufficiently, that to the immortal gods
temples have been either reared in vain, or built in consequence of insulting opinions held
to their dishonour and to the belittling4617 of the power believed to be in their hands. We
have next to say something about statues and images, which you form with much skill, and
tend with religious care,—wherein if there is any credibility, we can by no amount of consideration
settle in our own minds whether you do this in earnest and with a serious purpose,
or amuse yourselves in childish dreams by mocking at these very things.4618 For if you are
assured that the gods exist whom you suppose, and that they live in the highest regions of
heaven, what cause, what reason, is there that those images should be fashioned by you,
when you have true beings to whom you may pour forth prayers, and from whom you may
ask help in trying circumstances? But if, on the contrary, you do not believe, or, to speak
with moderation, are in doubt, in this case, also, what reason is there, pray, to fashion and
set up images of doubtful beings, and to form4619 with vain imitation what you do not believe
to exist? Do you perchance say, that under these images of deities there is displayed to you
their presence, as it were, and that, because it has not been given you to see the gods, they
are worshipped in this fashion,4620 and the duties owed to them paid? He who says and asserts
this, does not believe that the gods exist; and he is proved not to put faith in his own religion,
to whom it is necessary to see what he may hold, lest that which being obscure is not seen,
may happen to be vain.</p>

<p>9. We worship the gods, you say, by means of images.4621 What then? Without these,
do the gods not know that they are worshipped, and will they not think that any honour is
shown to them by you? Through bypaths, as it were, then, and by assignments to a third
party,4622 as they are called, they receive and accept your services; and before those to whom
that service is owed experience it, you first sacrifice to images, and transmit, as it were, some
remnants to them at the pleasure of others.4623 And what greater wrong, disgrace, hardship,
can be inflicted than to acknowledge one god, and yet make supplication to something
else—to hope for help from a deity, and pray to an image without feeling? Is not this, I pray
you, that which is said in the common proverbs: “to cut down the smith when you strike at
the fuller;”4624 “and when you seek a man’s advice, to require of asses and pigs their opinions
as to what should be done?”</p>

<p>10. And whence, finally, do you know whether all these images which you form and put
in the place of4625 the immortal gods reproduce and bear a resemblance to the gods? For it
may happen that in heaven one has a beard who by you is represented4626 with smooth
cheeks; that another is rather advanced in years to whom you give the appearance of a
youth;4627 that here he is fair, with blue eyes,4628 who really has grey ones; that he has distended
nostrils whom you make and form with a high nose. For it is not right to call or
name that an image which does not derive from the face of the original features like it;
which4629 can be recognised to be clear and certain from things which are manifest. For
while all we men see that the sun is perfectly round by our eyesight, which cannot be doubted,
you have given4630 to him the features of a man, and of mortal bodies. The moon is always
in motion, and in its restoration every month puts on thirty faces:4631 with you, as leaders
and designers, that is represented as a woman, and has one countenance, which passes
through a thousand different states, changing each day.4632 We understand that all the
winds are only a flow of air driven and impelled in mundane ways: in your hands they
take4633 the forms of men filling with breath twisted trumpets by blasts from out their
breasts.4634 Among the representations of your gods we see that there is the very stern face
of a lion4635 smeared with pure vermilion, and that it is named Frugifer. If all these images

<note type="footnote">4642 It is worthy of notice that although in this passage, as often elsewhere, Arnobius adheres pretty closely
to the argument proposed by Clemens Alexandrinus, he even in such passages sometimes differs from it, and
not at random. Thus Clement speaks merely of a “stone,” and Arnobius of an “unshaped stone.” The former
expression harmonizes with the words of Maximus Tyrius (Serm., xxxviii. p. 225, Steph.), “The Arabians worship
I know not whom, but the image which I saw was a square stone;” while Suidas (Küster’s ed., s.v. θεὺς ῎Αρης)
agrees with Arnobius in calling it a “stone, black, square, unfashioned” (ἀτύπωτος). This is the more noteworthy,

<p>12. From such causes as these this also has followed, with your connivance, that the
wanton fancy of artists has found full scope in representing the bodies of the gods, and giving
forms to them, at which even the sternest might laugh. And so Hammon is even now formed
and represented with a ram’s horns; Saturn with his crooked sickle, like some guardian of
the fields, and pruner of too luxuriant branches; the son of Maia with a broad-brimmed
travelling cap, as if he were preparing to take the road, and avoiding the sun’s rays and the
dust; Liber with tender limbs, and with a woman’s perfectly free and easily flowing lines of
body;4651 Venus, naked and unclothed, just as if you said that she exposed publicly, and
sold to all comers,4652 the beauty of her prostituted body; Vulcan with his cap and hammer,
but with his right hand free, and with his dress girt up as a workman prepares4653 for his
work; the Delian god with a plectrum and lyre, gesticulating like a player on the cithern and
an actor about to sing; the king of the sea with his trident, just as if he had to fight in the
gladiatorial contest: nor can any figure of any deity be found4654 which does not have certain
characteristics4655 bestowed on it by the generosity of its makers. Lo, if some witty and
cunning king were to remove the Sun from his place before the gate4656 and transfer him to
that of Mercury, and again were to carry off Mercury and make him migrate to the shrine
of the Sun,—for both are made beardless by you, and with smooth faces,—and to give to
this one rays of light to place a little cap4657 on the Sun’s head, how will you be able to distinguish
between them, whether this is the Sun, or that Mercury, since dress, not the peculiar
appearance of the face, usually points out the gods to you? Again, if, having transported
them in like manner, he were to take away his horns from the unclad Jupiter, and fix them
upon the temples of Mars, and to strip Mars of his arms, and, on the other hand, invest
Hammon with them, what distinction can there be between them, since he who had been
Jupiter can be also supposed to be Mars, and he who had been Mavors can assume the appearance
of Jupiter Hammon? To such an extent is there wantonness in fashioning those
images and consecrating names, as if they were peculiar to them; since, if you take away
their dress, the means of recognising each is put an end to, god may be believed to be god,
one may seem to be the other, nay, more, both may be considered both!</p>

<p>13. But why do I laugh at the sickles and tridents which have been given to the gods?
why at the horns, hammers, and caps, when I know that certain images have4658 the forms
of certain men, and the features of notorious courtesans? For who is there that does not
know that the Athenians formed the Hermæ in the likeness of Alcibiades? Who does not
know—if he read Posidippus over again—that Praxiteles, putting forth his utmost skill,4659
fashioned the face of the Cnidian Venus on the model of the courtesan Gratina, whom the
unhappy man loved desperately? But is this the only Venus to whom there has been given
beauty taken from a harlot’s face? Phryne,4660 the well-known native of Thespia—as those
who have written on Thespian affairs relate—when she was at the height of her beauty,
comeliness, and youthful vigour, is said to have been the model of all the Venuses which
are held in esteem, whether throughout the cities of Greece or here,4661 whither has flowed
the longing and eager desire for such figures. All the artists, therefore, who lived at that time,
and to whom truth gave the greatest ability to portray likenesses, vied in transferring with
all painstaking and zeal the outline of a prostitute to the images of the Cytherean. The
beautiful thoughts4662 of the artists were full of fire; and they strove each to excel the other
with emulous rivalry, not that Venus might become more august, but that Phryne4663 might
stand for Venus. And so it was brought to this, that sacred honours were offered to courtesans
instead of the immortal gods, and an unhappy system of worship was led astray by the
making of statues.4664 That well-known and4665 most distinguished statuary, Phidias, when

forming those little images, adoring them as gods, heaping upon them the divine virtues,
when we see that the artists themselves find amusement in fashioning them, and set them
up as monuments of their own lusts! For what reason is there, if you should inquire, why
Phidias should hesitate to amuse himself, and be wanton when he knew that, but a little
before, the very Jupiter which he had made was gold, stones, and ivory,4668 formless, separated,
confused, and that it was he himself who brought all these together and bound them

Dispel the darkness now, and, returning to the light of the mind, look more closely
and see what that is which is going on, if only you retain your right,4674 and are not beyond
the reach4675 of the reason and prudence given to you.4676 Those images which fill you with
terror, and which you adore prostrate upon the ground4677 in all the temples, are bones,
stones, brass, silver, gold, clay, wood taken from a tree, or glue mixed with gypsum. Having
been heaped together, it may be, from a harlot’s gauds or from a woman’s4678 ornaments,
from camels’ bones or from the tooth of the Indian beast,4679 from cooking-pots and little

filed down with ordinary files, cleft and hewn with saws, with augers,4680 with axes, dug
and hollowed out by the turning of borers, and smoothed with planes. Is not this, then, an

care, to kneel down trembling in supplication to that which has been formed by you, and

the rank of celestials if they remain untouched and unwrought, but should forthwith become

forms of men, ears, noses, cheeks, lips, eyes, and eyebrows? Does the fashioning add any
newness to these bodies, so that from this addition you are compelled4686 to believe that
something divine and majestic has been united to them? Does it change copper into gold,

before were without feeling, to live and breathe?4687 If they had any natural properties previously,
4688 all these they retain4689 when built up in the bodily forms of statues. What
stupidity it is—for I refuse to call it blindness—to suppose that the natures of things are
changed by the kind of form into which they are forced, and that that receives divinity from
the appearance given to it, which in its original body has been inert, and unreasoning, and

you, men, rational beings4691 and endowed with the gift of wisdom and discretion, sink
down before pieces of baked earthenware, adore plates of copper, beg from the teeth of elephants
good health, magistracies, sovereignties, power, victories, acquisitions, gains, very
good harvests, and very rich vintages; and while it is plain and clear that you are speaking
to senseless things, you think that you are heard, and bring yourselves into disgrace of your
own accord, by vainly and credulously deceiving yourselves.4692 Oh, would that you might
enter into some statue! rather, would that you might separate4693 and break up into parts4694
those Olympian and Capitoline Jupiters, and behold all those parts alone and by themselves
which make up the whole of their bodies! You would at once see that these gods of yours,
to whom the smoothness of their exterior gives a majestic appearance by its alluring4695
brightness, are only a framework of flexible4696 plates, particles without shape joined together;
that they are kept from falling into ruin and fear of destruction, by dove-tails and clamps
and brace-irons; and that lead is run into the midst of all the hollows and where the joints
meet, and causes delay4697 useful in preserving them. You would see, I say, at once that they
have faces only without the rest of the head,4698 imperfect hands without arms, bellies and
sides in halves, incomplete feet,4699 and, which is most ridiculous, that they have been put
together without uniformity in the construction of their bodies, being in one part made of
wood, but in the other of stone. Now, indeed, if these things could not be seen through the
skill with which they were kept out of sight,4700 even those at least which lie open to all
should have taught and instructed you that you are effecting nothing, and giving your services
in vain to dead things. For, in this case,4701 do you not see that these images, which seem

<p>17. But you err, says my opponent, and are mistaken, for we do not consider either
copper, or gold and silver, or those other materials of which statues are made, to be in
themselves gods and sacred deities; but in them we worship and venerate those whom
their4708 dedication as sacred introduces and causes to dwell in statues made by workmen.
The reasoning is not vicious nor despicable by which any one—the dull, and also the most
intelligent—can believe that the gods, forsaking their proper seats—that is, heaven—do not
shrink back and avoid entering earthly habitations; nay, more, that impelled by the rite of
dedication, they are joined to images! Do your gods, then, dwell in gypsum and in figures
of earthenware? Nay, rather, are the gods the minds, spirits, and souls of figures of earthenware
and of gypsum? and, that the meanest things may be able to become of greater importance,
do they suffer themselves to be shut up and concealed and confined in4709 an obscure
abode? Here, then, in the first place, we wish and ask to be told this by you: do they do this
against their will—that is, do they enter the images as dwellings, dragged to them by the rite
of dedication—or are they ready and willing? and do you not summon them by any considerations
of necessity? Do they do this unwillingly?4710 and how can it be possible that they
should be compelled to submit to any necessity without their dignity being impaired? With
ready assent?4711 And what do the gods seek for in figures of earthenware that they should
prefer these prisons4712 to their starry seats,—that, having been all but fastened to them,
they should ennoble4713 earthenware and the other substances of which images are made?</p>

<p>18. What then? Do the gods remain always in such substances, and do they not go away
to any place, even though summoned by the most momentous affairs? or do they have free
passage, when they please to go any whither, and to leave their own seats and images? If
they are under the necessity of remaining, what can be more wretched than they, what more
unfortunate than if hooks and leaden bonds hold them fast in this wise on their pedestals?
but if we allow that they prefer these images to heaven and the starry seats, they have lost
their divine power.4714 But if, on the contrary, when they choose, they fly forth, and are
perfectly free to leave the statues empty, the images will then at some time cease to be gods,
and it will be doubtful when sacrifices should be offered,—when it is right and fitting to
withhold them. Oftentimes we see that by artists these images are at one time made small,
and reduced to the size of the hand, at another raised to an immense height, and built up
to a wonderful size. In this way, then, it follows that we should understand that the gods
contract themselves in4715 little statuettes, and are compressed till they become like4716 a
strange body; or, again, that they stretch themselves out to a great length, and extend to
immensity in images of vast bulk. So, then, if this is the case, in sitting statues also the gods
should be said to be seated, and in standing ones to stand, to be running in those stretching
forward to run, to be hurling javelins in those represented as casting them, to fit and fashion
themselves to their countenances, and to make themselves like4717 the other characteristics
of the body formed by the artist.</p>
<note type="footnote">4714 It will be seen that these words fit into the indirect argument of Arnobius very well, although transposed

they must further lose their power as divinities.” Meursius, with, more reason, transposes the clause to the end

<p>19. The gods dwell in images—each wholly in one, or divided into parts, and into
members? For neither is it possible that there can be at one time one god in several images,
nor, again, divided into parts by his being cut up.4718 For let us suppose that there are ten
thousand images of Vulcan in the whole world: is it possible at all, as I said, that at one time
one deity can be in all the ten thousand? I do not think so. Do you ask wherefore? Because
things which are naturally single and unique, cannot become many while the integrity of
their simplicity4719 is maintained. And this they are further unable to become if the gods
have the forms of men, as your belief declares; for either a hand separated from the head,
or a foot divided from the body, cannot manifest the perfection of the whole, or it must be
said that parts can be the same as the whole, while the whole cannot exist unless it has been
made by gathering together its parts. Moreover, if the same deity shall be said to be in all
the statues, all reasonableness and soundness is lost to the truth, if this is assumed that at
one time one can remain in them all; or each of the gods must be said to divide himself from
himself, so that he is both himself and another, not separated by any distinction, but himself
the same as another. But as nature rejects and spurns and scorns this, it must either be said
and confessed that there are Vulcans without number, if we decide that he exists and is in
all the images; or he will be in none, because he is prevented by nature from being divided
among several.</p>

<p>20. And yet, O you—if it is plain and clear to you that the gods live, and that the inhabitants
of heaven dwell in the inner parts of the images, why do you guard, protect, and keep
them shut up under the strongest keys, and under fastenings of immense size, under iron
bars, bolts,4720 and other such things, and defend them with a thousand men and a thousand
women to keep guard, lest by chance some thief or nocturnal robber should creep in? Why
do you feed dogs in the capitols?4721 Why do you give food and nourishment to geese?
Rather, if you are assured that the gods are there, and that they do not depart to any place
from their figures and images, leave to them the care of themselves, let their shrines be always
unlocked and open; and if anything is secretly carried off by any one with reckless fraud,
let them show the might of divinity, and subject the sacrilegious robbers to fitting punishments
at the moment4722 of their theft and wicked deed. For it is unseemly, and subversive
of their power and majesty, to entrust the guardianship of the highest deities to the care of
dogs, and when you are seeking for some means of frightening thieves so as to keep them
away, not to beg it from the gods themselves, but to set and place it in the cackling of geese.</p>

<p>21. They say that Antiochus of Cyzicum took from its shrine a statue of Jupiter made
of gold ten4723 cubits high, and set up in its place one made of copper covered with thin
plates of gold. If the gods are present, and dwell in their own images, with what business,
with what cares, had Jupiter been entangled that he could not punish the wrong done to
himself, and avenge his being substituted in baser metal? When the famous Dionysius—but
it was the younger4724—despoiled Jupiter of his golden vestment, and put instead of it one
of wool, and, when mocking him with pleasantries also, he said that that which he was taking
away was cold in the frosts of winter, this warm, that that one was cumbrous in summer,
that this, again, was airy in hot weather,—where was the king of the world that he did not
show his presence by some terrible deed, and recall the jocose buffoon to soberness by bitter
torments? For why should I mention that the dignity of Æsculapius was mocked by him?
For when Dionysius was spoiling him of his very ample beard, which was of great weight
and philosophic thickness,4725 he said that it was not right that a son sprung from Apollo,
a father smooth and beardless, and very like a mere boy,4726 should be formed with such a
beard that it was left uncertain which of them was father, which son, or rather whether they
were of the same4727 race and family. Now, when all these things were being done, and the
robber was speaking with impious mockery, if the deity was concealed in the statue consecrated
to his name and majesty, why did he not punish with just and merited vengeance the
affront of stripping his face of its beard and disfiguring his countenance, and show by this,
both that he was himself present, and that he kept watch over his temples and images without
ceasing?</p>

(de Nat. Deor., iii. 33, 34, 35) tells these and other stories of the elder Dionysius. To this Arnobius calls attention

<p>22. But you will perhaps say that the gods do not trouble themselves about these losses,
and do not think that there is sufficient cause for them to come forth and inflict punishment
upon the offenders for their impious sacrilege.4728 Neither, then, if this is the case, do they
wish to have these images, which they allow to be plucked up and torn away with impunity;
nay, on the contrary, they tell us plainly that they despise these statues, in which they do not
care to show that they were contemned, by taking any revenge. Philostephanus relates in
his Cypriaca, that Pygmalion, king4729 of Cyprus, loved as a woman an image of Venus,
which was held by the Cyprians holy and venerable from ancient times,4730 his mind, spirit,
the light of his reason, and his judgment being darkened; and that he was wont in his madness,
just as if he were dealing with his wife, having raised the deity to his couch, to be joined
with it in embraces and face to face, and to do other vain things, carried away by a foolishly
lustful imagination.4731 Similarly, Posidippus,4732 in the book which he mentions to have
been written about Gnidus and about its affairs,4733 relates that a young man, of noble
birth,—but he conceals his name,—carried away with love of the Venus because of which
Gnidus is famous, joined himself also in amorous lewdness to the image of the same deity,
stretched on the genial couch, and enjoying4734 the pleasures which ensue. To ask, again,
in like manner: If the powers of the gods above lurk in copper and the other substances of
which images have been formed, where in the world was the one Venus and the other to
drive far away from them the lewd wantonness of the youths, and punish their impious
touch with terrible suffering?4735 Or, as the goddesses are gentle and of calmer dispositions,

lustful insults, and did not think that an action requiring vengeance to be taken, which
soothed their minds, and which they knew was suggested to human desires by themselves.
But if the goddesses, the Venuses, being endowed with rather calm dispositions, considered
that favour should be shown to the misfortunes of the blinded youths; when the greedy
flames so often consumed the Capitol, and had destroyed the Capitoline Jupiter himself
with his wife and his daughter,4737 where was the Thunderer at that time to avert that
calamitous fire, and preserve from destruction his property, and himself, and all his family?

priestess4738 Chrysis in Argos? Where the Egyptian Serapis, when by a similar disaster his
temple fell, burned to ashes, with all the mysteries, and Isis? Where Liber Eleutherius, when
his temple fell at Athens? Where Diana, when hers fell at Ephesus? Where Jupiter of Dodona,
when his fell at Dodona? Where, finally, the prophetic Apollo, when by pirates and sea
robbers he was both plundered and set on fire,4739 so that out of so many pounds of gold,
which ages without number had heaped up, he did not have one scruple even to show to
the swallows which built under his eaves,4740 as Varro says in his Saturæ Menippeæ?4741 It
would be an endless task to write down what shrines have been destroyed throughout the
whole world by earth quakes and tempests—what have been set on fire by enemies, and by
kings and tyrants—what have been stript bare by the overseers and priests themselves, even
though they have turned suspicion away from them4742—finally, what have been robbed by

<p>24. Here also the advocates of images are wont to say this also, that the ancients knew
well that images have no divine nature, and that there is no sense in them, but that they
formed them profitably and wisely, for the sake of the unmanageable and ignorant mob,
which is the majority in nations and in states, in order that a kind of appearance, as it were,
of deities being presented to them, from fear they might shake off their rude natures, and,
supposing that they were acting in the presence of the gods, put4746 away their impious
deeds, and, changing their manners, learn to act as men;4747 and that august forms of gold
and silver were sought for them, for no other reason than that some power was believed to
reside in their splendour, such as not only to dazzle the eyes, but even to strike terror into
the mind itself at the majestic beaming lustre. Now this might perhaps seem to be said with
some reason, if, after the temples of the gods were founded, and their images set up, there
were no wicked man in the world, no villany at all, if justice, peace, good faith, possessed
the hearts of men, and no one on earth were called guilty and guiltless, all being ignorant
of wicked deeds. But now when, on the contrary, all things are full of wicked men, the name
of innocence has almost perished, and every moment, every second, evil deeds, till now
unheard of, spring to light in myriads from the wickedness of wrongdoers, how is it right
to say that images have been set up for the purpose of striking terror into the mob, while,
besides innumerable forms of crime and wickedness,4748 we see that even the temples
themselves are attacked by tyrants, by kings, by robbers, and by nocturnal thieves, and that
these very gods whom antiquity fashioned and consecrated to cause terror, are carried

these images4752 of which they speak, that the men of old should have had reason to hope
and think that, by beholding them, the vices of men could be subdued, and their morals and
wicked ways brought under restraint?4753 The reaping-hook, for example, which was assigned
to Saturn,4754 was it to inspire mortals with fear, that they should be willing to live peacefully,
and to abandon their malicious inclinations? Janus, with double face, or that spiked key by
which he has been distinguished; Jupiter, cloaked and bearded, and holding in his right
hand a piece of wood shaped like a thunderbolt; the cestus of Juno,4755 or the maiden
lurking under a soldier’s helmet; the mother of the gods, with her timbrel; the Muses, with
their pipes and psalteries; Mercury, the winged slayer of Argus; Æsculapius, with his staff;
Ceres, with huge breasts, or the drinking cup swinging in Liber’s right hand; Mulciber, with
his workman s dress; or Fortune, with her horn full of apples, figs, or autumnal fruits; Diana,
with half-covered thighs, or Venus naked, exciting to lustful desire; Anubis, with his dog’s
face; or Priapus, of less importance4756 than his own genitals: were these expected to make

<p>26. O dreadful forms of terror and4757 frightful bugbears4758 on account of which the
human race was to be benumbed for ever, to attempt nothing in its utter amazement, and
to restrain itself from every wicked and shameful act—little sickles, keys, caps, pieces of
wood, winged sandals, staves, little timbrels, pipes, psalteries, breasts protruding and of
great size, little drinking cups, pincers, and horns filled with fruit, the naked bodies of women,
and huge veretra openly exposed! Would it not have been better to dance and to sing, than
calling it gravity and pretending to be serious, to relate what is so insipid and so silly, that
images4759 were formed by the ancients to check wrongdoing, and to arouse the fears of the
wicked and impious? Were the men of that age and time, in understanding, so void of
reason and good sense, that they were kept back from wicked actions, just as if they were
little boys, by the preternatural4760 savageness of masks, by grimaces also, and bugbears?4761
And how has this been so entirely changed, that though there are so many temples in your
states filled with images of all the gods, the multitude of criminals cannot be resisted even
with so many laws and so terrible punishments, and their audacity cannot be overcome4762
by any means, and wicked deeds, repeated again and again, multiply the more it is striven
by laws and severe judgments to lessen the number of cruel deeds, and to quell them by the
check given by means of punishments? But if images caused any fear to men, the passing of
laws would cease, nor would so many kinds of tortures be established against the daring of
the guilty: now, however, because it has been proved and established that the supposed4763
terror which is said to flow out from the images is in reality vain, recourse has been had to
the ordinances of laws, by which there might be a dread of punishment which should be most
certain fixed in men’s minds also, and a condemnation settled; to which these very images
also owe it that they yet stand safe, and secured by some respect being yielded to them.</p>

<p>1. Since it has been sufficiently shown, as far as there has been opportunity, how vain
it is to form images, the course of our argument requires that we should next speak as briefly
as possible, and without any periphrasis, about sacrifices, about the slaughter and immolation
of victims, about pure wine, about incense, and about all the other things which are provided
on such occasions.4764 For with respect to this you have been in the habit of exciting against
us the most violent ill-will, of calling us atheists, and inflicting upon us the punishment of
death, even by savagely tearing us to pieces with wild beasts, on the ground that we pay very
little respect4765 to the gods; which, indeed, we admit that we do, not from contempt or
scorn of the divine,4766 but because we think that such powers require nothing of the kind,
and are not possessed by desires for such things.4767</p>
<p>What, then,4768 some one will say, do you think that no sacrifices at all should be offered?
To answer you not with our own, but with your Varro’s opinion—none. Why so? Because,
he says, the true gods neither wish nor demand these; while those4769 which are made of
copper, earthenware, gypsum, or marble, care much less for these things, for they have no
feeling; and you are not blamed4770 if you do not offer them, nor do you win favour if you
do. No sounder opinion can be found, none truer, and one which any one may adopt, although
he may be stupid and very hard to convince. For who is so obtuse as either to slay
victims in sacrifice to those who have no sense, or to think that they should be given to those
who are removed far from them in their nature and blessed state?</p>

<p>2. Who are the true gods? you say. To answer you in common and simple language, we
do not know;4771 for how can we know who those are whom we have never seen? We have
been accustomed to hear from you that an infinite number4772 are gods, and are reckoned
among4773 the deities; but if these exist4774 anywhere, and are true gods, as Terentius4775
believes, it follows as a consequence, that they correspond to their name; that is, that they
are such as we all see that they should be, and that they are worthy to be called by this name;
nay, more,—to make an end without many words,—that they are such as is the Lord of the
universe, and the King omnipotent Himself, whom we have knowledge and understanding
enough to speak of as the true God when we are led to mention His name. For one god differs
from another in nothing as respects his divinity;4776 nor can that which is one in kind be
less or more in its parts while its own qualities remain unchanged.4777 Now, as this is certain,
it follows that they should never have been begotten, but should be immortal, seeking
nothing from without, and not drawing any earthly pleasures from the resources of matter.</p>

meeting his adversaries on their own ground. He knows who the true God is—the source and fountain of all
being, and framer of the universe (ii. 2), and if there are any lesser powers called gods, what their relation to
Him must be (iii. 2, 3); but he does not know any such gods himself, and is continually reminding the heathen
that they know these gods just as little. (Cf. the very next sentence.)</note>

<p>3. So, then, if these things are so, we desire to learn this, first, from you—what is the
cause, what the reason, that you offer them sacrifices; and then, what gain comes to the gods
themselves from this, and remains to their advantage. For whatever is done should have a
cause, and should not be disjoined from reason, so as to be lost4778 among useless works,
and tossed about among vain and idle uncertainties.4779 Do the gods of heaven4780 live on
these sacrifices, and must materials be supplied to maintain the union of their parts? And
what man is there so ignorant of what a god is, certainly, as to think that they are maintained
by any kind of nourishment, and that it is the food given to them4781 which causes them to
live and endure throughout their endless immortality? For whatever is upheld by causes
and things external to itself, must be mortal and on the way to destruction, when anything
on which it lives begins to be wanting. Again, it is impossible to suppose that any one believes
this, because we see that of these things which are brought to their altars, nothing is added
to and reaches the substance of the deities; for either incense is given, and is lost melting on
the coals,4782 or the life only of the victim is offered to the gods,4783 and its blood is licked
up by dogs; or if any flesh is placed upon the altars, it is set on fire in like manner, and is
destroyed, and falls into ashes,—unless perchance the god seizes upon the souls of the victims,
or snuffs up eagerly the fumes and smoke which rise from the blazing altars, and feeds upon
the odours which the burning flesh gives forth, still wet with blood, and damp with its former
juices.4784 But if a god, as is said, has no body, and cannot be touched at all, how is it possible
that that which has no body should be nourished by things pertaining to the body,—that
what is mortal should support what is immortal, and assist and give vitality to that which

<note type="footnote">4783 Or perhaps, simply, “the sacrifice is a living one,” animalis est hostia. Macrobius, however (Sat., iii. 5),
quotes Trebatius as saying that there were two kinds of sacrifices, in one of which the entrails were examined
that they might disclose the divine will, while in the other the life only was consecrated to the deity. This is more
precisely stated by Servius (Æn., iii. 231), who says that the hostia animalis was only slain, that in other cases
the blood was poured on the altars, that in others part of the victim, and in others the whole animal, was burned.
It is probable, therefore that Arnobius uses the words here in their technical meaning, as the next clause shows
that none of the flesh was offered, while the blood was allowed to fall to the ground. [I am convinced that classical
antiquities must be more largely studied in the Fathers of the first five centuries.]</note>
<note type="footnote">4784 i.e., the juices which formerly flowed through the living body.</note>

it cannot touch? This reason for sacrifices is not valid, therefore, as it seems; nor can it be
said by any one that sacrifices are kept up for this reason, that the deities are nourished by
them, and supported by feeding on them.</p>

<pb n="1273"/>
<p>4. If perchance it is not this,4785 are victims not slain in sacrifice to the gods, and cast
upon their flaming altars to give them4786 some pleasure and delight? And can any man
persuade himself that the gods become mild as they are exhilarated by pleasures, that they
long for sensual enjoyment, and, like some base creatures, are affected by agreeable sensations,
and charmed and tickled for the moment by4787 a pleasantness which soon passes away?
For that which is overcome by pleasure must be harassed by its opposite, sorrow; nor can
that be free from the anxiety of grief, which trembles with joy, and is elated capriciously
with gladness.4788 But the gods should be free from both passions, if we would have them
to be everlasting, and freed from the weakness of mortals. Moreover, every pleasure is, as
it were, a kind of flattery of the body, and is addressed to the five well-known senses; but if
the gods above feel it,4789 they must partake also of those bodies through which there is a
way to the senses, and a door by which to receive pleasures. Lastly, what pleasure is it to take
delight in the slaughter of harmless creatures, to have the ears ringing often with their piteous
bellowings, to see rivers of blood, the life fleeing away with the blood, and the secret parts
having been laid open, not only the intestines to protrude with the excrements, but also the
heart still bounding with the life left in it, and the trembling, palpitating veins in the viscera?
We half-savage men, nay rather,—to say with more candour what it is truer and more candid
to say,—we savages, whom unhappy necessity and bad habit have trained to take these as
food, are sometimes moved with pity for them; we ourselves accuse and condemn ourselves
when the thing is seen and looked into thoroughly, because, neglecting the law which is
binding on men, we have broken through the bonds which naturally united us at the beginning.
4790 Will4791 any one believe that the gods, who are kind, beneficent, gentle, are delighted
and filled with joy by the slaughter of cattle, if ever they fall and expire pitiably before
their altars?4792 And there is no cause, then, for pleasure in sacrifices, as we see, nor is there
a reason why they should be offered, since there is no pleasure afforded by them; and if
perchance there is some,4793 it has been shown that it cannot in any way belong to the gods.</p>
<note type="footnote">4785 The heathen opponent is supposed to give up his first reason, that the sacrifices provided food for the
gods, and to advance this new suggestion, that they were intended for their gratification merely.</note>

<p>5. We have next to examine the argument which we hear continually coming from the
lips of the common people, and find embedded in popular conviction, that sacrifices are
offered to the gods of heaven for this purpose, that they may lay aside their anger and passions,
and may be restored to a calm and placid tranquillity, the indignation of their fiery
spirits being assuaged. And if we remember the definition which we should always bear
steadily in mind, that all agitating feelings are unknown to the gods, the consequence is, a
belief4794 that the gods are never angry; nay, rather, that no passion is further from them
than that which, approaching most nearly to the spirit of wild beasts and savage creatures,
agitates those who suffer it with tempestuous feelings, and brings them into danger of destruction.
For whatever is harassed by any kind of disturbance,4795 is, it is clear, capable of
suffering, and frail; that which has been subjected to suffering and frailty must be mortal;
but anger harasses and destroys4796 those who are subject to it: therefore that should be
called mortal which has been made subject to the emotions of anger. But yet we know that
the gods should be never-dying, and should possess an immortal nature; and if this is clear
and certain, anger has been separated far from them and from their state. On no ground,
then, is it fitting to wish to appease that in the gods above which you see cannot suit their
blessed state.</p>
<note type="footnote">4794 So the ms., LB., Oberthür, Orelli, Hild., and Oehler, reading consec-, for which the rest read consentaneum
est credere—“it is fitting to believe.”</note>

</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<p>6. But let us allow, as you wish, that the gods are accustomed to such disturbance, and
that sacrifices are offered and sacred solemnities performed to calm it, when, then, is it fitting
that these offices should be made use of, or at what time should they be given?—before they
are angry and roused, or when they have been moved and displeased even?4797 If we must
meet them with sacrifices beforetheir anger is roused, lest they become enraged, you are
bringing forward wild beasts to us, not gods, to which it is customary to toss food, upon
which they may rage madly, and turn their desire to do harm, lest, having been roused, they
should rage and burst the barriers of their dens. But if these sacrifices are offered to satisfy4798
the gods when already fired and burning with rage, I do not inquire, I do not consider,
whether that happy4799 and sublime greatness of spirit which belongs to the deities is disturbed
by the offences of little men, and wounded if a creature, blind and ever treading
among clouds of ignorance, has committed any blunder,—said anything by which their
dignity is impaired.</p>

<p>7. But neither do I demand that this should be said, or that I should be told what causes
the gods have for their anger against men, that having taken offence they must be soothed.
I do ask, however, Did they ever ordain any laws for mortals? and was it ever settled by them
what it was fitting for them to do, or what it was not? what they should pursue, what avoid;
or even by what means they wished themselves to be worshipped, so that they might pursue
with the vengeance of their wrath what was done otherwise than they had commanded, and
might be disposed, if treated contemptuously, to avenge themselves on the presumptuous
and transgressors? As I think, nothing was ever either settled or ordained by them, since
neither have they been seen, nor has it been possible for it to be discerned very clearly
whether there are any.4800 What justice is there, then, in the gods of heaven being angry for
any reason with those to whom they have neither deigned at any time to show that they
existed, nor given nor imposed any laws which they wished to be honoured by them and
perfectly observed?4801</p>
<note type="footnote">4800 It is perhaps possible so to translate the ms. neque si sunt ulli apertissima potuit cognitione dignosci, retained

<p>8. But this, as I said, I do not mention, but allow it to pass away in silence. This one
thing I ask, above all, What reason is there if I kill a pig, that a god changes his state of mind,
and lays aside his angry feelings and frenzy; that if I consume a pullet, a calf under his eyes
and on his altars, he forgets the wrong which I did to him, and abandons completely all sense
of displeasure? What passes from this act4802 to modify his resentment? Or of what service4803
is a goose, a goat, or a peacock, that from its blood relief is brought to the angry god? Do
the gods, then, make insulting them a matter of payment? and as little boys, to induce them
to give up their fits of passion4804 and desist from their wailings, get little sparrows, dolls,
ponies, puppets,4805 with which they may be able to divert themselves, do the immortal
gods in such wise receive these gifts from you, that for them they may lay aside their resentment,
and be reconciled to those who offended them? And yet I thought that the gods—if
only it is right to believe that they are really moved by anger—lay aside their anger and resentment,
and forgive the sins of the guilty, without any price or reward. For this belongs
specially to deities, to be generous in forgiving, and to seek no return for their gifts.4806 But
if this cannot be, it would be much wiser that they should continue obstinately offended,
than that they should be softened by being corrupted with bribes. For the multitude increases
of those who sin, when there is hope given of paying for their sin; and there is little hesitation
to do wrong, when the favour of those who pardon offences may be bought.</p>

<p>9. So, if some ox, or any animal you please, which is slain to mitigate and appease the
fury of the deities, were to take a man’s voice and speak these4807 words: “Is this, then, O
Jupiter, or whatever god thou art, humane or right, or should it be considered at all just,
that when another has sinned I should be killed, and that you should allow satisfaction to
be made to you with my blood, although I never did you wrong, never wittingly or unwittingly
did violence to your divinity and majesty, being, as thou knowest, a dumb creature, not departing
from4808 the simplicity of my nature, nor inclined to be fickle in my4809 manners?
Did I ever celebrate your games with too little reverence and care? did I drag forward a
dancer so that thy deity was offended? did I swear falsely by thee? did I sacrilegiously steal
your property and plunder your temples? did I uproot the most sacred groves, or pollute
and profane some hallowed places by founding private houses? What, then, is the reason
that the crime of another is atoned for with my blood, and that my life and innocence are
made to pay for wickedness with which I have nothing to do? Is it because I am a base
creature, and am not possessed of reason and wisdom, as these declare who call themselves
men, and by their ferocity make themselves beasts?4810 Did not the same nature both beget
and form me from the same beginnings? Is it not one breath of life which sways both them
and me? Do I not respire and see, and am I not affected by the other senses just as they are?
They have livers, lungs, hearts, intestines, bellies; and do not I have as many members? They
love their young, and come together to beget children; and do not I both take care to procure
offspring, and delight in it when it has been begotten? But they have reason, and utter articulate
sounds; and how do they know whether I do what I do for my own reasons, and
whether that sound which I give forth is my kind of words, and is understood by us alone?
Ask piety whether it is more just that I should be slain, that I should be killed, or that man
should be pardoned and be safe from punishment for what he has done? Who formed iron
into a sword? was it not man? Who brought disaster upon races; who imposed slavery upon
nations? was it not man? Who mixed deadly draughts, and gave them to his parents,
brothers, wives, friends? was it not man? Who found out or devised so many forms of
wickedness, that they can hardly be related in ten thousand chronicles of years, or even of
days? was it not man? Is not this, then, cruel, monstrous, and savage? Does it not seem to
you, O Jupiter, unjust and barbarous that I should be killed, that I should be slain, that you
may be soothed, and the guilty find impunity? ”</p>

being made willing in a measure to grant our prayers, they may give us prosperity and avert
from us evil, cause us to live always happily, drive away grief truly, and any evils which
threaten us from accidental circumstances. This point demands great care; nor is it usual
either to hear or to believe what is so easily said. For the whole company of the learned will
straightway swoop upon us, who, asserting and proving that whatever happens, happens
according to the decrees of fate, snatch out of our4812 hands that opinion, and assert that we
are putting our trust in vain beliefs. Whatever, they will say, has been done in the world, is
being done, and shall be done, has been settled and fixed in time past, and has causes which
cannot be moved, by means of which events have been linked together, and form an unassailable
chain of unalterable necessity between the past and the future. If it has been determined
and fixed what evil or good should befall each person, it is already certain; but if this
is certain and fixed, there is no room for all the help given by the gods, their hatred, and
favours. For they are just as unable to do for you that which cannot be done, as to prevent
that from being done which must happen, except that they will be able, if they choose, to
depreciate somewhat powerfully that belief which you entertain, so that they4813 say that
even the gods themselves are worshipped by you in vain, and that the supplications with
which you address them are superfluous. For as they are unable to turn aside the course of
events, and change what has been appointed by fate, what reason, what cause, is there to
wish to weary and deafen the ears of those in whose help you cannot trust at your utmost
need?</p>

<p>11. Lastly, if the gods drive away sorrow and grief, if they bestow joy and pleasure,
how4814 are there in the world so many4815 and so wretched men, whence come so many
unhappy ones, who lead a life of tears in the meanest condition? Why are not those free
from calamity who every moment, every instant, load and heap up the altars with sacrifices?
Do we not see that some of them, say the learned, are the seats of diseases, the light of their
eves quenched, and their ears stopped, that they cannot move with their feet, that they live
mere trunks without the use of their hands, that they are swallowed up, overwhelmed, and
destroyed by conflagrations, shipwrecks, and disasters;4816 that, having been stripped of
immense fortunes, they support themselves by labouring for hire, and beg for alms at last;
that they are exiled, proscribed, always in the midst of sorrow, overcome by the loss of
children, and harassed by other misfortunes, the kinds and forms of which no enumeration
can comprehend? But assuredly this would not occur if the gods, who had been laid under
obligation, were able to ward off, to turn aside, those evils from those who merited this favour.
But now, because in these mishaps there is no room for the interference of the gods, but all
things are brought about4817 by inevitable necessity, the appointed course of events goes
on and accomplishes that which has been once determined.</p>

<p>12. Or the gods of heaven should be said to be ungrateful if, while they have power to
prevent it, they suffer an unhappy race to be involved in so many hardships and disasters.
But perhaps they may say something of importance in answer to this, and not such as should
be received by deceitful, fickle, and scornful ears. This point, however, because it would require
too tedious and prolix discussion,4818 we hurry past unexplained and untouched,
content to have stated this alone, that you give to your gods dishonourable reputations if
you assert that on no other condition do they bestow blessings and turn away what is injurious,
except they have been first bought over with the blood of she-goats and sheep, and
with the other things which are put upon their altars. For it is not fitting, in the first place,
that the power of the deities and the surpassing eminence of the celestials should be believed
to keep their favours on sale, first to receive a price, and then to bestow them; and then,
which is much more unseemly, that they aid no one unless they receive their demands, and
that they suffer the most wretched to undergo whatever perils may befall them,4819 while
they could ward these off, and come to their aid. If of two who are sacrificing, one is a
scoundrel,4820 and rich, the other of small fortune, but worthy of praise for his integrity
and goodness,—if the former should slay a hundred oxen, and as many ewes with their
lambkins, the poor man burn a little incense, and a small piece of some odorous substance,—
will it not follow that it should be believed that, if only the deities bestow nothing
except when rewards are first offered, they will give their favour4821 to the rich man, turn
their eyes away from the poor, whose gifts were restricted not by his spirit, but by the
scantiness of his means?4822 For where the giver is venal and mercenary, there it must needs
be that favour is granted according to the greatness of the gift by which it is purchased, and
that a favourable decision is given to him from whom4823 far the greater reward and bribe,
though this be shameful, flows to him who gives it.4824 What if two nations, on the other
hand, arrayed against each other in war, enriched the altars of the gods with equal sacrifices,
and were to demand that their power and help should be given to them, the one against the
other: must it not, again, be believed that, if they are persuaded to be of service by rewards,

they are at a loss between both sides, are struck motionless, and do not perceive what to do,
since they understand that their favour has been pledged by the acceptance of the sacrifices?
For either they will give assistance to this side and to that, which is impossible, for in that
case they will fight themselves against themselves, strive against their own favour and wishes;
or they will do nothing to aid either nation4825 after the price of their aid has been paid and
received, which is very wicked. All this infamy, therefore, should be removed far from the
gods; nor should it be said at all that they are won over by rewards and payments to confer
blessings, and remove what is disagreeable, if only they are true gods, and worthy to be
ranked under this name. For either whatever happens, happens inevitably, and there is no
place in the gods for ambition and favour; or if fate is excluded and got rid of, it does not
belong to the celestial dignity to sell the boon of its services,4826 and the conferring of its
bounties.</p>

<p>13. We have shown sufficiently, as I suppose, that victims, and the things which go along
with them, are offered in vain to the immortal gods, because they are neither nourished by
them, nor feel any pleasure, nor lay aside their anger and resentment, so as either to give
good fortune, or to drive away and avert the opposite. We have now to examine that point
also which has been usually asserted by some, and applied to forms of ceremony. For they
say that these sacred rites were instituted to do honour to the gods of heaven, and that these
things which they do, they do to show them honour, and to magnify the powers of the
deities by them. What if they were to say, in like manner, that they keep awake and sleep,
walk about, stand still, write something, and read, to give honour to the gods, and make
them more glorious in majesty? For what substance is there added to them from the blood
of cattle, and from the other things which are prepared in sacrificing? what power is given
and added to them? For all honour, which is said to be offered by any one, and to be yielded
to reverence for a greater being, is of a kind having reference to the other; and consists of
two parts, of the concession of the giver, and the increase of honour of the receiver. As, if
any one, on seeing a man famed for his very great power4827 and authority, were to make
way for him, to stand up, to uncover his head, and leap down from his carriage, then,
bending forward to salute him with slavish servility and4828 trembling agitation, I see what
is aimed at in showing such respect: by the bowing down of the one, very great honour is
given to the other, and he is made to appear great whom the respect of an inferior exalts
and places above his own rank.4829</p>

<p>14. But all this conceding and ascribing of honour about which we are speaking are met
with among men alone, whom their natural weakness and love of standing above their fellows4830
teach to delight in arrogance, and in being preferred above others. But, I ask, where
is there room for honour among the gods, or what greater exaltation is found to be given4831
to them by piling up4832 sacrifices? Do they become more venerable, more powerful, when
cattle are sacrificed to them? is there anything added to them from this? or do they begin to
be more truly gods, their divinity being increased? And yet I consider it almost an insult,
nay, an insult altogether, when it is said that a god is honoured by a man, and exalted by
the offering of some gift. For if honour increases and augments the grandeur of him to
whom it is given, it follows that a deity becomes greater by means of the man from whom
he has received the gift, and the honour conferred on him; and thus the matter is brought
to this issue, that the god who is exalted by human honours is the inferior, while, on the
other hand, the man who increases the power of a deity is his superior.4833</p>

<p>15. What then! some one will say, do you think that no honour should be given to the
gods at all? If you propose to us gods such as they should be if they do exist, and such as4834
we feel that we all mean when we mention4835 that name, how can we but give them even
the greatest honour, since we have been taught by the commands which have especial power
over us,4836 to pay honour to all men even, of whatever rank, of whatever condition they
may be? What, pray, you ask, is this very great honour? One much more in accordance with
duty than is paid by you, and directed to4837 a more powerful race, we reply. Tell, us, you
say, in the first place, what is an opinion worthy of the gods, right and honourable, and not
blameworthy from its being made unseemly by something infamous? We reply, one such
that you believe that they neither have any likeness to man, nor look for anything which is
outside of them and comes from without; then—and this has been said pretty frequently—that
they do not burn with the fires of anger, that they do not give themselves up passionately
to sensual pleasure, that they are not bribed to be of service, that they are not tempted to
injure our enemies, that they do not sell their kindness and favour, that they do not rejoice
in having honour heaped on them, that they are not indignant and vexed if it is not given;
but—and this belongs to the divine—that by their own power they know themselves, and
that they do not rate themselves by the obsequiousness of others. And yet, that we may see
the nature of what is said, what kind of honour is this, to bind a wether, a ram, a bull before
the face of a god, and slay them in his sight? What kind of honour is it to invite a god to a
banquet of blood, which you see him take and share in with dogs? What kind of honour is
it, having set on fire piles of wood, to hide the heavens with smoke, and darken with gloomy
blackness the images of the gods? But if it seems good to you that these actions should be
considered in themselves,4838 not judged of according to your prejudices, you will find that
those altars of which you speak, and even those beautiful ones which you dedicate to the
superior gods,4839 are places for burning the unhappy race of animals, funeral pyres, and
mounds built for a most unseemly office, and formed to be filled with corruption.</p>

<p>16. What say you, O you—! is that foul smell, then, which is given forth and emitted by
burning hides, by bones, by bristles, by the fleeces of lambs, and the feathers of fowls,—is
that a favour and an honour to the deity? and are the deities honoured by this, to whose
temples, when you arrange to go, you come4840 cleansed from all pollution, washed, and
perfectly4841 pure? And what can be more polluted than these, more unhappy,4842 more
debased, than if their senses are naturally such that they are fond of what is so cruel, and
take delight in foul smells which, when inhaled with the breath, even those who sacrifice
cannot bear, and certainly not a delicate4843 nose? But if you think that the gods of heaven
are honoured by the blood of living creatures being offered to them, why do you not4844
sacrifice to them both mules, and elephants, and asses? why not dogs also, bears, and foxes,
camels, and hyænas, and lions? And as birds also are counted victims by you, why do you
not sacrifice vultures, eagles, storks, falcons, hawks, ravens, sparrow-hawks, owls, and, along
with them, salamanders, water-snakes, vipers, tarantulæ? For indeed there is both blood in
these, and they are in like manner moved by the breath of life. What is there more artistic
in the former kind of sacrifices, or less ingenious in the latter, that these do not add to and
increase the grandeur of the gods? Because, says my opponent, it is right to honour the gods
of heaven with those things by which we are ourselves nourished and sustained, and live;
which also they have, in their divine benevolence, deigned to give to us for food. But the
same gods have given to you both cumin, cress, turnips, onions, parsley, esculent thistles,
radishes, gourds, rue, mint, basil, flea-bane, and chives, and commanded them to be used
by you as part of your food; why, then, do you not put these too upon the altars, and scatter
wild-marjoram, with which oxen are fed, over them all, and mix amongst them onions with
their pungent flavour?</p>

clearly—if dogs, I say, and asses, and along with them water-wagtails, if the twittering
swallows, and pigs also, having acquired some of the feelings of men, were to think and
suppose that you were gods, and to propose to offer sacrifices in your honour, not of other
things and substances, but of those with which they are wont to be nourished and supported,
according to their natural inclination,—we ask you to say whether you would consider this
an honour, or rather a most outrageous affront, when the swallows slew and consecrated
flies to you, the water-wagtails ants; when the asses put hay upon your altars, and poured
out libations of chaff; when the dogs placed bones, and burned human excrements4845 at
your shrines; when, lastly, the pigs poured out before you a horrid mess, taken from their
frightful hog-pools and filthy maws? Would you not in this case, then, be inflamed with
rage that your greatness was treated with contumely, and account it an atrocious wrong that
you were greeted with filth? But, you reply, you honour the gods with the carcasses of bulls,
and by slaying4846 other living creatures. And in what respect does this differ from that,
since these sacrifices, also, if they are not yet, will nevertheless soon be, dung, and will become
rotten after a very short time has passed? Finally, cease to place fire upon4847 your altars,
then indeed you will4848 see that consecrated flesh of bulls, with which you magnify the
honour of the gods, swelling and heaving with worms, tainting and corrupting the atmosphere,
and infecting the neighbouring districts with unwholesome smells. Now, if the gods
were to enjoin you to turn these things4849 to your own account, to make your meals from
them4850 in the usual way; you would flee to a distance, and, execrating the smell, would
beg pardon from the gods, and bind yourselves by oath never again to offer such sacrifices
to them. Is not this conduct of yours mockery, then? is it not to confess, to make known
that you do not know what a deity is, nor to what power the meaning and title of this name
should be given and applied? Do you give new dignity to the gods by new kinds of food? do
you honour them with savours and juices, and because those things which nourish you are
pleasing and grateful to you? do you believe that the gods also flock up to enjoy their pleasant

there, that while the immortal gods—for, so far as we are concerned, they may all be gods
who are believed to be so—are of one mind, or should be of one nature, kind, and character,
all are not appeased with all the victims, but certain deities with certain animals, according
to the sacrificial laws? For what cause is there, to repeat the same question, that that deity
should be honoured with bulls, another with kids or sheep, this one with sucking pigs, the
other with unshorn lambs, this one with virgin heifers, that one with horned goats, this with
barren cows, but that with teeming4851 swine, this with white, that with dusky4852 victims,
one with female, the other, on the contrary, with male animals? For if victims are slain in
sacrifice to the gods, to do them honour and show reverence for them, what does it matter,
or what difference is there with the life of what animal this debt is paid, their anger and resentment
put away? Or is the blood of one victim less grateful and pleasing to one god, while
the other’s fills him with pleasure and joy? or, as is usually done, does that deity abstain from
the flesh of goats because of some reverential and religious scruple, another turn with disgust
from pork, while to this mutton stinks? and does this one avoid tough ox-beef that he may
not overtax his weak stomach, and choose tender4853 sucklings that he may digest them

<p>19. But you err, says my opponent, and fall into mistakes; for in sacrificing female victims
to the female deities, males to the male deities, there is a hidden and very4855 secret reason,
and one beyond the reach of the mass. I do not inquire, I do not demand, what the sacrificial
laws teach or contain; but if reason has demonstrated,4856 and truth declared, that among
the gods there is no difference of species, and that they are not distinguished by any sexes,
must not all these reasonings be set at nought, and be proved, be found to have been believed
under the most foolish hallucinations? I will not bring forward the opinions of wise men,
who cannot restrain their laughter when they hear distinctions of sex attributed to the immortal
gods: I ask of each man whether he himself believes in his own mind, and persuades
himself that the race of the gods is so distinguished that they are male and female, and have
been formed with members arranged suitably for the begetting of young?</p>
<p>But if the laws of the sacrifices enjoin that like sexes should be sacrificed to like, that is,
female victims to the female gods, male victims, on the contrary, to the male gods, what relation
is there in the colours, so that it is right and fitting that to these white, to those dark,
even the blackest victims are slain? Because, says my opponent, to the gods above, and those
who have power to give favourable omens,4857 the cheerful colour is acceptable and propitious
from the pleasant appearance of pure white; while, on the contrary, to the sinister
deities, and those who inhabit the infernal seats, a dusky colour is more pleasing, and one
tinged with gloomy hues. But if, again, the reasoning holds good, that the infernal regions
are an utterly vain and empty name,4858 and that underneath the earth there are no Plutonian
realms and abodes, this, too, must nullify your ideas about black cattle and gods under
the ground. Because, if there are no infernal regions, of necessity there are no dii Manium
also. For how is it possible that, while there are no regions, there should be said to be any

<p>20. But let us agree, as you wish, that there are both infernal regions and Manes, and
that some gods or other dwell in these by no means favourable to men, and presiding over
misfortunes; and what cause, what reason is there, that black victims, even4859 of the darkest
hue, should be brought to their altars? Because dark things suit dark, and gloomy things are
pleasing to similar beings. What then? Do you not see—that we, too, may joke with you
stupidly, and just as you do yourselves4860—that the flesh of the victims is not black,4861
nor their bones, teeth, fat, the bowels, with4862 the brains, and the soft marrow in the bones?
But the fleeces are jet-black, and the bristles of the creatures are jet-black. Do you, then,
sacrifice to the gods only wool and little bristles torn from the victims? Do you leave the
wretched creatures, despoiled it may be, and shorn, to draw the breath of heaven, and rest
in perfect innocence upon their feeding-grounds? But if you think that those things are
pleasing to the infernal gods which are black and of a gloomy colour, why do you not take
care that all the other things which it is customary to place upon their sacrifices should be
black, and smoked, and horrible in colour? Dye the incense if it is offered, the salted grits,
and all the libations without exception. Into the milk, oil, blood, pour soot and ashes, that
this may lose its purple hue, that the others may become ghastly. But if you have no scruple

<p>21. But this, too, it is fitting that we should here learn from you: If a goat be slain to
Jupiter, which is usually sacrificed to father Liber and Mercury,4863 or if the barren heifer
be sacrificed to Unxia, which you give to Proserpine, by what usage and rule is it determined
what crime there is in this, what wickedness or guilt has been contracted, since it makes no
difference to the worship offered to the deity what animal it is with whose head the honour
is paid which you owe? It is not lawful, says my opponent, that these things should be confounded,
and it is no small crime to throw the ceremonies of the rites and the mode of expiation
into confusion. Explain the reason, I beg. Because it is right to consecrate victims of
a certain kind to certain deities, and that certain forms of supplication should be also adopted.
And what, again, is the reason that it is right to consecrate victims of a certain kind to certain
deities, and that certain forms of supplication should be also adopted, for this very rightfulness
should have its own cause, and spring, be derived from certain reasons? Are you going
to speak about antiquity and custom? If so, you relate to me merely the opinions of men,
and the inventions of a blind creature: but I, when I request a reason to be brought forward
to me, wish to hear either that something has fallen from heaven, or, which the subject rather
requires, what relation Jupiter has to a bull’s blood that it should be offered in sacrifice to
him, not to Mercury or Liber. Or what are the natural properties of a goat, that they again
should be suited to these gods, should not be adapted to the sacrifices of Jupiter? Has a
partition of the animals been made amongst the gods? Has some contract been made and
agreed to, so that4864 it is fitting that this one should hold himself back from the victim
which belongs to that, that the other should cease4865 to claim as his own the blood which
belongs to another? Or, as envious boys, are they unwilling to allow others to have a share
in enjoying the cattle presented to them? or, as is reported to be done by races which differ
greatly in manners, are the same things which by one party are considered fit for eating,
rejected as food by others?</p>

<p>22. If, then, these things are vain, and are not supported by any reason, the very offering4866
of sacrifices also is idle. For how can that which follows have a suitable cause, when
that very first statement from which the second flows is found to be utterly idle and vain,
and established on no solid basis? To mother Earth, they say, is sacrificed a teeming4867 and
pregnant sow; but to the virgin Minerva is slain a virgin calf, never forced4868 by the goad
to attempt any labour. But yet we think that neither should a virgin have been sacrificed to
a virgin, that the virginity might not be violated in the brute, for which the goddess is especially
esteemed; nor should gravid and pregnant victims have been sacrificed to the Earth
from respect for its fruitfulness, which4869 we all desire and wish to go on always in irrepressible
fertility.4870 For if because the Tritonian goddess is a virgin it is therefore fitting that
virgin victims be sacrificed to her, and if because the Earth is a mother she is in like manner
to be entertained with gravid swine, then also Apollo should be honoured by the sacrifice of
musicians because he is a musician; Æsculapius, because he is a physician, by the sacrifice
of physicians; and because he is an artificer, Vulcan by the sacrifice of artificers; and because
Mercury is eloquent, sacrifice should be made to him with the eloquent and most fluent.
But if it is madness to say this, or, to speak with moderation, nonsense, that shows much
greater madness to slaughter pregnant swine to the Earth because she is even more prolific;
pure and virgin heifers to Minerva because she is pure, of unviolated virginity.

<p>23. For as to that which we hear said by you, that some of the gods are good, that others,
on the contrary, are bad, and rather inclined to indulge in wanton mischief,4871 and that
the usual rites are paid to the one party that they may show favour, but to the others that
they may not do you harm,—with what reason this is said, we confess that we cannot understand.
For to say that the gods are most benevolent, and have gentle dispositions, is not only
pious and religious, but also true; but that they are evil and sinister, should by no means be
listened to, inasmuch as that divine power has been far removed and separated from the
disposition which does harm.4872 But whatever can occasion calamity, it must first be seen
what it is, and then it should be removed very far from the name of deity.</p>
<p>Then, supposing that we should agree with you that the gods promote good fortune and
calamity, not even in this case is there any reason why you should allure some of them to
grant you prosperity, and, on the other hand, coax others with sacrifices and rewards not
to do you harm. First, because the good gods cannot act badly, even if they have been worshipped
with no honour,—for whatever is mild and placid by nature, is separated widely
from the practice and devising of mischief; while the bad knows not to restrain his ferocity,
although he should be enticed to do so with a thousand flocks and a thousand altars. For
neither can bitterness change itself into sweetness, dryness into moisture, the heat of fire
into cold, or what is contrary to anything take and change into its own nature that which
is its opposite. So that, if you should stroke a viper with your hand, or caress a poisonous
scorpion, the former will attack you with its fangs, the latter, drawing itself together, will
fix its sting in you; and your caressing will be of no avail, since both creatures are excited to
do mischief, not by the stings of rage, but by a certain peculiarity of their nature. It is thus
of no avail to wish to deserve well of the sinister deities by means of sacrifices, since,
whether you do this, or on the contrary do not, they follow their own nature, and by inborn
laws and a kind of necessity are led to those things, to do which4873 they were made.
Moreover, in this way4874 both kinds of gods cease to possess their own powers, and to retain
their own characters. For if the good are worshipped that they may be favourable, and supplication
is made in the same way to the others, on the contrary, that they may not be injurious,
it follows that it should be understood that the propitious deities will show no favour
if they receive no gifts, and become bad instead of good;4875 while, on the contrary, the bad,
<note type="footnote">4871 Lit., “more prompt to lust of hurting.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4872 Lit., “nature of hurting.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4873 The ms. reads ad ea quæ facti sunt, understood seemingly as above by the edd., by supplying ad before

if they receive offerings, will lay aside their mischievous disposition, and become thereafter
good: and thus it is brought to this issue, that neither are these propitious, nor are those
sinister: or, which is impossible, both are propitious, and both again sinister.</p>

the temples of the gods without some religious obligation, and that what has been done in
accordance with usage and custom possesses some rational ground: but if it seems a great
and grand thing to slay bulls to the gods, and to burn in sacrifice the flesh of animals whole
and entire, what is the meaning of these relics connected with the arts of the Magi which
the pontifical mysteries have restored to a place among the secret laws of the sacred rites,
and have mixed up with religious affairs? What, I say, is the meaning of these things,
apexaones, hirciæ, silicernia, longavi, which are names and kinds of sausages,4876 some
stuffed with goats’ blood,4877 others with minced liver? What is the meaning of tædæ, uæniæ,
offæ, not those used by the common people, but those named and called offæ penitæ?—of
which the first4878 is fat cut into very small pieces, as dainties4879 are; that which has been
placed second is the extension of the gut by which the excrements are given off after being
drained of all their nourishing juices; while the offa penita is a beast’s tail cut off with a
morsel of flesh. What is the meaning of polimina, omenta, palasea, or, as some call it,
plasea?—of which that named omentum is a certain part enclosed by the reservoirs of the
belly are kept within bounds; the plasea is an ox’s tail4880 besmeared with flour and blood;
the polimina, again, are those parts which we with more decency call proles,—by the vulgar,
however, they are usually termed testes. What is the meaning of fitilla, frumen, africia, gratilla,
catumeum, cumspolium, cubula?—of which the first two are names of species of pottage,
but differing in kind and quality; while the series of names which follows denotes consecrated
cakes, for they are not shaped in one and the same way. For we do not choose to mention
the caro strebula which is taken from the haunches of bulls, the roasted pieces of meat which
are spitted, the intestines first heated, and baked on glowing coals, nor, finally, the pickles4881
which are made by mixing four kinds of fruit. In like manner, we do not choose to mention

<p>25. For if whatever is done by men, and especially in religion, should have its
causes,—and nothing should be done without a reason in all that men do and perform,—tell
us and say what is the cause, what the reason, that these things also are given to the gods
and burned upon their sacred altars? For here we delay, constrained most urgently to wait
for this cause, we pause, we stand fast, desiring to learn what a god has to do with pottage,
with cakes, with different kinds of stuffing prepared in manifold ways, and with different
ingredients? Are the deities affected by splendid dinners or luncheons, so that it is fitting
to devise for them feasts without number? Are they troubled by the loathings of their
stomachs, and is variety of flavours sought for to get rid of their aversion, so that there is
set before them meat at one time roasted, at another raw, and at another half cooked and
half raw? But if the gods like to receive all these parts which you term præsiciæ,4887 and if
these gratify them with any sense of pleasure or delight, what prevents, what hinders you
from laying all these upon their altars at once with the whole animals? What cause, what
reason is there that the haunch-piece4888 by itself, the gullet, the tail, and the tail-piece4889
separately, the entrails only, and the membrane4890 alone, should be brought to do them
honour? Are the gods of heaven moved by various condiments? After stuffing themselves
with sumptuous and ample dinners, do they, as is usually done, take these little bits as sweet
dainties, not to appease their hunger, but to rouse their wearied palates,4891 and excite in
themselves a perfectly voracious appetite? O wonderful greatness of the gods, comprehended
by no men, understood by no creatures! if indeed their favours are bought with the testicles

<p>26. We have now to say a few words about incense and wine, for these, too, are connected
and mixed up with your ceremonies,4893 and are used largely in your religious acts. And,
first, with respect to that very incense which you use, we ask this of you particularly, whence
or at what time you have been able to become acquainted with it, and to know it, so that
you have just reason to think that it is either worthy to be given to the gods, or most agreeable
to their desires. For it is almost a novelty; and there is no endless succession of years since
it began to be known in these parts, and won its way into the shrines of the gods. For neither
in the heroic ages, as it is believed and declared, was it known what incense was, as is proved
by the ancient writers, in whose books is found no mention4894 of it; nor was Etruria, the
parent and mother of superstition, acquainted with its fame and renown, as the rites of the
chapels prove; nor was it used by any one in offering sacrifice during the four hundred years
in which Alba flourished; nor did even Romulus or Numa, who was skilful in devising new
ceremonies, know either of its existence or growth, as the sacred grits4895 show with which
it was customary that the usual sacrifices should be performed. Whence, therefore, did its
use begin to be adopted? or what desire of novelty assailed the old and ancient custom, so
that that which was not needed for so many ages took the first place in the ceremonies? For
if without incense the performance of a religious service is imperfect, and if a quantity of it
is necessary to make the celestials gentle and propitious to men, the ancients fell into sin,
nay rather, their whole life was full of guilt, for they carelessly neglected to offer that which
was most fitted to give pleasure to the gods. But if in ancient times neither men nor gods
sought for this incense, it is proved that to-day also that is offered uselessly and in vain
which antiquity did not believe necessary, but modern times desired without any reason.4896</p>
<note type="footnote">4893 Lit., “these kinds of ceremonies, too, were coupled and mixed,” etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">4894 On this Oehler remarks, that the books of Moses show that it was certainly used in the East in the most

<p>27. Finally, that we may always abide by the rule and definition by which it has been
shown and determined that whatever is done by man must have its causes, we will hold it
fast here also, so as to demand of you what is the cause, what the reason, that incense is put
on the altars before the very images of the deities, and that, from its being burned, they are
supposed to become friendly and gentle. What do they acquire from this being done, or
what reaches their minds, so that we should be right in judging that these things are well
expended, and are not consumed uselessly and in vain? For as you should show why you
give incense to the gods, so, too, it follows that you should manifest that the gods have some
reason for not rejecting it with disdain, nay more, for desiring it so fondly. We honour the
gods with this, some one will perhaps say. But we are not inquiring what your feeling is, but
the gods’; nor do we ask what is done by you, but how much they value what is done to
purchase their favour. But yet, O piety, what or how great is this honour which is caused by
the odour of a fire, and produced from the gum of a tree? For, lest you should happen not
to know what this incense is, or what is its origin, it is a gum flowing from the bark of trees,
just as from the almond-tree, the cherry-tree, solidifying as it exudes in drops. Does this,
then, honour and magnify the celestial dignities? or, if their displeasure has been at any time
excited, is it melted away before the smoke of incense, and lulled to sleep, their anger being
moderated? Why, then, do you not burn indiscriminately the juice of any tree whatever,
without making any distinction? For if the deities are honoured by this, and are not displeased
that Panchæan gums are burned to them, what does it matter from what the smoke proceeds
on your sacred altars, or from what kind of gum the clouds of fumigation arise?</p>
</div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
<pb n="1302"/>
<p>28. Will any one say that incense is given to the celestials, for this reason, that it has a
sweet smell, and imparts a pleasant sensation to the nose, while the rest are disagreeable,
and have been set aside because of their offensiveness? Do the gods, then, have nostrils with
which to breathe? do they inhale and respire currents of air so that the qualities of different
smells can penetrate them? But if we allow that this is the case, we make them subject to the
conditions of humanity, and shut them out from the limits of deity; for whatever breathes
and draws in draughts of air, to be sent back in the same way, must be mortal, because it is
sustained by feeding on the atmosphere. But whatever is sustained by feeding on the atmosphere,
if you take away the means by which communication is kept up,4897 its life must be
crushed out, and its vital principle must be destroyed and lost. So then, if the gods also
breathe and inhale odours enwrapt in the air that accompanies them, it is not untrue to say
that they live upon what is received from others,4898 and that they might perish if their airholes
were blocked up. And whence, lastly, do you know whether, if they are charmed by
the sweetness of smells, the same things are pleasant to them which are pleasant to you, and
charm and affect your different natures with a similar feeling? May it not be possible that
the things which give pleasure to you, seem, on the contrary, harsh and disagreeable to
them? For since the opinions of the gods are not the same, and their substance not one, by
what methods can it be brought about that that which is unlike in quality should have the
same feeling and perception as to that which touches it.4899 Do we not every day see that,
even among the creatures sprung from the earth, the same things are either bitter or sweet
to different species, that to some things are fatal which are not pernicious to others, so that
the same things which charm some with their delightful odours, give forth exhalations
deadly to the bodies of others? But the cause of this is not in the things which cannot be at
one and the same time deadly and wholesome, sweet and bitter; but just as each one has
been formed to receive impressions from what is external,4900 so he is affected:4901 his
condition is not caused by the influences of the things, but springs from the nature of his
own senses, and connection with the external. But all this is set far from the gods, and is
separated from them by no small interval. For if it is true, as is believed by the wise, that
they are incorporeal, and not supported by any excellence of bodily strength, an odour is of
no effect upon them, nor can reeking fumes move them by their senses, not even if you were

to set on fire a thousand pounds of the finest incense, and the whole sky were clouded with
the darkness of the abundant vapours. For that which does not have bodily strength and
corporeal substance, cannot be touched by corporeal substance; but an odour is corporeal,
as is shown by the nose when touched by one: therefore it cannot, according to reason, be
felt by a deity, who has no body, and is without any feeling and thought.4902</p>

why it is poured upon it when burning. For if a reason is not4903 shown for doing this, and
its cause is not4904 set forth, this action of yours must not now be attributed to a ridiculous
error, but, to speak more plainly, to madness, foolishness, blindness. For, as has been already
said pretty frequently, everything which is done should have its cause manifest, and not involved
in any dark obscurity. If, therefore, you have confidence in what is done, disclose,
point out why that liquor is offered; that is, why wine is poured on the altars. For do the
bodies of the deities feel parching thirst, and is it necessary that their dryness be tempered
by some moisture? Are they accustomed, as men are, to combine eating and drinking? In
like manner, also, after the solid4905 food of cakes and pottages, and victims slain in honour
of them, do they drench themselves, and make themselves merry with very frequent cups of
wine, that their food may be more easily softened, and thoroughly digested? Give, I beg, to
the immortal gods to drink; bring forth goblets, bowls,4906 ladles, and cups; and as they stuff
themselves with bulls, and luxurious feasts, and rich food,—lest some piece of flesh hastily4907
gulped down should stick in passing through the stomach, run up, hasten, give pure wine
to Jupiter, the most excellent, the supreme, lest he be choked. He desires to break wind, and
is unable; and unless that hindrance passes away and is dissolved, there is very great danger
that his breathing will be stopped and4908 interrupted, and heaven be left desolate without
its rulers.</p>

<p>30. But, says my opponent, you are insulting us without reason, for we do not pour forth
wine to the gods of heaven for these reasons, as if we supposed that they either thirsted, or
drank, or were made glad by tasting its sweetness. It is given to them to do them honour;
that their eminence may become more exalted, more illustrious, we pour libations on their
altars, and with the half-extinguished embers we raise sweet smells,4909 which show our
reverence. And what greater insult can be inflicted upon the gods than if you believe that
they become propitious on receiving wine, or, if you suppose that great honour is done to
them, if you only throw and drop on the live coals a few drops of wine? We are not speaking
to men void of reason, or not possessed of common understanding: in you, too, there is
wisdom, there is perception, and in your hearts you know, by your own4910 judgment, that
we are speaking truly. But what can we do with those who are utterly unwilling to consider
things as they are, to converse themselves with themselves? For you do what you see to be
done, not that which you are assured should be done, inasmuch4911 as with you a custom
without reason prevails, more than a perception of the nature of circumstances based on a
careful examination of the truth. For what has a god to do with wine? or what or how great
is the power in it, that, on its being poured out, his eminence becomes greater, and his dignity
is supposed to be honoured? What, I say, has a god to do with wine, which is most closely
connected with the pursuits of Venus, which weakens the strength of all virtues, and is
hostile to the decency of modesty and chastity,—which has often excited men’s minds, and
urged them to madness and frenzy, and compelled the gods to destroy their own authority
by raving and foul language? Is not this, then, impious, and perfectly sacrilegious, to give
that as an honour which, if you take too eagerly, you know not what you are doing, you are
ignorant of what you are saying, and at last are reviled, and become infamous as a drunkard,

<p>31. It is worth while to bring forward the words themselves also, which, when wine is
offered, it is customary to use and make supplication with: “Let the deity be worshipped
with this wine which we bring.”4912 The words “which we bring,” says Trebatius, are added
for this purpose, and put forth for this reason, that all the wine whatever which has been
laid up in closets and storerooms, from which was taken that which is poured out, may not
begin to be sacred, and be reft from the use of men. This word, then, being added, that alone
will be sacred which is brought to the place, and the rest will not be consecrated.4913 What
kind of honour, then, is this, in which there is imposed on the deity a condition,4914 as it
were, not to ask more than has been given? or what is the greed of the god, who, if he were
not verbally interdicted, would extend his desires too far, and rob his suppliant of his stores?
“Let the deity be worshipped with this wine which we bring:” this is a wrong, not an honour.
For what if the deity shall wish for more, and shall not be content with what is brought!
Must he not be said to be signally wronged who is compelled to receive honour conditionally?
For if all wine in cellars whatever must become consecrated were a limitation not added, it
is manifest both that the god is insulted to whom a limit is prescribed against his wishes,
and that in sacrificing you yourselves violate the obligations of the sacred rites, who do not
give as much wine as you see the god wishes to be given to himself. “Let the deity be worshipped
with this wine which we bring:” what is this but saying, “Be worshipped as much
as I choose; receive as much dignity as I prescribe, as much honour as I decide and determine
by a strict engagement4915 that you should have?” O sublimity of the gods, excelling in
power, which thou shouldst venerate and worship with all ceremonial observances, but on
which the worshipper imposes conditions, which he adores with stipulations and contracts,
which, through fear of one word, is kept from excessive desire of wine</p>

of the deities be appeased by the immolation and slaughter of victims: are the gods
moved by garlands also, wreaths and flowers, by the jingling of brass also, and the shaking
of cymbals, by timbrels also, and also by symphonious pipes?4916 What effect has the clattering
of castanets, that when the deities have heard them, they think that honour has been
shown to them, and lay aside their fiery spirit of resentment in forgetfulness? Or, as little
boys are frightened into giving over their silly wailings by hearing the sound ofrattles, are
the almighty deities also soothed in the same way by the whistling of pipes? and do they
become mild, is their indignation softened, at the musical sound of cymbals? What is the
meaning of those calls4917 which you sing in the morning, joining your voices to the music
of the pipe? Do the gods of heaven fall asleep, so that they should return to their posts? What
is the meaning of those slumbers4918 to which you commend them with auspicious salutations
that they may be in good health? Are they awakened from sleep; and that they may be able
to be overcome by it, must soothing lullabies be heard? The purification, says my opponent,
of the mother of the gods is to-day.4919 Do the gods, then, become dirty; and to get rid of
the filth, do those who wash them need water, and even some cinders to rub them with?4920

rest which you wish to be sacred, and to be considered religious duties, what reason have
they, what cause, that it was necessary that they should be instituted and founded and designated
by the names4927 of deities? The gods are honoured by these, says my opponent; and
if they have any recollection of offences committed4928 by men, they lay it aside, get rid of
it, and show themselves gracious to us again, their friendship being renewed. And what is
the cause, again, that they are made quite calm and gentle, if absurd things are done, and
idle fellows sport before the eyes of the multitude? Does Jupiter lay aside his resentment if
the Amphitryon of Plautus is acted and declaimed? or if Europa, Leda, Ganymede, or Danæ
is represented by dancing does he restrain his passionate impulses? Is the Great Mother
rendered more calm, more gentle, if she beholds the old story of Attis furbished up by the
players? Will Venus forget her displeasure if she sees mimics act the part of Adonis also in
a ballet?4929 Does the anger of Alcides die away if the tragedy of Sophocles named Trachiniæ,
or the Hercules of Euripides, is acted? or does Flora think4930 that honour is shown to her
if at her games she sees that shameful actions are done, and the stews abandoned for the
theatres? Is not this, then, to lessen the dignity of the gods, to dedicate and consecrate to
them the basest things which a rigidly virtuous mind will turn from with disgust, the performers
of which your law has decided to be dishonoured and to be considered infamous?
The gods, forsooth, delight in mimics; and that surpassing excellence which has not been
comprehended by any human faculty, opens4931 its ears most willingly to hear these plays,
with most of which they know they are mixed up to be turned to derision; they are delighted,
as it is, with the shaved heads of the fools, by the sound of flaps, and by the noise of applause,
by shameful actions and words, by huge red fascina. But further, if they see men weakening
themselves to the effeminacy of women, some vociferating uselessly, others running about

out their cheeks with wind, and shouting out noisily empty vows, do they lift up their hands
to heaven in their admiration, start up moved by such wonders, burst into exclamations,

they derive the highest pleasure from comedies, Atellane farces, and pantomimes, why do
you delay, why do you hesitate, to say that the gods themselves also play, act lasciviously,

<p>34. Whence, therefore, have these vicious opinions flowed, or from what causes have
they sprung? From this it is clear, in great measure, that men are unable to know what God
is, what is His essence, nature, substance, quality; whether He has a form, or is limited by
no bodily outline, does anything or not, is ever watchful, or is at times sunk in slumbers,
runs, sits, walks, or is free from such motions and inactivity. Being, as I have said, unable
to know all these things, or to discern them by any power of reason, they fell into these
fanciful beliefs, so that they fashioned gods after themselves, and gave to these such a nature
as they have themselves, in actions, circumstances, and desires. But if they were to perceive
that they are worthless creatures,4934 and that there is no great difference between themselves
and a little ant, they would cease, indeed, to think that they have anything in common with
the gods of heaven, and would confine their unassuming insignificance4935 within its
proper limits. But now, because they see that they themselves have faces, eyes, heads, cheeks,
ears, noses, and all the other parts of our limbs and muscles, they think that the gods also
have been formed in the same way, that the divine nature is embodied in a human frame;4936
and because they perceive that they themselves rejoice and are glad, and again are made sad
by what is too disagreeable, they think that the deities also on joyous occasions are glad, and
on less pleasant ones become dejected. They see that they are affected by the games, and
think that the minds of the celestials are soothed by enjoying games; and because they have
pleasure in refreshing themselves with warm baths, they think that the cleanness produced
by4937 bathing is pleasing to the gods above. We men gather our vintages, and they think
and believe that the gods gather and bring in their grapes; we have birthdays, and they affirm
that the powers of heaven have birthdays.4938 But if they could ascribe to the gods ill-health,
sickness, and bodily disease, they would not hesitate to say that they were splenetic, bleareyed,
and ruptured, because they are themselves both splenetic, and often blear-eyed, and
weighed down by huge herniæ.</p>

<p>35. Come now: as the discussion has been prolonged and led to these points, let us,
bringing forward what each has to say,4939 decide by a brief comparison whether your ideas
of the gods above are the better, or our thoughts preferable, and much more honourable
and just, and such as to give and assign its own dignity to the divine nature. And, first, you
declare that the gods, whom you either think or believe to exist, of whom you have set up
images and statues in all the temples, were born and produced from the germs of males and
females, under the necessary condition of sexual embraces. But we, on the contrary, if they
are indeed true gods, and have the authority, power, dignity of this name, consider that they
must either be unbegotten, for it is pious to believe this, or, if they have a beginning in4940
birth, it belongs to the supreme God to know by what methods He made them, or how many
ages there are since He granted to them to enter upon the eternal being of His own divine
nature. You consider that the deities have sexes, and that some of them are male, others female;
we utterly deny that the powers of heaven have been distinguished by sexes, since this
distinction has been given to the creatures of earth which the Author of the universe willed
should embrace and generate, to provide, by their carnal desires, one generation of offspring
after another. You think that they are like men, and have been fashioned with the countenances
of mortals; we think that the images of them are wide of the mark,4941 as form belongs
to a mortal body; and if they have any, we swear with the utmost earnestness and confidence
that no man can comprehend it. By you they are said to have each his trade, like artisans;
we laugh when we hear you say such things, as we hold and think that professions are not
necessary to gods, and it is certain and evident that these have been provided to assist poverty.</p>

which the book ends as it is arranged in the ms. Orelli has therefore adopted the suggestion of an anonymous

still holds good, that there is a want of connection and harmony in these concluding chapters, and that, even
when thus arranged, they do not form a fitting conclusion to the whole work.</note>

<p>36.4942 You say that some of them cause dissensions, that there are others who inflict
pestilences, others who excite love and madness, others, even, who preside over wars, and
are delighted by the shedding of blood; but we, indeed, on the contrary, judge that these
things are remote4943 from the dispositions of the deities; or if there are any who inflict and
bring these ills on miserable mortals, we maintain that they are far from the nature of the
gods, and should not be spoken of under this name. You judge that the deities are angry
and perturbed, and given over and subject to the other mental affections; we think that such
emotions are alien from them, for these suit savage beings, and those who die as mortals.4944
You think that they rejoice, are made glad, and are reconciled to men, their offended feelings
being soothed by the blood of beasts and the slaughter of victims; we hold that there is in
the celestials no love of blood, and that they are not so stern as to lay aside their resentment
only when glutted with the slaughter of animals. You think that, by wine and incense, honour
is given to the gods, and their dignity increased; we judge it marvellous and monstrous that
any man thinks that the deity either becomes more venerable by reason of smoke,4945 or
thinks himself supplicated by men with sufficient awe and respect when they offer4946 a few
drops of wine. You are persuaded that, by the crash of cymbals and the sound of pipes, by
horse-races and theatrical plays, the gods are both delighted and affected, and that their resentful
feelings conceived before4947 are mollified by the satisfaction which these things
give; we hold it to be out of place, nay more, we judge it incredible, that those who have
surpassed by a thousand degrees every kind of excellence in the height of their perfection,
should be pleased and delighted with those things which a wise man laughs at, and which
do not seem to have any charm except to little children, coarsely and vulgarly educated.</p>

<note type="footnote">4943 It is important to notice the evidence in this one sentence of haste and want of revision. In the first line
we find a genitive (discordiarum—“dissensions”), but not the noun on which it depends; and in the apodosis a
verb (disjunctas esse—“have been removed,” i.e., “are remote”) has no subject, although its gender imperatively
requires that has res, or some such words, be supplied. One omission might have been easily ascribed to a slip
on the part of the copyist; but two omissions such as these occurring so closely, must, it would seem, be assigned
to the impetuous disregard of minutiæ with which Arnobius blocked out a conclusion which was never carefully
revised. (Cf. Appendix, note 1, and p. 539, n. 8.) The importance of such indications is manifest in forming an
opinion on the controversy as to this part of the work.</note>

opinions and yours, where are we, on the one hand, impious, or you pious, since the decision
as to4949 piety and impiety must be founded on the opinions of the two parties? For he who
makes himself an image which he may worship for a god, or slaughters an innocent beast,
and burns it on consecrated altars, must not be held to be devoted to religion.4950 Opinion
constitutes religion, and a right way of thinking about the gods, so that you do not think
that they desire anything contrary to what becomes their exalted position, which is manifest.
4951 For since we see all the things which are offered to them consumed here under our
eyes, what else can be said to reach them from us than opinions worthy of the gods, and
most appropriate to their name? These are the surest gifts, these true sacrifices; for gruel,
incense, and flesh feed the devouring flames, and agree very well with the parentalia4952 of

<p>38.4953 If the immortal gods cannot be angry, says my opponent, and their nature is not
agitated or troubled by any passions, what do the histories, the annals mean, in which we
find it written4954 that the gods, moved by some annoyances, occasioned pestilences, sterility,
4955 failure of crops, and other dangers, to states and nations; and that they again, being
appeased and satisfied by means of4956 sacrifices, laid aside their burning anger, and changed
the state of the atmosphere and times into a happier one? What is the meaning of the earth’s
roarings, the earthquakes, which we have been told occurred because the games had been
celebrated carelessly, and their nature and circumstances had not been attended to, and yet,
on their being celebrated afresh, and repeated with assiduous care, the terrors of the gods
were stilled, and they were recalled to care and friendship for men? How often, after that—in
obedience to the commands of the seers and the responses of the diviners—sacrifice has
been offered, and certain gods have been summoned from nations dwelling beyond the sea,
and shrines erected to them, and certain images and statues set on loftier pillars, have fears
of impending dangers been diverted, and the most troublesome enemies beaten, and the
republic extended both by repeated joyous victories, and by gaining possession of several
provinces! Now, certainly this would not happen if the gods despised sacrifices, games, and
other acts of worship, and did not consider themselves honoured by expiratory offerings.
If, then, all the rage and indignation of the deities are cooled when these things are offered,
and if those things become favourable which seemed fraught with terrors, it is clear that all
these things are not done without the gods wishing them, and that it is vain, and shows utter
ignorance, to blame us for giving them.</p>

<p>39.4957 We have come, then, in speaking, to the very point of the case, to that on which
the question hinges, to the real and most intimate part of the discussion, which it is fitting
that, laying aside superstitious dread, and putting away partiality, we should examine
whether these are gods whom you assert to be furious when offended, and to be rendered
mild by sacrifices; or whether they are something far different, and should be separated
from the notion of this name and power. For we do not deny that all these things are to be
found in the writings of the annalists which have been brought forward by you in opposition;
for we ourselves also, according to the measure and capacity of our abilities, have read, and
know, that it has been recorded that once at the ludi circenses, celebrated in honour of Jupiter
the supreme, a master dragged across the middle of the arena, and afterwards, according to
custom, punished with the cross, a very worthless slave whom he had beaten with rods.
Then, when the games were ended, and the races not long finished, a pestilence began to
distress the state; and when each day brought fresh ill worse than what was before,4958 and
the people were perishing in crowds, in a dream Jupiter said to a certain rustic, obscure
from the lowliness of his lot, that he should go4959 to the consuls, point out that the dancer4960
had displeased him, that it might be better for the state if the respect due to the games
were paid to them, and they were again celebrated afresh with assiduous care. And when
he had utterly neglected to do this, either because he supposed it was an empty dream, and
would find no credence with those to whom he should tell it, or because, remembering his
natural insignificance, he avoided and dreaded approaching those who were so powerful,4961
Jupiter was rendered hostile to the lingerer, and imposed as punishment on him the death
of his sons. Afterwards, when he4962 threatened the man himself with death unless he went
to announce his disapproval of the dancer,—overcome by fear of dying, since he was already
himself also burning with the fever of the plague, having been infected, he was carried to
the senate-house, as his neighbours wished, and, when his vision had been declared, the
contagious fever passed away. The repetition of the games being then decreed, great care
was, on the one hand, given to the shows, and its former good health was restored to the
people.</p>

<p>40.4963 But neither shall we deny that we know this as well, that once on a time, when
the state and republic were in difficulties, caused either by4964 a terrible plague continually
infecting the people and carrying them off, or by enemies powerful, and at that time almost
threatening to rob it of its liberty4965 because of their success in battle,—by order and advice
of the seers, certain gods4966 were summoned from among nations dwelling beyond the
sea, and honoured with magnificent temples; and that the violence of the plague abated,
and very frequent triumphs were gained, the power of the enemy being broken, and the
territory of the empire was increased, and provinces without number fell under your sway.
But neither does this escape our knowledge, that we have seen it asserted that, when the
Capitol was struck by a thunderbolt, and many other things in it, the image of Jupiter also,
which stood on a lofty pillar, was hurled from its place. Thereafter a response was given by
the soothsayers, that cruel and very sad mischances were portended from fire and slaughter,
from the destruction of the laws, and the overthrow of justice, especially, however, from
enemies themselves belonging to the nation, and from an impious band of conspirators;
but that these things could not be averted, nay, that the accursed designs could not be revealed,
unless Jupiter were again set up firmly on a higher pillar, turned towards the east,
and facing the rays of the rising sun. Their words were trustworthy, for, when the pillar was

you will find that there is nothing worthy of the gods, and, as has already been said often,
nothing worthy to be referred to the splendour and majesty of this race. For, first, who is
there who will believe that he was a god who was pleased with horses running to no purpose,
4969 and considered it most delightful that he should be summoned4970 by such sports?
Rather, who is there who will agree that that was Jupiter—whom you call the supreme god,
and the creator of all things which are—who set out from heaven to behold geldings vieing
with each other in speed, and running4971 the seven rounds of the course; and that, although
he had himself determined that they should not be equally nimble, he nevertheless rejoiced
to see them pass each other, and be passed, some in their haste falling forward upon their
heads, and overturned upon their backs along with their chariots, others dragged along and
lamed, their legs being broken; and that he considered as the highest pleasures fooleries
mixed with trifles and cruelties, which any man, even though fond of pleasure, and not
trained to strive after seriousness and dignity, would consider childish, and spurn as ridiculous?
Who is there, I say, who will believe—to repeat this word assiduously—that he was
divine who, being irritated because a slave was led across the circus, about to suffer and be
punished as he deserved, was inflamed with anger, and prepared himself to take vengeance?
For if the slave was guilty, and deserved to be punished with that chastisement, why should
Jupiter have been moved with any indignation when nothing was being done unjustly, nay,
when a guilty fellow was being punished, as was right? But if he was free from guilt, and not
worthy of punishment at all, Jupiter himself was the cause of the dancer’s vitiating the
games,4972 for when he might have helped him, he did him no service—nay, sought both
to allow what he disapproved, and to exact from others the penalty for what he had permitted.
And why, then, did he complain and declare that he was wronged in the case of that dancer

<p>42.4973 And what pollution or abomination could have flowed from this, either to make
the circus less pure, or to defile Jupiter, seeing that in a few moments, in a few seconds, he
beheld so many thousands throughout the world perish by different kinds of death, and
with various forms of torture? He was led across, says my opponent, before the games began
to be celebrated. If from a sacrilegious spirit and contempt4974 for religion, we have reason
to excuse Jupiter for being indignant that he was contemned, and that more anxious care
was not given to his games. But if from mistake or accident that secret fault was not observed
and known, would it not have beer right and befitting Jupiter to pardon human failings,
and grant forgiveness to the blindness of ignorance? But it was necessary that it should be
punished. And after this, will any one believe that he was a god who avenged and punished
neglect of a childish show by the destruction of a state? that he had any seriousness and
dignity, or any steady constancy, who, that he might speedily enjoy pleasure afresh, turned
the air men breathed4975 into a baneful poison, and ordered the destruction of mortals by
plague and pestilence? If the magistrate who presided over the games was too careless in
learning who on that day had been led across the circus, and blame was therefore contracted,
what had the unhappy people done that they should in their own persons suffer the penalty
of another’s offences, and should be forced to hurry out of life by contagious pestilences?
Nay, what had the women, whose weakness did not allow them to take part in public business,
the grown-up4976 maidens, the little boys, finally the young children, yet dependent for food
on their nurses,—what had these done that they should be assailed with equal, with the same
severity, and that before they tasted the joy of life4977 they should feel the bitterness of death?</p>

<p>43.4978 If Jupiter sought to have his games celebrated, and that afresh,4979 with greater
care; if he honestly sought to restore4980 the people to health, and that the evil which he had
caused should go no further and not be increased, would it not have been better that he
should come to the consul himself, to some one of the public priests, the pontifex maximus,
or to his own flamen Dialis, and in a vision reveal to him the defect in the games occasioned
by the dancer, and the cause of the sadness of the times? What reason had there been that
he should choose to announce his wishes and procure the satisfaction desired, a man accustomed
to live in the country, unknown from the obscurity of his name, not acquainted with
city matters, and perhaps not knowing what a dancer is? And if he indeed knew, as he must
have known if he was a diviner,4981 that this fellow would refuse to obey, would it not have
been more natural and befitting a god, to change the man’s mind, and constrain him to be
willing to obey, than to try more cruel methods, and vent his rage indiscriminately, without
any reason, as robbers do? For if the old rustic, not being quick in entering upon anything,
delayed in doing what was commanded, being kept back by stronger motives, of what had
his unhappy children been guilty, that Jupiter’s anger and indignation should be turned
upon them, and that they should pay for another’s offences by being robbed of their lives?
And can any man believe that he is a god who is so unjust, so impious, and who does not
observe even the laws of men, among whom it would be held a great crime to punish one
for another, and to avenge one man’s offences upon others?4982 But, I am told, he caused
the man himself to be seized by the cruel pestilence. Would it not then have been better,
nay rather, juster, if it seemed that this should be done, that dread of punishment should
be first excited by the father, who4983 had been the cause of such passion by4984 his disobedient
delay, than to do violence to the children, and to consume and destroy innocent persons
to make him sorrowful?4985 What, pray, was the meaning of this fierceness, this cruelty,
which was so great that, his offspring being dead, it afterwards terrified the father by his
own danger! But if he had chosen to do this long before, that is, in the first place, not only
would not the innocent brothers have been cut off, but the indignant purpose of the deity
also would have been known. But certainly, it will be said, when he had done his duty by
announcing the vision, the disease immediately left him, and the man was forthwith restored

thoroughly, there was greater cruelty than kindness in his deliverance, for Jupiter
did not preserve him to the joys of life who was miserable and wishing to perish after his

<p>44.4987 In like manner we might go through the other narratives, and show that in these
also, and in expositions of these, something far different from what the gods should be is
said and declared about them, as in this very story which I shall next relate, one or two only
being added to it, that disgust may not be produced by excess.4988 After certain gods were
brought from among nations dwelling beyond the sea, you say, and after temples were built
to them, after their altars were heaped with sacrifices, the plague-stricken people grew strong
and recovered, and the pestilence fled before the soundness of health which arose. What
gods, say, I beseech? Æsculapius, you say, the god of health, from Epidaurus, and now settled
in the island in the middle of the Tiber. If we were disposed to be very scrupulous in dealing
with your assertions, we might prove by your own authority that he was by no means divine
who had been conceived and born from a woman’s womb, who had by yearly stages reached
that term of life at which, as is related in your books, a thunderbolt drove him at once from
life and light. But we leave this question: let the son of Coronis be, as you wish, one of the
immortals, and possessed of the everlasting blessedness4989 of heaven. From Epidaurus,
however, what was brought except an enormous serpent? If we trust the annals, and ascribe
to them well-ascertained truth, nothing else, as it has been recorded. What shall we say then?
That Æsculapius, whom you extol, an excellent, a venerable god, the giver of health, the
averter, preventer, destroyer of sickness, is contained within the form and outline of a serpent,
crawling along the earth as worms are wont to do, which spring from mud; he rubs the
ground with his chin and breast, dragging himself in sinuous coils; and that he may be able
to go forward, he draws on the last part of his body by the efforts of the first.</p>

<p>45.4990 And as we read that he used food also, by which bodily existence is kept up, he
has a large gullet, that he may gulp down the food sought for with gaping mouth; he has a
belly to receive it, and4991 a place where he may digest the flesh which he has eaten and devoured,
that blood may be given to his body, and his strength recruited;4992 he has also a
draught, by which the filth is got rid of, freeing his body from a disagreeable burden.
Whenever he changes his place, and prepares to pass from one region to another, he does
not as a god fly secretly through the stars of heaven, and stand in a moment where something
requires his presence, but, just as a dull animal of earth, he seeks a conveyance on which he
may be borne; he avoids the waves of the sea; and that he may be safe and sound, he goes
on board ship along with men; and that god of the common safety trusts himself to weak
planks and to sheets of wood joined together. We do not think that you can prove and show
that that serpent was Æsculapius, unless you choose to bring forward this pretext, that you
should say that the god changed himself into a snake, in order that he might be able4993 to
deceive men as to himself, who he was, or to see what men were. But if you say this, the inconsistency
of your own statements will show how weak and feeble such a defence is.4994
For if the god shunned being seen by men, he should not have chosen to be seen in the form
of a serpent, since in any form whatever he was not to be other than himself, but always
himself. But if, on the other hand, he had been intent on allowing himself to be seen—he
should not have refused to allow men’s eyes to look on him4995—why did he not show
himself such as he knew that he was in his own divine power?4996 For this was preferable,
and much better, and more befitting his august majesty, than to become a beast, and be
changed into the likeness of a terrible animal, and afford room for objections, which cannot
be decided,4997 as to whether he was a true god, or something different and far removed
from the exalted nature of deity.</p>

<p>46.4998 But, says my opponent, if he was not a god, why, after he left the ship, and crawled
to the island in the Tiber, did he immediately become invisible, and cease to be seen as before?
Can we indeed know whether there was anything in the way under cover of which he hid
himself, or any opening in the earth? Do you declare, say yourselves, what that was, or to
what race of beings it should be referred, if your service of certain personages is in itself
certain.4999 Since the case is thus, and the discussion deals with your deity, and your religion
also, it is your part to teach, and yours to show what that was, rather than to wish to hear
our opinions and to await our decisions. For we, indeed, what else can we say than that
which took place and was seen, which has been handed down in all the narratives, and has
been observed by means of the eyes? This, however, undoubtedly we say was a colubra5000
of very powerful frame and immense length, or, if the name is despicable, we say it was a
snake,5001 we call it a serpent,5002 or any other name which usage has afforded to us, or the
development of language devised. For if it crawled as a serpent, not supporting itself and
walking on feet,5003 but resting upon its belly and breast; if, being made of fleshly substance,
it lay stretched out in5004 slippery length; if it had a head and tail, a back covered with scales,
diversified by spots of various colours; if it had a mouth bristling with fangs, and ready to
bite, what else can we say than that it was of earthly origin, although of immense and excessive
size, although it exceeded in length of body and greatness of might that which was slain by
Regulus by the assault of his army? But if we think otherwise, we subvert5005 and overthrow
the truth. It is yours, then, to explain what that was, or what was its origin, its name, and
nature. For how could it have been a god, seeing that it had those things which we have
mentioned, which gods should not have if they intend to be gods, and to possess this exalted
title? After it crawled to the island in the Tiber, forthwith it was nowhere to be seen, by
which it is shown that it was a deity. Can we, then, know whether there was there anything
in the way under cover of which it hid itself,5006 or some opening in the earth, or some

caverns and vaults, caused by huge masses being heaped up irregularly, into which it hurried,
evading the gaze of the beholders? For what if it leaped across the river? what if it swam
across it? what if it hid itself in the dense forests? It is weak reasoning from this,5007 to
suppose that that serpent was a god because with all speed it withdrew itself from the eyes
of the beholders, since, by the same reasoning, it can be proved, on the other hand, that it
was not a god.</p>

<p>47.5008 But if that snake was not a present deity, says my opponent, why, after its arrival,
was the violence of the plague overcome, and health restored to the Roman people? We,
too, on the other hand, bring forward the question, If, according to the books of the fates
and the responses of the seers, the god Æsculapius was ordered to be invited to the city, that
he might cause it to be safe and sound from the contagion of the plague and of pestilential
diseases, and came without spurning the proposal contemptuously, as you say, changed into
the form of serpents,—why has the Roman state been so often afflicted with such disasters,
so often at one time and another torn, harassed, and diminished by thousands, through the
destruction of its citizens times without number? For since the god is said to have been
summoned for this purpose, that he might drive away utterly all the causes by which pestilence
was excited, it followed that the state should be safe, and should be always maintained
free from pestilential blasts, and unharmed. But yet we see, as was said before, that it has
over and over again had seasons made mournful by these diseases, and that the manly vigour
of its people has been shattered and weakened by no slight losses. Where, then, was Æsculapius?
where that deliverer promised by venerable oracles? Why, after temples were built,
and shrines reared to him, did he allow a state deserving his favour to be any longer plaguestricken,
when he had been summoned for this purpose, that he should cure the diseases
which were raging, and not allow anything of the sort which might be dreaded to steal on
them afterwards?</p>

<pb n="1228"/>
<p>48.5009 But some one will perhaps say that the care of such a god has been denied5010
to later and following ages, because the ways in which men now live are impious and objectionable;
that it brought help to our ancestors, on the contrary, because they were blameless
and guiltless. Now this might perhaps have been listened to, and said with some reasonableness,
either if in ancient times all were good without exception, or if later times produced5011
only wicked people, and no others.5012 But since this is the case that in great peoples, in
nations, nay, in all cities even, men have been of mixed5013 natures, wishes, manners, and
the good and bad have been able to exist at the same time in former ages, as well as in
modern times, it is rather stupid to say that mortals of a later day have not obtained the aid
of the deities on account of their wickedness. For if on account of the wicked of later generations
the good men of modern times have not been protected, on account of the ancient
evil-doers also the good of former times should in like manner not have gained the favour
of the deities. But if on account of the good of ancient times the wicked of ancient times
were preserved also, the following age, too, should have been protected, although it was
faulty, on account of the good of later times. So, then, either that snake gained the reputation
of being a deliverer while he had been of no service at all, through his being brought to the
city when the violence of the disease5014 was already weakened and impaired, or the hymns
of the fates must be said to have been far from giving5015 true indications, since the remedy
given by them is found to have been useful, not to all in succession, but to one age only.</p>

Pessinus in precisely the same way by command of the seers, was a cause of safety and great
joy to the people. For, on the one hand, a long-powerful enemy was thrust out from the
position he had gained in5017 Italy; and, on the other, its ancient glory was restored to the
city by glorious and illustrious victories, and the boundaries of the empire were extended
far and wide, and their rights as freemen were torn from races, states, peoples without
number, and the yoke of slavery imposed on them, and many other things accomplished at
home and abroad established the renown and dignity of the race with irresistible power. If
the histories tell the truth, and do not insert what is false in their accounts of events, nothing
else truly5018 is said to have been brought from Phrygia, sent by King Attalus, than a stone,
not large, which could be carried in a man’s hand without any pressure—of a dusky and
black colour—not smooth, but having little corners standing out, and which to-day we all

<p>50.5020 What shall we say then? Was Hannibal, that famous Carthaginian, an enemy
strong and powerful, before whom the fortunes of Rome trembled in doubt and uncertainty,
and its greatness shook—was he driven from Italy by a stone?5021 was he subdued by a
stone? was he made fearful, and timid, and unlike himself by a stone? And with regard to
Rome’s again springing to the height of power and royal supremacy, was nothing done by
wisdom, nothing by the strength of men; and, in returning to its former eminence, was no
assistance given by so many and so great leaders by their military skill, or by their acquaintance
with affairs? Did the stone give strength to some, feebleness to others? Did it hurl these
down from success, raise the fortunes of others which seemed hopelessly overthrown? And
what man will believe that a stone taken from the earth, having5022 no feeling, of sooty colour
and dark5023 body, was the mother of the gods? or who, again, would listen to this,—for
this is the only alternative,—that the power5024 of any deity dwelt in pieces of flint, within5025
its mass,5026 and hidden in its veins? And how was the victory procured if there was no
deity in the Pessinuntine stone? We may say, by the zeal and valour of the soldiers, by
practice, time, wisdom, reason; we may say, by fate also, and the alternating fickleness of
fortune. But if the state of affairs was improved, and success and victory were regained, by
the stone’s assistance, where was the Phrygian mother at the time when the commonwealth
was bowed down by the slaughter of so many and so great armies, and was in danger of utter
ruin? Why did she not thrust herself before the threatening, the strong enemy? Why did she
not crush and repel assaults5027 so terrible before these awful blows fell, by which all the
blood was shed, and the life even failed, the vitals being almost exhausted? She had not been
brought yet, says my opponent, nor asked to show favour. Be it so;5028 but a kind helper
never requires to be asked, always offering assistance of his own accord. She was not able,

to any fictions you please, who would consider that she either was a goddess at that time,
or should be now so spoken of and named, who at one time desires these things, at another
requires those, abandons and despises her worshippers, leaves the humbler provinces, and
allies herself with more powerful and richer peoples, truly5032 loves warfare, and wishes to
be in the midst of battles, slaughter, death, and blood? If it is characteristic of the gods—if
only they are true gods, and those who it is fitting should be named according to the
meaning of this word and the power of divinity—to do5033 nothing wickedly, nothing unjustly,
to show5034 themselves equally gracious to all men without any partiality, would any
man believe that she was of divine origin, or showed5035 kindness worthy of the gods, who,
mixing herself up with the dissensions of men, destroyed the power of some, gave and
showed favour to others, bereft some of their liberty, raised others to the height of
power,—who, that one state might be pre-eminent, having been born to be the bane of the
human race, subjugated the guiltless world?</p>

<p>We do not deny that all these things which have been brought forward by you in opposition
are contained in the writings of the annalists. For we have ourselves also, according to
the measure and capacity of our powers, read these same things, and know that they have
been alleged; but the whole discussion hinges upon this: whether these are gods who you
assert are furious when displeased, and are soothed by games and sacrifices, or are something
far different, and should be separated from the notion even of this, and from its power.</p>
<p>For who, in the first place, thinks or believes that those are gods who are lost in joyful
pleasure at theatrical shows5037 and ballets, at horses running to no purpose; who set out
from heaven to behold silly and insipid acting, and grieve that they are injured, and that the
honours due to them are withheld if the pantomimist halts for a little, or the player, being
wearied, rests a little; who declare that the dancer has displeased them if some guilty fellow
passes through the middle of the circus to suffer the penalty and punishment of his deeds?
All which things, if they be sifted thoroughly and without any partiality, will be found to be
alien not only to the gods, but to any man of refinement, even if he has not been trained to
the utmost gravity and self-control.5038</p>
<p>For, in the first place, who is there who would suppose that those had been, or believe
that they are, gods, who have a nature which tends to5039 mischief and fury, and lay these5040

<note type="footnote">5036 This section, which is found in the ms. after the first sentence of ch. 44, was retained in the text of both
Roman editions, marked off, however, by asterisks in that of Ursinus, but was rejected by Gelenius and later
editors as the useless addition of some copyist. Oehler alone has seen that it is not “a collection of words gathered
carelessly and thoughtlessly” (Hildebrand), and maintained that we have in it the corrections of Arnobius
himself. If the three paragraphs are read carefully, it will be observed that the first is a transposition and reconstruction
of the first two sentences of ch. 39; the second a revision of the interrogations in ch. 41, but with the
sentence which there precedes placed after them here, whilst the third is made up of the same sentences in a
revised and enlarged form. Now this must be regarded as conclusive evidence against the hypothesis that these

from heaven to see geldings running in vain, and without any reason, and rejoice that some
of them pass the rest, that others are passed,5042 rush on, leaning forward, and, with their
heads towards the ground, are overturned on their backs with the chariots to which they are
yoked, are dragged along crippled, and limp with broken legs; who declare that the dancer
has displeased them if some wicked fellow passes through the middle of the circus to suffer
the punishment and penalty of his deeds; who grieve that they are injured, and that the
honours due to them are withheld if the pantomimist halts for a little, the player, being

<p>I.
(Note 9, p. 459.)</p>
<p>This is a most extraordinary note. The author uses “so to say” (="as it were”) merely to
qualify the figure, which a pagan might think extravagant. “This is, as it were, the door of
life:” the expression qualifies the rhetoric, not the Scripture, as such. On the contrary, I
should adduce this very passage as an instance of our author’s familiarity alike with the
spirit and the letter of two most important texts of the Gospel, which he expounds and enforces
with an earnest intelligence, and with a spirit truly evangelical.</p>

<p>II.
(Covered with garments, note 7, p. 469.)</p>
<p>A heathen might have retorted, had he known the Scriptures, by asking about the “white
robes” of angels, and the raiment of the risen Redeemer; e.g., Rev. i. 13. “Curious and unlearned
questions” concerning these matters have been stirred by a certain class of Christians.
(See Stier5046 and Olshausen.5047) But let us not reason from things terrestrial as regards
things celestial: our coarse material fabrics are “shadows of the true.” The robes of light are
realities, and are conformed to spiritual bodies, as even here a mist may envelop a tree. Because
of men’s stupid and carnally gross ideas, let it be said of “harps” and “phials,” and all
like phraseology as to things heavenly, once for all, “it doth not yet appear” what it means;
but they intimate realities unknown to sense, and “full of glory.”</p>

<p>III.
(The eyes of Jupiter, p. 483.)</p>
<p>Arnobius with remorseless vigour smites Jove himself,—the Optimus Maximus of
polytheism,—and, as I have said, with the assurance of one who feels that the Church’s triumph
over “lords many and gods many” is not far distant. The scholar will recall the language
of Terence,5048 where the youth, gazing on the obscene picture of Jupiter and Danäe, exclaims,—

</p>
<p>On which the great African Father5049 remarks pithily, “Omnes enim cultores talium
deorum, mox ut eos libido perpulerit, magis intuentur quid Jupiter fecerit, quam quid docuerit
Plato, vel censuerit Cato.” And here is not only the secret of the impotence of heathen
ethics, but the vindication of the Divine Wisdom in sending the God-Man. Men will resemble
that which they worship: law itself is incapable of supplying a sufficient motive. Hence,5050
“what the law could not do, in that it was weak,…God sending His own Son,” etc. Thus “the
foolishness of God is wiser than men,” and “the love of Christ constraineth us.”</p>
<p>“Talk they of morals? O Thou bleeding Lamb!
The grand morality is love of Thee.”</p>
<p>The world may sneer at faith, but only they who believe can love; and who ever loved
Christ without copying into his life the Sermon on the Mount, and, in some blest degree,
the holy example of his Master?</p>

<p>IV.
(For those freed from the bondage of the flesh, p. 488 and note 11.)</p>
<p>The early Christians prayed for the departed, that they might have their consummation
in body and spirit at the last day. Thus, these prayers for the faithful dead supply the strongest
argument against the purgatorial system, which supposes the dead in Christ (1) not to be in
repose at first, but (2) capable of being delivered out of “purgatory” into heaven, sooner or
later, by masses, etc. Thus, their situation in the intermediate state is not that of Scripture
(Rev. xiv. 13), nor do they wait for glory, according to Scripture, until that day (2 Tim. iv.
8). Archbishop Usher, therefore, bases a powerful argument against the Romish dogma, on
these primitive prayers for the departed. Compare vol. iii. p. 706, and vol. v. p. 222, this
series.</p>
<p>He divides it into five heads, as follows:5051—
<lg>
<l>“(1) Of the persons for whom, after death, prayers were offered;</l>
<l>“(2) Of the primary intention of these prayers;</l>
<l>“(3) Of the place and condition of souls departed;</l>

<l>“(5) Of the profit, to the persons prayed for, of these prayers.”</l>
<l>And his conclusion is, after a rich collation of testimonies, that “the commemoration</l>
<l>and prayers for the dead used by the ancient Church had not any relation with purgatory,</l>
<l>and therefore, whatsoever they were, Popish prayers we are sure they were not.”</l>

<p>V.
(The pine…sanctuary of the Great Mother, p. 504.)</p>
<p>I recall with interest the pine-cone of Dante’s comparison (Inferno, canto xxxi. 59) as I
saw it in the gardens of the Vatican. Valuable notes may be found in Longfellow’s translation,
vol. i. p. 328. It is eleven feet high, and once adorned the summit of Hadrian’s mausoleum,
so they say; but that was open, and had no apex on which it could be placed. It is made of
bronze, and, I think, belonged to the mysteries satirized by our author. It is less pardonable
to find the vilest relics of mythology on the very doors of St. Peter’s, where I have seen them
with astonishment. They were put there, according to M. Valery,5052 under Paul V.; “and
among the small mythological groups,” he adds, “may be distinguished Jupiter and Leda,
the Rape of Ganymede, some nymphs and satyrs, with other very singular devices for the
entrance of the most imposing of Christian temples.” It is painful to think of it; but the
heathenism to which the age of Leo X. had reduced the court of Rome must be contrasted
with the ideas of a Clement, an Athenagoras, and even of an Arnobius, in order to give us
a due sense of the crisis which, after so many appeals for a reformation “in the head and the
members” of the Latin communion, brought on the irrepressible revolt of Northern Europe
against the papacy.</p>

<p>VI.
(Sacrifices, p. 519.)</p>
<p>It must be felt that Arnobius here lays himself open to a severe retort. The God of
Christians is the author of sacrifice, and accepts the unspeakable sufferings of the innocent
Lamb for the sins of the whole world.</p>
<p>The answer, indeed, suggests itself, that the sacrifices of the heathen had no apparent
relation whatever to faith in this Atoning Lamb; none in the mysterious will of God that
this faith should be nurtured before the Advent by an institution in which He had no pleasure,
but which was profoundly harmonious with human thought and the self-consciousness of
human guilt.</p>

<pb n="1338"/>
<p>Arnobius would have written better had he been a better-instructed Christian. He demolishes
pagan rites, but he should have called up the Gentile mind to the truths covered
under its corruptions and superstitions. On this subject the reader will do well to consult
the work of a modern Arnobius, the eccentric Soame Jenyns, who called out such a controversy
in the last century about the truths and errors of his View of the Internal Evidence of
the Christian Religion,5053 to which he had become a convert from previous scepticism.
This essay attracted the attention of the Count. (Joseph) de Maistre, who read it in the French
translations of MM. le Tourneur and de Feller both, reflected it in his Considerations sur la
France,5054 and reproduced some of its admirable thoughts in the Soirées de St Pétersbourg.
5055 From these two striking writers, the one an Anglican and the other a rabid Ultramontane,
I must permit myself to condense an outline of their views of sacrifice.</p>
<p>So long as we know nothing of the origin of evil, we are not competent judges of what
is or is not a suitable remedy. Nobody can assure us that the sufferings of one may not be
in some way necessary to the good of the many. A tax may thus be laid upon innocence in
behalf of the guilty, and a voluntary sacrifice may be accepted from the Innocent (the Holy
One) for the payment of the debts of others. In spite of something illogical which seems to
cling to this idea, the fact of its universal adoption in all ages among men must be accounted
for,—the fact that all nations have always accepted this principle of expiatory sacrifice, innocent
men and innocent beasts suffering for the unjust. Never could this principle have
been thus universalized by human wisdom, for it seems to contradict reason; nor by human
stupidity, for ignorance never could have proposed such a paradox; nor could priestcraft
and kingcraft have obtained for it, among divers races and forms of society, with barbarians
and philosophers, freemen and slaves, alike, a common acceptance. It must therefore proceed
(1) from a natural instinct of humanity, or (2) from a divine revelation: both alike must be
recognised as the work of our Creator. Now, Christianity unveils the secret, presenting the
Son of God, made man, a voluntary sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. If it be a mystery,
still we do not wonder at the idea when we see one man paying the debts of another, and
so ransoming the debtor.5056 Christianity states this as God’s plan for the ransom of sinners.
Such is the fact: as to the why, it says nothing.5057 As to the philosophy of these mysteries,
we reason in vain; and, happily, the Gospel does not require us to reason. The Nicene Creed
<note type="footnote">5053 It appeared in Paris 1764. A more literal translation (by the Abbé de Feller) was published, Liege, 1779.</note>

merito dici possit.” Bellarmin, Opp., tom. iii. col. 1493, ed. Ingolstadt, 1601.</note>

<pb n="1339"/>
formulates the truth: “For us men and for our salvation He came down,” etc. But we are
called to profess no more than “I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.”</p>
<p>De Maistre responds as follows: This dogma is universal, and as old as creation; viz.,
the reversibility of the sufferings of innocence for the benefit of the guilty. As to the fall of man,
“earth felt the wound;”5058 “the whole creation groaneth and travaileth5059 in pain together.”
In this condition of things the human heart and mind have universally acquiesced in the
idea of expiation.5060…And as well the Gentile sacrifices (corrupted from Noah’s pure original)
as those which were perpetuated in their purity by the Hebrews on one spot, and
looking to their only explanation in the coming of one Redeemer, bear witness to the Wisdom
which framed the human mind and adapted its ordinances thereto with profound and divine
comprehension of all human wants and all human capabilities. When the infinite Victim
exclaimed upon the cross, “It is finished,” the veil was rent, the grand secret was unfolded.
For this event, God had prepared all mankind by the system of sacrifice which, even in its
corruption, had made preparation for the true elucidation.</p>
<p>In a word, then, Arnobius should have said this, as the Church was always saying it in
the perpetual commemoration of Calvary, in her Holy Eucharist, and in her annual Paschal
celebration. It was all summed up by the prophet a thousand years before “the Lamb of
God” was slain. By the prophet, the Lamb Himself expounds it all:5061—</p>
<p>“Sacrifice and meat-offering Thou wouldest not, but mine ears hast Thou opened: burntofferings
and sacrifice for sin hast Thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume
of the Book it is written of Me, that I should fulfil Thy will, O my God. I am content to do
it; yea, Thy law is within my heart.”</p>
<p>The expiatory sacrifice, the voluntary Victim, the profound design of God the Father,
are all here. But the infinite value of the sacrifice was unfolded when the Son of man was
identified by the poor Gentile centurion: “Truly this was the Son of God.”</p>

<head>NPNF1-10. St. Chrysostom: Homilies on the Gospel
of Saint Matthew</head>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Chrysostom, Saint</p>
<p>Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. This volume
contains St. John Chrysostom's homilies on the Gospel of
Matthew. Widely regarded as an eloquent speaker, these
homilies are a wonder to behold. The Nicene and Post-
Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and provide keen
translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some
of the greatest theologians of the Christian church. These
spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over
a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even
today!

<head>Preface to the American Edition.</head>
<p>This volume, according to the previous announcement of the publishers, contains a
reprint of the Oxford edition of the Homilies of St. Chrysostom on the gospel of St. Matthew.</p>
<p>The Homilies on this Gospel formed three volumes of the Oxford edition, published
respectively in 1843, 1844, and 1851. The dedication appears in the third volume, as a memorial
of Archbishop Howley, who died in 1848. The preface is from the pen of Charles
Marriott of Oriel College.</p>
<p>As regards the present volume, it may be remarked that the archaic style of the English
translation has been preserved without material alteration. Even when obscure and involved,
the form seemed to be a fitting dress for the original. Occasionally an amendation, or rather
suggestion, has been made in a foot-note by the American editor. The spelling has been
altered throughout by the printer, to accord with the usage more common among us. Some
obvious typographical errors have been corrected, and these have usually been indicated.
Instead of the brackets, used in the Oxford edition, to mark words or phrases supplied by
the translator, Italics have been substituted. The same remark applies to passages where the
Greek text is in doubt. The editor has felt at liberty to indicate more fully than the translator
the portions supplied by the latter. In a few cases an emphatic word is printed in Italics, but
these instances can be readily distinguished from the passages above referred to.</p>
<p>The English translator of these Homilies was fortunate in having the Greek text of Mr.
Frederick Field as the basis of his renderings. This text is also accessible in the edition of
Migne, and has been compared throughout in the preparation of this volume. At the time
when the Oxford edition appeared textual criticism had received but slight attention in
England; hence the translator seems to have occasionally failed to estimate aright the value
of the authorities for various readings. But in few patristic works do we have better security
for the accuracy of the text than in the case of these Homilies on Matthew. The labor of the
American editor has been, of course, supplementary. Attention has been called quite frequently
to the Greek phrase used in the Homily, with a view to marking the usage in Ecclesiastical
Greek. Many foot-notes have been added, to indicate the readings of the New
Testament text appearing in the Homilies. The constant use of the Authorized Version by
the translator made this necessary. The Greek phrase has frequently been given; still more
frequently the rendering (and reading) of the Revised version. Where these agree with the
text of the Homily, they are cited, without comment, in brackets. Differences between
readings are carefully indicated.</p>
<p>Occasionally the editor has noted his dissent from the renderings or annotations of the
translator, but he has not felt warranted in expressing every difference of judgment. All ad-

<pb n="3"/>
ditions made in this volume are enclosed in brackets, and except in cases where the Revised
Version is cited without comment, the letter R. has been appended.</p>
<p>Much time and care have been bestowed upon the Indexes.</p>

<head>Preface to the Oxford Edition.</head>
<p>The Homilies of St. Chrysostom on St. Matthew were undoubtedly delivered at Antioch
(see Hom. vii. p. 43) and probably in the latter part of the time during which he preached
as a Presbyter. Montfaucon considers his little mention of the sin of swearing a sign of his
having accomplished some reformation on that point by his previous exertions. In the
Homilies delivered from 386 to 388, it is a constant topic; and the Homilies known to belong
to that date are so numerous, as scarcely leave room for such a series as the present. These,
however, contain very little to mark the period to which they belong. The argument from
his reference to dissensions some time gone by, possibly those between St. Meletius and
Paulinus and Evagrius, in commenting on St. Matt. xxiii. 6. is not very conclusive.</p>
<p>A modern reader must sometimes be struck with finding in St. Chrysostom a kind of
criticism, which we are apt to think belongs only to later times. His main object, however,
is moral, and he searches out with diligence both the meaning and the applications of particular
passages, usually concluding with an eloquent exhortation to some special virtue.
Some of the most remarkable of these exhortations are on the subject of Alms-giving, which
he seems to have pressed with some success at last. His calculation in Hom. lxvi. as to what
might be done, is somewhat curious. In the end of Hom. lxxxviii. he demands a reformation
as the condition of his entering on the controversy with Infidels. In the next Homily he
discusses the evidence of the Resurrection with nearly the same arguments as would still be
used against an objector.</p>
<p>The Theatres are the theme of his frequent reprobation, and the Monks of the mountains
near Antioch of his praise. In Hom. lxix. and lxx. he describes their mode of life as an edifying
example to all. He frequently attacks the Anomoean or extreme Arian Heresy, and sometimes
also the Manichæan. It is perhaps worth while to recollect the nearly contemporaneous
prevalence of Manichæism in the West, as it appears in the early history of St. Augustine.
In Hom. lxxxvi. there are some remarks on the device of Satan by which evil is introduced
by little and little, which are worthy of consideration as applicable to the growth of erroneous
doctrine and practice within the Church.</p>
<p>For all information with respect to the Text and Manuscripts of these Homilies, the
learned reader is referred to the Greek Edition of Mr. Field, which has been of great service,
as affording a safe basis for the Translation. The paucity of materials possessed by Savile,
and the carelessness of the Benedictine Editor, had left much room for improvement by a
judicious and faithful use of the existing copies. It may now at last be hoped, that we have
a Text very closely approximating to the genuine work of the Author.</p>
<p>For the Translation, the Editors are indebted to the Rev. Sir George Prevost, M.A. of
Oriel College, and for the Index to the Rev. J. E. Tweed, M.A. of Christ Church, Oxford. It

<pb n="6"/>
will be their endeavor to complete the commentaries of St. Chrysostom on the New Testament,
by bringing out the remainder of the Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles, and those
on the Epistle to the Hebrews, as soon as they are able. In both instances, however, the corrupt
state of the Text has occasioned some difficulty and delay.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTORY ESSAY.</head>
<p>St. Chrysostom as an Exegete.</p>
<p>By M. B. Riddle, D.D.</p>
<p>The pre-eminence of Chrysostom as a preacher remains undisputed, despite the many
reversals of judgment that have resulted from modern historical investigations; no voice
has been raised against the popular verdict, repeated in every age, that awards to him the
first place among pulpit orators in the Eastern Church.</p>
<p>Nor has there been any serious difference of opinion in regard to his personal character.
His intense moral earnestness has always been recognized, and the man has been honored
because it was distinctly felt that the man gave power to the oration. “Golden mouth” avails
little, unless it belongs to a golden man. The rhetorical training of his earlier years doubtless
contributed much to his skill as a preacher, but his exegetical method was perhaps a still
more important factor.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="8"/>
<head>I. The Place of Chrysostom in the History of Exegesis.</head>
<p>The position held by Chrysostom in the history of exegesis is remarkable. Owing to a
peculiar combination of circumstances he, more than any of the Fathers, was enabled to
avoid the errors alike of the allegorizing and dogmatic tendencies. The former tendency
was the prevalent one in the Christian Church in the Ante-Nicene period; the latter, especially
in the West, became dominant during the Post-Nicene period, using for its own ends the
earlier erroneous theory. Chrysostom represents the Antiochian reaction against the allegorizing
method, while he ante-dates by a generation, at least, the time when the ecclesiastical
or dogmatic theory became overpowering in its influence. This historical position must be
recognized in estimating his character as an exegete, as well as in accounting for his eminence
as an interpreter of Scripture. Modern scholarship with comparative unanimity accords to
him this eminence. It is true that one is disposed to dissent from this judgment on first
reading the Homilies of Chrysostom. Trained in our modern exegetical methods the reader
may unconsciously compare the expositions of the Greek Father with those of Luther and
Calvin, if not with those of Meyer and Weiss. Such a comparison is of course an anachronism.
A study of other patristic exegetes must lead to an endorsement of the prevalent opinion as
to the merits of Chrysostom as an expositor. An immense mass of homiletical literature of
which he was the author has been preserved, and of course reveals very unequal results.
Marks of carelessness, especially in citation, abound; the habits of the “practical preacher”
often leads to long digressions, to elaboration of matters that at best hold only the relation
of a tangent to the truth of the text. Yet less than most pulpit orators does Chrysostom warp
the interpretation itself to suit his homiletical purpose. Occasionally vehement invective
occurs when an exegetical difficulty is encountered, and it is easy to suppose that unconsciously
the former has been used to cover up the latter. But there are few evidences of lack
of candor in the treatment of such difficulties. It must be confessed that Chrysostom is not
always true to his own principles of interpretation, yet these instances of inconsistency are
usually due to a desire to enforce an ethical lesson pertinent to the occasion, even though
the application was scarcely pertinent to the text. Owing to his ignorance of Hebrew,
Chrysostom was not properly equipped for the work of expounding the Old Testament. He
treats the LXX. as though it were of final authority, save in a few instances where the variations
of other Greek versions have occasioned discussion. Frequently he makes use of
verbal suggestions of the Greek that have no warrant in the Hebrew text. Yet, where he is
not thus misled, his comments on the Old Testament present the same characteristics as
those on the New.</p>
<p>The most marked peculiarity of Chrysostom as an exegete is his comparative freedom
from the allegorizing tendency that prevailed in the early Christian centuries. In contending
with the Jews, the Christian apologists, from Justin Martyr onward, had inevitably followed8

<pb n="9"/>
to some extent the methods of their opponents. The Jewish schools of interpreters, both at
Alexandria and in Palestine, while somewhat antagonistic to each other, had in common
this allegorizing habit. Argument about the meaning of the Old Testament necessarily
fostered a similar tendency among Christian writers. Moreover, the Christian authors of
the second and third centuries were not men of pre-eminent talent or acquirements. The
victory won by the church was ethical rather than intellectual. Then, as now, profound piety,
when not combined with accurate knowledge and mental acumen, delighted in mystical
fancies. Types could be invented far more easily than texts could be investigated. At length
this tendency found in Origen an advocate who had the ability to formulate its principles,
and also the learning and industry necessary to illustrate the method by copious comments
of his own. Facile princeps as a mystical interpreter, Origen’s influence is still felt, and in his
own age it was dominant in exegesis. It is true the dogmatic principle was already gaining
the mastery, yet both the Orthodox and their opponents made use of allegory: the former
combined the two tendencies, the latter placed them in antagonism. Curiously enough the
doctrinal controversy that arose in consequence of some of Origen’s views was made the
occasion of an attack upon Chrysostom, and the kindness he showed to certain Egyptian
monks, who were followers of Origen, became the pretext for those harsh measures which
resulted in his banishment and death.1 Yet Chrysostom, in his writings, shows no sympathy
with the philosophic speculations of Origen, and his method as an exegete is far removed
from that implied in the principles laid down by the latter. The great preacher never dishonors
the literal, or historical, sense of Scripture, and though he occasionally refers to interpretations
κατ ναγωγν, using the phrase applied by Origen to the mystical sense of passages, these are
never exalted above the plain meaning of the words of the text. No one living in the age of
Chrysostom could be a diligent student of the Bible and ignore the labors of Origen. Despite
his advocacy of the mystical theory and his excessive speculative tendency he had done more
for exegetical theology than any of his predecessors. In these days we owe him too much to
forget these services. The wonder is that Chrysostom, familiar with his writings, was so little
influenced by the erroneous hermeneutical principles he advocated and exemplified. The
earnest practical purpose of Chrysostom did much in preserving him from allegorizing, but
his training of Antioch under Diodorus, afterwards bishop of Tarsus, was probably still
more influential for good. Diodorus is reckoned the leader of the so-called Antiochian school
of exegetes. He was the first to oppose directly the false methods of Origen. It is true “the
Three Cappadocians,” Basil the Great, his brother Gregory of Nyssa, and his friend Gregory
of Nazianzen, had but a qualified admiration for the exegetical results attained by Origen,
though diligent in their use of his writings. The conflicts of the period interfered, however,
<note type="footnote">1 See Stephens, Life of St. Chrysostom, pp. 286–326; Schaff, History of the Christian Church, vol. III., pp. 702
et seq.</note>

<pb n="10"/>
with any decided hermeneutical advance; the dogmatic interest of the Arian controversy
still overshadowing all other theological movements. Diodorus (<sic>394</sic>) was president of a
monastery in the vicinity of Antioch. Under his guidance Chrysostom and his friend Basil
pursued a semi-monastic life of seclusion and study for nearly six years (ending in A.D.
381). Theodore, who was afterwards bishop of Mopsuestia, and the father of the Nestorian
theology, was also his friend and fellow-student. While Diodorus was not free from rationalizing
tendencies, he undoubtedly represents a healthy re-action toward the historico-exegetical
theory of interpretation. His writings and his influence on his two most distinguished
pupils, Chrysostom and Theodore, plainly prove this. “The practical element in Diodorus,
his method of literal and common-sense interpretation of Holy Scripture, was inherited
chiefly by Chrysostom; the intellectual vein, his conceptions of the relation between the
Godhead and Manhood in Christ, his opinions respecting the final restoration of mankind,
which were almost equivalent to a denial of eternal punishment, were reproduced mainly
by Theodore.”2</p>
<p>While the influence of the Antiochian school seems transient, it has achieved much in
stating more clearly the correct principles of interpretation; it has achieved still more in
preparing for his work the greatest preacher of the Greek church. Avoiding to a great extent
the extremes of both Origen and Diodorus, Chrysostom as an interpreter is probably nearer
to us than any Father of the Eastern Church. A careful study of his Homilies must lead to
that conviction. “He set forth the verbal meaning with constant attention to the course of
thought, and connected therewith, in harmony with the form which he had chosen, the religious
and moral observations which were founded directly on the text. Dogmatic and polemic
digressions were not necessarily excluded, but were never made the principal thing,
and the more or less frequently inserted allegorical additions appear rather as rhetorical
ornament and deference to custom than as something necessary to the expositor.”3</p>
<p>The doctrinal views of Chrysostom were positive and usually well defined. He does not
fail to oppose heretical opinions. So great a preacher could not be without a theology. Yet,
as already intimated, the dogmatic principle of interpretation does not dominate his exegesis
to any great extent.</p>
<p>It thus appears that, whatever may be defects in his expositions, however faulty his
comments may seem to us, Chrysostom stands as the representative of more correct principles
than any of the early Fathers. That his eminence as a preacher is due to this fact can scarcely
be doubted. A new interest in his writings would serve to emphasize the importance of adherence
to the historico-exegetical method of interpretation. Great pulpit orators do not

<head>II. Extent and Character of Chrysostom’s Exegetical Labors.</head>
<p>1. The exegetical labors of Chrysostom are embodied in his Homilies, of which more
than six hundred have been preserved. These are for the most part expository in their
character, usually forming a continuous series upon some book of Scripture. The parts of
the Bible thus treated are: in the Old Testament, Genesis and the Book of Psalms; in the
New Testament, all the books except the gospels of Mark and Luke, the Catholic Epistles
and Revelation. “Commentaries, properly so-called, he wrote only on the first eight chapters
of Isaiah and on the Epistle to the Galatians” (Schaff4). Most of the Homilies were preserved
by short-hand reports, but some were published by Chrysostom himself.5 There are internal
evidences that in many cases the spoken discourse had not been previously written, e.g., the
rebuke of applause and of inattention on account of some distracting incident. Previous
study is equally manifest in the expository portions; but the method of delivery as well as
the method of preservation must modify our judgment of the preacher’s exegetical accuracy.
Probably many of the inconsistencies and inexact citations, noticeable in the Homilies, are
due to one or the other of these causes.</p>
<p>From an exegetical point of view the Homilies on the Old Testament rank lowest, those
on the Pauline Epistles highest. The reasons for this are easily discovered. For the exposition
of the Old Testament Chrysostom did not have the necessary equipment, being ignorant of
Hebrew. In explaining the Gospels he fails to discuss the historical questions with fullness.
This was owing no doubt to his distinct homiletical purpose. For the same reason he passes
over most of the harmonistic questions, or answers them indefinitely. But in expounding
our Lord’s longer discourses the same qualities as an interpreter which fitted him so well
for explaining the Pauline Epistles enable him to rise to his full eminence.</p>
<p>2. In all the Homilies there is apparent a proper conception of the relation of the Old
Testament and the New. Chrysostom’s treatment of the two parts of revelation agrees in
many respects with the methods now generally accepted in the subdivision of Exegetical
Theology technically termed Biblical Theology. He recognized the progressive movement;
thus holding to the essential unity of Scripture, but also admitting the incompleteness of
the Old Testament and superiority of the New. The distinction between the two is never
regarded as an antagonism. Indeed some of the severest utterances in the Homilies is in
opposition to the error that denies the authority of the Old Testament as a revelation from
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. But the unity of the two parts of Scripture are not
maintained at the expense of the historical sense of the Old Testament. While Chrysostom
finds in the older revelation a prophecy of Christ who was to come, “he fails not also to
point out the moral aspect of prophecy as a system of teaching rather than prediction, as
<note type="footnote">4 History of the Christian Church, III., p. 939.</note>

<pb n="13"/>
preparatory to the advent of Jesus Christ in the flesh, not only by informing men’s minds,
but disciplining their hearts to receive Him.”6 Probably the absence of any polemical purpose
against the Jews aided him in attaining a position more correct than most of some of the
earlier Fathers. His view of the relation of Christ to the law is set forth in Homily XVI. on
Matthew.7 In his view of inspiration Chrysostom recognized the Divine-human character
of the Scriptures. While he does not formally state his theory, the method he adopts implies
the value of each and every part of the Bible, the importance of marking the sense of every
word. But the mechanical theory is nowhere suggested: it is in fact opposed by his statements
regarding the variations in the Gospels.8 Indeed no one could be such an expositor as
Chrysostom was without an acceptance alike of the Divine authority and human authorship
of the Scriptures. These not in antithesis, but in synthesis. Denying the former, there could
have been no such power in preaching; ignoring the latter, there would have been no such
care in his comments. This view of the Bible was the result of his profound and constant
study of it. The same study gave him the wealth of Scriptural illustration and suggestion so
noticeable in his Homilies. Knowledge of the whole Bible and love of the whole Bible are
manifest everywhere.</p>
<p>3. In textual criticism Chrysostom does not afford us the help that might be expected
from the extent of his labors. Origen is incomparably more useful to the textual critic. Even
in citing the LXX. many inaccuracies occur, and the Hebrew text is ignored, except in a few
cases where doctrinal discussion had arisen.9</p>
<p>As Westcott and Hort have shown,10the Syrian text of the New Testament had become
dominant in the Eastern church about A.D. 350. It held in the time of Chrysostom very
much the same position afterwards allowed to the received text during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Accordingly we find few indications of any critical investigations of
the text, and the variations from the Syrian text in the Homilies are neither numerous nor
important. Yet the differences from the received text of our day are worth noticing.11 In all
such matters, however, there enter several elements of uncertainty, combining to subtract
from the value of the Homilies or critical purposes.12 In the case of Chrysostom we know

<pb n="14"/>
that the Homilies were taken down by others. Hence we are not sure how accurately the
preacher made his citations, how correctly they were reported, nor how much of change
has been made by copyists in the interest of conformity to the text prevalent at the time of
transcription. Quite frequently the same passage occurs in two forms within the limits of
the same Homily. The labors of Mr. Field on the Greek text of Chrysostom show how much
remains to be done before we can cite this Father as a trustworthy witness in regard to the
minor variations of the New Testament text. Fortunately Tischendorf, who had access to a
very ancient codex of the Homilies on Matthew,13has given the results of his collation in
his painstaking way. As this codex was not included in the apparatus criticus of Mr. Field,
the supplementary value of Tischendorf’s citations is increased.</p>
<p>Some peculiar readings occur in the Homilies on Matthew; the most remarkable is,
however, a reading of Luke ix. 31. In Homily LVI. 3 (p. 346 of this volume), Chrysostom
expressly reads δξαν for ἔξοδον, commenting upon the word. It seems altogether probable
that there was no such reading prevalent in his day, but that the word δξ, which stands immediately
before in Luke ix. 31, was accidentally substituted for ἔξοδον. This might happen
from a slip of the memory on the part of Chrysostom, or some scribe might have made the
blunder in an isolated copy used by the preacher. In other respects Chrysostom is a witness
for the prevalence of the Antiochian or Syrian text, from which our received text has descended.
He ignores the pericope of the woman taken in adultery (John vii. 53, viii. 11), as do
all the Greek Fathers before the eighth century.</p>
<p>The minor variations do not fully appear in the Oxford translation, owing to the habit
of using the text of the Authorized Version, even when its differences from the text of
Chrysostom were quite obvious. Accordingly the emendations of the Revised Version have
been given, without comment, in the additional foot-notes to this volume, wherever that
Version represents more accurately the readings in the Homilies.</p>
<p>4. As already intimated, Chrysostom’s ignorance of Hebrew detracts from his trustworthiness
as an Old Testament expositor. In the New Testament he is much superior. Yet even
here he is open to criticism. Besides an occasional allegorizing comment, he shows much
inaccuracy, sometimes inconsistency, in dealing with the historical questions that arise in
connection with the Gospel History. He seems to have no taste for the dis cussion of such
questions. Augustin shows far more judgment in his treatment of these problems. But the
ethical purpose probably debarred Chrysostom from such investigations. As regards the
length of our Lord’s ministry, the vexed question of our Lord’s brethren, the identity of
Mary Magdalene and the woman who was a sinner, etc., we derive little satisfaction from
these Homilies. Occasionally topographical and archæological topics are referred to in terms
<note type="footnote">13 The codex is of the sixth century (Wolfenbüttel), designated in Tischendorf’s notes as Chrgue. See
Scrivener, Introduction, etc., p. 419.</note>

<pb n="15"/>
that are misleading or positively erroneous. Hence the Homilies on the Gospels are usually
estimated as less valuable than those on the Epistles.</p>
<p>But where the exegesis deals with the human heart, its motives, its weakness, or with
the grace and love of Jesus Christ, there Chrysostom rises, and remains “the Master in Israel.”
Few have made advances beyond him in commenting upon the parables, the miracles of
healing, the great discourses of our Lord. His sturdy common sense enabled him to expound
the great eschatological discourse (Matt. xxiv, xxv.) in a manner so free from chiliastic extravagance,
that to-day his exposition can be used with little alteration.</p>
<p>These characteristics of his exegesis fitted Chrysostom to excel in his exposition of the
Epistles. Here there is more of continuated and logical method than in the Homilies on the
Gospels. Each Epistle he is careful to consider “as a connected whole; and, in order to impress
this on his hearers, he frequently recapitulates at the beginning of a Homily all the steps by
which the part under consideration has been reached. In his introduction to each letter he
generally makes useful observations on the author, the time, place, and style of composition,
the readers for whom it was intended, the general character and arrangement of its contents.”
14 The Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews is accepted in all the references
to that book which occur in the Homilies or other portions of Scripture.</p>
<p>The doctrinal positions of Chrysostom naturally influence his explanations of certain
portions of the Epistle, but these are to be judged by the stage of development attained by
the theology of the Eastern Church in the Post-Nicene period.</p>
<p>The minute attention necessary in editing this volume has compelled the writer to note
the excellence of the great Greek Father as an exegete. Beginning the task with some prejudice,
mainly due to a knowledge of the inaccuracy of Chrysostom’s citations, he now gladly pays
his humble tribute to the genius of the author, hoping that students of the volume will be
enabled to echo the praises that for so many centuries have been bestowed upon John of
the Golden Mouth.</p>

<head>HOMILIES OF ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM,
ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE,
ON THE
GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>It were indeed meet for us not at all to require15the aid of the written Word, but to exhibit
a life so pure, that the grace of the Spirit should be instead of books to our souls, and
that as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our hearts be with the Spirit. But, since
we have utterly put away from us this grace, come, let us at any rate embrace the second
best course.</p>
<p>For that the former was better, God hath made manifest,16both by His words, and by
His doings. Since unto Noah, and unto Abraham, and unto his offspring, and unto Job, and
unto Moses too, He discoursed not by writings, but Himself by Himself, finding their mind
pure. But after the whole people of the Hebrews had fallen into the very pit of wickedness,
then and thereafter was a written word, and tables, and the admonition which is given by
these.</p>
<p>And this one may perceive was the case, not of the saints in the Old Testament only,
but also of those in the New. For neither to the apostles did God give anything in writing,
but instead of written words He promised that He would give them the grace of the Spirit:
for “He,” saith our Lord, “shall bring all things to your remembrance.”17 And that thou
mayest learn that this was far better, hear what He saith by the Prophet: “I will make a new
covenant with you, putting my laws into their mind, and in their heart I will write them,”
<note type="footnote">15 [μηδ δεσθαι, “not even to need,” as below in sec. 2.—R.]</note>

and, “they shall be all taught of God.”18 And Paul too, pointing out the same superiority,
said, that they had received a law “not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.”19</p>
<p>But since in process of time they made shipwreck, some with regard to doctrines, others
as to life and manners, there was again need that they should be put in remembrance by the
written word.</p>
<p>2. Reflect then how great an evil it is for us, who ought to live so purely as not even to
need written words, but to yield up our hearts, as books, to the Spirit; now that we have lost
that honor, and are come to have need of these, to fail again in duly employing even this
second remedy. For if it be a blame to stand in need of written words, and not to have
brought down on ourselves the grace of the Spirit; consider how heavy the charge of not
choosing to profit even after this assistance, but rather treating what is written with neglect,
as if it were cast forth without purpose, and at random, and so bringing down upon ourselves
our punishment with increase.20</p>
<p>But that no such effect may ensue, let us give strict heed unto the things that are written;
and let us learn how the Old Law was given on the one hand, how on the other the New
Covenant.</p>
<p>3. How then was that law given in time past, and when, and where? After the destruction
of the Egyptians, in the wilderness, on Mount Sinai, when smoke and fire were rising up
out of the mountain, a trumpet sounding, thunders and lightnings, and Moses entering into
the very depth of the cloud.21 But in the new covenant not so,—neither in a wilderness, nor
in a mountain, nor with smoke and darkness and cloud and tempest; but at the beginning
of the day, in a house, while all were sitting together, with great quietness, all took place.
For to those, being more unreasonable, and hard to guide, there was need of outward
pomp,22as of a wilderness, a mountain, a smoke, a sound of trumpet, and the other like
things: but they who were of a higher character, and submissive, and who had risen above
mere corporeal imaginations,23 Yea, for it was removal of punishment, and remission of
sins, and “righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,”24and adoption, and an inheritance
of Heaven, and a relationship unto the Son of God, which he came declaring unto
all; to enemies, to the perverse, to them that were sitting in darkness. What then could ever
be equal to these good tidings? God on earth, man in Heaven; and all became mingled to-

gether, angels joined the choirs of men, men had fellowship with the angels, and with the
other powers above: and one might see the long war brought to an end, and reconciliation
made between God and our nature,25the devil brought to shame, demons in flight, death
destroyed, Paradise opened, the curse blotted out, sin put out of the way, error driven off,
truth returning, the word of godliness everywhere sown, and flourishing in its growth, the
polity of those above planted on the earth, those powers in secure intercourse with us, and
on earth angels continually haunting, and hope abundant touching things to come.</p>
<p>Therefore he hath called the history good tidings, forasmuch as all other things surely
are words only without substance; as, for instance, plenty of wealth, greatness of power,
kingdoms, and glories, and honors, and whatever other things among men are accounted
to be good: but those which are published by the fishermen would be legitimately and
properly called good tidings: not only as being sure and immoveable blessings, and beyond
our deserts, but also as being given to us with all facility.</p>
<p>For not by laboring and sweating, not by fatigue and suffering, but merely as being beloved
of God, we received what we have received.</p>
<p>5. And why can it have been, that when there were so many disciples, two write only
from among the apostles, and two from among their followers? (For one that was a disciple
of Paul, and another of Peter, together with Matthew and John, wrote the Gospels.) It was
because they did nothing for vainglory, but all things for use.</p>
<p>“What then? Was not one evangelist sufficient to tell all?” One indeed was sufficient;
but if there be four that write, not at the same times, nor in the same places, neither after
having met together, and conversed one with another, and then they speak all things as it
were out of one mouth, this becomes a very great demonstration of the truth.26</p>
<p>6. “But the contrary,” it may be said, “hath come to pass, for in many places they are
convicted of discordance.” Nay, this very thing is a very great evidence of their truth. For if
they had agreed in all things exactly even to time, and place, and to the very words, none of
our enemies would have believed but that they had met together, and had written what they
wrote by some human compact; because such entire agreement as this cometh not of simplicity.
But now even that discordance which seems to exist in little matters delivers them
from all suspicion, and speaks clearly in behalf of the character of the writers.</p>
<p>But if there be anything touching times or places, which they have related differently,
this nothing27injures the truth of what they have said. And these things too, so far as God

shall enable us, we will endeavor, as we proceed, to point out; requiring you, together with
what we have mentioned, to observe, that in the chief heads, those which constitute our life
and furnish out28our doctrine, nowhere is any of them found to have disagreed, no not ever
so little.</p>
<p>But what are these points? Such as follow: That God became man, that He wrought
miracles, that He was crucified, that He was buried, that He rose again, that He ascended,
that He will judge, that He hath given commandments tending to salvation, that He hath
brought in a law not contrary to the Old Testament, that He is a Son, that He is only-begotten,
that He is a true Son, that He is of the same substance with the Father, and as many things
as are like these; for touching these we shall find that there is in them a full agreement.</p>
<p>And if amongst the miracles they have not all of them mentioned all, but one these, the
other those, let not this trouble thee. For if on the one hand one had spoken of all, the
number of the rest would have been superfluous; and if again all had written fresh things,
and different one from another, the proof of their agreement would not have been manifest.
For this cause they have both treated of many in common, and each of them hath also received
and declared something of his own; that, on the one hand, he might not seem superfluous,
and cast on the heap29to no purpose; on the other, he might make our test of the
truth of their affirmations perfect.30</p>
<p>7. Now Luke tells us also the cause wherefore he proceeds to write: “that thou mayest
hold,” saith he, “the certainty of the words wherein thou hast been instructed;”31that is, that
being continually reminded thou mayest hold to the certainty,32and abide in certainty.</p>
<p>But as to John, he hath himself kept silence touching the cause; yet,33(as a tradition34saith,
which hath come down to us from the first, even from the Fathers,) neither did
he come to write without purpose; but forasmuch as it had been the care of the three to
dwell upon the account of the dispensation,35and the doctrines of the Godhead were near

being left in silence, he, moved by Christ, then and not till then set himself to compose his
Gospel.36 And this is manifest both from the history itself, and from the opening of his
Gospel. For he doth not begin like the rest from beneath, but from above, from the same
point, at which he was aiming, and it was with a view to this that37he composed the whole
book. And not in the beginning only, but throughout all the Gospel, he is more lofty than
the rest.</p>
<p>Of Matthew again it is said,38 that when those who from amongst the Jews had believed
came to him, and besought him to leave to them in writing those same things, which he had
spoken to them by word, he also composed his Gospel in the language of the Hebrews. And
Mark too, in Egypt,39 is said to have done this self-same thing at the entreaty of the disciples.</p>
<p>For this cause then Matthew, as writing to Hebrews, sought to shew nothing more, than
that He was from Abraham, and David; but Luke, as discoursing to all in general, traces up
the account higher, going on even to Adam. And the one begins with His generation, because
nothing was so soothing to the Jew as to be told that Christ was the offspring of Abraham
and David: the other doth not so, but mentions many other things, and then proceeds to
the genealogy.</p>
<p>8. But the harmony between them we will establish, both by the whole world, which
hath received their statements, and by the very enemies of the truth. For many sects have
had birth, since their time, holding opinions opposed to their words; whereof some have
received all that they have said, while some have cut off from the rest certain portions of
their statements, and so retain them for themselves.40 But if there were any hostility41in
their statements, neither would the sects, who maintain the contrary part, have received all,

but only so much as seemed to harmonize with themselves; nor would those, which have
parted off a portion, be utterly refuted by that portion; so that the very fragments42cannot
be hid, but declare aloud their connexion43with the whole body. And like as if thou
shouldest take any part from the side of an animal, even in that part thou wouldest find all
the things out of which the whole is composed;—nerves and veins, bones, arteries, and
blood, and a sample, as one might say, of the whole lump;—so likewise with regard to the
Scriptures; in each portion of what is there stated, one may see the connexion with the whole
clearly appearing. Whereas, if they were in discord, neither could this have been pointed
out, and the doctrine itself had long since been brought to nought: “for every kingdom,”
saith He, “divided against itself shall not stand.”44 But now even in this shines forth the
might of the Spirit, namely, in that it prevailed on these men, engaged as they were in those
things which are more necessary and very urgent, to take no hurt at all from these little
matters.</p>
<p>Now, where each one was abiding, when he wrote, it is not right for us to affirm very
positively.</p>
<p>But that they are not opposed to each other, this we will endeavor to prove, throughout
the whole work. And thou, in accusing them of disagreement, art doing just the same as if
thou wert to insist upon their using the same words and forms of speech.</p>
<p>9. And I do not yet say, that those likewise who glory greatly in rhetoric and philosophy,
having many of them written many books touching the same matters, have not merely expressed
themselves differently, but have even spoken in opposition to one another (for it is
one thing to speak differently and another to speak at variance); none of these things do I
say. Far be it from me to frame our defense from the frenzy of those men, neither am I
willing out of falsehood to make recommendations for the truth.</p>
<p>But this I would be glad to inquire: how were the differing accounts believed? how did
they prevail? how was it that, while saying opposite things, they were admired, were believed,
were celebrated everywhere in the world?</p>
<p>And yet the witnesses of what they said were many, and many too were the adversaries
and enemies thereof. For they did not write these things in one corner and bury them, but
everywhere, by sea and by land, they unfolded them in the ears of all, and these things were
read in the presence of enemies, even as they are now, and none of the things which they
said offended any one. And very naturally, for it was a divine power that pervaded all, and
made it to prosper with all men.</p>

<p>10. For if it had not been so, how could the publican, and the fisherman, and the unlearned,
have attained to such philosophy?45 For things, which they that are without have
never been able to imagine, no not in a dream, are by these men with great certainty both
published and made convincing, and not in their lives only, but even after death: neither to
two men, nor twenty men, nor an hundred, nor a thousand, nor ten thousand, but to cities,
nations, and people, both to land and sea, in the land both of Greeks and barbarians, both
inhabited and desert; and all concerning things far beyond our nature. For leaving the earth,
all their discourse is concerning the things in heaven, while they bring in unto us another
principle of life, another manner of living: both wealth and poverty, freedom and slavery,
life and death, our world and our polity, all changed.</p>
<p>Not like Plato, who composed that ridiculous Republic,46or Zeno, or if there be any one
else that hath written a polity, or hath framed laws. For indeed, touching all these, it hath
been made manifest by themselves, that an evil spirit, and some cruel demon at war with
our race, a foe to modesty, and an enemy to good order, oversetting all things, hath made
his voice be heard in their soul. When, for example, they make their women common to
all, and stripping virgins naked in the Palæstra, bring them into the gaze of men; and when
they establish secret marriages, mingling all things together and confounding them, and
overturning the limits of nature, what else is there to say? For that these their sayings are
all inventions of devils, and contrary to nature, even nature herself would testify, not tolerating
what we have mentioned; and this, though they write not amidst persecutions, nor
dangers, nor fightings, but in all security and freedom, and deck it out with many ornaments
from many sources. But these doctrines of the fishermen, chased as they were, scourged and
in jeopardy, both learned and unlearned, both bond and free, both kings and private soldiers,
both barbarians and Greeks, have received with all good will.</p>
<p>11. And thou canst not say, that it was because these things were trifling and low, that
they were easily to be received by all men: nay, for these doctrines are far higher than those.
For as to virginity, they never imagined even the name thereof so much as in a dream, nor
yet of voluntary poverty, nor of fasting, nor of any other of those things that are high.</p>
<p>But they that are of our part not only exterminate lust, they chastise not only the act,
but even an unchaste look, and insulting language, and disorderly laughter, and dress, and
gait, and clamor, and they carry on their exactness even to the smallest things, and have

filled the whole earth with the plant of virginity. And touching God too, and the things in
heaven, they persuade men to be wise47with such knowledge as no one of those hath at any
time been able so much as to conceive in his mind. For how could they, who made for gods
images of beasts, and of monsters that crawl on the earth, and of other things still more vile?</p>
<p>Yet these high doctrines were both accepted and believed, and they flourish every day
and increase; but the others have passed away, and perished, having disappeared more easily
than spiders’ webs.</p>
<p>And very naturally, for they were demons that published these things; wherefore besides
their uncleanness, their obscurity is great, and the labor they require greater. For what could
be more ridiculous than that “republic,”48in which, besides what I have mentioned, the
philosopher, when he hath spent lines without number, that he may be able to shew what
justice is, hath over and above this prolixity filled his discourse with much indistinctness?
This, even if it did contain anything profitable, must needs be very useless for the life of
man. For if the husbandman and the smith, the builder and the pilot, and every one who
subsists by the labor of his hands, is to leave his trade, and his honest toils, and is to spend
such and such a number of years in order to learn what justice is; before he has learnt he
will often times be absolutely destroyed by hunger, and perish because of this justice, not
having learnt anything else useful to be known, and having ended his life by a cruel death.</p>
<p>12. But our lessons are not such; rather Christ hath taught49us what is just, and what is
seemly, and what is expedient, and all virtue in general, comprising it in few and plain words:
at one time saying that, “on two commandments hang the Law and the Prophets;”50that is
to say, on the love of God and on the love of our neighbor: at another time, “Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.”
51</p>
<p>And these things even to a laborer, and to a servant, and to a widow woman, and to a
very child, and to him that appeareth to be exceedingly slow of understanding, are all plain
to comprehend and easy to learn. For the lessons of the truth are like this; and the actual
result bears witness thereto. All at least have learned what things they are to do, and not
learned only, but been emulous also of them; and not in the cities alone nor in the midst of
the market places, but also in the summits of the mountains.</p>

<p>Yea, for there wilt thou see true wisdom52abounding, and choirs of angels shining forth
in a human body, and the commonwealth53of Heaven manifested here on earth. For a
commonwealth54did these fishermen too write for us, not with commands that it should
be embraced from childhood, like those others, nor making it a law that the virtuous man
must be so many years old, but addressing their discourse generally to every age. For those
lessons are children’s toys, but these are the truth of things.</p>
<p>And as a place for this their commonwealth55they have assigned Heaven, and God they
have brought in as the framer thereof, and as lawgiver of the statutes there set; as indeed
was their duty. And the rewards in their commonwealth56are not leaves of bay nor olive,
nor an allowance of meat in the public hall, nor statues of brass, these cold and ordinary
things, but a life which hath no end, and to become children of God, to join the angels’ choir,
and to stand by the royal throne, and to be always with Christ. And the popular guides of
this commonwealth57are publicans, and fishermen, and tent-makers, not such as have lived
for a short time, but such as are now living for ever. Therefore even after their death they
may possibly do the greatest good to the governed.</p>
<p>This republic58is at war not with men, but with devils, and those incorporeal powers.
Wherefore also their captain is no one of men, nor of angels, but God Himself. And the armor
too of these warriors suits the nature of the warfare, for it is not formed of hides and steel,
but of truth and of righteousness, and faith, and all true love of wisdom.59</p>
<p>13. Since then the aforesaid republic60is both the subject on which this book was written,
and it is now proposed for us to speak thereof, let us give careful heed to Matthew, discoursing
plainly concerning this: for what he saith is not his own, but all Christ’s, who hath made the
laws of this city.61 Let us give heed, I say, that we may be capable of enrolment therein, and
of shining forth among those that have already become citizens thereof, and are awaiting
those incorruptible crowns. To many, however, this discourse seems to be easy, while the
prophetic writings are difficult. But this again is the view of men who know not the depth
of the thoughts laid up therein. Wherefore I entreat you to follow us with much diligence,

so as to enter into the very ocean of the things written, with Christ for our guide at this our
entering in.</p>
<p>But in order that the word may be the more easy to learn, we pray and entreat you, as
we have done also with respect to the other Scriptures, to take up beforehand that portion
of the Scripture which we may be going to explain, that your reading may prepare the way
for your understanding (as also was the case with the eunuch62), and so may greatly facilitate
our task.</p>
<p>14. And this because63the questions are many and frequent. See, for instance, at once
in the beginning of his Gospel, how many difficulties might be raised one after the other.
As first, wherefore the genealogy of Joseph is traced, who was not father of Christ. Secondly,
whence may it be made manifest that He derives His origin from David, while the forefathers
of Mary, who bare Him, are not known, for the Virgin’s genealogy is not traced? Thirdly,
on what account Joseph’s genealogy is traced, when he had nothing to do with the birth;
while with regard to the Virgin, who was the very mother, it is not shown of what fathers,
or grandfathers, or ancestors, she is sprung.</p>
<p>And along with these things, this is also worth inquiry, wherefore it can be, that, when
tracing the genealogy through the men, he hath mentioned women also; and why since he
determined upon doing this, he yet did not mention them all, but passing over the more
eminent, such as Sarah, Rebecca, and as many as are like them, he hath brought forward
only them that are famed for some bad thing; as, for instance, if any was a harlot, or an
adulteress, or a mother by an unlawful marriage, if any was a stranger or barbarian. For he
hath made mention of the wife of Uriah, and of Thamar, and of Rahab, and of Ruth, of
whom one was of a strange race, another an harlot, another was defiled by her near kinsman,
and with him not in the form of marriage, but by a stolen intercourse, when she had put on
herself the mask of an harlot; and touching the wife of Uriah no one is ignorant, by reason
of the notoriety of the crime. And yet the evangelist hath passed by all the rest, and inserted
in the genealogy these alone. Whereas, if women were to be mentioned, all ought to be so;
if not all but some, then those famed in the way of virtue, not for evil deeds.</p>
<p>See you how much care is required of us straightway in the first beginning? and yet the
beginning seems to be plainer than the rest; to many perhaps even superfluous, as being a
mere numbering of names.</p>
<p>After this, another point again is worth inquiry; wherefore he hath omitted three kings.
For if, because they were exceeding ungodly, he therefore passed by their names in silence,
neither should he have mentioned the others, that were like them.</p>
<note type="footnote">62 Acts viii. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">63 [Κα γρ.]</note>

<pb n="26"/>
<p>And this again64is another question; why, after having spoken of fourteen generations,
he hath not in the third division maintained the number.65</p>
<p>And wherefore Luke hath made mention of other names, and not only not all of them
the same, but also many more of them, while Matthew hath both fewer and different, though
he too hath ended with Joseph, with whom Luke likewise concluded.</p>
<p>Ye see how much wakeful attention is needed on our part, not only for explanation, but
even that we may learn what things we have to explain. For neither is this a little matter, to
be able to find out the difficulties; there being also this other hard point, how Elizabeth, who
was of the Levitical tribe, was kinswoman to Mary.</p>
<p>15. But that we may not overload your memory, by stringing many things together, here
let us stay our discourse for a time. For it is enough for you in order that ye be thoroughly
roused, that you learn66the questions only. But if ye long for67their solution also, this again
depends on yourselves, before we speak. For if I see you thoroughly awakened, and longing
to learn, I will endeavor to add the solution also; but if gaping and not attending, I will
conceal both the difficulties, and their solution, in obedience to a divine law. For, saith He,
“Give not the holy things to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they
trample them under their feet.”68</p>
<p>But who is he that tramples them under foot? He that doth not account these things
precious, and venerable. And who, it may be asked, is so wretched as not to esteem these
things venerable, and more precious than all? He who doth not bestow on them so much
leisure as on the harlot women in the theatres of Satan. For there the multitude pass the
whole day, and give up not a few of their domestic concerns for the sake of this unseasonable
employment, and they retain with exactness whatever they have heard, and this though it
be to the injury of their souls, that they keep it. But here, where God is speaking, they will
not bear to tarry even a little time.</p>
<p>Therefore, let me warn you, we have nothing in common with Heaven, but our citizenship69goes
no further than words. And yet because of this, God hath threatened even hell,
not in order to cast us therein, but that He might persuade us to flee this grievous tyranny.
But we do the opposite, and run each day the way that leads thither, and while God is
commanding us not only to hear, but also to do what He saith, we do not submit so much
as to hearken.</p>

<p>When then, I pray thee, are we to do what is commanded, and to put our hand to the
works, if we do not endure so much as to hear the words that relate to them, but are impatient
and restless about the time we stay here, although it be exceedingly short?</p>
<p>16. And besides, when we are talking of indifferent matters, if we see those that are in
company do not attend, we call what they do an insult; but do we consider that we are provoking
God, if, while He is discoursing of such things as these, we despise what is said, and
look another way?</p>
<p>Why, he that is grown old, and hath travelled over much country, reports to us with all
exactness the number of stadia, and the situations of cities, their plans, and their harbors
and markets; but we ourselves know not even how far we are from the city that is in Heaven.
For surely we should have endeavored to shorten the space, had we known the distance.
That city being not only as far from us as Heaven is from the earth, but even much farther,
if we be negligent; like as, on the other hand, if we do our best,70even in one instant we shall
come to the gates thereof. For not by local space, but by moral disposition, are these distances
defined.</p>
<p>But thou knowest exactly the affairs of the world, as well new as old, and such too as
are quite ancient; thou canst number the princes under whom thou hast served in time past,
and the ruler of the games, and them that gained the prize, and the leaders of armies, matters
that are of no concern to thee; but who hath become ruler in this city, the first or the second
or the third, and for how long, each of them; and what each hath accomplished, and brought
to pass, thou hast not imagined even as in a dream. And the laws that are set in this city
thou wilt not endure to hear, nor attend to them, even when others tell thee of them. How
then, I pray thee, dost thou expect to obtain the blessings that are promised, when thou dost
not even attend to what is said?</p>
<p>17. But though never before, now, at any rate, let us do this. Yea, for we71are on the
point of entering into a city (if God permit) of gold, and more precious than any gold.</p>
<p>Let us then mark her foundations, her gates consisting of sapphires and pearls; for indeed
we have in Matthew an excellent guide. For through his gate we shall now enter in, and
much diligence is required on our part. For should He see any one not attentive, He casts
him out of the city.</p>
<p>Yes, for the city is most kingly and glorious; not as the cities with us, divided into a
market-place, and the royal courts; for there all is the court of the King. Let us open therefore
the gates of our mind, let us open our ears, and with great trembling, when on the point of
setting foot on the threshold, let us worship the King that is therein. For indeed the first
approach hath power straightway to confound the beholder.</p>
<note type="footnote">70 [σπουδζωμεν; the verb is rendered “endeavor” in the preceding sentence.—R.]</note>

<pb n="28"/>
<p>For the present we find the gates closed; but when we see them thrown open (for this
is the solution of the difficulties), then we shall perceive the greatness of the splendor within.
For there also, leading thee with the eyes of the Spirit, is one who offers to show thee all,
even this Publican; where the King sitteth, and who of His host stand by Him; where are
the angels, where the archangels; and what place is set apart for the new citizens in this city,
and what kind of way it is that leads thither, and what manner of portion they have received,
who first were citizens therein, and those next after them, and such as followed these. And
how many are the orders of these tribes, how many those of the senate, how many the distinctions
of dignity.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore with noise or tumult enter in, but with a mystical silence.</p>
<p>For if in a theatre, when a great silence hath been made, then the letters of the king are
read, much more in this city must all be composed, and stand with soul and ear erect. For
it is not the letters of any earthly master, but of the Lord of angels, which are on the point
of being read.</p>
<p>If we would order ourselves on this wise, the grace itself of the Spirit will lead us in great
perfection, and we shall arrive at the very royal throne, and attain to all the good things, by
the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, together
with the Father and the Holy Ghost, now and always, even for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Do ye indeed remember the charge, which we lately made you, entreating you to hearken
unto all the things that are said with all silence, and mystical quietness? For72we are to-day
to set foot within the holy vestibule, wherefore I have also put you in mind of the charge.</p>
<p>Since, if the Jews, when they were to approach “a mountain that burned, and fire, and
blackness, and darkness, and tempest;”73—or rather when they were not so much as to approach,
but both to see and to hear these things from afar;—were commanded for three
days before to abstain from their wives, and to wash their garments, and were in trembling
and fear, both themselves and Moses with them; much more we, when we are to hearken
to such words, and are not to stand far from a smoking mountain, but to enter into Heaven
itself, ought to show forth a greater self-denial;74not washing our garments, but wiping clean
the robe of our soul, and ridding ourselves of all mixture with worldly things. For it is not
blackness that ye shall see, nor smoke, nor tempest, but the King Himself sitting on the
throne of that unspeakable glory, and angels, and archangels standing by Him, and the tribes
of the saints, with those interminable myriads.</p>
<p>For such is the city of God, having “the Church of the first-born, the spirits of the just,
the general assembly of the angels, the blood of sprinkling,”75whereby all are knit into one,
and Heaven hath received the things of earth, and earth the things of Heaven, and that peace
hath come which was of old longed for both by angels and by saints.</p>
<p>Herein standeth the trophy of the cross, glorious, and conspicuous, the spoils won by
Christ, the first-fruits76of our nature, the booty of our King; all these, I say, we shall out of
the Gospels know perfectly. If thou follow in becoming quietness, we shall be able to lead
thee about everywhere, and to show where death is set forth crucified, and where sin is
hanged up, and where are the many and wondrous offerings from this war, from this battle.</p>

or meat to this history. But if that kind of narrative be welcome, much more this. For consider
what a thing it is to hear, how on the one side God from Heaven, arising “out of the royal
thrones, leaped down78” unto the earth, and even unto hell itself, and stood in the battle
array; and how the devil on the other hand set himself in array against Him; or rather not
against God unveiled, but God hidden in man’s nature.</p>
<p>And what is marvellous, thou wilt see death destroyed by death, and curse extinguished
by curse, and the dominion of the devil put down by those very things whereby he did prevail.
Let us therefore rouse ourselves thoroughly, and let us not sleep, for lo, I see the gates
opening to us; but let us enter in with all seemly order, and with trembling, setting foot
straightway within the vestibule itself.</p>
<p>2. But what is this vestibule? “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David,
Son of Abraham.”</p>
<p>“What sayest thou? Didst thou not promise to discourse of the Only-begotten Son of
God, and dost thou make mention of David, a man born after a thousand generations, and
say that he is both father and ancestor?” Stay, seek not to learn all at once, but gently and
by little and little. Why, it is in the vestibule that thou art standing, by the very porch; why
then dost thou hasten towards the inner shrine? As yet thou hast not well marked all without.
For neither for a while do I declare unto thee that other generation: or rather not even this
which cometh after, for it is unutterable, and unspeakable. And before me the Prophet
Esaias hath told thee this; where79when proclaiming His passion, and His great care for the
world, and admiring who He was, and what He became, and whither He descended, he cried
out loud and clear, saying thus, “Who shall declare His generation?”80</p>
<p>It is not then of that we are now to speak, but of this beneath, this which took place on
earth, which was amongst ten thousand witnesses. And concerning this again we will relate
in such wise as it may be possible for us, having received the grace of the Spirit. For not even
this may any one set forth altogether plainly, forasmuch as this too is most awful. Think

not, therefore, it is of small things thou art hearing, when thou hearest of this birth, but
rouse up thy mind, and straightway tremble, being told that God hath come upon earth.
For so marvellous was this, and beyond expectation, that because of these things the very
angels formed a choir, and in behalf of the world offered up their praise for them, and the
prophets from the first were amazed at this, that “He was seen upon earth, and conversed
with men81.” Yea, for it is far beyond all thought to hear that God the Unspeakable,82the
Unutterable, the Incomprehensible, and He that is equal to the Father, hath passed through
a virgin’s womb, and hath vouchsafed to be born of a woman, and to have Abraham and
David for forefathers. But why do I say Abraham and David? For what is even more amazing,
there are those women, whom we have lately mentioned.</p>
<p>3. Hearing these things, arise, and surmise nothing low: but even because of this very
thing most of all shouldest thou marvel,83that being Son of the Unoriginate God, and His
true Son, He suffered Himself to be called also Son of David, that He might make thee Son
of God. He suffered a slave to be father to Him, that He might make the Lord Father to thee
a slave.</p>
<p>Seest thou at once from the beginning of what nature are the Gospels? If thou doubt
concerning the things that pertain to thee, from what belongs to Him believe these also. For
it is far more difficult, judging by human reason, for God to become man, than for a man
to be declared a Son of God. When therefore thou art told that the Son of God is Son of
David and of Abraham, doubt not any more that thou too, the son of Adam, shall be son
of God. For not at random, nor in vain did He abase Himself so greatly, only He was minded
to exalt us. Thus He was born after the flesh, that thou mightest be born after the Spirit; He
was born of a woman, that thou mightest cease to be the son of a woman.</p>
<p>Wherefore the birth was twofold, both made like unto us, and also surpassing ours. For
to be born of a woman indeed was our lot, but “to be born not of blood, nor of the will of
flesh, nor of man,” but of the Holy Ghost,84was to proclaim beforehand the birth surpassing
us, the birth to come, which He was about freely to give us of the Spirit. And everything else
too was like this. Thus His baptism also was of the same kind, for it partook of the old, and
it partook also of the new. To be baptized by the prophet marked the old, but the coming
down of the Spirit shadowed out the new. And like as though any one were to place himself
in the space between any two persons that were standing apart, and stretching forth both
his hands were to lay hold on either side, and tie them together; even so hath He done,

joining the old covenant with the new, God’s nature with man’s, the things that are His with
ours.</p>
<p>Seest thou the flashing brightness85of the city, with how great a splendor it hath dazzled
thee from the very beginning? how it hath straightway shown the King in thine own form;
as though in a camp? For neither there doth the king always appear bearing his proper dignity,
but laying aside the purple and the diadem, he often disguises himself in the garb of a
common soldier. But there it is, lest by being known he should draw the enemy upon himself;
but here on the contrary, lest, if He were known, He should cause the enemy to fly from the
conflict with Him, and lest He should confound all His own people: for His purpose was to
save, not to dismay.</p>
<p>4. For this reason he hath also straightway called Him by this title, naming Him Jesus.
For this name, Jesus, is not Greek, but in the Hebrew language it is thus called Jesus; which
is, when interpreted into the Greek tongue, “A Saviour.” And He is called a Saviour, from
His saving His people.</p>
<p>Seest thou how he hath given wings to the hearer, at once speaking things familiar, and
at the same time by these indicating to us things beyond all hope? I mean that86both these
names were well known to the Jews. For, because the things that were to happen were beyond
expectation, the types even of the names went before, in order that from the very first all
the unsettling power of novelty might be taken away. Thus he is called Jesus, who after
Moses brought the people into the land of promise. Hast thou seen the type? Behold the
truth. That led into the land of promise, this into heaven, and to the good things in the
heavens; that, after Moses was dead, this after the law had ceased; that as a leader, this as a
King.</p>
<p>However, lest having heard the word Jesus, thou shouldest by reason of the identity of
the name be perplexed, he hath added, “Jesus Christ, Son of David.” But that other was not
of David, but of another tribe.</p>
<p>5. But wherefore doth he call it a “book of the generation of Jesus Christ,” while yet this
book hath not the birth only, but the whole dispensation? Because this is the sum of the
whole dispensation, and is made an origin and root of all our blessings. As then Moses calleth
it the book of heaven and earth,87although he hath not discoursed of heaven and earth only,
but also of all things that are in the midst thereof; so also this man hath named his book
from that which is the sum of all the great things done. For that which teems with astonishment,
and is beyond hope and all expectation, is that God should become man. But this
having come to pass, all afterwards follows in reasonable consequence.</p>

<p>6. But wherefore did he not say, “the Son of Abraham,” and then “the Son of David?”
It is not, as some suppose, that he means to proceed upward from the lower point, since
then he would have done the same as Luke, but now he doth the contrary. Why then hath
he made mention of David? The man was in the mouths of all, both from his distinction,
and from the time, for he had not been so very long since dead, like Abraham. And though
God made promises to both, yet the one, as old, was passed over in silence, while the other,
as fresh and recent, was repeated of all. Themselves, for instance, say, “Doth not Christ come
of the seed of David, and out of Bethlehem, the town where David was?”88 And no man
called Him Son of Abraham, but all Son of David; and that because this last was more in
the recollection of all, both on account of the time, as I have already said, and because of
his royalty. On this principle again all the kings whom they had in honor after his time were
named from him, both by the people themselves and by God. For both Ezekiel89and other
prophets besides speak of David as coming and rising again; not meaning him that was
dead, but them who were emulating his virtue. And to Hezekiah He saith, “I will defend
this city, for mine own sake and for my servant David’s sake.”90 And to Solomon too He
said, that for David’s sake He rent not the kingdom during his lifetime.91 For great was the
glory of the man, both with God and with men.</p>
<p>On account of this he makes the beginning at once from him who was more known,
and then runs up to his father; accounting it superfluous, as far as regards the Jews, to carry
the genealogy higher up. For these were principally the persons held in admiration; the one
as a prophet and a king, the other as a patriarch and a prophet.</p>
<p>7. “But92whence is it manifest that He is of David?” one may say. For if He was not
sprung of a man, but from a woman only, and the Virgin hath not her genealogy traced,
how shall we know that He was of David’s race? Thus, there are two things inquired; both
why His mother’s genealogy is not recited, and wherefore it can be that Joseph is mentioned
by them, who hath no part in the birth: since the latter seems to be superfluous, and the
former a defect.</p>
<p>Of which then is it necessary to speak first? How the Virgin is of David. How then shall
we know that she is of David? Hearken unto God, telling Gabriel to go unto “a virgin betrothed
to a man (whose name was Joseph), of the house and lineage of David.”93 What

<pb n="34"/>
now wouldest thou have plainer than this, when thou hast heard that the Virgin was of the
house and lineage of David?</p>
<p>Hence it is evident that Joseph also was of the same. Yes, for there was a law, which bade
that it should not be lawful to take a wife from any other stock, but from the same tribe.
And the patriarch Jacob also foretold that He should arise out of the tribe of Judah, saying
on this wise: “there shall not fail a ruler out of Judah, nor a governor out of his loins, until
He come for whom it is appointed, and He is the expectation of the Gentiles.”94</p>
<p>“Well; this prophecy doth indeed make it clear that He was of the tribe of Judah, but
not also that He was of the family of David. Was there then in the tribe of Judah one family
only, even that of David, or were there not also many others? And might it not happen for
one to be of the tribe of Judah, but not also of the family of David?”</p>
<p>Nay, lest thou shouldest say this, the evangelist hath removed this suspicion of thine,
by saying, that He was “of the house and lineage of David.”</p>
<p>And if thou wish to learn this from another reason besides, neither shall we be at a loss
for another proof. For not only was it not allowed to take a wife out of another tribe, but
not even from another lineage, that is, from another kindred. So that if either we connect
with the Virgin the words, “of the house and lineage of David,” what hath been said stands
good; or if with Joseph, by that fact this also is proved. For if Joseph was of the house and
lineage of David, he would not have taken his wife from another than that whence he himself
was sprung.</p>
<p>“What then,” one may say, “if he transgressed the law?” Why, for this cause he hath by
anticipation testified that Joseph was righteous, on purpose that thou mightest not say this,
but having been told his virtue, mightest be sure also that he would not have transgressed
the law. For he who was so benevolent, and free from passion, as not to wish, even when
urged by suspicion, to attempt inflicting punishment on the Virgin, how should he have
transgressed the law for lust? he that showed wisdom and self-restraint beyond the law (for
to put her away, and that privily, was to act with self-restraint beyond the law), how should
he have done anything contrary to the law; and this when there was no cause to urge him?95</p>
<p>8. Now that the Virgin was of the race of David is indeed from these things evident; but
wherefore he gave not her genealogy, but Joseph’s, requires explanation. For what cause

<pb n="35"/>
was it then? It was not the law among the Jews that the genealogy of women should be
traced. In order then that he might keep the custom, and not seem to be making alterations96from
the beginning, and yet might make the Virgin known to us, for this cause he
hath passed over her ancestors in silence, and traced the genealogy of Joseph. For if he had
done this with respect to the Virgin, he would have seemed to be introducing novelties; and
if he had passed over Joseph in silence, we should not have known the Virgin’s forefathers.
In order therefore that we might learn, touching Mary, who she was, and of what origin,
and that the laws might remain undisturbed, he hath traced the genealogy of her espoused
husband, and shown him to be of the house of David. For when this hath been clearly proved,
that other fact is demonstrated with it, namely, that the Virgin likewise is sprung from
thence, by reason that this righteous man, even as I have already said, would not have endured
to take a wife from another race.</p>
<p>There is also another reason, which one might mention, of a more mystical nature, because
of which the Virgin’s forefathers were passed over in silence; but this it were not seasonable
now to declare, because so much has been already said.97</p>
<p>9. Wherefore let us stay at this point our discourse concerning the questions, and in the
meanwhile let us retain with accuracy what hath been revealed to us; as, for instance, why
he mentioned David first; wherefore he called the book, “a book of the generation;” on what
account he said, “of Jesus Christ;” how the birth is common and not common; whence it
was that Mary was shown to be from David; and wherefore Joseph’s genealogy is traced,
while her ancestors are passed over in silence.</p>
<p>For if ye retain these things, ye will the more encourage us with respect to what is to
come; but if ye reject and cast them from your mind, we shall be the more backward as to
the rest. Just as no husbandman would care to pay attention to a soil which had destroyed
the former seed.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you to revolve these things. For from taking thought concerning
such matters, there springs in the soul some great good, tending unto salvation. For by these
meditations we shall be able to please God Himself; and our mouths will be pure from insults,
and filthy talking, and reviling, while they are exercising themselves in spiritual sayings; and
we shall be formidable to the devils, while arming our tongue with such words; and we shall
draw unto ourselves God’s grace the more, and it will render our eye more piercing. For
indeed both eyes and mouth and hearing He set in us to this intent, that all our members
may serve Him, that we may speak His words, and do His deeds, that we may sing unto
Him continual hymns, that we may offer up sacrifices of thanksgiving,98and by these may
thoroughly purify our consciences.</p>

<p>For as a body will be more in health when enjoying the benefits of a pure air, even so
will a soul be more endued with practical wisdom99when nourished in such exercises as
these. Seest thou not even the eyes of the body, that when they abide in smoke they are always
weeping; but when they are in clear air, and in a meadow, and in fountains and gardens,
they become more quicksighted and more healthy? Like this is the soul’s eye also, for should
it feed in the meadow of spiritual oracles, it will be clear and piercing, and quick of sight;
but should it depart into the smoke of the things of this life, it will weep without end, and
wail both now and hereafter. For indeed the things of this life are like smoke. On this account
also one hath said, “My days have failed like smoke.”100 He indeed was referring to their
shortness of duration, and to their unsubstantial nature, but I would say that we should take
what is said, not in this sense alone, but also as to their turbid character.</p>
<p>For nothing doth so hurt and dim the eye of the soul as the crowd of worldly anxieties
and the swarm of desires. For these are the wood that feedeth this smoke. And as fire, when
it lays hold of any damp and saturated fuel, kindles much smoke; so likewise this desire, so
vehement and burning, when it lays hold of a soul that is (so to speak) damp and dissolute,
produces also in its way abundance of smoke. For this cause there is need of the dew of the
Spirit, and of that air, that it may extinguish the fire, and scatter the smoke, and give wings
to our thoughts. For it cannot, it cannot be that one weighed down with so great evils should
soar up to heaven; it is well if being without impediment101we can cleave our way thither;
or rather it is not possible even so, unless we obtain the wing of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now if there be need both of an unencum bered mind, and of spiritual grace, that we
may mount up to that height; what if there be none of these things, but we draw to ourselves
whatever is opposite to them, even a satanical weight? how shall we be able to soar upwards,
when dragged down by so great a load? For indeed, should any one attempt to weigh our
words as it were in just balances; in ten thousand talents of worldly talk he will scarcely find
an hundred pence of spiritual words, or rather, I should say, not even ten farthings. Is it not
then a disgrace, and an extreme mockery, that if we have a servant, we make use of him for
the most part in things necessary, but being possessed of a tongue, we do not deal with our
member so well even as with a slave, but on the contrary make use of it for things unprofitable,
and mere makeweights?102 And would it were only for makeweights:103but now it is

for what are contrary and hurtful and in no respect advantageous to us. For if the things
that we spoke were profitable to us, they would assuredly be also pleasing to God. But as it
is, whatever the devil may suggest, we speak it all, now laughing, and now speaking wittily;
now cursing and insulting, and now swearing, lying, and taking false oaths; now murmuring,
and now making vain babblings, and talking trifles more than old wives; uttering all things
that are of no concern to us.</p>
<p>For, tell me, who of you that stand here, if he were required, could repeat one Psalm,
or any other portion of the divine Scriptures? There is not one.</p>
<p>And it is not this only that is the grievous thing, but that while ye are become so backward
with respect to things spiritual, yet in regard of what belongs to Satan ye are more vehement
than fire. Thus should any one be minded to ask of you songs of devils and impure effeminate
melodies, he will find many that know these perfectly, and repeat them with much pleasure.</p>
<p>10. But what is the answer to these charges? “I am not,” you will say, “one of the monks,
but I have both a wife and children, and the care of a household.” Why, this is what hath
ruined all, your supposing that the reading of the divine Scriptures appertains to those only,
when ye need it much more than they. For they that dwell in the world,104and each day receive
wounds, these have most need of medicines. So that it is far worse than not reading,
to account the thing even “superfluous:” for these are the words of diabolical invention.
Hear ye not Paul saying, “that all these things are written for our admonition”?105</p>
<p>And thou, if thou hadst to take up a Gospel, wouldest not choose to do so with hands
unwashed; but the things that are laid up within it, dost thou not think to be highly necessary?
It is because of this, that all things are turned upside down.</p>
<p>For if thou wouldest learn how great is the profit of the Scriptures, examine thyself,
what thou becomest by hearing Psalms, and what by listening to a song of Satan; and how
thou art disposed when staying in a Church, and how when sitting in a theatre; and thou
wilt see that great is the difference between this soul and that, although both be one.
Therefore Paul said, “Evil communications corrupt good manners.”106 For this cause we
have need continually of those songs, which serve as charms from the Spirit. Yes, for this it
is whereby we excel the irrational creatures, since with respect to all other things, we are
even exceedingly inferior to them.</p>
<p>This is a soul’s food, this its ornament, this its security; even as not to hear is famine
and wasting; for “I will give them,” saith He, “not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water,
but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.”107</p>

<p>What then can be more wretched? when the very evil, which God threatens in the way
of punishment, this thou art drawing upon thine head of thine own accord, bringing into
thy soul a sort of grievous famine, and making it the feeblest thing in the world? For it is its
nature both to be wasted and to be saved by words. Yea, this leads it on to anger; and the
same kind of thing again makes it meek: a filthy expression is wont to kindle it to lust, and
it is trained to temperance by speech full of gravity.</p>
<p>But if a word merely have such great power, tell me, how is it thou dost despise the
Scriptures? And if an admonition can do such great things, far more when the admonitions
are with the Spirit. Yes, for a word from the divine Scriptures, made to sound in the ear,
doth more than fire soften the hardened soul, and renders it fit for all good things.</p>
<p>11. In this way too did Paul, when he had found the Corinthians puffed up and inflamed,
compose them, and make them more considerate. For they were priding themselves on
those very things, touching which they ought to have been ashamed, and to have hid their
face. But after they had received the letter, hear the change in them, of which the Teacher
himself hath borne witness for them, saying on this wise: for “this very thing, that ye sorrowed
after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves,
yea, what indignation, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge.”108 In this way do we bring to order
servants and children, wives, and friends, and make our enemies friends.</p>
<p>In this way the great men too, they that were dear to God, became better. David, for
instance, after his sin, when he had had the benefit of certain words, then it was that he came
unto that most excellent repentance; and the apostles also by this mean became what they
did become, and drew after them the whole world.</p>
<p>“And what is the profit,” one may say, “when any one hears, but doeth not what is said?”
No little will the profit be even from hearing. For he will go on to condemn himself,109and
to groan inwardly, and will come in time also to do the things that are spoken of. But he
that doth not even know that he hath sinned, when will he cease from his negligence? when
will he condemn himself?</p>
<p>Let us not therefore despise the hearing of the divine Scriptures. For this is of Satan’s
devising; not suffering us to see the treasure, lest we should gain the riches. Therefore he
saith that the hearing the divine laws is nothing, lest he should see us from the hearing acquiring
the practice also.</p>

Why Joseph’s genealogy is traced, who had no part in the birth. And one cause we have

kept in secret from the prince of this world, as was also the Lord’s death; three most notable mysteries, yet done
in Secret of God.” [See Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. I., p. 57. The Greek given in this note is from the “briefer”
form of the Ignatian Epistles. But the “longer” form differs very little, and the Syriac version, brief as it is, contains
this sentence.—R.] And Origen, 6th Homily on St. Luke, says, “It has been well written in one of the epistles of
a certain martyr, I mean Ignatius, the next Bishop of Antioch after the blessed Peter, him who fought with wild
beasts in the persecution at Rome, ‘Now the virginity of Mary was kept in secret from the prince of this world.’
It was concealed because of Joseph, because of her espousals, because she was supposed to have a husband. For,
had she had no spouse or supposed husband, it could not have been concealed from the prince of this world.
For presently the thought would have silently occurred to the evil one, ‘How is she with child, who knoweth not
a man? This conception must be divine, it must be something higher than human nature.’ On the contrary, our
Saviour had purposed that the devil should be ignorant of his OEconomy and Incarnation: for which cause He
both in His birth concealed the same, and commanded His disciples afterwards that they should not make Him
known. Also when tempted by the devil in person, He no where owned Himself Son of God.” Origen then quotes
1 Cor. ii. 6–8, to the same effect. And in answer to the objection, How the devils which were from time to time
cast out knew Him to be the Son of God, he suggests that it might be owing to their inferiority in malice and
mischief: according to the rule among men, that the worse they are, the less they can know of Christ. [The
Homilies of Origen are not included in the Ante-Nicene Fathers.] See also a supposed Homily of St. Basil’s, De
Christi generatione, Ed. Ben. ii. 598, c.; and St. Jerome on St. Matt. i. 18.</note>

first, calling Himself Son of Man, and hath not everywhere clearly unfolded to us even His
equality with the Father; why dost thou wonder at His having for a time disguised this also,
taking order as He was for a certain great and marvellous purpose?111and would have condemned
her for adultery. For if in regard to the other matters, for which they had frequent
precedents likewise in the old dispensation, they were quite shameless in their obstinacy112(
for so, because He had cast out devils, they called Him possessed; and because He
healed on the Sabbath day, they supposed Him to be an adversary of God; and yet oftentimes
even before this had the Sabbath been broken), what would they not have said, if this had
been told them? Especially as113they had all time before this on their side, in that it never
had produced any such thing. For if after so many miracles they still called Him son of
Joseph, how before the miracles would they have believed that He was born of a virgin?</p>
<p>It is then for this reason that both Joseph has his genealogy traced, and the Virgin betrothed
to him. For if even he, who was both a just and wondrous man, required many
things, in order that he should receive that which had come to pass; an angel, and the vision
in dreams, and the testimony from the prophets; how could the Jews, being both dull and
depraved, and of so unfriendly spirit towards Him, have admitted this idea into their minds?
For the strangeness and novelty thereof would be sure greatly to disturb them, and the fact
that they had never so much as heard of such a thing having happened in the times of their
forefathers. For as the man who was once persuaded that He is Son of God, would after that
have no cause to doubt concerning this too; so he who was accounting Him to be a deceiver
and an adversary of God, how could he but have been yet more offended by this, and have
been led on unto the opposite114notion? For this cause neither do the apostles at the first
directly say this, but while of His resurrection they discourse much and often (forasmuch
as of this there were examples in the times before, although not such as this); that He was
born of a virgin they do not say always: nay, not even His mother herself ventured to utter
this. See, for instance, what saith the Virgin even to Himself: “Behold, Thy father and I have
sought Thee.”115 For if this suspicion had been entertained, neither would He any longer
have been accounted to be a Son of David, and this opinion not being held, many other evils
besides would have arisen. For this cause neither do the angels say these things to all, but
to Mary only, and Joseph; but when showing to the shepherds the glad tidings of that which
was come to pass, they no longer added this.</p>

<p>2. But why is it, that having mentioned Abraham, and having said that “he begat Isaac,
and Isaac, Jacob;” and not having made any mention of his brother; when he is come to
Jacob, he remembers both “Judah, and his brethren”? Now there are some that say, it was
because of the perverseness of Esau, and of the rest that came before. But I should not say
this; for if it were so, how is it that he a little after mentions such women? It being out of
contraries, in this place, that His glory is manifested; not by having great forefathers, but
low and of little account. For to the lofty One it is a great glory to be able to abase Himself
exceedingly. Wherefore then did He not mention them? Because Saracens, and Ishmaelites,
and Arabians, and as many as are sprung from those ancestors, have nothing in common
with the race of the Israelites. For this cause then he passes over those in silence, and hastens
on to His forefathers, and those of the Jewish people. Wherefore he saith, “And Jacob begat
Judas and his brethren.” For at this point the race of the Jews begins to have its peculiar
mark.</p>
<p>3. “And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar.”116“What doest thou, O man, putting
us in remembrance of a history that contains an unlawful intercourse?” But why is this
said?117 Since, if we were recounting the race of a mere man, one might naturally have been
silent touching these things; but if of God Incarnate, so far from being silent, one ought to
make a glory of them, showing forth His tender care, and His power. Yea, it was for this
cause He came, not to escape our disgraces, but to bear them away. Therefore as He is the
more admired, in that He not only died, but was even crucified (though the thing be opprobrious,
yet the more opprobrious the more doth it show Him full of love to man), so likewise
may we speak touching His birth; it is not only because He took flesh upon Him, and became
man, that we justly stand amazed at Him, but because He vouchsafed to have also such
kinsfolk, being in no respect ashamed of our evils. And this He was proclaiming from the
very beginnings of His birth, that He is ashamed of none of those things that belong to us;
while He teaches us also hereby, never to hide our face at our forefathers’ wickedness, but
to seek after one thing alone, even virtue. For such a man, though he have an alien for his
ancestor, though he have a mother who is a prostitute, or what you will, can take no hurt
thereby. For if the whoremonger himself, being changed, is nothing disgraced by his former
life, much more will the wickedness of his ancestry have no power to bring to shame him
that is sprung of an harlot or an adulteress, if he be virtuous.</p>
<p>But he did these things not only to instruct us, but also to bring down the haughtiness
of the Jews. For since they, negligent about virtue in their own souls, were parading the
name of Abraham,118thinking they had for a plea their forefathers’ virtue; he shows from
<note type="footnote">116 Matt. i. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">117 [More accurately, “But why is this? one may say.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">118 [τν Αβραμ νω κα κτω παρφερον.]</note>

<pb n="43"/>
the very beginning that it is not in these things men ought to glory, but in their own good
deeds.</p>
<p>Besides this, he is establishing another point also, to show that all are under sin, even
their forefathers themselves. At least their patriarch and namesake is shown to have committed
no small sin, for Thamar stands against him, to accuse his whoredom. And David
too had Solomon by the wife whom he corrupted. But if by the great ones the law was not
fulfilled, much more by the less. And if it was not fulfilled, all have sinned, and Christ’s
coming is become necessary.</p>
<p>For this cause he made mention also of the twelve patriarchs, by this again bringing
down their pride at the noble birth of their fathers. Because many of these also were born
of women that were slaves; but nevertheless the difference of the parents did not make a
difference in the children. For all were equally both patriarchs and heads of tribes. For this
is the precedence of the Church, this the prerogative of the nobility that is among us, taking
its type from the beginning. So that whether thou be bond or free, thou hast from thence
nothing more nor less; but the question is all about one thing only, namely, the mind, and
the disposition of the soul.</p>
<p>4. But besides what we have said, there is another cause also, wherefore he hath mentioned
even this history; for to be sure, Zara’s name was not cast at random on that of Phares.
(For indeed it was irrelevant, and superfluous, when he had mentioned Phares, from whom
he was to trace Christ’s genealogy, to mention Zara also.) Wherefore then did he mention
him? When Thamar was on the point of giving birth to them, the pangs having come upon
her, Zara put forth his hand first.119 Then the midwife, when she saw this, in order that the
first should be known, bound his hand with scarlet; but the child, when he was bound, drew
in his hand, and when he had drawn it in, Phares came forth first, and then Zara. The midwife
when she saw this said, “Why was the hedge broken up for thee?”120</p>
<p>Seest thou the dark expression of mysteries? For it was not without purpose that these
things were recorded for us: since neither was it worth our study to learn, what it might be
that the midwife said; nor worth a narrative to know, that he who came out second, put
forth his hand first. What then is the mysterious lesson?121 First, from the name of the
child122we learn what is inquired, for Phares is “a division,” and “a breach.” And moreover
<note type="footnote">119 Gen. xxxviii. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">120 Our marginal translation is, “Wherefore hast thou made this breach against thee?” Gen. xxxviii. 29. [R.V.

breach be upon thee!” The LXX. rendering, which Chrysostom cites, misses the suggestion of the original
Hebrew.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">121 τ ανιγμα.</note>
<note type="footnote">122 [τ προηγοπα το παιδου. The terms seem to be chosen to suggest that the name of the child came from the

<pb n="44"/>
from the thing itself, which took place; for it was not in the order of nature that, having
thrust out his hand, he should draw it in again when bound; these thing neither belonged
to a movement directed by reason, nor did they take place in the way of natural consequence.
For after the hand had found its way out, that another child should come forth before was
perhaps not unnatural; but that he should draw it back, and give a passage for another, was
no longer after the manner of children at the birth, but the grace of God was present with
the children, ordering these things, and sketching out for us by them a sort of image of the
things that were to come.</p>
<p>What then? Some of those who have examined these things accurately say, that these
children are a type of the two nations.123 And so in order that thou mightest learn that the
polity of the latter people shone forth previously to the origin of the former, the child that
hath the hand stretched forth doth not show itself entire, but draws even it in again; and
after his brother had glided forth whole, then he too appears entire. And this took place also
with regard to the two nations. I mean, that after the polity of the Church had been manifested
in the times of Abraham, and then had been withdrawn in the midst of its course, the Jewish
<note type="footnote">123 i.e., The Jewish and the Christian. Compare the 62d Homily on Genesis, t. i. 478, ed. Sav. “Zara being interpreted,
is ‘the East.’ And that these things did not take place at random, but were a type of what was to come,
the facts themselves indicate. For that which happened was not in the order of nature. For how was it possible,
when the hand had been bound with the scarlet thread, for it to be again drawn back to afford passage to him
who came after had there not been some divine power which before ordained these things, and as in a kind of
shadow drew out this figure; that at first and from the beginning Zara (that is the East, which is the type of the
Church) began to increase, and after it had made a little progress and then retired, the observance of the Law,
represented by Phares, came in: and after prevailing a long time, on a second advance of Zara, who had before
retired, made room on the contrary for the Church; I mean, the whole Jewish polity did so.” “Perhaps, however,
it is necessary now to state the matter more briefly and clearly. There was a beginning, like the putting forth of
Zara’s hand, in Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchisedek, Abraham, making extreme account of what might please God.
Afterwards, when they had grown into a multitude, and had heaped on themselves heavy burdens of sin, and
needed the benefit of some slight consolation, the Law was given as a kind of shadow, not as taking away sins,
but as declaring and making them manifest: that as imperfect children living on milk they might be capable of
attaining full age. But when even thus they failed of profiting, yea, kept mingling themselves up again with their
sins, all the while that the Law was pointing out the greatness of the same, He came who is our common Lord,
and freely bestowed on mankind this present spiritual polity, full of all virtue, whereof Zara was to stand as a
type. For this cause the evangelist also both mentioned Thamar and her children, saying, ‘Judas begat Pharez
and Zarah of Thamar.’” Compare also St. Cyr. of Alex. 6 lib. in Gen. t. i. 201, ed. Aubert; Theod. in Gen. qu. 96;
St. Aug. in Ps. 61, t. iv. 442, D. [A good specimen of the allegorizing exegesis which even such an expositor as
Chrysostom could indulge in. The detailed account of the birth of Pharez is justified by the importance attached
to the position of first-born.—R.]</note>

<pb n="45"/>
people came, and the legal polity, and then the new people appeared entire with their own
laws. Wherefore also the midwife saith, “Why was the hedge broken up for thee?” because
the law coming in had broken in upon the freedom of the polity. For indeed the Scripture
is ever wont to call the law a hedge; as the prophet saith: “Thou hast broken down her hedge,
so that all they which pass by the way do pluck off her grapes:”124and, “I have set a hedge
about it:”125and Paul, “Having broken down the middle wall of the hedge.”126 But others
say, that the saying, “Why was the hedge broken up for thee?” was spoken touching the new
people: for this at its coming put down the law.127</p>
<p>5. Seest thou that it was not for few nor small causes that he brought to our remembrance
the whole history concerning Judah? For this end he hath mentioned Ruth also and Rahab,
the one an alien, the other an harlot, that thou mayest learn that He came to do away with
all our ills. For He hath come as a Physician, not as a Judge. Therefore in like manner as
those of old took harlots for wives, even so God too espoused unto Himself the nature which
had played the harlot: and this also prophets128from the beginning declare to have taken
place with respect to the Synagogue. But that spouse was ungrateful towards Him who had
been an husband to her, whereas, the Church, when once delivered from the evils received
from our fathers, continued to embrace the Bridegroom.</p>
<p>See, for instance, what befell Ruth, how like it is to the things which belong to us. For
she was both of a strange race, and reduced to the utmost poverty, yet Boaz when he saw
her neither despised her poverty nor abhorred her mean birth, as Christ having received
the Church, being both an alien and in much poverty, took her to be partaker of the great
blessings. But even as Ruth, if she had not before left her father, and renounced household
and race, country and kindred, would not have attained unto this alliance; so the Church
too, having forsaken the customs which men had received from their fathers, then, and not
before,129became lovely to the Bridegroom. Of this therefore the prophet discourses unto
her, and saith, “Forget thy people, and thy father’s house, so shall the king have pleasure in
thy beauty.”130 This Ruth did too, and because of this she became a mother of kings, even
as the Church did likewise. For of her David himself sprung. So then to shame them by all

these things, and to prevail on them not to be high-minded, he hath both composed the
genealogy, and brought forward these women. Yes, for this last, through those who intervened,
was parent to the great king, and of these David is not ashamed. For it cannot, nay,
it cannot be that a man should be good or bad, obscure or glorious, either by the virtue or
by the vice of his forefathers; but if one must say somewhat even paradoxical, he shines forth
the more, who not being of worthy ancestors, has yet become excellent.</p>
<p>6. Let no one therefore be high-minded on account of these matters, but let him consider
the forefathers of the Lord, and put away all his haughtiness, and let good actions be his
pride; or rather, not even these. For thus it was that the Pharisee came to be inferior to the
Publican. Thus, if thou wouldest show the good work to be great, have no high thought,131and
thou hast proved it so much the greater. Make account that thou hast done nothing, and
then thou hast done all. For if, being sinners, when we account ourselves to be what we are,
we become righteous, as indeed the Publican did; how much more, when being righteous
we account ourselves to be sinners. Since if out of sinners men are made righteous by a lowly
mind (although this were not to be lowly-minded but to be right-minded); if then to be
right-minded avails so much in the case of sinners, consider what will not lowliness of mind
do with respect to righteous men.</p>
<p>Do not then mar thy labors, nor cast away from thee the fruits of thy toils, neither run
thou in vain, making frustrate all thy labor after the many courses thou hast run. Nay, for
thy Lord knows thy good works better than thou dost. Though thou give but a cup of cold
water, not even this doth He overlook; though thou contribute but a farthing, though thou
shouldest utter a sigh only, He receives it all with great favor and is mindful thereof, and
assigns for it great rewards.
But wherefore dost thou search out thine own doings, and bring them out before us
continually? Knowest thou not, that if thou praise thyself, God will no more praise thee?
even as if thou bewail thyself,132 He will not cease proclaiming thee before all. For it is not
at all His will that thy labors should be disparaged. Why do I say, disparaged? Nay, He is
doing and contriving all things, so that even for little He may crown thee; and He goes about
seeking excuses, whereby thou mayest be delivered from hell. For this cause, though thou
shouldest work but the eleventh hour of the day, He gives thy wages entire; and though thou
afford no ground of salvation, He saith, “I do it for mine own sake, that my name be not
profaned:”133though thou shouldest sigh only, though thou shouldest only weep, all these
things He quickly catches hold of, for an occasion of saving thee.</p>

<p>Let us not therefore lift up ourselves, but let us declare ourselves unprofitable, that we
may become profitable. For if thou call thyself approved, thou art become unprofitable,
though thou wert approved; but if useless, thou art become profitable, even though thou
wert reprobate.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore it is necessary to forget our good actions. “Yet how is it possible,” one may
say, “not to know these things with which we are well acquainted?” How sayest thou? Offending
thy Lord perpetually, thou livest delicately, and laughest, and dost not so much as
know that thou hast sinned, but hast consigned all to oblivion; and of thy good actions canst
thou not put away the memory? And yet fear is a stronger kind of thing. But we do the very
contrary; on the one hand, whilst each day we are offending, we do not so much as put it
before our mind; on the other, if we give a little money to a poor person, this we are ever
revolving. This kind of conduct comes of utter madness, and it is a very great loss to him
who so makes his reckoning.134 For the secure storehouse of good works is to forget our
good works. And as with regard to raiment and gold, when we expose them in a marketplace,
we attract many ill-meaning persons; but if we put them by at home and hide them,
we shall deposit them all in security: even so with respect to our good deeds; if we are continually
keeping them in memory, we provoke the Lord, we arm the enemy, we invite him
to steal them away; but if no one know of them, besides Him who alone ought to know, they
will lie in safety.</p>
<p>Be not therefore for ever parading them, lest some one should take them away. As was
the case with the Pharisee, for bearing them about upon his lips; whence also the devil caught
them away. And yet it was with thanksgiving he made mention of them, and referred the
whole to God. But not even did this suffice Him. For it is not thanksgiving to revile others,
to be vainglorious before many, to exalt one’s self against them that have offended. Rather,
if thou art giving thanks to God, be content with Him only, and publish it not unto men,
neither condemn thy neighbor; for this is not thanksgiving. Wouldest thou learn words of
thanksgiving? hearken unto the Three Children, saying, “We have sinned, we have transgressed.
Thou art righteous, O Lord, in all that thou hast done unto us, because thou hast
brought all things upon us by a true judgment.”135 For to confess136one’s own sins, this is
to give thanks with confession137unto God: a kind of thing which implies one to be guilty
of numberless offenses, yet not to have the due penalty exacted. This man most of all is the
giver of thanks.</p>

<p>8. Let us beware therefore of saying anything about ourselves, for this renders us both
odious with men and abominable to God. For this reason, the greater the good works we
do, the less let us say of ourselves; this being the way to reap the greatest glory both with
men and with God. Or rather, not only glory from God, but a reward, yea, a great recompense.
Demand not therefore a reward that thou mayest receive a reward. Confess thyself to be
saved by grace, that He may profess Himself a debtor to thee; and not for thy good works
only, but also for such rightness of mind. For when we do good works, we have Him debtor
for our good works only; but when we do not so much as think we have done any good
work, then also for this disposition itself; and more for this, than for the other things: so
that this is equivalent to our good works. For should this be absent, neither will they appear
great. For in the same way, we too, when we have servants,138do then most approve them
when, after having performed all their service with good will, they do not think they have
done anything great. Wherefore, if thou wouldest make thy good deeds great, do not think
them to be great, and then they will be great.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the centurion also said, “I am not fit that thou shouldest enter
under my roof;” because of this, he became worthy, and was “marvelled at”139above all Jews.
On this wise again Paul saith, “I am not meet to be called an apostle;”140because of this he
became even first of all. So likewise John: “I am not meet to loose the latchet of His
shoe;”141because of this he was the “friend of the Bridegroom,” and the hand which he affirmed
to be unworthy to touch His shoes, this did Christ draw unto His own head.142 So
Peter too said, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man;”143because of this he became a
foundation of the Church.</p>
<p>For nothing is so acceptable to God as to number one’s self with the last. This is a first
principle of all practical wisdom.144 For he that is humbled, and bruised in heart, will not
be vainglorious, will not be wrathful, will not envy his neighbor, will not harbor any other

passion. For neither when a hand is bruised, though we strive ten thousand times, shall we
be able to lift it up on high. If therefore we were thus to bruise our heart145likewise, though
it were stirred by ten thousand swelling passions, it could not be lifted up, no, not ever so
little. For if a man, by mourning for things pertaining to this life, drives out all the diseases
of his soul, much more will he, who mourns for sins, enjoy the blessing of self-restraint.146</p>

who became illustrious chiefly because of this, and see the contrition of his soul. How after
ten thousand good works, and when he was on the point of being deprived of country, and
home, and life itself, at the very season of his calamity, seeing a vile and outcast common
soldier trample on the turn of his fortunes147and revile him; so far from reviling him again,
he utterly forbad one of his captains, who was desirous to have slain him, saying, “Let him
alone, for the Lord hath bidden him.”148 And again, when the priests desired to carry about
the ark of God149with him, he did not permit it; but what doth he say?150“Let me set it down
in the temple, and if God deliver me from the dangers that are before me, I shall see the
beauty thereof; but if He say to me, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let Him do
to me as seemeth good unto Him.” And that which was done with regard to Saul, again and
again, even oftentimes, what excellence of self-restraint doth it not show? Yea, for he even
surpassed the old law, and came near to the apostolic injunctions. For this cause he bore
with contentedness all that came from the Lord’s hands; not contending against what befell
him, but aiming at one object alone, namely, in everything to obey, and follow the laws set
by Him. And when after so many noble deeds on his part, he saw the tyrant, the parricide,
the murderer of his own brother, that injurious, that frenzied one, possessing in his stead
his own kingdom, not even so was he offended. But “if this please God,” saith he, “that I
should be chased, and wander, and flee, and that he should be in honor, I acquiesce, and
accept it, and do thank God for His many afflictions.” Not like many of the shameless and
impudent ones, who when they have not done, no not the least part of his good works, yet
if they see any in prosperity, and themselves enduring a little discouragement, ruin their
own souls by ten thousand blasphemies. But David was not such an one; rather he showed

<head>Homily IV.</head>
<p>Matt. I. 17.</p>
<p>“So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David
until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the carrying
away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.”</p>
<p>He hath divided all the generations into three portions, to indicate that not even when
their form of government was changed did they become better, but alike under an aristocracy,
and under a king, and under an oligarchy, they were in the same evil ways, and whether
popular leaders, or priests, or kings controlled them, it was no advantage to them in the way
of virtue.</p>
<p>But wherefore hath he in the middle portion passed over three kings, and in the last,
having set down twelve generations, affirmed them to be fourteen? The former question I
leave for you to examine;154for neither is it needful for me to explain all things to you, lest
ye should grow indolent: but the second we will explain.155 To me then he seems in this
place to be putting in the place of a generation, both the time of the captivity, and Christ
Himself, by every means connecting Him with us. And full well doth he put us in mind of
that captivity, making it manifest that not even when they went down thither, did they become
more sober-minded; in order that from everything His coming may be shown to be
necessary.</p>
<p>“Why then,” one may say, “doth not Mark do this, nor trace Christ’s genealogy, but utter
everything briefly?” It seems to me that Matthew was before the rest in entering on the
subject (wherefore he both sets down the genealogy with exactness, and stops at those things
which require it): but that Mark came after him, which is why he took a short course, as
putting his hand to what had been already spoken and made manifest.156</p>
<p>How is it then that Luke not only traces the genealogy, but doth it through a greater
number? As was natural, Matthew having led the way, he seeks to teach us somewhat in
addition to former statements. And each too in like manner imitated his master; the one
Paul, who flows fuller than any river; the other Peter, who studies brevity.</p>
<p>2. And what may be the reason that Matthew said not at the beginning, in the same way
as the prophet, “the vision which I saw,” and “the word which came unto me”? Because he
was writing unto men well disposed, and exceedingly attentive to him. For both the miracles
<note type="footnote">154 See St. Jerome in loc.</note>

names (forty) is given a symbolical significance.—R.]</note>

<pb n="52"/>
that were done cried aloud, and they who received the word were exceeding faithful. But in
the case of the prophets, there were neither so many miracles to proclaim them; and besides,
the tribe of the false prophets, no small one, was riotously breaking in upon them: to whom
the people of the Jews gave even more heed. This kind of opening therefore was necessary
in their case.</p>
<p>And if ever miracles were done, they were done for the aliens’ sake, to increase the
number of the proselytes; and for manifestation of God’s power, if haply their enemies
having taken them captives, fancied they prevailed, because their own gods were mighty:
like as in Egypt, out of which no small “mixed multitude”157went up; and, after that, in
Babylon, what befell touching the furnace and the dreams. And miracles were wrought also,
when they were by themselves in the wilderness; as also in our case: for among us too, when
we had just come out of error, many wonderful works were shown forth; but afterwards
they stayed, when in all countries true religion had taken root.</p>
<p>And what took place at a later period158were few and at intervals; for example, when
the sun stood still in its course, and started back in the opposite direction. And this one may
see to have occurred in our case also. For so even in our generation, in the instance of him
who surpassed all in ungodliness, I mean Julian, many strange things happened. Thus when
the Jews were attempting to raise up again the temple at Jerusalem, fire burst out from the
foundations, and utterly hindered them all; and when both his treasurer,159and his uncle
and namesake, made the sacred vessels the subject of their open insolence, the one was
“eaten with worms, and gave up the ghost,”160the other “burst asunder in the midst.”
Moreover, the fountains failing,161when sacrifices were made there, and the entrance of the

<note type="footnote">158 [Ε δ κα μετ τατα γγονεν.]</note>
<note type="footnote">159 “The tyrant commanded the sacred vessels to be delivered up to the imperial treasury.…Into the Temple
of God then,” at Antioch, “there entered, along with Julian the Prefect of the East, Felix the Steward of the Imperial
Treasures…And they say that Julian grievously insulted the sacred table, and when Euzoius” (the Arian
bishop) “endeavored to prevent him, he gave him a blow on the temple…Julian, however, presently fell into a
grievous disease, and had his bowels wasted with a kind of mortification…and so came to an end of his life.
Felix also for his part being afflicted with a scourge from God, had to vomit blood night and day from his
mouth…until he also wasted away.” Theodoret. E H. iii. 8, 9, ed. Schulze. See also Sozom. E. H. v. 8. St. Chrys.

<note type="footnote">161 He mentions this miracle too with the former ones, Hom. in Ps. cx. t. 1, 738; and in his first Hom. on St.
Paul, t. 8, 44. “The fountains among us, whose current is stronger than the rivers, shrank suddenly and started
back (a thing which never had occurred to them before), upon the Emperor’s attempting to defile the place with
sacrifices and libations.”</note>

<pb n="53"/>
famine into the cities together with the emperor himself, was a very great sign. For it is
usual with God to do such things; when evils are multiplied, and He sees His own people
afflicted, and their adversaries greatly intoxicated with their dominion over them, then to
display His own power; which he did also in Persia with respect to the Jews.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore, that he was not acting without an object, or by chance, when he distributed
Christ’s forefathers into three portions, is plain from what hath been said. And mark, too,
whence he begins, and where he ends. From Abraham to David; from David to the captivity
of Babylon; from this unto Christ Himself. For both at the beginning he put the two in close
succession, David and Abraham, and also in summing up he mentions both in the same
way. And this, because, as I have already said, it was to them that the promises were made.</p>
<p>But why can it be, that as he mentioned the captivity of Babylon, he did not mention
also the descent into Egypt? Because they had ceased to be any longer afraid of the Egyptians,
but the Babylonians they dreaded still. And the one thing was ancient, but the other fresh,
and had taken place of late. And to the one they were carried down for no sins, but to the
other, transgressions were the cause of their being removed.</p>
<p>And also with regard to the very names, if any one were to attempt to translate their
etymologies, even thence would he derive great matter of divine speculation,162and such as
is of great importance with regard to the New Testament: as, for instance, from Abraham’s
name, from Jacob’s, from Solomon’s, from Zorobabel’s. For it was not without purpose that
these names were given them. But lest we should seem to be wearisome by running out a
great length, let us pass these things by, and proceed to what is urgent.</p>
<p>4. Having then mentioned all His forefathers, and ending with Joseph, he did not stop
at this, but added, “Joseph the husband of Mary;” intimating that it was for her sake he
traced his genealogy also. Then, lest when thou hast heard of the “husband of Mary,” thou
shouldest suppose that Christ was born after the common law of nature, mark, how he sets
it right by that which follows. “Thou hast heard,” saith he, “of an husband, thou hast heard
of a mother, thou hast heard a name assigned to the child, therefore hear the manner too
of the birth.” “The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.”163“Of what kind of birth art thou
telling me, I pray thee, since thou hast already mentioned His ancestors?” “I still wish to tell
thee the manner also of His birth.” Seest thou, how he wakens up the hearer? For as though
he were about to speak of something unusual,164he promises to tell also the manner thereof.</p>

<pb n="54"/>
<p>And observe a most admirable order in the things he hath mentioned. For he did not
proceed directly to the birth, but puts us in mind first, how many generations he was from
Abraham, how many from David, and from the captivity of Babylon; and thus he sets the
careful hearer upon considering the times, to show that this is the Christ who was preached
by the prophets. For when thou hast numbered the generations, and hast learnt by the time
that this is He, thou wilt readily receive likewise the miracle which took place in His birth.
Thus, being about to tell of a certain great thing, His birth of a virgin, he first shadows over
the statement, until he hath numbered the generations, by speaking of “an husband of Mary;”
or rather he doth even put in short space165the narration of the birth itself, and then proceeds
to number also the years, reminding the hearer, that this is He, of whom the patriarch Jacob
had said, He should then at length come, when the Jewish rulers had come to an end; of
whom the prophet Daniel had proclaimed beforehand, that He should come after those
many weeks. And if any one, counting the years spoken of to Daniel by the angel in a
number of weeks, would trace down the time from the building of the city to His birth, by
reckoning he will perceive the one to agree with the other.166</p>
<p>5. How then was He born, I pray thee? “When as His mother Mary was espoused:”167
He saith not “virgin,” but merely “mother;” so that his account is easy to be received. And
so having beforehand prepared the hearer to look for some ordinary piece of information,
and by this laying hold of him, after all he amazes him by adding the marvellous fact, saying,
“Before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.” He saith not,
“before she was brought to the bridegroom’s house;” for indeed she was therein. It being
the way of the ancients for the most part to keep their espoused wives in their house:168in
those parts, at least, where one may see the same practised even now. Thus also Lot’s sonsin-
law were in his house with him. Mary then herself likewise was in the house with Joseph.</p>
<p>And wherefore did she not conceive before her espousal? It was, as I said at first, that
what had been done might be concealed awhile, and that the Virgin might escape every evil
suspicion. For when he, who had most right of all to feel jealousy, so far from making her
a show, or degrading her, is found even receiving and cherishing her after her conception;
it was quite clear that, unless he had fully persuaded himself that what was done was of the
operation of the Holy Spirit, he would not have kept her with him, and ministered to her
in all other things. And most properly hath he said, that “she was ‘found’ with child,” the
sort of expression that is wont to be used with respect to things strange, and such as happen
beyond all expectation, and are unlooked for.</p>

<pb n="55"/>
<p>Proceed therefore no further, neither require anything more than what hath been said;
neither say thou, “But how was it that the Spirit wrought this of a virgin?” For if, when nature
is at work, it is impossible to explain the manner of the formation; how, when the Spirit is
working miracles, shall we be able to express these? And lest thou shouldest weary the
evangelist, or disturb him by continually asking these things, he hath said who it was that
wrought the miracle, and so withdrawn himself. “For I know,” saith he, “nothing more, but
that what was done was the work of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>6. Shame on them who busy themselves touching the generation on high. For if this
birth, which hath witnesses without number, and had been proclaimed so long a time before,
and was manifested and handled with hands, can by no man be explained; of what excess
of madness do they come short who make themselves busy and curious touching that unutterable
generation? For neither Gabriel nor Matthew was able to say anything more, but
only that it was of the Spirit; but how, of the Spirit, or in what manner, neither of them hath
explained; for neither was it possible.</p>
<p>Nor think that thou hast learnt all, by hearing “of the Spirit;” nay, for we are ignorant
of many things, even when we have learnt this; as, for instance, how the Infinite is in a womb,
how He that contains all things is carried, as unborn, by a woman; how the Virgin bears,
and continues a virgin. How, I pray thee, did the Spirit frame that Temple? how did He take
not all the flesh from the womb, but a part thereof, and increased it, and fashioned it? For
that He did come forth of the Virgin’s flesh, He hath declared by speaking of “that which
was conceived in her;”169and Paul, by saying, “made of a woman;” whereby he stops the
mouths of them170that say, Christ came among us as through some conduit. For, if this
were so, what need of the womb? If this were so, He hath nothing in common with us, but
that flesh is of some other kind, and not of the mass which belongs to us. How then was He
of the root of Jesse? How was He a rod? how Son of man? how was Mary His mother? how
was He of David’s seed? how did he “take the form of a servant?”171how “was the Word

came, who is God over all?”173 Therefore that He was of us, and of our substance,174and of
the Virgin’s womb, is manifest from these things, and from others beside; but how, is not
also manifest. Do not either thou then inquire; but receive what is revealed, and be not
curious about what is kept secret.</p>
<p>7. “And Joseph her husband, being,” saith he “a just man, and not willing to make her
a public example, was minded to put her away privily.”175</p>
<p>Having said that it was of the Holy Ghost, and without cohabitation, he establishes his
statement in another way again.176 Lest any one should say, “Whence doth this appear?
Who hath heard, who hath seen any such thing ever come to pass?”—or lest you should
suspect the disciple as inventing these things to favor his Master;—he introduces Joseph as
contributing, by what he underwent, to the proof of the things mentioned; and by his narrative
all but says, “If thou doubt me, and if thou suspect my testimony, believe her husband.”
For “Joseph,” saith he, “her husband, being a just man.” By “a just man” in this place he
means him that is virtuous in all things. For both freedom from covetousness is justice, and
universal virtue is also justice;177and it is mostly in this latter sense that the Scripture uses
the name of justice; as when it saith, “a man that was just and true;”178and again, “they were
both just.”179 Being then “just,” that is good and considerate, “he was minded to put her
away privily.” For this intent he tells what took place before Joseph’s being fully informed,
that thou mightest not mistrust what was done after he knew. However, such a one was not
liable to be made a public example only, but that she should also be punished was the command
of the law. Whereas Joseph remitted not only that greater punishment, but the less
likewise, namely, the disgrace. For so far from punishing, he was not minded even to make
an example of her. Seest thou a man under self-restraint, and freed from the most tyrannical
of passions. For ye know how great a thing jealousy is: and therefore He said, to whom these
things are clearly known, “For full of jealousy is the rage of a husband;”180“he will not spare
in the day of vengeance:” and “jealousy is cruel as the grave.”181 And we too know of many

that have chosen to give up their lives rather than fall under the suspicion of jealousy. But
in this case it was not so little as suspicion, the burden of the womb entirely convicting her.
But nevertheless he was so free from passion as to be unwilling to grieve the Virgin even in
the least matters. Thus, whereas to keep her in his house seemed like a transgression of the
law, but to expose and bring her to trial would constrain him to deliver her to die; he doth
none of these things, but conducts himself now by a higher rule than the law. For grace being
come, there must needs henceforth be many tokens of that exalted citizenship. For as the
sun, though as yet he show not his beams, doth from afar by his light illumine more than
half182the world; so likewise Christ, when about to rise from that womb, even before He
came forth, shone over all the world. Wherefore, even before her travail, prophets danced
for joy, and women foretold what was to come, and John, when he had not yet come forth
from the belly, leaped from the very womb. Hence also this man exhibited great self-command,
in that he neither accused nor upbraided, but only set about putting her away.</p>
<p>8. The matter then being in this state, and all at their wits’ end,183the angel comes to
solve all their difficulties. But it is worth inquiring, why the angel did not speak sooner, before
the husband had such thoughts: but, “when he thought on it,” not until then, he came; for
it is said, “While he thought on these things, the angel” comes. And yet to her he declares
the good tidings even before she conceived. And this again contains another difficulty; for
even though the angel had not spoken, wherefore was the Virgin silent, who had been informed
by the angel; and why, when she saw her betrothed husband in trouble, did she not
put an end to his perplexity?</p>
<p>Wherefore then did not the angel speak before Joseph became troubled. For we must
needs explain the former difficulty first. For what reason then did he not speak? Lest Joseph
should be unbelieving, and the same happen to him as to Zacharias. For when the thing was
visible, belief was thenceforth easy; but when it had not yet a beginning, it was not equally
easy to receive his saying. For this reason the angel spake not at the first, and through the
same cause the Virgin too held her peace. For she did not think to obtain credit with her
betrothed husband, in declaring to him a thing unheard of, but rather that she should provoke
him the more, as though she were cloking a sin that had been committed. Since if she herself,
who was to receive so great a favor, is affected somewhat after the manner of man, and saith,
“How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?”184much more would he have doubted; and
especially when hearing it from the woman who was under suspicion. Wherefore the Virgin
saith nothing to him, but the angel, the time demanding it, presents himself to him.</p>
<note type="footnote">182 [τ πλεον.]</note>
<note type="footnote">183 [πντων ν μηχαν καθεσττων.]</note>
<note type="footnote">184 Luke i. 34.</note>

<pb n="58"/>
<p>9. Why then, it may be asked, did he not so in the Virgin’s case also, and declare the
good tidings to her after the conception? Lest she should be in agitation and great trouble.
For it were likely that she, not knowing the certainty, might have even devised something
amiss touching herself, and have gone on to strangle or to stab herself, not enduring the
disgrace. For wondrous indeed was that Virgin, and Luke points out her excellency, saying,
that when she heard the salutation, she did not straightway pour herself out,185neither did
she accept the saying, but “was troubled,” seeking “what manner of salutation this might
be.”186 Now she who was of such perfect delicacy would even have been distracted with
dismay at the thought of her shame, not expecting, by whatever she might say, to convince
any one who should hear of it, but that what had happened was adultery. Therefore to prevent
these things, the angel came before the conception. Besides that, it was meet that womb
should be free from trouble which the Maker of all things entered; and the soul rid of all
perturbation, which was thought worthy to become the minister of such mysteries. For these
reasons He speaks to the Virgin before the conception, but to Joseph at the time of travail.</p>
<p>And this many of the simpler sort, not understanding, have said there is a discordance;
because Luke saith it was Mary to whom he declared the good tidings, but Matthew, that it
was Joseph; not knowing that both took place. And this sort of thing it is necessary to bear
in mind throughout the whole history; for in this way we shall solve many seeming discordances.</p>
<p>10. The angel then comes, when Joseph is troubled. For in addition to the causes mentioned,
with a view also to the manifestation of his self-command, he defers his coming. But
when the thing was on the point of taking place, then at last he presents himself. “While he
thought on these things, an angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream.”187</p>
<p>Seest thou the mildness of the husband? So far from punishing, he did not even declare
it to any one, no not even to her whom he suspected, but was thinking it over with himself,
as aiming to conceal the cause even from the Virgin herself. For neither is it said that he
was minded to “cast her out,” but to “put her away,” so very mild and gentle was the man.
“But while he is thinking on these things, the angel appeareth in a dream.”</p>
<p>And why not openly, as to the shepherds, and to Zacharias, and to the Virgin? The man
was exceedingly full of faith, and needed not this vision. Whereas the Virgin, as having declared
to her very exceeding good tidings, greater than to Zacharias, and this before the
event, needed also a marvellous vision; and the shepherds, as being by disposition rather

dull and clownish.188 But this man, after the conception,189and wide the interval between
the two men; wherefore neither was there need of rebuke.</p>
<p>But by saying, “fear not,” he signifies him to have been afraid, lest he should give offense
to God, as retaining an adulteress; since, if it had not been for this, he would not have even
thought of casting her out. In all ways then he points out that the angel came from God,
bringing forward and setting before him all, both what he thought to do, and what he felt
in his mind.</p>
<p>Now having mentioned her name, he stayed not at this, but added also, “thy wife;”
whereas he would not have called her so, if she had been corrupted. And here he calls her
that is espoused “a wife;” as indeed the Scripture is wont to call betrothed husbands sonsin-
law even before marriage.</p>
<p>But what means, “to take unto thee?” To retain her in his house, for in intention she
had been now put away by him. “Her, being put away, do thou retain,” saith he, “as committed
unto thee by God, not by her parents. And He commits her not for marriage; but to
dwell with thee; and by my voice doth He commit her.” Much as Christ Himself afterwards
committed her to His disciple, so even now unto Joseph.</p>
<p>12. Then having obscurely signified the matter in hand, he mentioned not the evil suspicion;
but, in a manner more reverent and seemly, by telling the cause of travail he removed
this also; implying that the very thing which had made him afraid, and for which he would
have cast her out,—this very thing, I say, was a just cause why he should take her and retain
her in his house. Thus more than entirely190doing away with his distress. “For she is not
only free,” saith he, “from unlawful intercourse, but even above all nature is her conception.
Not only therefore put away thy fear, but even rejoice more exceedingly, ‘for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.’”</p>
<p>A strange thing it was which he spake of, surpassing man’s reason, and above all the
laws of nature. How then is he to believe, to whom such tidings are altogether new? “By the
things that are past,” saith he, “by the revelations.” For with this intent he laid open all things
that were in his mind, what he felt, what he feared, what he was resolved to do;—that by
these he might assure himself of this point.</p>
<p>Or rather, not by things past only, but like wise by things to come, he wins him over.
“And she shall bring forth,” saith he, “a Son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus.”191“For do
not thou, because He is of the Holy Ghost, imagine that thou art an alien to the ministry of
this dispensation. Since although in the birth thou hast no part, but the Virgin abode un-

touched, nevertheless, what pertains to a father, not injuring the honor of virginity, that do
I give thee, to set a Name on that which is born: for “thou shalt call Him.” For though the
offspring be not thine, yet shalt thou exhibit a father’s care towards Him. Wherefore I do
straightway, even from the giving of the name, connect thee with Him that is born.”</p>
<p>Then lest on the other hand any one should from this suspect him to be the father, hear
what follows, with what exact care he states it. “She shall bring forth,” he saith, “a Son:” he
doth not say, “bring forth to thee,” but merely “she shall bring forth,” putting it indefinitely:
192since not to him did she bring forth, but to the whole world.</p>
<p>13. For this cause too the angel came bringing His name from Heaven, hereby again
intimating that this is a wondrous birth: it being God Himself who sends the name from
above by the angel to Joseph. For neither was this without an object, but a treasure of ten
thousand blessings. Wherefore the angel also interprets it, and suggests good hopes, in this
way again leading him to belief. For to these things we are wont to be more inclined, and
therefore are also fonder of believing them.</p>
<p>So having established his faith by all, by the past things, by the future, by the present,
by the honor given to himself, he brings in the prophet also in good time, to give his suffrage
in support of all these. But before introducing him, he proclaims beforehand the good things
which were to befall the world through Him. And what are these? Sins removed and done
away.193“For He shall save His people from their sins.”</p>
<p>Here again the thing is signified to be beyond all expectation. For not from visible wars,
neither from barbarians, but what was far greater than these, from sins, he declares the glad
tidings of deliverance; a work which had never been possible to any one before.</p>
<p>But wherefore, one may ask, did he say, “His people,” and not add the Gentiles also?
That he might not startle the hearer yet a while. For to him that listens with understanding
he darkly signified the Gentiles too. For “His people” are not the Jews only, but also all that
draw nigh and receive the knowledge that is from Him.</p>
<p>And mark how he hath by the way discovered to us also His dignity, by calling the
Jewish nation “His people.” For this is the word of one implying nought else, but that He
who is born is God’s child, and that the King of those on high is the subject of his discourse.
As neither doth forgiving sins belong to any other power, but only to that single essence.</p>
<p>14. Forasmuch then as we have partaken of so great a gift, let us do everything not to
dishonor such a benefit. For if even before this honor, what was done was worthy of punishment,
much more now, after this unspeakable benefit. And this I say not now for no
cause,194but because I see many after their baptism living more carelessly than the uninitiated,

and having nothing peculiar to distinguish them in their way of life. It is, you see, for this
cause, that neither in the market nor in the Church is it possible to know quickly who is a
believer and who an unbeliever; unless one be present at the time of the mysteries, and see
the one sort put out, the others remaining within. Whereas they ought to be distinguished
not by their place, but by their way of life. For as men’s outward195dignities are naturally
to be discovered by the outward signs with which they are invested, so ours ought to be
discernible by the soul. That is, the believer ought to be manifest not by the gift only, but
also by the new life. The believer ought to be the light and salt of the world. But when thou
dost not give light even to thyself, neither bind up thine own gangrene, what remains,
whereby we are to know thee? Because thou hast entered the holy waters? Nay, this to thee
becomes a store196of punishment. For greatness of honor is, to them who do not choose to
live worthy of the honor, an increase of vengeance. Yea, the believer ought to shine forth
not only by what he hath received from God, but also by what he himself hath contributed;
and should be discernible by everything, by his gait, by his look, by his garb, by his voice.
And this I have said, not that display, but that the profit of beholders, may be the rule by
which we frame ourselves.</p>
<p>15. But now, what things soever I might seek to recognize thee by, I find thee in all
points distinguished by the contraries of the same. For whether by thy place I would fain
discern thee, I see thee spending thy day in horse races, and theatres, and scenes of lawlessness,
in the wicked assemblies in the market places, and in companies of depraved men; or
by the fashion of thy countenance, I see thee continually laughing to excess, and dissolute
as a grinning197and abandoned harlot; or by thy clothes, I see thee in no better trim than
the people on the stage; or by thy followers, thou art leading about parasites and flatterers;
or by thy words, I hear thee say nothing wholesome, nothing necessary, nothing of moment
to our life; or by thy table, yet heavier from thence will the charge against thee appear.</p>
<p>By what then, tell me, am I to recognize the believer198in thee, while all the things I have
mentioned give the contrary sentence? And why do I say, the believer? since I can not clearly
make out whether thou art a man. For when thou art like an ass, kicking, and like a bull,
wantoning, and like a horse neighing after women; when thou dost play the glutton like the
bear, and pamper thy flesh as the mule, and bear malice like the camel;199also?</p>

<p>Further, if I were bidding thee make another man gentle, not even so ought I to seem
as one enjoining impossible things; however, thou mightest then object that thou hast not
the control of another’s disposition, and that it doth not altogether rest with thee. But now
it is thine own wild beast, and a thing which absolutely depends on thee. What plea then
hast thou? or what fair excuse wilt thou be able to put forth, turning as thou art a lion into
a man, and regardless that thou thyself art of a man becoming a lion; upon the beast bestowing
what is above nature, but for thyself not even preserving what is natural? Yea, while the
wild beasts are by thine earnest endeavors advanced into our noble estate, thou art by thyself
cast down from the throne of the kingdom, and thrust out into their madness. Thus, imagine,
if thou wilt, thy wrath to be a kind of wild beast, and as much zeal as others have displayed
about lions, so much do thou in regard of thyself, and cause that way of taking things200to
become gentle and meek. Because this too hath grievous teeth and talons, and if thou tame
it not, it will lay waste all things. For not even lion nor serpent hath such power to rend the
vitals as wrath, with its iron talons continually doing so. Since it mars, we see, not the body
only, but the very health likewise of the soul is corrupted by it, devouring, rending, tearing
to pieces all its strength, and making it useless for everything. For if a man nourishing worms
in his entrails, shall not be able so much as to breathe, his inward parts all wasting away;
how shall we, having so large a serpent eating up all within us (it is wrath I mean), how, I
say, shall we be able to produce anything noble?</p>
<p>17. How then are we to be freed from this pest? If we can drink a potion that is able to
kill the worms within us and the serpents. “And of what nature,” it will be asked, “may this
potion be, that hath such power?” The precious Blood of Christ, if it be received with full
assurance,201(for this will have power to extinguish every disease); and together with this
the divine Scriptures carefully heard, and almsgiving added to our hearing; for by means of
all these things we shall be enabled to mortify the affections that mar our soul. And then
only shall we live; for now surely we are in no better state than the dead: forasmuch as it
cannot be, that while those passions live, we should live too, but we must necessarily perish.
And unless we first kill them here, they will be sure to kill us in the other life; or rather before
that death they will exact of us, even here, the utmost penalty. Yes, for every such passion
is both cruel and tyrannical and insatiable, and never ceases to devour us every day. For
“their teeth are the teeth of a lion,”202or rather even far more fierce. For the lion, as soon as
ever he is satisfied, is wont to leave the carcass that hath fallen in his way; but these passions
neither are satisfied, nor do they leave the man whom they have seized, until they have set
him nigh the devil. For so great is their power, that the very service which Paul showed forth
<note type="footnote">200 τν τοιοτον λογισμν.</note>

<note type="footnote">202 Joel i. 6.</note>

<pb n="63"/>
to Christ,203despising both hell and the kingdom for His sake, even this same do they require
of them whom they have seized. For whether it be with the love of women, or of riches, or
of glory, that any one is entangled, he laughs at hell thenceforth, and despises the kingdom,
that he may work the will of these. Let us not then doubt Paul when he saith that he so loved
Christ. For when some are found so doing service to their passions, how should that other
afterwards seem incredible? Yea, and this is the reason why our longing for Christ is feebler,
because all our strength is consumed on this love, and we rob, and defraud, and are slaves
to vainglory; than which what can be more worthless?</p>
<p>For though thou shouldest become infinitely conspicuous, thou wilt be nothing better
than the base: rather for this selfsame cause thou wilt even be baser. For when they who are
willing to give thee glory, and make thee illustrious, do for this very cause ridicule thee, that
thou desirest the glory which comes of them, how can such instances fail to turn the contrary
way in regard of thee. For indeed this thing is among those which attract censure. So that
even as in the case of one desiring to commit adultery or fornication, should any one praise
or flatter him, by this very act he becomes an accuser rather than a commender of the person
indulging such desires: so with regard to him who is desirous of glory; when we all praise,
it is accusation rather than praise which we bestow on those who wish to be made glorious.</p>
<p>18. Why then bring upon thyself that, from which the very opposite is wont to befall
thee. Yea, if thou wilt be glorified, despise glory; so shalt thou be more illustrious than any.
Why feel as Nebuchadnezzar felt? For he too set up an image, thinking from wood and from
a senseless figure to procure to himself an increase of fame, and the living would fain appear
more glorious by the help of that which hath no life. Seest thou the excess of his madness;
how, thinking to do honor, he rather offered insult, to himself? For when it appears that he
is relying rather on the lifeless thing, than on himself and the soul that lives in him, and
when for this cause he advances the stock unto such high precedence, how can he be other
than ridiculous, endeavoring as he doth to adorn himself, not by his way of living, but by
planks of wood? Just as if a man should think proper to give himself airs, because of the
pavement of his house, and his beautiful staircase rather than because he is a man. Him do
many too amongst us imitate now. For as he for his image, so some men claim to be admired
for their clothes, others for their house; or for their mules and chariots, and for the columns
in their house. For inasmuch as they have lost their being as men, they go about gathering
to themselves from other quarters such glory as is full of exceeding ridicule.</p>
<p>But as to the noble and great servants of God, not by these means, but by such as best
became them, even by such did they shine forth. For captives as they were, and slaves, and
youths, and strangers, and stripped of all resources of their own, they proved at that time
far more awful than he who was invested with all these things. And while Nebuchadnezzar
<note type="footnote">203 Rom. viii. 38.</note>

<pb n="64"/>
found neither so great an image, nor satraps, nor captains of the host, nor endless legions,
nor abundance of gold, nor other pomp, enough to meet his desire, and to show him great;
to these, on the other hand, stripped of all this, their high self-restraint alone was sufficient,
and showed him that wore the diadem and the purple, as much inferior in glory to those
who had no such thing, as the sun is more glorious than a pearl.204 For they were led forth
in the midst of the whole world, being at once youths, and captives, and slaves, and
straightway on their appearance the king darted fire from his eyes, and captains, and deputies,
and governors, and the whole amphitheatre of the devil, stood around; and a voice of pipes
from all sides, and of trumpets, and of all music, borne up to Heaven, was sounding in their
ears, and the furnace burned up to a boundless height, and the flame reached the very clouds,
and all was full of terror and dismay. But none of these things dismayed them, but they
laughed it all to scorn, as they would children mocking them, and exhibited their courage
and meekness, and uttering a voice clearer than those trumpets, they said, “Be it known
unto thee, O king.”205 For they did not wish to affront the king, no not so much as by a
word, but to declare their religion206only. For which cause, neither did they extend their
speech to any great length, but set forth all briefly; “For there is,” say they, “a God in Heaven,
who is able to deliver us,”207“why showest thou me the multitude? why the furnace? why
the sharpened swords? why the terrible guards? our Lord is higher and more mighty than
all these.”</p>
<p>Then when they considered that it was possible that God might be willing even to permit
them to be burnt; lest, if this should come to pass, they might seem to be speaking falsehoods;
they add this also and say, “If this happen not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we serve
not thy gods.”208 For had they said, “Sins are the cause of His not delivering us, should He
fail to deliver,” they would not have been believed. Wherefore in this place they are silent
on that subject, though they speak of it in the furnace, again and again alleging their sins.
But before the king they say no such thing; only, that though they were to be burnt, they
would not give up their religion.</p>
<p>For it was not for rewards and recompenses that they did what they did, but out of love
alone; and yet they were in captivity too, and in slavery, and had enjoyed no good thing.
Yea, they had lost their country, and their freedom, and all their possessions. For tell me
not of their honors in the king’s courts, for holy and righteous as they were, they would
have chosen ten thousand times rather to have been beggars at home, and to have been

partakers of the blessings in the temple. “For I had rather,” it is said, “be an outcast209in the
house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of sinners.” And “one day in thy courts is better
than thousands.”210 They would have chosen then ten thousand times rather to be outcasts
at home, than kings in Babylon. And this is manifest, from what they declare even in the
furnace, grieving at their continuance in that country. For although themselves enjoyed
great honors, yet seeing the calamities of the rest they were exceedingly vexed; and this kind
of thing is most especially characteristic of saints, that no glory, nor honor, nor anything
else should be more precious to them than their neighbor’s welfare. See, for example, how
even when they were in a furnace, they made their supplication for all the people. But we
not even when at large bear our brethren in mind. And again, when they were inquiring
about the dreams,211they were looking “not to their own but the common good,”212for that
they despised death they showed by many things afterwards. But everywhere they put
themselves forward, as wishing to prevail213with God by importunity. Next, as not accounting
themselves either to be sufficient, they flee to the Fathers; but of themselves they said that
they offer nothing more than “a contrite spirit.”214</p>
<p>19. These men then let us also imitate. Because now too there is set up a golden image,
even the tyranny of Mammon. But let us not give heed to the timbrels, nor to the flutes, nor
to the harps, nor to the rest of the pomp of riches; yea, though we must needs fall into a
furnace of poverty, let us choose it, rather than worship that idol, and there will be “in the
midst a moist whistling wind.”215 Let us not then shudder at hearing of “a furnace of poverty.”
For so too at that time they that fell into the furnace were shewn the more glorious, but they
that worshipped were destroyed. Only then all took place at once, but in this case some part
will be accomplished here, some there, some both here and in the day that is to come. For
they that have chosen poverty, in order that they might not worship mammon, will be more
glorious both here and then, but they that have been rich unjustly here, shall then pay the
utmost penalty.</p>

<p>From this furnace Lazarus too went forth, not less glorious than those children; but the
rich man who was in the place of them that worshipped the image, was condemned to
hell.216 For indeed what we have now mentioned was a type of this. Wherefore as in this
instance they who fell into the furnace suffered no hurt, but they who sat without were laid
hold of with great fierceness, so likewise shall it be then. The saints walking through the
river of fire shall suffer no pain, nay they will even appear joyous; but they that have worshipped
the image, shall see the fire rest upon them fiercer than any wild beast, and draw
them in. So that if any one disbelieves hell, when he sees this furnace, let him from the things
present believe things to come, and fear not the furnace of poverty, but the furnace of sin.
For this is flame and torment, but that, dew217and refreshment; and by this stands the devil,
by that, angels wafting aside the flame.</p>
<p>20. These things let them hear that are rich, that are kindling the furnace of poverty.
For though they shall not hurt those others, “the dew”218coming to their aid; yet themselves
they will render an easy prey to the flame, which they have kindled with their own hands.</p>
<p>Then, an angel went down with those children; now, let us go down with219them that
are in the furnace of poverty, and by alms-deeds let us make a “dewy air,”220and waft the
flame quite aside, that we may be partakers of their crowns also; that the flames of hell may
likewise be scattered by the voice of Christ saying, “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me.”221
For that voice shall then be with us instead of a “moist wind whistling”222through the midst
of the flame. Let us then go down with alms-giving, unto the furnace of poverty; let us behold
them that in self-restraint walk therein, and trample on the burning coals; let us behold the
marvel, strange and beyond thought, a man singing praise in a furnace, a man giving thanks
in fire, chained unto extreme poverty, yet offering much praise to Christ. Since they, who
bear poverty with thankfulness, really become equal to those children. For no flame is so
terrible as poverty, nor so apt to set us on fire. But those children were not set on fire; rather,
on their giving thanks to the Lord, their bonds too were at once loosed. So likewise now, if
when thou hast fallen into poverty, thou art thankful, both the bonds are loosened, and the
flame extinguished; or though it be not extinguished (what is much more marvellous), it
becomes a fountain instead of a flame: which then likewise came to pass, and in the midst

of a furnace they enjoyed a pure dew. For the fire indeed it quenched not, but the burning
of those cast in it altogether hindered. This one may see in their case also who live by the
rules of wisdom,223for they, even in poverty, feel more secure than the rich.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore sit down without the furnace, feeling no pity towards the poor; lest
the same befall us as then befell those executioners. For if thou shouldest go down to them,
and take thy stand with the children, the fire will no longer work thee any harm; but if thou
shouldest sit above and neglect them in the flame of their poverty, the flame will burn thee
up. Go down therefore into the fire, that thou mayest not be burnt up by the fire; sit not
down without the fire, lest the flame catch hold of thee. For if it should find thee amongst
the poor, it will depart from thee; but if alienated from them, it will run upon thee quickly,
and catch thee. Do not therefore stand off from them that are cast in, but when the devil
gives command to cast them that have not worshipped gold into the furnace of poverty, be
not thou of them that cast others in, but of them that are cast in; that thou mayest be of the
number of the saved, and not of the burned. For indeed it is a most effectual dew, to be held
in no subjection by desire of wealth, to be associate with poor persons. These are wealthier
than all, who have trampled under foot the desire of riches. Forasmuch as those children
too, by despising the king at that time, became more glorious than the king. And thou
therefore, if thou despise the things of the world, shalt become more honorable than all the
world; like those holy men, “of whom the world was not worthy.”224</p>
<p>In order then to become worthy of the things in Heaven, I bid thee laugh to scorn things
present. For in this way thou shalt both be more glorious here, and enjoy the good things
to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be glory and
might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet,
saying, Behold, a Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall
call His name Emmanuel.”</p>
<p>I Hear many say, “While we are here, and enjoying the privilege of hearing, we are awed,
but when we are gone out, we become altered men again, and the flame of zeal is quenched.”
What then may be done, that this may not come to pass? Let us observe whence it arises.
Whence then doth so great a change in us arise? From the unbecoming employment of our
time, and from the company of evil men. For we ought not as soon as we retire from the
Communion,225to plunge into business unsuited to the Communion, but as soon as ever
we get home, to take our Bible into our hands, and call our wife and children to join us in
putting together what we have heard, and then, not before, engage in the business of life.226
For if after the bath you would not choose to hurry into the market place, lest by the
business in the market you should destroy the refreshment thence derived; much more
ought we to act on this principle after the Communion. But as it is, we do the contrary, and
in this very way throw away all. For while the profitable effect of what hath been said to us
is not yet well fixed, the great force of the things that press upon us from without sweeps
all entirely away.</p>
<p>That this then may not be the case, when you retire from the Communion, you must
account nothing more necessary than that you should put together the things that have been
said to you. Yes, for it were the utmost folly for us, while we give up five and even six days
to the business of this life, not to bestow on things spiritual so much as one day, or rather
not so much as a small part of one day. See ye not our own children, that whatever lessons
are given them, those they study throughout the whole day? This then let us do likewise,
since otherwise we shall derive no profit from coming here, drawing water daily into a vessel
with holes, and not bestowing on the retaining of what we have heard even so much earnestness
as we plainly show with respect to gold and silver. For any one who has received a
few pence both puts them into a bag and sets a seal thereon; but we, having given us oracles

not put them away in the storehouses of our soul, but thoughtlessly and at random suffer

own interests, and casting ourselves into so deep poverty? Therefore, that this may not be

memory what hath been lately spoken, ye hearken accordingly to what comes afterwards.
For no little doth this also contribute towards the understanding of what is said, when ye
know accurately the connexion of the thoughts, which we are busy in weaving together for
you. For since it is not possible to set down all in one day, you must by continued remembrance
make the things laid before you on many days into a kind of chain, and so wrap it
about your soul: that the body of the Scriptures may appear entire.</p>
<p>Therefore let us not either to-day go on to the subjects set before us, without first recalling
what was lately said to our memory.227</p>
<p>2. But what are the things set before us to-day? “Now all this was done, that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying.” In a tone worthy of the
wonder, with all his might he hath uttered his voice, saying, “Now all this was done.” For
when he saw the sea and the abyss of the love of God towards man, and that actually come
to pass which never had been looked for, and nature’s laws broken, and reconciliations
made, Him who is above all come down to him that is lower than all, and “the middle walls
of partition broken,”228and the impediments removed, and many more things than these
done besides; in one word he hath put before us the miracle, saying, “Now all this was done
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord.” For, “think not,” saith he, “that
these things are now determined upon; they were prefigured of old.” Which same thing,
Paul also everywhere labors to prove.</p>
<p>And the angel proceeds to refer Joseph to Isaiah; in order that even if he should, when
awakened, forget his own words, as newly spoken, he might by being reminded of those of
the prophet, with which he had been nourished up continually, retain likewise the substance
of what he had said.229 And to the woman he mentioned none of these things, as being a
damsel and unskilled in them, but to the husband, as being a righteous man and one who

studied the prophets, from them he reasons. And before this he saith, “Mary, thy wife;” but
now, when he hath brought the prophet before him, he then trusts him with the name of
virginity; for Joseph would not have continued thus unshaken, when he heard from him of
a virgin, unless230he had first heard it also from Isaiah. For indeed it was nothing novel that
he was to hear out of the prophets,231but what was familiar to him, and had been for a long
time the subject of his meditations. For this cause the angel, to make what he said easy to
be received, brings in Isaiah. And neither here doth he stop, but connects the discourse with
God. For he doth not call the saying Isaiah’s, but that of the God of all things. For this cause
he said not, “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of Isaiah,” but “which was spoken
of the Lord.” For the mouth indeed was Isaiah’s, but the oracle was wafted from above.</p>
<p>3. What then saith this oracle? “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel.”</p>
<p>How was it then, one may say, that His name was not called Emmanuel, but Jesus Christ?
Because he said not, “thou shalt call,” but “they shall call,” that is, the multitude, and the
issue of events. For here he puts the event as a name: and this is customary in Scripture, to
substitute the events that take place for names.</p>
<p>Therefore, to say, “they shall call” Him “Emmanuel,” means nothing else than that they
shall see God amongst men. For He hath indeed always been amongst men, but never so
manifestly.</p>
<p>But if Jews are obstinate, we will ask the, when was the child called, “Make speed to the
spoil, hasten the prey?” Why, they could not say. How is it then that the prophet said, “Call
his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz?”232 Because, when he was born, there was a taking and
dividing of spoils, therefore the event that took place in his time is put as his name. And the
city, too, it is said, shall be called “the city of righteousness, the faithful city Sion.”233 And
yet we nowhere find that the city was called “righteousness,” but it continued to be called
Jerusalem. However, inasmuch as this came to pass in fact, when the city underwent a change
for the better, on that account he saith it is so called. For when any event happens which
marks out him who brings it to pass, or who is benefited by it, more clearly than his name,
the Scripture234speaks of the truth of the event as being a name to him.</p>

<p>4. But if, when their mouths are stopped on this point, they should seek another, namely,
what is said touching Mary’s virginity, and should object to us other translators,235saying,
that they used not the term “virgin,” but “young woman;” in the first place we will say this,
that the Seventy were justly entitled to confidence above all the others. For these made their
translation after Christ’s coming, continuing to be Jews, and may justly be suspected as
having spoken rather in enmity, and as darkening the prophecies on purpose; but the Seventy,
as having entered upon this work an hundred years or more before the coming of Christ,
stand clear from all such suspicion, and on account of the date, and of their number, and
of their agreement,236would have a better right to be trusted.</p>
<p>But even if they bring in the testimony of those others, yet so the tokens of victory would
be with us. Because the Scripture is wont to put the word “youth,” for “virginity;” and this
with respect not to women only, but also to men. For it is said, “young men and maidens,
old men with younger ones.”237 And again, speaking of the damsel who is attacked, it saith,
“if the young woman cry out,”238meaning the virgin.</p>
<p>And what goes before also establishes this interpretation. For he doth not merely say,
“Behold, the Virgin shall be with child,” but having first said, “Behold, the Lord Himself
shall give you a sign,” then he subjoins, “Behold, the Virgin shall be with child.”239 Whereas,
if she that was to give birth was not a virgin, but this happened in the way of marriage, what
sort of sign would the event be? For that which is a sign must of course be beyond the course
of common events, it must be strange and extraordinary; else how could it be a sign?</p>
<p>5. “Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him.”
Seest thou obedience, and a submissive mind? Seest thou a soul truly wakened, and in all
things incorruptible? For neither when he suspected something painful or amiss could he
endure to keep the Virgin with him; nor yet, after he was freed from this suspicion, could
he bear to cast her out, but he rather keeps her with him, and ministers to the whole Dispensation.</p>
<p>“And took unto him Mary his wife.” Seest thou how continually the evangelist uses this
word, not willing that that mystery should be disclosed as yet, and annihilating that evil
suspicion?</p>

<p>And when he had taken her, “he knew her not, till she had brought forth her first-born
Son.”240 He hath here used the word “till,” not that thou shouldest suspect that afterwards
he did know her, but to inform thee that before the birth the Virgin was wholly untouched
by man. But why then, it may be said, hath he used the word, “till”? Because it is usual in
Scripture often to do this, and to use this expression without reference to limited times. For
so with respect to the ark likewise, it is said, “The raven returned not till the earth was dried
up.”241 And yet it did not return even after that time. And when discoursing also of God,
the Scripture saith, “From age until age Thou art,”242not as fixing limits in this case. And
again when it is preaching the Gospel beforehand, and saying, “In his days shall righteousness
flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away,”243it doth not set a limit to
this fair part of creation. So then here likewise, it uses the word “till,” to make certain what
was before the birth, but as to what follows, it leaves thee to make the inference. Thus, what
it was necessary for thee to learn of Him, this He Himself hath said; that the Virgin was
untouched by man until the birth; but that which both was seen to be a consequence of the
former statement, and was acknowledged, this in its turn he leaves for thee to perceive;
namely, that not even after this, she having so become a mother, and having been counted
worthy of a new sort of travail, and a child-bearing so strange, could that righteous man
ever have endured to know her. For if he had known her, and had kept her in the place of
a wife, how is it that our Lord244commits her, as unprotected, and having no one, to His
disciple, and commands him to take her to his own home?</p>
<p>How then, one may say, are James and the others called His brethren? In the same kind
of way as Joseph himself was supposed to be husband of Mary. For many were the veils
provided, that the birth, being such as it was, might be for a time screened. Wherefore even
John so called them, saying, “For neither did His brethren believe in Him.”245</p>
<p>6. Nevertheless they, who did not believe at first, became afterwards admirable, and illustrious.
At least when Paul and they that were of his company were come up to Jerusalem
about decrees,246they went in straightway unto James. For he was so admired as even to be

the first to be entrusted with the bishop’s office. And they say he gave himself up to such
great austerity, that even his members became all of them as dead, and that from his continual
praying, and his perpetual intercourse with the ground, his forehead became so callous
as to be in no better state than a camel’s knees, simply by reason of his striking it so against
the earth.247 This man gives directions to Paul himself, when he was after this come up
again to Jerusalem, saying,248“Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are of them
that are come together.” So great was his understanding and his zeal, or rather so great the
power of Christ. For they that mock Him when living, after His death are so filled with awe,
as even to die for Him with exceeding readiness. Such things most of all show the power of
His resurrection. For this, you see, was the reason of the more glorious things being kept
till afterwards, viz. that this proof might become indisputable. For seeing that even those
who are admired amongst us in their life, when they are gone, are apt to be forgotten by us;
how was it that they, who made light of this Man living, afterwards thought Him to be God,
if He was but one of the many? How was it that they consented even to be slain for His sake,
unless they received His resurrection on clear proof?</p>
<p>7. And these things we tell you, that ye may not hear only, but imitate also his manly
severity,249his plainness of speech, his righteousness in all things; that no one may despair
of himself, though hitherto he have been careless, that he may set his hopes on nothing else,
after God’s mercy, but on his own virtue. For if these were nothing the better for such a
kindred, though they were of the same house and lineage with Christ, until they gave proof
of virtue; what favor can we possibly receive, when we plead righteous kinsmen and brethren,
unless we be exceeding dutiful,250and have lived in virtue? As the prophet too said, intimating
the selfsame thing, “A brother redeemeth not, shall a man redeem?”251 No, not although it
were252 Moses, Samuel, Jeremiah. Hear, for example, what God saith unto this last, “Pray
not thou for this people, for I will not hear thee.”253 And why marvellest thou if I hear not
thee? “Though Moses himself and Samuel stood before me,”254 I would not receive their
supplication for these men.” Yea, if it be Ezekiel who entreats, he will be told, “Though Noah
stand forth, and Job, and Daniel, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters.”255 Though

not, God will leave him and go His way,256that he may not receive his cry in their behalf.
Though again it be Samuel who is doing this, He saith unto him, “Mourn not thou for
Saul.”257 Though for his own sister one entreat, when it is not fitting, he again shall have
the same sort of answer as Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face.”258</p>
<p>Let us not then be looking open-mouthed towards others. For it is true, the prayers of
the saints have the greatest power; on condition however of our repentance and amendment.
Since even Moses, who had rescued his own brother and six hundred thousand men from
the wrath that was then coming upon them from God, had no power to deliver his sister;
259and yet the sin was not equal; for whereas she had done despite but to Moses, in that
other case it was plain impiety, what they ventured on. But this difficulty I leave for you;
while that which is yet harder, I will try to explain.</p>
<p>For why should we speak of his sister? since he who stood forth the advocate of so great
a people had not power to prevail for himself, but after his countless toils, and sufferings,
and his assiduity for forty years, was prohibited from setting foot on that land, touching
which there had been so many declarations and promises. What then was the cause? To
grant this favor would not be profitable, but would, on the contrary, bring with it much
harm, and would be sure to prove a stumbling-block to many of the Jews. For if when they
were merely delivered from Egypt, they forsook God, and sought after Moses, and imputed
all to him; had they seen him also lead them into the land of promise, to what extent of impiety
might they not have been cast away? And for this reason also, let me add, neither was
his tomb made known.</p>
<p>And Samuel again was not able to save Saul from the wrath from above, yet he oftentimes
preserved the Israelites. And Jeremiah prevailed not for the Jews, but some one else he did
haply cover from evil by his prophecy.260 And Daniel saved the barbarians from
slaughter,261but he did not deliver the Jews from their captivity.</p>
<p>And in the Gospels too we shall see both these events come to pass, not in the case of
different persons, but of the same; and the same man now prevailing for himself and now
given up. For he who owed the ten thousand talents, though he had delivered himself from

the danger by entreaty, yet again he prevailed not,262and another on the contrary, who had
before thrown himself away, afterwards had power to help himself in the greatest degree.263
But who is this? He that devoured his Father’s substance.</p>
<p>So that on the one hand, if we be careless, we shall not be able to obtain salvation, no
not even by the help of others; if, on the other hand, we be watchful, we shall be able to do
this by ourselves, and by ourselves rather than by others. Yes; for God is more willing to
give His grace to us, than to others for us; that we by endeavoring ourselves to do away His
wrath, may both enjoy confidence towards Him, and become better men. Thus He had pity
on the Canaanitish woman, thus He saved the harlot, thus the thief, when there was none
to be mediator nor advocate.</p>
<p>8. And this I say, not that we may omit supplicating the saints, but to hinder our being
careless, and entrusting our concerns to others only, while we fall back and slumber ourselves.
For so when He said, “make to yourselves friends,”264he did not stop at this only, but He
added, “of the unrighteous mammon;” that so again the good work may be thine own; for
it is nothing else but almsgiving which He hath here signified. And, what is marvellous,
neither doth He make a strict account with us, if we withdraw ourselves from injustice. For
what He saith is like this: “Hast thou gained ill? spend well. Hast thou gathered by unrighteousness?
scatter abroad in righteousness.” And yet, what manner of virtue is this, to give
out of such gains? God, however, being full of love to man, condescends even to this and if
we thus do, promises us many good things. But we are so past all feeling, as not to give even
of our unjust gain, but while plundering without end, if we contribute the smallest part, we
think we have fulfilled all. Hast thou not heard Paul saying, “He which soweth sparingly,
shall reap also sparingly”?265 Wherefore then dost thou spare? What, is the act an outlay?
is it an expense? Nay, it is gain and good merchandise. Where there is merchandise, there
is also increase; where there is sowing, there is also reaping. But thou, if thou hadst to till a
rich and deep soil, and capable of receiving much seed, wouldest both spend what thou
hadst, and wouldest borrow of other men, accounting parsimony in such cases to be loss;
but, when it is Heaven which thou art to cultivate, which is exposed to no variation of
weather, and will surely repay thine outlay with abundant increase, thou art slow and
backward, and considerest not that it is possible by sparing to lose, and by not sparing to
gain.</p>

<note type="footnote">263 Luke xv. 13–20.</note>
<note type="footnote">264 Luke xvi. 9. It would seem from this that the saints whom we are to supplicate for their help are those on
earth, whom we may assist by our alms. And the examples before tend to confirm this view.</note>

<pb n="76"/>
<p>9. Disperse therefore, that thou mayest not lose; keep not, that thou mayest keep; lay
out, that thou mayest save; spend, that thou mayest gain. If thy treasures are to be hoarded,
do not thou hoard them, for thou wilt surely cast them away; but entrust them to God, for
thence no man makes spoil of them. Do not thou traffic, for thou knowest not at all how to
gain; but lend unto Him who gives an interest greater than the principal. Lend, where is no
envy, no accusation, nor evil design, nor fear. Lend unto Him who wants nothing, yet hath
need for thy sake; who feeds all men, yet is an hungered, that thou mayest not suffer famine;
who is poor, that thou mayest be rich. Lend there, where thy return cannot be death, but
life instead of death. For this usury is the harbinger of a kingdom, that, of hell; the one
coming of covetousness, the other of self-denial; the one of cruelty, the other of humanity.
What excuse then will be ours, when having the power to receive more, and that with security,
and in due season, and in great freedom, without either reproaches, or fears, or dangers, we
let go these gains, and follow after that other sort, base and vile as they are, insecure and
perishable, and greatly aggravating the furnace for us? For nothing, nothing is baser than
the usury of this world, nothing more cruel. Why, other persons’ calamities are such a man’s
traffic; he makes himself gain of the distress of another, and demands wages for kindness,
as though he were afraid to seem merciful, and under the cloak of kindness he digs the pitfall
deeper, by the act of help galling a man’s poverty, and in the act of stretching out the hand
thrusting him down, and when receiving him as in harbor, involving him in shipwreck, as
on a rock, or shoal, or reef.</p>
<p>“But what dost thou require?” saith one; “that I should give another for his use that
money which I have got together, and which is to me useful, and demand no recompense?”
Far from it: I say not this: yea, I earnestly desire that thou shouldest have a recompense; not
however a mean nor small one, but far greater; for in return for gold, I would that thou
shouldest receive Heaven for usury. Why then shut thyself up in poverty, crawling about
the earth, and demanding little for great? Nay, this is the part of one who knows not how
to be rich. For when God in return for a little money is promising thee the good things that
are in Heaven, and thou sayest, “Give me not Heaven, but instead of Heaven the gold that
perisheth,” this is for one who wishes to continue in poverty. Even as he surely who desires
wealth and abundance will choose things abiding rather than things perishing; the inexhaustible,
rather than such as waste away; much rather than little, the incorruptible rather than
the corruptible. For so the other sort too will follow. For as he who seeks earth before
Heaven, will surely lose earth also, so he that prefers Heaven to earth, shall enjoy both in
great excellency. And that this may be the case with us, let us despise all things here, and
choose the good things to come. For thus shall we obtain both the one and the other, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be glory and might for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily VI.</head>
<p>Matt. II. 1, 2.</p>
<p>“When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there
came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the
Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him.”</p>
<p>We have need of much wakefulness, and many prayers, that we may arrive at the interpretation
of the passage now before us, and that we may learn who these wise men were,
and whence they came, and how; and at whose persuasion, and what was the star. Or rather,
if ye will, let us first bring forward what the enemies of the truth say. Because the devil hath
blown upon them with so violent a blast, as even from this passage try to arm them against
the words of truth.</p>
<p>What then do they allege? “Behold,” say they, “even when Christ was born a star appeared;
which is a sign that astrology may be depended on.” How then, if He had His birth
according to that law, did He put down astrology, and take away fate, and stop the mouths
of demons, and cast out error, and overthrow all such sorcery?</p>
<p>And what moreover do the wise men learn from the star of itself? That He was King of
the Jews? And yet He was not king of this kingdom; even as He said also to Pilate, “My
kingdom is not of this world.” At any rate He made no display of this kind, for He had
neither guards armed with spear or shield, nor horses, nor chariots of mules, nor any other
such thing around Him; but He followed this life of meanness and poverty, carrying about
with Him twelve men of mean estate.</p>
<p>And even if they knew Him to be a king, for what intent are they come? For surely this
is not the business of astrology, to know from the stars who are born, but from the hour
when men are born to predict what shall befall them: so it is said. But these were neither
present with the mother in her pangs, nor did they know the time when He was born, neither
did they, beginning at that moment, from the motion of the stars compute what was to
happen: but conversely, having a long time before seen a star appear in their own country,
they come to see Him that was born.</p>
<p>Which circumstance in itself would afford a still greater difficulty even than the former.
For what reason induced them, or the hope of what benefits, to worship one who was king
so far off? Why, had He been to reign over themselves, most assuredly not even so would
the circumstance be capable of a reasonable account. To be sure, if He had been born in
royal courts, and with His father, himself a king, present by Him, any one would naturally
say, that they, from a wish to pay court to the father, had worshipped the child that was
born, and in this way were laying up for themselves beforehand much ground of patronage.
But now when they did not so much as expect Him to be their own king, but of a strange

<pb n="78"/>
nation, far distant from their country, neither seeing Him as yet grown to manhood;
wherefore do they set forth on so long a journey, and offer gifts, and this when dangers were
sure to beset their whole proceeding? For both Herod, when he heard it, was exceedingly
troubled, and the whole people was confounded on being told of these things by them.</p>
<p>“But these men did not foresee this.” Nay, this is not reasonable. For let them have been
ever so foolish, of this they could not be ignorant, that when they came to a city under a
king, and proclaimed such things as these, and set forth another king besides him who then
reigned, they must needs be bringing down on themselves a thousand deaths.</p>
<p>2. And why did they at all worship one who was in swaddling clothes? For if He had
been a grown man, one might say, that in expectation of the succor they should receive from
Him, they cast themselves into a danger which they foresaw; a thing however to the utmost
degree unreasonable, that the Persian, the barbarian, and one that had nothing in common
with the nation of the Jews, should be willing to depart from his home, to give up country,
and kindred, and friends, and that they should subject themselves to another kingdom.</p>
<p>But if this be foolish, what follows is much more foolish. Of what nature then is this?
That after they had entered on so long a journey, and worshipped, and thrown all into
confusion, they went away immediately. And what sign at all of royalty did they behold,
when they saw a shed, and a manger, and a child in swaddling clothes, and a poor mother?
And to whom moreover did they offer their gifts, and for what intent? Was it then usual
and customary, thus to pay court to the kings that were born in every place? and did they
always keep going about the whole world, worshipping them who they knew should become
kings out of a low and mean estate, before they ascended the royal throne? Nay, this no one
can say.</p>
<p>And for what purpose did they worship Him at all? If for the sake of things present,
then what did they expect to receive from an infant, and a mother of mean condition? If for
things future, then whence did they know that the child whom they had worshipped in
swaddling clothes would remember what was then done? But if His mother was to remind
Him, not even so were they worthy of honor, but of punishment, as bringing Him into
danger which they must have foreseen. Thence at any rate it was that Herod was troubled,
and sought, and pried, and took in hand to slay Him. And indeed everywhere, he who makes
known the future king, supposing him in his earliest age in a private condition, doth nothing
else than betray him to slaughter, and kindle against him endless warfare.</p>
<p>Seest thou how manifold the absurdities appear, if we examine these transactions according
to the course of human things and ordinary custom? For not these topics only, but
more than these might be mentioned, containing more matter for questions than what we
have spoken of. But lest, stringing questions upon questions, we should bewilder you, come
let us now enter upon the solution of the matters inquired of, making a beginning of our
solution with the star itself.</p>

<pb n="79"/>
<p>3. For if ye can learn what the star was, and of what kind, and whether it were one of
the common stars, or new and unlike the rest, and whether it was a star by nature or a star
in appearance only, we shall easily know the other things also. Whence then will these points
be manifest? From the very things that are written. Thus, that this star was not of the common
sort, or rather not a star at all, as it seems at least to me, but some invisible power transformed
into this appearance, is in the first place evident from its very course. For there is not, there
is not any star that moves by this way, but whether it be the sun you mention, or the moon,
or all the other stars, we see them going from east to west; but this was wafted from north
to south; for so is Palestine situated with respect to Persia.</p>
<p>In the second place, one may see this from the time also. For it appears not in the night,
but in mid-day, while the sun is shining; and this is not within the power of a star, nay not
of the moon; for the moon that so much surpasses all, when the beams of the sun appear,
straightway hides herself, and vanishes away. But this by the excess of its own splendor
overcame even the beams of the sun, appearing brighter than they, and in so much light
shining out more illustriously.</p>
<p>In the third place, from its appearing, and hiding itself again. For on their way as far as
Palestine it appeared leading them, but after they set foot within Jerusalem, it hid itself: then
again, when they had left Herod, having told him on what account they came, and were on
the point of departing, it shows itself; all which is not like the motion of a star, but of some
power highly endued with reason. For it had not even any course at all of its own, but when
they were to move, it moved; when to stand, it stood, dispensing266all as need required: in
the same kind of way as the pillar of the cloud, now halting and now rousing up the camp
of the Jews, when it was needful.</p>
<p>In the fourth place, one may perceive this clearly, from its mode of pointing Him out.
For it did not, remaining on high, point out the place; it not being possible for them so to
ascertain it, but it came down and performed this office. For ye know that a spot of so small
dimensions, being only as much as a shed would occupy, or rather as much as the body of
a little infant would take up, could not possibly be marked out by a star. For by reason of
its immense height, it could not sufficiently distinguish so confined a spot, and discover it
to them that were desiring to see it. And this any one may see by the moon, which being so
far superior to the stars, seems to all that dwell in the world, and are scattered over so great
an extent of earth,—seems, I say, near to them every one. How then, tell me, did the star
point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and shed, unless it left that height
and came down, and stood over the very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist
was hinting when he said, “Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where
the young Child was.”</p>
<note type="footnote">266 οκονομν.</note>

<pb n="80"/>
<p>4. Seest thou, by what store of proofs this star is shown not to be one of the many, nor
to have shown itself according to the order of the outward creation? And for what intent
did it appear? To reprove the Jews for their insensibility, and to cut off from them all occasion
of excuse for their willful ignorance. For, since He who came was to put an end to the ancient
polity, and to call the world to the worship of Himself, and to be worshipped in all land and
sea, straightway, from the beginning, He opens the door to the Gentiles, willing through
strangers to admonish His own people. Thus, because the prophets were continually heard
speaking of His advent, and they gave no great heed, He made even barbarians come from
a far country, to seek after the king that was among them. And they learn from a Persian
tongue first of all, what they would not submit to learn from the prophets; that, if on the
one hand they were disposed to be candid, they might have the strongest motive for obedience;
if, on the other hand, they were contentious, they might henceforth be deprived of all
excuse. For what could they have to say, who did not receive Christ after so many prophets,
when they saw that wise men, at the sight of a single star, had received this same, and had
worshipped Him who was made manifest. Much in the same way then as He acted in the
case of the Ninevites, when He sent Jonas, and as in the case of the Samaritan and the
Canaanitish women; so He did likewise in the instance of the magi. For this cause He also
said, “The men of Nineveh shall rise up, and shall condemn:” and, “the Queen of the South
shall rise up, and shall condemn this generation:”267because these believed the lesser things,
but the Jews not even the greater.</p>
<p>“And wherefore,” one may say, “did He attract them by such a vision?” Why, how should
He have done? Sent prophets? But the magi would not have submitted to prophets. Uttered
a voice from above? Nay, they would not have attended. Sent an angel? But even him they
would have hurried by. And so for this cause dismissing all those means, God calleth them
by the things that are familiar, in exceeding condescension; and He shows a large and extraordinary
star, so as to astonish them, both at the greatness and beauty of its appearance,
and the manner of its course.</p>
<p>In imitation of this, Paul also reasons with the Greeks from an heathen altar, and brings
forward testimonies from the poets.268 And not without circumcision doth he harangue
the Jews. Sacrifices he makes the beginning of his instruction to them that are living under
the law. For, since to every one what is familiar is dear, both God, and the men that are sent
by Him, manage things on this principle with a view to the salvation of the world. Think it
not therefore unworthy of Him to have called them by a star; since by the same rule thou
wilt find fault with all the Jewish rites also, the sacrifices, and the purifications, and the new
moons, and the ark, and the temple too itself. For even these derived their origin from
<note type="footnote">267 Matt. xii. 41, 42.</note>
<note type="footnote">268 Acts xvii. 23, 28; 1 Cor. xv. 33; Titus i. 12.</note>

<pb n="81"/>
Gentile grossness.269 Yet for all that, God, for the salvation of them that were in error, endured
to be served by these things, whereby those without were used to serve devils; only
He slightly altered them; that He might draw them off by degrees from their customs, and
lead them towards the highest wisdom. Just so He did in the case of the wise men also, not
disdaining to call them by sight of a star, that He might lift them higher ever after. Therefore
after He hath brought them, leading them by the hand, and hath set them by the manger;
it is no longer by a star, but by an angel that He now discourses unto them. Thus did they
by little and little become better men.</p>
<p>This did He also with respect to them of Ascalon, and of Gaza. For those five cities too
(when at the coming of the ark they had been smitten with a deadly plague, and found no
deliverance from the ills under which they lay)—the men of them called their prophets, and
gathered an assembly, and sought to discover an escape from this divine scourge. Then,
when their prophets said that they should yoke to the ark heifers untamed, and having their
first calves, and let them go their way, with no man to guide them, for so it would be evident
whether the plague was from God or whether it was any accident which brought the disease;—(“
for if,” it is said, “they break the yoke in pieces for want of practice, or turn where
their calves are lowing, ‘it is a chance that hath happened;’270but if they go on right, and err
not from the way, and neither the lowing of their young, nor their ignorance of the way,
have any effect on them, it is quite plain that it is the hand of God that hath visited those
cities:”)—when, I say, on these words of their prophets the inhabitants of those cities obeyed
and did as they were commanded, God also followed up the counsel of the prophets,
showing condescension in that instance also, and counted it not unworthy of Himself to
bring to effect the prediction of the prophets, and to make them seem trustworthy in what
they had then said. For so the good achieved was greater, in that His very enemies themselves
bore witness to the power of God; yea, their own teachers gave their voice concerning Him.
And one may see many other such things brought about by God. For what took place with
respect to the witch,271is again like this sort of dispensation; which circumstance also you
will now be able to explain from what hath been said.</p>
<p>With respect to the star, we have said these things, and yet more perhaps may be said
by you; for, it is said, “Give occasion to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:”272but we must
now come to the beginning of what hath been read.</p>
<p>5. And what is the beginning? “When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa, in the days
of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.” While wise
<note type="footnote">269 See St. Iren. iv. 28, 29; Tertull. adv. Marc. i. 18, 22; St. Chrys. adv. Jud. Hom. i. t. 6, 318.</note>

men followed under the auspices of a star, these believed not, with prophets even sounding
in their ears. But wherefore doth he mention to us both the time and the place, saying, “in
Bethlehem,” and “in the days of Herod the king?” And for what reason doth he add his rank
also? His rank, because there was also another Herod, he who slew John: but that was a
tetrarch, this a king. And the place likewise, and the time, he puts down, to bring to our remembrance
ancient prophecies; whereof one was uttered by Micah, saying, “And thou,
Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah;”273and
the other by the patriarch Jacob, distinctly marking out to us the time, and setting forth the
great sign of His coming. For, “A ruler,” saith he, “shall not fail out of Judah, nor a leader
out of his loins, until He come for whom it is appointed, and He is the expectation of the
Gentiles.”274</p>
<p>And this again is worth inquiry, whence it was that they came to entertain such a thought,
and who it was that stirred them up to this. For it doth not seem to me to be the work of
the star only, but also of God, who moved their soul; which same kind of thing He did also
in the case of Cyrus, disposing him to let the Jews go. He did not however so do this as to
destroy their free will, since even when He called Paul from above by a voice, He manifested
both His own grace and Paul’s obedience.</p>
<p>And wherefore, one may ask, did He not reveal this to all the wise men of the East? Because
all would not have believed, but these were better prepared than the rest; since also
there were countless nations that perished, but it was to the Ninevites only that the prophet
was sent; and there were two thieves on the cross, but one only was saved. See at least the
virtue of these men, not only by their coming, but also by their boldness of speech. For so
that they may not seem to be a sort of impostors,275they tell who showed them the way, and
the length of their journey; and being come, they had boldness of speech: “for we are come,”
that is their statement, “to worship Him:” and they were afraid neither of the people’s anger,
nor of the tyranny of the king. Whence to me at least they seem to have been at home also
teachers of their countrymen.276 For they who here did not shrink from saying this, much
more would they speak boldly in their own country, as having received both the oracle from
the angel, and the testimony from the prophet.</p>

<note type="footnote">276 So in Op. Imperf. in Matt. Hom. 2. “After their return, they continued serving God more than before, and
instructed many by their preaching. And at last, when Thomas had gone into that province, they joined themselves
to him and were baptized, and became doers of his word.” This work has been attributed to St. Chrysostom,
and seems certainly of the same date with him.</note>

<pb n="83"/>
<p>6. But “when Herod,” saith the Scripture, “had heard, he was troubled, and all Jerusa
lem with him.” Herod naturally, as being king, and afraid both for himself and for his children;
but why Jerusalem? Surely the prophets had foretold Him a Saviour, and Benefactor,
and a Deliverer from above. Wherefore then was Jerusalem277troubled? From the same
feeling which caused them before also to turn away from God when pouring His benefits
on them, and to be mindful of the flesh-pots of Egypt, while in the enjoyment of great freedom.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, the accuracy of the prophets. For this selfsame thing also had the
prophet foretold from the first,278saying, “They would be glad, if they had been burnt with
fire; for unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.”279</p>
<p>But nevertheless, although troubled, they seek not to see what hath happened, neither
do they follow the wise men, nor make any particular inquiry; to such a degree were they
at once both contentious and careless above all men. For when they had reason rather to
pride themselves that the king was born amongst them, and had attracted to Him the land
of the Persians, and they were on the point of having all subject to them, as though their
affairs had advanced towards improvement, and from the very outset His empire had become
so glorious; nevertheless, they do not even for this become better. And yet they were but
just delivered from their captivity there; and it was natural for them to think (even if they
knew none of those things that are high and mysterious, but formed their judgment from
what is present only), “If they thus tremble before our king at His birth, much more when
grown up will they fear and obey Him, and our estate will be more glorious than that of the
barbarians.”</p>
<p>7. But none of these things thoroughly awakens them, so great was their dullness, and
with this their envy also: both which we must with exact care root out of our mind; and he
must be more fervent than fire who is to stand in such an array. Wherefore also Christ said,
“I am come to send fire on earth, and I would it were already kindled.”280in the same lot
with it, even so godly tears are a germ of perpetual and unfading joy. In this way the very
harlot became more honorable than virgins when seized by this fire. That is, being thoroughly

warmed by repentance, she was thenceforth carried out of herself by her longing desire toward
Christ; loosing her hair, and drenching with her tears His holy feet, and wiping them
with her own tresses, and exhausting the ointment.281 And all these were outward results,
but those wrought in her mind were far more fervent than these; which things God Himself
alone beheld. And therefore, every one, when he hears, rejoices with her and takes delight
in her good works, and acquits her of every blame. But if we that are evil pass this judgment,
consider what sentence she obtained from that God who is a lover of mankind; and how
much, even before God’s gifts, her repentance caused her to reap in the way of blessing.</p>
<p>For much as after a violent burst of rain, there is a clear open sky; so likewise when tears
are pouring down, a calm arises, and serenity, and the darkness that ensues on our sins quite
disappears. And like as by water and the spirit, so by tears and confession are we cleansed
the second time; unless we be acting thus for display and vanity: for as to a woman whose
tears were of that sort, I should call her justly condemnable, more than if she decked herself
out with282lines and coloring. For I seek those tears which are shed not for display, but in
compunction; those which trickle down secretly and in closets, and in sight of no man, softly
and noiselessly; those which arise from a certain depth of mind, those shed in anguish and
in sorrow, those which are for God alone; such as were Hannah’s, for “her lips moved,” it
is said, “but her voice was not heard;”283however, her tears alone uttered a cry more clear
than any trumpet. And because of this, God also opened her womb, and made the hard rock
a fruitful field.</p>
<p>If thou also weep thus, thou art become a follower of thy Lord. Yea, for He also wept,
both over Lazarus, and over the city; and touching Judas He was greatly troubled. And this
indeed one may often see Him do, but nowhere laugh, nay, nor smile but a little; no one at
least of the evangelists hath mentioned this. Therefore also with regard to Paul, that he wept,
that he did so three years night and day,284both he hath said of himself, and others say this
of him; but that he laughed, neither hath he said himself anywhere, neither hath so much
as one other of the saints, either concerning him, or any other like him; but this is said of
Sarah only,285when she is blamed, and of the son of Noe, when for a freeman he became a
slave.286</p>

<p>9. And these things I say, not to suppress287all laughter, but to take away dissipation of
mind. For wherefore, I pray thee, art thou luxurious and dissolute, while thou art still liable
to such heavy charges, and are to stand at a fearful judgment-seat, and to give a strict account
of all that hath been done here? Yes: for we are to give an account both of what we have
sinned willingly, and what against our will:—for “whosoever shall deny me,” saith He, “before
men, him will I also deny before my Father:”288—and surely such a denial is against our
will; but nevertheless it doth not escape punishment, but of it too we have to give account:—
both of what we know, and of what we do not know; “For I know nothing by myself,”
saith one, “yet am I not hereby justified:”289—both for what we have done in ignorance,
and what in knowledge; “For I bear them record,” it is said, “that they have a zeal of God,
but not according to knowledge;”290but yet this doth not suffice for an excuse for them.
And when writing to the Corinthians also he saith, “For I fear, lest by any means, as the
serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in Christ.”291</p>
<p>The things then being so great, for which thou art to give account, dost thou sit laughing
and talking wittily, and giving thyself up to luxury? “Why,” one may say, “if I did not so,
but mourned, what would be the profit?” Very great indeed; even so great, as it is not possible
so much as to set it forth by word. For while, before the temporal tribunals, be thy weeping
ever so abundant, thou canst not escape punishment after the sentence; here, on the contrary,
shouldest thou only sigh, thou hast annulled the sentence, and hast obtained pardon.
Therefore it is that Christ discourses to us much of mourning, and blesses them that mourn,
and pronounces them that laugh wretched. For this is not the theatre for laughter, neither
did we come together for this intent, that we may give way to immoderate mirth, but that
we may groan, and by this groaning inherit a kingdom. But thou, when standing by a king,
dost not endure so much as merely to smile; having then the Lord of the angels dwelling in
thee, dost thou not stand with trembling, and all due self-restraint, but rather laughest, oftentimes
when He is displeased? And dost thou not consider that thou provokest Him in
this way more than by thy sins? For God is not wont to turn Himself away so much from
them that sin, as from those that are not awestruck after their sin.</p>

<p>But for all this, some are of so senseless a disposition, as even after these words to say,
“Nay, far be it from me to weep at any time, but may God grant me to laugh and to play all
my days.” And what can be more childish than this mind? For it is not God that grants to
play, but the devil. At least hear, what was the portion of them that played. “The people,” it
is said, “sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.”292 Such were they at Sodom, such
were they at the time of the deluge. For touching them of Sodom likewise it is said, that “in
pride, and in plenty, and in fullness of bread, they waxed wanton.”293 And they who were
in Noah’s time, seeing the ark a preparing for so many years, lived on in senseless mirth,
forseeing nought of what was coming. For this cause also the flood came and swept them
all away, and wrought in that instant the common shipwreck of the world.</p>
<p>Ask not then of God these things, which thou receivest of the devil. For it is God’s part
to give a contrite and humbled heart, sober, self-possessed, and awestruck, full of repentance
and compunction. These are His gifts, forasmuch as it is also of these things that we are
most in need. Yes, for a grievous conflict is at hand, and against the powers unseen is our
wrestling; against “the spiritual wickednesses”294our fight, “against principalities, against
powers” our warfare: and it is well for us, if when we are earnest and sober and thoroughly
awakened, we can be able to sustain that savage phalanx. But if we are laughing and sporting,
and always taking things easily, even before the conflict, we shall be overthrown by our own
remissness.</p>
<p>10. It becometh not us then to be continually laughing, and to be dissolute, and luxurious,
but it belongs to those upon the stage, the harlot women, the men that are trimmed for this
intent, parasites, and flatterers; not them that are called unto heaven, not them that are enrolled
into the city above, not them that bear spiritual arms, but them that are enlisted on
the devil’s side. For it is he, yea, it is he, that even made the thing an art, that he might
weaken Christ’s soldiers, and soften the nerves of their zeal. For this cause he also built
theatres in the cities, and having trained those buffoons, by their pernicious influence he
causes that kind of pestilence to light upon the whole city, persuading men to follow those
things which Paul bade us flee, “foolish talking and jesting.”295 And what is yet more
grievous than these things is the subject of the laughter. For when they that act those absurd
things utter any word of blasphemy or filthiness, then many among the more thoughtless
laugh and are pleased, applauding in them what they ought to stone them for; and drawing
down on their own heads by this amusement the furnace of fire. For they who praise the
utterers of such words, it is these above all who induce men so to speak: wherefore they

must be more justly accountable for the penalty allotted to these things. For were there no
one to be a spectator in such cases, neither would there be one to act; but when they see you
forsaking your workshops, and your crafts, and your income from these, and in short
everything, for the sake of continuing there, they derive hence a greater forwardness, and
exert a greater diligence about these things.</p>
<p>And this I say, not freeing them from reproof, but that ye may learn that it is you chiefly
who supply the principle and root of such lawlessness; ye who consume your whole day on
these matters, and profanely exhibit the sacred things of marriage, and make an open mock
of the great mystery. For not even he who acts these things is so much the offender, as thou
art before him; thou who biddest him make a play on these things, or rather who not only
biddest him, but art even zealous about it, taking delight, and laughing, and praising what
is done, and in every way gaining strength for such workshops of the devil.</p>
<p>Tell me then, with what eyes wilt thou after this look upon thy wife at home, having
seen her insulted there? Or how dost thou not blush being put in mind of the partner of thy
home, when thou seest nature herself put to an open shame? Nay, tell me not, that what is
done is acting; for this acting hath made many adulterers, and subverted many families.
And it is for this most especially that I grieve, that what is done doth not so much as seem
evil, but there is even applause and clamor, and much laughter, at commission of so foul
adultery. What sayest thou? that what is done is acting? Why, for this selfsame reason they
must be worthy of ten thousand deaths, that what things all laws command men to flee,
they have taken pains to imitate. For if the thing itself be bad, the imitation thereof also is
bad. And I do not yet say how many adulterers they make who act these scenes of adultery,
how they render the spectators of such things bold and shameless; for nothing is more full
of whoredom and boldness than an eye that endures to look at such things.</p>
<p>And thou in a market-place wouldest not choose to see a woman stripped naked, or
rather not even in a house, but callest such a thing an outrage. And goest thou up into the
theatre, to insult the common nature of men and women, and disgrace thine own eyes? For
say not this, that she that is stripped is an harlot; but that the nature is the same, and they
are bodies alike, both that of the harlot, and that of the free-woman. For if this be nothing
amiss, what is the cause that if thou were to see this done in a market place, thou wouldest
both hasten away thyself, and drive thence her who was behaving herself unseemly? Or is
it that when we are apart, then such a thing is outrageous, but when we are assembled and
all sitting together, it is no longer equally shameful? Nay, this is absurdity and a disgrace,
and words of the utmost madness; and it were better to besmear the eyes all over with mud
and mire than to be a spectator of such a transgression. For surely mire is not so much an
hurt to an eye, as an unchaste sight, and the spectacle of a woman stripped naked. Hear, for
example, what it was that caused nakedness at the beginning, and read the occasion of such

<pb n="88"/>
disgrace. What then did cause nakedness? Our disobedience,296and the devil’s counsel.
Thus, from the first, even from the very beginning, this was his contrivance. Yet they were
at least ashamed when they were naked, but ye take a pride in it; “having,” according to that
saying of the apostle, “your glory in your shame.”297</p>
<p>How then will thy wife thenceforward look upon thee, when thou art returned from
such wickedness? how receive thee? how speak to thee, after thou hast so publicly put to
shame the common nature of woman, and art made by such a sight the harlots’ captive and
slave?298</p>
<p>Now if ye grieve at hearing these things, I thank you much, for “who is he that maketh
me glad, but he which is made sorry by me?”299 Do not then ever cease to grieve and be
vexed for them, for the sorrow that comes of such things will be to you a beginning of a
change for the better. For this cause I also have made my language the stronger, that by
cutting deeper I might free you from the venom of them that intoxicate you; that I might
bring you back to a pure health of soul; which God grant we may all enjoy by all means, and
attain unto the rewards laid up for these good deeds; by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. II. 4, 5.</p>
<p>“And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded
of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, in Bethlehem of Judæa.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how all things are done to convict the Jews? how, as long as He was out of
their sight, the envy had not yet laid hold of them, and they rehearsed the testimonies of
Him with truth; but when they saw the glory that arose from the miracles, a grudging spirit
possessed them, and thenceforth they betrayed the truth.</p>
<p>However, the truth was exalted by all things, and strength was the more gathered for it
even by its enemies. See for example in this very case, how wonderful and beyond expectation
are the results secretly provided for.300 For both the barbarians and the Jews do the same
time alike learn something more of one another, and teach one another. Thus the Jews, for
their part, heard from the wise men, that a star also had proclaimed Him in the land of the
Persians; the wise men, in their turn, were informed by the Jews that this Man, whom the
star proclaimed, prophets also had made known from a long time of old. And the ground301of
their inquiry was made to both an occasion of setting forth clearer and more perfect instruction;
and the enemies of the truth are compelled even against their will to read the writings
in favor of the truth, and to interpret the prophecy; although not all of it. For having spoken
of Bethlehem, and how that out of it He shall come that should rule Israel, they proceed not
afterwards to add what follows, out of flattery to the king. And what was this? That “His
goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.”</p>
<p>2. “But why,” one may say, “if He was to come from thence, did He live in Nazareth
after the birth, and obscure the prophecy?” Nay, He did not obscure it, but unfolded it the
more. For the fact, that while His mother had her constant residence in the one place, He
was born in the other, shows the thing to have been done by a Divine dispensation.302</p>
<p>And for this cause, let me add, neither did He remove from thence straightway after
His birth, but abode forty days, giving opportunity to them that were disposed to be inquisitive
to examine all things accurately. Because there were in truth many things to move them
to such an inquiry, at least if they had been disposed to give heed to them. Thus at the
coming of the wise men the whole city was in a flutter,303and together with the city the king,
and the prophet was brought forward, and a court of high authority was summoned; and

<note type="footnote">302 ἐξ οκονομα.</note>

<pb n="90"/>
many other things too were done there, all which Luke relates minutely. Such were what
concerns Anna, and Simeon, and Zacharias, and the angels, and the shepherds; all which
things were to the attentive sufficient to give hints for ascertaining what had taken place.
For if the wise men, who came from Persia, were not ignorant of the place, much more
might they, whose abode it was, acquaint themselves with these things.</p>
<p>He manifested Himself then from the beginning by many miracles, but when they would
not see, He hid Himself for a while, to be again revealed from another more glorious beginning.
For it was no longer the wise men, nor the star, but the Father from above that proclaimed
Him at the streams of Jordan; and the Spirit likewise came upon Him, guiding that
voice to the head of Him just baptized; and John, with all plainness of speech, cried out
everywhere in Judæa, till inhabited and waste country alike were filled with that kind of
doctrine; and the witness too of the miracles, and earth, and sea, and the whole creation,
uttered in His behalf a distinct voice. But at the time of the birth, just so many things
happened as were fitted quietly to mark out Him that was come. Thus, in order that the
Jews might not say, “We know not when He was born, nor whereabouts,” both all these
events in which the wise men were concerned were brought about by God’s providence,
and the rest of the things which we have mentioned; so that they would have no excuse to
plead, for not having inquired into that which had come to pass.</p>
<p>But mark also the exactness of the prophecy. For it does not say, “He will abide” in
Bethlehem, but “He will come out” thence. So that this too was a subject of prophecy, His
being simply born there.</p>
<p>Some of them, however, being past shame, say that these things were spoken of Zerubbabel.
But how can they be right? For surely “his goings forth” were not “from of old, from
everlasting.”304 And how can that suit him which is said at the beginning, “Out of thee shall
He come forth:” Zorobabel not having been born in Judæa, but in Babylon, whence also he
was called Zorobabel,305because he had his origin there? And as many as know the Syrians’
language know what I say.</p>
<p>And together with what hath been said, all the time also since these things is sufficient
to establish the testimony. For what saith he? “Thou art not the least among the princes of
Judah,” and he adds the cause of the pre-eminence, saying, “out of thee shall He come.” But
no one else hath made that place illustrious or eminent, excepting Him alone. For example:
since that birth, men come from the ends of the earth to see the manger, and the site of the
shed. And this the prophet foretold aloud from the first, saying, “Thou art not the least
among the princes of Judah;” that is, among the heads of tribes. By which expression he

<pb n="91"/>
comprehended even Jerusalem.306 But not even so have they given heed, although the advantage
passes on to themselves. Yea, and because of this the prophets at the beginning
discourse nowhere so much of His dignity, as touching the benefit which accrued to them
by Him. For so, when the Virgin was bearing the child, he saith, “Thou shalt call His name
Jesus;”307and he gives the reason saying, “for He shall save His people from their sins.” And
the wise men too said not, “Where is the Son of God?” but “He that is born King of the
Jews.” And here again it is not affirmed, “Out of thee shall come forth” the Son of God, but
“a Governor, that shall feed my people Israel.”308 For it was needful to converse with them
at first, setting out in a tone of very exceeding condescension, lest they should be offended;
and to preach what related to their salvation in particular, that hereby they might be the
rather won over. At any rate, all the testimonies that are first cited, and for which it was the
season immediately at the time of the birth, say nothing great, nor lofty concerning Him,
nor such as those subsequent to the manifestation of the miracles; for these discourse more
distinctly concerning His dignity. For instance, when after many miracles children were
singing hymns unto Him, hear what saith the prophet, “Out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.”309 And again, “I will consider the Heavens, the works
of Thy fingers;” which signifies Him to be Maker of the universe. And the testimony too,
which was produced after the ascension, manifests His equality with the Father; thus saying,
“The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.”310 And Isaiah too saith, “He
that riseth up to rule over the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust.”311</p>
<p>But how saith he that Bethlehem is “not the least among the princes of Judah?” for not
in Palestine alone, but in the whole world, the village hath become conspicuous. Why, so
far he was speaking to Jews; wherefore also he added, “He shall feed my people Israel.” And
yet He fed the whole world; but as I have said, He is fain not to offend as yet, by revealing
what He hath to say touching the Gentiles.</p>
<p>But how was it, one may say, that He did not feed the Jewish people? I answer, first, this
too is accomplished: for by the term Israel in this place, he figuratively meant such as believed
on Him from among the Jews. And Paul interpreting this, saith, “For they are not all Israel,
which are of Israel,”312but as many as have been born by faith and promise. And if He did

not feed them all, this is their own fault and blame. For when they ought to have worshipped
with the wise men, and have glorified God that such a time was come, doing away all their
sins (for not a word was spoken to them of judgments set, or of accounts to be given, but
of a mild and meek Shepherd); they for their part do just the contrary, and are troubled,
and make disturbance, and go on continually framing plots without end.</p>
<p>3. “Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently313what
time the star appeared:”314</p>
<p>Attempting to slay that which was born,—an act of extreme idiotcy315not of madness
only; since what had been said and done was enough to have withholden him from any such
attempt. For those occurrences were not after the manner of man. A star, I mean, calling
the wise men from on high; and barbarians making so long a pilgrimage, to worship Him
that lay in swaddling clothes and a manger; and prophets too from of old, proclaiming beforehand
all this;—these and all the rest were more than human events: but nevertheless,
none of these things restrained him. For such a thing is wickedness. It falls foul of itself, and
is ever attempting impossibilities. And mark his utter folly. If on the one hand he believed
the prophecy, and accounted it to be unchangeable, it was quite clear that he was attempting
impossibilities; if again he disbelieved, and did not expect that those sayings would come
to pass, he need not have been in fear and alarm, nor have formed any plot on that behalf.
So that in either way his craft was superfluous.</p>
<p>And this too came of the utmost folly, to think that the wise men would make more
account of him than of the Child that was born, for the sake of which they had come so long
a journey. For if, before they saw, they were so inflamed with longing for Him; after they
had seen with their eyes, and been confirmed by the prophecy, how hoped he to persuade
them to betray the young Child to him?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many as were the reasons to withhold him, he made the attempt; and
having “privily called the wise men, he inquired of them.”316 Because he thought that Jews
would be concerned in favor of the Child, and he never could expect that they would fall
away unto such madness as to be willing to give up to His enemies their Protector and Saviour,
and Him who was come for the deliverance of their nation. On account of this he
both calls them privily, and seeks the time not of the Child, but of the star: thereby marking
out the object of his chase so as to include far more than it.317 For the star, I think, must

have appeared a long time before. It was a long time which the wise men had to spend on
their journey. In order, therefore, that they might present themselves just after His birth (it
being meet for Him to be worshipped in His very swaddling clothes, that the marvellous
and strange nature of the thing might appear), the star, a long time before, makes itself visible.
Whereas if at the moment of His birth in Palestine, and not before, it had been seen by them
in the East, they, consuming a long time in their journey, would not have seen Him in
swaddling clothes on their arrival. As to his slaying the children “from two years old and
under,” let us not marvel; for his wrath and dread, for the sake of a fuller security, added
very much to the time, so that not one might escape.</p>
<p>Having therefore called them, he saith, “Go and search diligently318for the young Child;
and when ye have found Him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship Him
also.”319</p>
<p>Seest thou his extreme folly? Why, if thou sayest these things in sincerity, wherefore
dost thou inquire privily? But if intending to plot against Him, how is it thou dost not perceive,
that from the fact of their being asked secretly the wise men will be able to perceive
thy craft? But as I have already said, a soul taken captive by any wickedness becomes more
utterly senseless than any thing.</p>
<p>And he said not, “go and learn concerning the King,” but “concerning the young Child;”
for he could not even endure to call Him by the name of His dominion.</p>
<p>4. But the wise men perceive nothing of this, by reason of their exceeding reverence (for
they never could have expected that he could have gone on to so great wickedness, and
would have attempted to form plots against a dispensation so marvellous): and they depart
suspecting none of these things, but from what was in themselves auguring all that would
be in the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>“And, lo! the star, which they saw in the east, went before them.”320</p>
<p>For therefore only was it hidden, that having lost their guide, they might come to be
obliged to make inquiry of the Jews, and so the matter might be made evident to all. Since
after they have made inquiries, and have had His enemies321for informants, it appears to
them again. And mark how excellent was the order; how in the first place after the star the
people322of the Jews receives them, and the king, and these bring in the prophecy to explain
what had appeared: how next, after the prophet, an angel again took them up and taught
them all things; but for a time they journey from Jerusalem to Bethlehem by the guidance

of the star, the star again journeying with them from that place also; that hence too thou
mightest learn, that this was not one of the ordinary stars, for there is not so much as one
star that hath this nature. And it not merely moved, but “went before them,” drawing and
guiding them on in mid-day.</p>
<p>“But what need of this star any more,” one may ask, “when the place was ascertained?”
In order that the Child also might be seen. For there was not anything to make Him manifest,
since the house was not conspicuous, neither was His mother glorious, or distinguished.
There was need then of the star, to set them by the place. Wherefore it re-appears on their
coming out of Jerusalem, and stays not, before it hath reached the manger.</p>
<p>And marvel was linked on to marvel; for both were strange things, as well the magi
worshipping, as the star going before them; and enough to attract even such as were made
all of stone. For if the wise men had said, they had heard prophets say these things, or that
angels had discoursed with them in private, they might have been disbelieved; but now,
when the vision of the star appeared on high, even they that were exceeding shameless had
their mouths stopped.</p>
<p>Moreover, the star, when it stood over the young Child, stayed its course again: which
thing itself also was of a greater power than belongs to a star, now to hide itself, now to appear,
and having appeared to stand still. Hence they too received an increase of faith. For
this cause they rejoiced also, that they had found what they were seeking, that they had
proved messengers of truth, that not without fruit had they come so great a journey; so great
a longing (so to speak) had they for Christ. For first it came and stood over His very head,
showing that what is born is Divine; next standing there, it leads them to worship Him; being
not simply barbarians, but the wiser sort amongst them.</p>
<p>Seest thou, with how great fitness the star appeared? Why; because even after the
prophecy, and after the interpretation of the chief priests and scribes, they still had their
minds turned towards it.</p>
<p>5. Shame upon Marcion, shame upon Paul of Samosata,323for refusing to see what those
wise men saw,—the forefathers of the Church; for I am not ashamed so to call them. Let
Marcion be ashamed, beholding God worshipped in the flesh. Let Paul be ashamed, beholding
Him worshipped as not being merely a man. As to His being in the flesh, that first is signified
by the swaddling clothes and the manger; as to their not worshipping Him as a mere man,
they declare it, by offering Him, at that unripe age, such gifts as were meet to be offered to
God. And together with them let the Jews also be ashamed, seeing themselves anticipated
by barbarians and magi, whilst they submit not so much as to come after them. For indeed
what happened then was a type of the things to come, and from the very beginning it was
shown that the Gentiles would anticipate their nation.</p>
<note type="footnote">323 Because Marcion denied Christ’s human nature, Paul His Divinity. See Epiph. Hær. 22 and 65.</note>

<pb n="95"/>
<p>“But how was it,” one may ask, “that not at the beginning, but afterwards, He said, ‘Go
ye, and make disciples of all nations’”? Because the occurrence was a type, as I said, of the
future, and a sort of declaration of it beforehand. For the natural order was that Jews should
come unto Him first; but forasmuch as they of their own choice gave up their proper benefit,
the order of things was inverted. Since not even in this instance should the wise men have
come before the Jews, nor should persons from so great a distance have anticipated those
who were settled about the very city, nor should those who had heard nothing have prevented324them
that were nurtured in so many prophecies. But because they were exceedingly
ignorant of their own blessings, those from Persia anticipate those at Jerusalem. And this
indeed is what Paul also saith: “It was necessary that the word of the Lord should first have
been spoken to you, but seeing ye have judged yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn to the
Gentiles.”325 For even though before they did not obey, at any rate when they heard it from
the wise men, they ought to have made all haste; but they would not. Therefore, while those
are slumbering, these run before.</p>
<p>6. Let us then also follow the magi, let us separate ourselves from our barbarian customs,
and make our distance therefrom great, that we may see Christ, since they too, had they not
been far from their own country, would have missed seeing Him. Let us depart from the
things of earth. For so the wise men, while they were in Persia, saw but the star, but after
they had departed from Persia, they beheld the Sun of Righteousness. Or rather, they would
not have seen so much as the star, unless they had readily risen up from thence. Let us then
also rise up; though all men be troubled, let us run to the house of the young Child; though
kings, though nations, though tyrants interrupt this our path, let not our desire pass away.
For so shall we thoroughly repel all the dangers that beset us. Since these too, except they
had seen the young Child, would not have escaped their danger from the king. Before seeing
the young Child, fears and dangers and troubles pressed upon them from every side; but
after the adoration, it is calm and security; and no longer a star but an angel receives them,
having become priests from the act of adoration; for we see that they offered gifts also.</p>
<p>Do thou therefore likewise leave the Jewish people, the troubled city, the blood-thirsty
tyrant, the pomp of the world, and hasten to Bethlehem, where is the326house of the spiritual
Bread.327 For though thou be a shepherd, and come hither, thou wilt behold the young
Child in an inn: though thou be a king, and approach not here, thy purple robe will profit
thee nothing; though thou be one of the wise men, this will be no hindrance to thee; only

let thy coming be to honor and adore, not to spurn the Son of God; only do this with trembling
and joy: for it is possible for both of these to concur in one.</p>
<p>But take heed that thou be not like Herod, and say, “that I may come and worship Him,”
and when thou art come, be minded to slay Him. For him do they resemble, who partake
of the mysteries unworthily: it being said, that such a one “shall be guilty of the Body and
Blood of the Lord.”328 Yes; for they have in themselves the tyrant who is grieved at Christ’s
kingdom, him that is more wicked than Herod of old, even Mammon. For he would fain
have the dominion, and sends them that are his own to worship in appearance, but slaying
while they worship. Let us fear then, lest at any time, while we have the appearance of suppliants
and worshippers, we should in deed show forth the contrary.</p>
<p>And let us cast everything out of our hands when we are to worship; though it be gold
that we have, let us offer it unto him and not bury it. For if those barbarians then offered it
for honor, what will become of thee, not giving even to Him that hath need? If those men
journeyed so far to see Him newly born, what sort of excuse wilt thou have, not going out
of thy way one alley’s length, that thou mayest visit Him sick or in bonds? And yet when
they are sick or in bonds, even our enemies have our pity; thine is denied even to thy Benefactor
and Lord. And they offered gold, thou hardly givest bread. They saw the star and were
glad, thou, seeing Christ Himself a stranger and naked, art not moved.</p>
<p>For which of you, for Christ’s sake, hath made so long a pilgrimage, you that have received
countless benefits, as these barbarians, or rather, these wiser than the wisest philosophers?
And why say I, so long a journey? Nay, many of our women are so delicate, that
they go not over so much as one crossing of the streets to behold Him on the spiritual
manger,329unless they can have mules to draw them. And others being able to walk, yet
prefer to their attendance here, some a crowd of worldly business, some the theatres.
Whereas the barbarians accomplished so great a journey for His sake, before seeing Him;
thou not even after thou hast seen Him dost emulate them, but forsakest Him after seeing
Him, and runnest to see the stage player. (For I touch again on the same subjects, as I did
also of late.330) And seeing Christ lying in the manger, thou leavest Him, that thou mayest
see women on the stage.</p>
<p>7. What thunderbolts do not these things deserve? For tell me, if any one were to
lead331thee into a palace, and show thee the king on his throne, wouldest thou indeed choose
to see the theatre instead of those things? And yet even in the palace there is nothing to gain;
but here a spiritual well of fire gushes up out of this table. And thou leavest this, and runnest

down to the theatre, to see women swimming, and nature put to open dishonor, leaving
Christ sitting by the well? Yes: for now, as of old, He sits down by the well, not discoursing
to a Samaritan woman, but to a whole city. Or perchance now too with a Samaritan woman
only. For neither now is any one with Him; but some with their bodies only, and some not
even with these. But nevertheless, He retires not, but remains, and asks of us to drink, not
water, but holiness, for “His holy things He gives unto the holy.”332 For it is not water that
He gives us from this fountain, but living blood; and it is indeed a symbol of death, but it is
become the cause of life.</p>
<p>But thou, leaving the fountain of blood, the awful cup, goest thy way unto the fountain
of the devil, to see a harlot swim, and to suffer shipwreck of the soul. For that water is a sea
of lasciviousness, not drowning bodies, but working shipwreck of souls. And whereas she
swims with naked body, thou beholding, art sunk into the deep of lasciviousness. For such
is the devil’s net; it sinks, not them that go down into the water itself, but them that sit above
more than such as wallow therein; and it chokes them more grievously than Pharaoh, who
was of old sunk in the sea with his horses and his chariots. And if souls could but be seen,
I could show you many floating on these waters, like the bodies of the Egyptians at that
time. But what is still more grievous is this, that they even call such utter destruction a delight,
and they term the sea of perdition a channel for a pleasure voyage.333 Yet surely one might
easier pass over in safety the Ægean or the Tuscan sea, than this spectacle. For in the first
place, through a whole night the devil preoccupies their souls with the expectation of it;
then having shown them the expected object, he binds them at once, and makes them captives.
For think not, because thou hast not been joined unto the harlot, thou art clean from
the sin; for in the purpose of thine heart thou hast done it all. Since if thou be taken by lust,
thou hast kindled the flame up higher; if thou feel nothing at what thou seest, thou deservest
a heavier charge, for being a scandal to others, by encouraging them in these spectacles, and
for polluting thine own eye-sight, and together with thine eye-sight, thy soul.</p>
<p>However, not merely to find fault, come let us devise a mode of correction too. What
then will the mode be? I would commit you to your own wives, that they may instruct you.
It is true, according to Paul’s law,334you ought to be the teachers. But since that order is
reversed by sin, and the body has come to be above, and the head beneath, let us even take
this way.</p>
<p>But if thou art ashamed to have a woman for thy teacher, fly from sin, and thou wilt
quickly be able to mount up on the throne which God hath given thee. Since so long as thou

sinnest the Scripture sends thee not to a woman only, but even to things irrational, and
those of the viler sort; yea, it is not ashamed to send thee who art honored with reason, as
a disciple to the ant.335 Plainly this is no charge against the Scripture, but against them that
so betray their own nobility of race. This then we will do likewise; and for the present we
will commit thee to thy wife; but if thou despise her, we will send thee away to the school
of the very brutes, and will point out to thee how many birds, fishes, four-footed beasts, and
creeping things are found more honorable, and chaster than thou.</p>
<p>If now thou art ashamed, and dost blush at the comparison, mount up to thine own
nobility, and fly the sea of hell, and the flood of fire, I mean the pool in the theatre. For this
pool introduces to that sea, and kindles that abyss of flame. Since if “he that looketh on a
woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery,”336he who is forced even to see
her naked, how doth he not become ten thousandfold a captive? The flood in the days of
Noah did not so utterly destroy the race of men as these swimming women drown all that
are there with great disgrace. For as to that rain, though it wrought indeed a death of the
body, yet did it repress the wickedness of the soul; but this hath the contrary effect; while
the bodies remain, it destroys the soul. And ye, when there is a question of precedence, claim
to take place of the whole word, forasmuch as our city first crowned itself with the name of
Christian;337but in the competition of chastity, ye are not ashamed to be behind the rudest
cities.</p>
<p>8. “Well,” saith one, “and what dost thou require us to do? to occupy the mountains,
and become monks?” Why it is this which makes me sigh, that ye think them alone to be
properly concerned with decency and chastity; and yet assuredly Christ made His laws
common to all. Thus, when He saith, “if any one look on a woman to lust after her,” He
speaks not to the solitary, but to him also that hath a wife; since in fact that mount was at
that time filled with all kinds of persons of that description. Form then in thy mind an image
of that amphitheatre, and hate thou this, which is the devil’s. Neither do thou condemn the
severity of my speech. For I neither “forbid to marry,”338nor hinder thy taking pleasure;
but I would have this be done in chastity, not with shame, and reproach, and imputations
without end. I do not make it a law that you are to occupy the mountains and the deserts,
but to be good and considerate and chaste, dwelling in the midst of the city. For in fact all
our laws are common to the monks also, except marriage; yea rather, even with respect to
this, Paul commands us to put ourselves altogether on a level with them; saying, “For the

fashion of this world passeth away:” that “they that have wives be as though they had
none.”339</p>
<p>“Wherefore” (so he speaks) “I do not bid you take possession of the summits of the
mountains; it is true I could wish it, since the cities imitate the things that were done in Sodom;
nevertheless, I do not enforce this. Abide, having house and children and wife; only
do not insult thy wife, nor put thy children to shame, neither bring into thine house the infection
from the theatre.” Hearest thou not Paul saying, “The husband hath not power of
his own body, but the wife,”340and setting down laws common to both? But thou, if thy
wife be continually thrusting herself into a public assembly, art severe in blaming her; but
thyself, spending whole days on public shows, thou dost not account worthy of blame. Yea,
touching thy wife’s modesty thou art so strict as even to go beyond necessity or measure,
and not to allow her so much as indispensable absences; but to thyself thou deemest all
things lawful. Yet Paul allows thee not, who gives the wife likewise the same authority, for
thus he speaks: “Let the husband render unto the wife due honor.”341 What sort of honor
then is this, when thou insultest her in the chiefest things, and givest up her body to harlots
(for thy body is hers); when thou bringest tumults and wars into thine house, when thou
doest in the market place such things, as being related by thyself to thy wife at home, overwhelm
her with shame, and put to shame also thy daughter if present, and more than them,
surely, thyself? For thou must necessarily either be silent, or behave thyself so unseemly,
that it would be just for thy very servants to be scourged for it. What plea then wilt thou
have, I pray thee, beholding, as thou dost, with great eagerness, things which even to name
is disgraceful; preferring to all sights these, which even to recount is intolerable?</p>
<p>Now then for a season, in order not to be too burdensome, I will here bring my discourse
to an end. But if ye continue in the same courses, I will make the knife sharper, and the cut
deeper; and I will not cease, till I have scattered the theatre of the devil, and so purified the
assembly of the Church. For in this way we shall both be delivered from the present disgrace,
and shall reap the fruit of the life to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. II. 2.</p>
<p>“And when they were come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother.”342</p>
<p>How then saith Luke, that He was lying in the manger? Because at the birth indeed she
presently laid Him there (for, as was not unlikely, in that large assemblage for the taxing,
they could find no house; which Luke also signifies, by saying, “Because there was no room,
she laid Him” there); but afterwards she took Him up, and held Him on her knees. For no
sooner was she arrived at Bethlehem than she brought her pangs to an end,343that thou
mayest thence also learn the whole dispensation, and that these things were not done at
random, or by chance, but that they all were in course of accomplishment, according to
some Divine foreknowledge, and prophetic order.</p>
<p>But what was it that induced them to worship? For neither was the Virgin conspicuous,
nor the house distinguished, nor was any other of the things which they saw apt to amaze
or attract them. Yet they not only worship, but also “open their treasures,” and “offer gifts;”
and gifts, not as to a man, but as to God. For the frankincense and the myrrh were a symbol
of this. What then was their inducement? That which wrought upon them to set out from
home and to come so long a journey; and this was both the star, and the illumination wrought
of God in their mind, guiding them by little and little to the more perfect knowledge. For,
surely, had it not been so, all that was in sight being ordinary, they would not have shown
so great honor. Therefore none of the outward circumstances was great in that instance,
but it was a manger, and a shed, and a mother in poor estate; to set before thine eyes, naked
and bare, those wise men’s love of wisdom,344and to prove to thee, that not as mere man
they approached Him, but as a God, and Benefactor. Wherefore neither were they offended
by ought of what they saw outwardly, but even worshipped, and brought gifts; gifts not only
free from Judaical grossness, in that they sacrificed not sheep and calves, but also coming
nigh to the self-devotion of the Church, for it was knowledge and obedience and love that
they offered unto Him.</p>
<p>“And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return unto Herod, they
departed into their own country another way.”345
See from this also their faith, how they were not offended, but are docile, and considerate;
neither are they troubled, nor reason with themselves, saying, “And yet, if this Child be

great, and hath any might, what need of flight, and of a clandestine retreat? and wherefore
can it be, that when we have come openly and with boldness, and have stood against so great
a people, and against a king’s madness, the angel sends us out of the city as runaways and
fugitives?” But none of these things did they either say or think. For this most especially
belongs to faith, not to seek an account of what is enjoined, but merely to obey the commandments
laid upon us.</p>
<p>2. “And when they were departed, behold, an angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream,
saying, Arise, and take the young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt.”346</p>
<p>There is something here worth inquiring into, both touching the magi, and touching
the Child; for if even they were not troubled, but received all with faith, it is worthy of examination
on our part, why they and the young Child are not preserved, continuing there, but
they as fugitives go into Persia, He with His mother into Egypt. But what? should He have
fallen into the hands of Herod, and having fallen, not have been cut off? Nay, He would not
have been thought to have taken flesh upon Him; the greatness of the Economy would not
have been believed.</p>
<p>For if, while these things are taking place, and many circumstances are being ordered
mysteriously after the manner of men, some have dared to say that His assumption of our
flesh347is a fable; in what degree of impiety would they not have been wrecked had He done
all in a manner becoming His Godhead, and according to His own power?</p>
<p>As to the wise men, He sends them off quickly, at once both commissioning them as
teachers to the land of the Persians, and at the same time intercepting the madness of the
king, that he might learn that he was attempting things impossible, and might quench his
wrath, and desist from this his vain labor. For not alone openly to subdue His enemies, but
also to deceive them with ease, is worthy of His power. Thus, for example, He deceived the
Egyptians also in the case of the Jews, and having power to transfer their wealth openly into
the hands of the Hebrews, He bids them do this secretly and with craft; and this surely, not
less than the other miracles, made Him an object of terror to His enemies. At least, they of
Ascalon, and all the rest, when they had taken the ark, and being smitten, did after that devise
their countrymen not to fight, nor to set themselves against Him, with the other miracles
brought this also forward, saying, “Wherefore harden ye your hearts, as Egypt and Pharaoh
hardened? when He had mocked them, did He not after that send forth His people, and
they departed?”348 Now this they said, as accounting this fresh one not inferior to those
other signs that had been done openly, towards the demonstration of His power, and of His
greatness. And the like ensued on this occasion too; a thing sufficient to astonish the tyrant.

For consider what it was natural for Herod to feel, and how his very breath would be stopped,
deceived as he was by the wise men, and thus laughed to scorn. For what, if he did not become
better? It is not His fault, who marvellously ordered all this, but it is the excess of Herod’s
madness, not yielding even to those things which had virtue349to have persuaded him, and
deterred him from his wickedness, but going on still further, to receive a yet sharper punishment
for folly so great.</p>
<p>3. But wherefore, it may be said, is the young Child sent into Egypt? In the first place,
the evangelist himself hath mentioned the cause, saying, “That it might be fulfilled, Out of
Egypt have I called my Son.” And at the same time beginnings of fair hopes were thenceforth
proclaimed before to the world. That is, since Babylon and Egypt, most in the whole earth,
were burnt up with the flame of ungodliness, He, signifying from the first that He means
to correct and amend both, and inducing men hereby to expect His bounties in regard of
the whole world likewise, sent to the one the wise men, the other He Himself visited with
His mother.</p>
<p>And besides what I have said, there is another lesson also, which we are hereby taught,
tending not slightly to true self-command in us. Of what kind then is it? To look from the
beginning for temptations and plots. See, for instance, how this was the case even at once
from His swaddling clothes. Thus you see at His birth, first a tyrant raging, then flight ensuing,
and departure beyond the border; and for no crime His mother is exiled into the land
of the barbarians: that thou, hearing these things (supposing thee thought worthy to minister
to any spiritual matter, and then to see thyself suffering incurable ills, and enduring countless
dangers), shouldest not be greatly troubled, nor say, “What can this be? yet surely I ought
to be crowned and celebrated, and be glorious and illustrious for fulfilling the Lord’s commandment:”
but that having this example, thou mightest bear all things nobly, knowing
that this especially is the order of all things spiritual, to have everywhere temptations in the
same lot with them. See at least how this is the case not only with regard to the mother of
the young Child, but also of those barbarians; since they for their part retire secretly in the
condition of fugitives; and she again, who had never passed over the threshold of her house,
is commanded to undergo so long a journey of affliction, on account of this wonderful birth,
and her spiritual travail.</p>
<p>And behold a wonder again. Palestine plots, and Egypt receives and preserves Him that
is the object of the plots. For, as it appears, not only in the instance of the sons of the patriarch350did
types take place, but also in our Lord’s own case. In many instances, we are sure,

<pb n="103"/>
His doings at that time were prophetic declarations of what was to happen afterwards; as,
for example, in the matter of the ass and the colt.351</p>
<p>4. Now the angel having thus appeared, talks not with Mary, but with Joseph; and what
saith he? “Arise, and take the young Child and His mother.” Here, he saith not any more,
“thy wife,” but “His mother.” For after that the birth had taken place, and the suspicion was
done away, and the husband appeased, thenceforth the angel talks openly, calling neither
child nor wife his, but “take the young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt;” and he
mentions the cause of the flight: “For Herod,” saith he, “will seek the young Child’s life.”</p>
<p>Joseph, when he had heard these things, was not offended, nether did he say, “The thing
is hard to understand: Didst thou not say just now, that He should save His people?’ and
now He saves not even Himself: but we must fly, and go far from home, and be a long time
away: the facts are contrary to the promise.” Nay, none of these things doth he say (for the
man was faithful): neither is he curious about the time of his return; and this though the
angel had put it indefinitely thus: “Be thou there until I tell thee.” But nevertheless, not even
at this did he shudder, but submits and obeys, undergoing all the trials with joy.</p>
<p>And this because God, who is full of love to man, did with these hardships mingle things
pleasant also; which indeed is His way with regard to all the saints, making neither their
dangers nor their refreshment continual, but weaving the life of all righteous men, out of
both the one and the other. This very thing He did here also: for consider, Joseph saw the
Virgin with child; this cast him into agitation and the utmost trouble, for he was suspecting
the damsel of adultery. But straightway the angel was at hand to do away his suspicion, and
remove his fears; and seeing the young child born, he reaped the greatest joy. Again, this
joy no trifling danger succeeds, the city being troubled, and the king in his madness seeking
after Him that was born. But this trouble was again succeeded by another joy; the star, and
the adoration of the wise men. Again, after this pleasure, fear and danger; “For Herod,” saith
he, “is seeking the young Child’s life,” and He must needs fly and withdraw Himself as any
<note type="footnote">351 The received mystical interpretation of our Lord’s final entry into Jerusalem represented the ass as the
type of the Jewish converts, and the colt, of the Gentile Church. See hereafter, Hom. LXVI., and comp. Origen
on St. Matt. t. 16, 15; St. Amb. in Luc. lib. 9, 4–14; St. Just. Mart. Dial. cum. Tryph. c. 53. The interpretation to
which St. Chrysostom points of the flight into Egypt, is probably the same with that of St. Hilary on this place.
“Joseph is admonished by the angel to take the young child into Egypt: Egypt full of idols, and given to the
worship of all kinds of portents for gods. Accordingly, after the persecution by the Jews, and the assent of that
profane multitude to His murder, Christ passes over to the nations, sold as they were to the vainest superstitions.
He leaves Jewry, and is carried into the world which knows Him not: while Bethlehem, i.e., Judæa, overflows
with the blood of martyrs. As to Herod’s rage and his murdering the infants, it is the type of the Jewish people
raging against the Christians, under the notion that by the slaughter of the blessed martyrs they may blot out
Christ’s name from the faith and profession of all men.” p.613, ed. Ben. Paris, 1693.</note>

<pb n="104"/>
mortal might: the working of miracles not being seasonable as yet. For if from His earliest
infancy He had shown forth wonders, He would not have been accounted a Man.</p>
<p>Because of this, let me add, neither is a temple framed at once; but a regular conception
takes place, and a time of nine months, and pangs, and a delivery, and giving suck, and silence
for so long a space, and He awaits the age proper to manhood; that by all means acceptance
might be won for the mystery of His Economy.</p>
<p>“But wherefore then,” one may say, “were even these signs wrought at the beginning?”
For His mother’s sake; for the sake of Joseph and of Simeon, who was presently to depart;
for the sake of the shepherds and of the wise men; for the sake of the Jews. Since they, had
they been willing to mind diligently what was taking place, would from this event also have
reaped no small advantage in regard of what was to come.</p>
<p>But if the prophets do not mention what relates to the wise men, be not troubled; for
they neither foretold all things, nor were they silent touching all. For as without any warning
to see those things coming to pass, would naturally occasion much astonishment and trouble;
so also to have been informed of all would dispose the hearer to sleep, and would have left
nothing for the evangelists to add.</p>
<p>5. And if the Jews should raise a question touching the prophecy, and say, that the words,
“Out of Egypt have I called my Son,” were uttered concerning themselves; we would tell
them, This is a law of prophecy, that in many cases much that is spoken of one set of persons
is fulfilled in another; of which kind is that which is said touching Simeon and Levi, “I will
divide them,” saith He, “in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.”352 And yet not in themselves
did this come to pass, but in their descendants; and Noah’s saying again about Canaan,
came to pass in the Gibeonites, Canaan’s descendants.353 And that concerning Jacob one
may see to have so come to pass; for those blessings which say, “Be lord over thy brother,
and let thy father’s sons worship thee,”354had no accomplishment in himself (how could
they, he being in fear and trembling, and worshipping his brother over and over again?355),
but in his offspring they had. The very same may be said in this case also. For which may
be called the truer son of God, he that worships a calf, and is joined to Baalpeor356and sacrifices
his sons to devils? or He that is a Son by nature, and honors Him that begat Him? So
that, except this man had come, the prophecy would not have received, its due fulfillment.
It is worth observing, too, that the evangelist intimates the same by the phrase, “that it might
be fulfilled;” implying that it would not have been fulfilled, unless He had come.</p>

<p>And this makes the Virgin also in no common degree glorious and distinguished; that
the very thing which was the whole people’s special endowment in the way of praise, she
also might thenceforth have for her own. I mean, that whereas they were proud of their
coming up from Egypt, and used to boast of it (which indeed the prophet also was hinting
at, when he said, “Have I not brought up the strangers from Cappadocia, and the Assyrians
from the pit”357), He makes this pre-eminence belong to the Virgin likewise.</p>
<p>Rather, however, both the people and the patriarch, going down thither, and coming
up thence, were together completing the type of this His return. Thus, as they went down
to avoid death by famine, so He death by conspiracy. But whereas they on their arrival were
for the time delivered from the famine, this man, when He had gone down, sanctified the
whole land, by setting His foot thereon.</p>
<p>At least it is observable how, in the midst of His humiliations, the tokens of His Godhead
are disclosed. Thus, first of all, the angel saying, “Flee into Egypt,” did not promise to journey
with them, either in their descent or return; intimating that they have a great fellow-traveller,
the Child that had been born; such an one as actually changed all things immediately on
His appearing, and wrought so that His enemies should minister in many ways to this
Economy. Thus magi and barbarians, leaving the superstition of their fathers, are come to
worship: thus Augustus ministers to the birth at Bethlehem by the decree for the taxing;
Egypt receives and preserves Him, driven from His home, and plotted against, and obtains
a sort of first impulse towards her union unto Him; so that when in after-time she should
hear Him preached by the apostles, she might have this at least to glory of, as having received
Him first. And yet this privilege did belong unto Palestine alone; but the second proved
more fervent than the first.</p>
<p>6. And now, shouldest thou come unto the desert of Egypt, thou wilt see this desert become
better than any paradise, and ten thousand choirs of angels in human forms, and nations
of martyrs, and companies of virgins, and all the devil’s tyranny put down, while
Christ’s kingdom shines forth in its brightness. And the mother of poets, and wise men,
and magicians,358were but inventions of sottish old women, but the real philosophy, and
worthy of heaven, is this, which was declared unto them by the fishermen. And for this very
cause, together with their so great exactness in doctrine, they exhibit also by their life that
extreme seriousness. For when they have stripped themselves of all that they have, and are
crucified to the whole world, they urge their course on again yet farther, using the labor of

their body for the nourishment of them that be in need. For neither, because they fast and
watch, do they think it meet to be idle by day; but their nights they spend in the holy hymns
and in vigils, and their days in prayers, and at the same time in laboring with their own
hands imitating the zeal of the apostle.359 For if he when the whole world was looking unto
him for the sake of nourishing them that were in need, both occupied a workshop, and
practised a craft, and being thus employed did not so much as sleep by night; how much
more, say they, is it meet that we, who have taken up our abode in the wilderness, and have
nothing to do with the turmoils in the cities, should use the leisure of our quiet for spiritual
labors!</p>
<p>Let us then be ashamed all of us, both they that are rich, and they that are poor, when
those having nothing at all but a body only and hands, force their way on and strive eagerly
to find thence a supply for the poor; while we, having endless stores within, touch not even
our superfluities for these objects. What kind of plea shall we have then, I pray thee? and
what sort of excuse?</p>
<p>Yet further consider, how of old these Egyptians were both avaricious, and gluttonous,
together with their other vices. For there were the flesh-pots360which the Jews remember;
there, the great tyranny of the belly. Nevertheless, having a willing mind, they changed: and
having caught fire from Christ, they set off at once on their voyage towards heaven; and
though more ardent than the rest of mankind, and more headstrong, both in anger, and in
bodily pleasures, they imitate the incorporeal powers in meekness, and in the rest of that
freedom from passions which pertains unto self-denial.</p>

entered those tabernacles, let him call to mind him who even until now is in the mouths of
all men,—him whom, after the apostles, Egypt brought forth,—the blessed and great Antony;
and let him put it to himself, “This man, too, was born in the same country with Pharaoh;
nevertheless he was not thereby damaged, but both had a divine vision vouchsafed him, and
showed forth such a life as the laws of Christ require.” And this any man shall know perfectly,
when he hath read the book that contains the history of that man’s life;361in which also he
will perceive much prophecy. I allude to his prediction about those infected with the errors
of Arius, and his statement of the mischief that would arise from them; God even then
having shown them to him, and sketched out before his eyes all that was coming. A thing
which most especially (among the rest) serves to demonstrate the truth, that no person,
belonging to the heresies without, hath such a man to mention. But, not to depend on us

<p>And this advice I give, that we not merely peruse what is written there, but that we also
emulate it, and make neither place, nor education, nor forefathers’ wickedness an excuse.
For if we will take heed to ourselves, none of these things shall be an hindrance to us, since
even Abraham had an ungodly father,362but he inherited not his wickedness; and Hezekiah,
Ahaz: yet nevertheless he became dear to God. And Joseph too when in the midst of Egypt,
adorned himself with the crowns of temperance; and the Three Children no less in the midst
of Babylon, and of the palace, when a table like those at Sybaris was set before them, showed
the highest self-denial; and Moses also in Egypt, and Paul in the whole world; but nothing
was to any one of these an hindrance in the race of virtue.</p>
<p>Let us then, bearing in mind all these things, put out of the way these our superfluous
pleas and excuses, and apply ourselves to those toils which the cause of virtue requires. For
thus shall we both attract to ourselves more favor from God, and persuade Him to assist us
in our struggles, and we shall obtain the eternal blessings; unto which God grant that we
may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory and victory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily IX.</head>
<p>Matt. II. 16.</p>
<p>“Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth.”</p>
<p>Yet surely it was a case not for anger, but for fear and awe: he ought to have perceived
that he was attempting impossible things. But he is not refrained. For when a soul is insensible
and incurable, it yields to none of the medicines given by God. See for example this man
following up his former efforts,363and adding many murders to one, and hurried down the
steep any whither. For driven wild by this anger, and envy, as by some demon, he takes account
of nothing, but rages even against nature herself, and his anger against the wise men
who had mocked him he vents upon the children that had done no wrong: venturing then
in Palestine upon a deed akin to the things that had been done in Egypt. For he “sent forth,”
it is said, “and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof,
from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of
the wise men.”</p>
<p>Here attend to me carefully. Because many things are uttered by many very idly touching
these children, and the course of events is charged with injustice, and some of these express
their perplexity about it in a more moderate way, others with more of audaciousness and
frenzy. In order then that we may free these of their madness and those of their perplexity,
suffer us to discourse a little upon this topic. Plainly, then, if this be their charge, that the
children were left to be slain, they should find fault likewise with the slaughter of the soldiers
that kept Peter.364 For as here, when the young child had fled, other children are massacred
in the place of Him who was sought; even so then, too, Peter having been delivered from
his prison and chains by the angel, one of like name with this tyrant, and like temper too,
when he had sought him, and found him not, slew instead of him the soldiers that kept him.</p>
<p>“But what is this?” it may be said; “why this is not a solution, but an enhancement of
our difficulty.” I know it too, and for this intent I bring forward all such cases, that to all I
may adduce one and the same solution. What then is the solution of these things? or what
fair account of them can we give? That Christ was not the cause of their slaughter, but the
king’s cruelty; as indeed neither was Peter to those others, but the madness of Herod. For
if he had seen the wall broken through, or the doors overthrown, he might, perhaps, have
had ground to accuse the soldiers that kept the apostle, of neglect; but now when all things
<note type="footnote">363 το προτροι παγωνιζμενον. Comp. Jude 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">364 Acts xii. 19.</note>

<pb n="109"/>
continued in due form,365and the doors were thrown wide open, and the chains fastened
to the hands of them that kept him (for in fact they were bound unto him), he might have
inferred from these things (that is, if he had been strictly doing a judge’s office on the matters
before him), that the event was not of human power or craft, but of some divine and wonderworking
power; he might have adored the doer of these things, instead of waging war with
the sentinels. For God had so done all that He did, that so far from exposing the keepers,
He was by their means leading the king unto the truth. But if he proved senseless, what
signifies to366the skillful Physician of Souls, managing all things to do good, the insubordination
of him that is diseased?</p>
<p>And just this one may say in the present case likewise. For, wherefore art thou wroth,
O Herod, at being mocked of the wise men? didst thou not know that the birth was divine?
didst thou not summon the chief priests? didst thou not gather together the scribes? did not
they, being called, bring the prophet also with them into thy court of judgment, proclaiming
these things beforehand from of old? Didst thou not see how the old things agreed with the
new? Didst thou not hear that a star also ministered to these men? Didst thou not reverence
the zeal of the barbarians? Didst thou not marvel at their boldness? Wast thou not horrorstruck
at the truth of the prophet? Didst thou not from the former things perceive the very
last also? Wherefore didst thou not reason with thyself from all these things, that this event
was not of the craft of the wise men, but of a Divine Power, duly dispensing all things? And
even if thou wert deceived by the wise men, what is that to367the young children, who have
done no wrong?</p>
<p>2. “Yea,” saith one, “Herod thou hast full well deprived of excuse, and proved him bloodthirsty;
but thou hast not yet solved the question about the injustice of what took place. For
if he did unjustly, wherefore did God permit it?” Now, what should we say to this? That
which I do not cease to say continually, in church, in the market-place and everywhere; that
which I also wish you carefully to keep in mind, for it is a sort of rule for us, suited to every
such perplexity. What then is our rule, and what our saying? That although there be many
that injure, yet is there not so much as one that is injured. And in order that the riddle may
not disturb you too much, I add the solution too with all speed. I mean, that what we may
suffer unjustly from any one, it tells either to the doing away of our sins, God so putting
that wrong to our account; or unto the recompense of rewards.</p>
<p>And that what I may say may be clearer, let us conduct our argument in the way of illustration.
As thus: suppose a certain servant who owes much money to his master, and then
that this servant has been despitefully used by unjust men, and robbed of some of his goods.
<note type="footnote">365 ἐπ σχματο.</note>
<note type="footnote">366 [τ πρς, “what is that to,” as in following paragraph.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">367 [τ πρς.]</note>

<pb n="110"/>
If then the master, in whose power it was to stay the plunderer and wrong doer, should not
indeed restore that same property, but should reckon what was taken away towards what
was owed him by his servant, is the servant then injured? By no means. But what if he should
repay him even more? Has he not then even gained more than he has lost? Every one, I
suppose, perceives it.</p>
<p>Now this same reckoning we are to make in regard of our own sufferings. For as to the
fact, that in consideration of what we may suffer wrongfully, we either have sins done away,
or receive more glorious crowns, if the amount of our sins be not so great: hear what Paul
says concerning him that had committed fornication, “Deliver ye such a one to Satan for
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved.”368“But what is this?” you may say,
“for the discourse was about them that were injured by others, not about them that are
corrected by their teachers.” I might answer, that there is no difference;369for the question
was, whether to suffer evil be not an indignity to the sufferer. But, to bring my argument
nearer the very point inquired of; remember David, how, when he saw Shimei at a certain
time assailing him, and trampling on his affliction, and pouring on him revilings without
end, his captains desiring to slay him, he utterly forbade them, saying, “Let him curse, that
the Lord may look upon mine abasement, and that he may requite me good for this cursing
this day.”370 And in the Psalms too in his chanting, he said, “Consider mine enemies, that
they are multiplied, and they hate me with unjust hatred,” and “forgive all my sins.”371 And
Lazarus again for the same cause enjoyed remission, having in this life suffered innumerable
evils. They therefore who are wronged, are not wronged if they bear nobly all that they suffer,
yea, rather they gain even more abundantly, whether they be smitten of God, or scourged
by the devil.</p>
<p>3. “But what kind of sin had these children,” it may be said, “that they should do it away?
for touching those who are of full age, and have been guilty of many negligences, one might
with show of reason speak thus: but they who so underwent premature death, what sort of
sins did they by their sufferings put away?” Didst thou not hear me say, that though there
were no sins, there is a recompense of rewards hereafter for them that suffer ill here? Wherein
then were the young children hurt in being slain for such a cause, and borne away speedily
into that waveless harbor? “Because,” sayest thou, “they would in many instances have
achieved, had they lived, many and great deeds of goodness.” Why, for this cause He lays
up for them beforehand no small reward, the ending their lives for such a cause. Besides, if

<pb n="111"/>
the children were to have been any great persons, He would not have suffered them to be
snatched away beforehand. For if they that eventually will live in continual wickedness are
endured by Him with so great long-sufferings, much more would He not have suffered these
to be so taken off had He foreknown they would accomplish any great things.</p>
<p>And these are the reasons we have to give; yet these are not all; but there are also others
more mysterious than these, which He knoweth perfectly, who Himself ordereth these
things. Let us then give up unto Him the more perfect understanding of this matter, and
apply ourselves to what follows, and in the calamities of others let us learn to bear all things
nobly. Yea, for it was no little scene of woe, which then befell Bethlehem, the children were
snatched from their mother’s breast, and dragged unto this unjust slaughter.</p>
<p>And if thou art yet faint-hearted, and not equal to controlling thyself in these things,
learn the end of him who dared all this, and recover thyself a little. For very quickly was he
overtaken by punishment for these things; and he paid the due penalty of such an abominable
act, ending his life by a grievous death, and more pitiable than that which he now dared inflict;
372suffering also countless additional ills, which ye may know of by perusing Josephus’
account of these events. But, lest we should make our discourse long, and interrupt its
continuity, we have not thought it necessary to insert that account in what we are saying.</p>
<p>4. “Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,373saying, In Rama
was there a voice heard, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because
they are not.”374</p>
<p>Thus having filled the hearer with horror by relating these things: the slaughter so violent
and unjust, so extremely cruel and lawless; he comforts him again, by saying, Not from
God’s wanting power to prevent it did all this take place, nor from any ignorance of His,
but when He both knew it, and foretold it,375and that loudly by His prophet. Be not troubled
then, neither despond, looking unto His unspeakable providence, which one may most
clearly see, alike by what He works, and by what He permits. And this He intimated in another
place also, when discoursing to His disciples. I mean where, having forewarned them
of the judgment seats, and executions, and of the wars of the world, and of the battle that
knows no truce, to uphold their spirit and to comfort them He saith, “Are not two sparrows
sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father which
is in Heaven.”376 These things He said, signifying that nothing is done without His knowledge,
but while He knows all, yet not in all doth He act. “Be not then troubled,” He saith,
<note type="footnote">372 See Josephus, A.J. xvii. 6, 5.</note>

<note type="footnote">374 Matt. ii. 17, 18.</note>

<note type="footnote">376 Matt. x. 29.</note>

<pb n="112"/>
“neither be disturbed.” For if He know what ye suffer, and hath power to hinder it, it is quite
clear that it is in His providence and care for you that He doth not hinder it. And this we
ought to bear in mind in our own temptations also, and great will be the consolation we
shall thence receive.</p>
<p>But what, it may be said, hath Rachel to do with Bethlehem? For it saith, “Rachel
weeping for her children.” And what hath Rama to do with Rachel? Rachel was the mother
of Benjamin, and on his death, they buried her in the horse-course that was near this place.377
The tomb then being near, and the portion pertaining unto Benjamin her infant (for Rama
was of the tribe of Benjamin), from the head of the tribe first, and next from the place of
her sepulture, He naturally denominates her young children who were massacred.378 Then
to show that the wound that befell her was incurable and cruel, He saith, “she would not be
comforted because they are not.”</p>
<p>Hence again we are taught this, which I mentioned before, never to be confounded
when what is happening is contrary to the promise of God. Behold, for instance, when He
was come for the salvation of the people, or rather for the salvation of the world, of what
kind were His beginnings. His mother, first, in flight; His birth-place is involved in irremediable
calamities, and a murder is perpetrated of all murders the bitterest, and there is lamentation
and great mourning, and wailings everywhere. But be not troubled; for He is wont
ever to accomplish His own dispensations by their contraries, affording us from thence a
very great demonstration of His power.</p>
<p>Thus did He lead on His own disciples also, and prepared them to do all their duty,
bringing about things by their contraries, that the marvel might be greater. They, at any
rate, being scourged and persecuted, and suffering terrors without end, did in this way get
the better of them that were beating and persecuting them.</p>
<p>5. “But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to
Joseph saying, Arise, and take the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel.”</p>
<p>He no more saith “fly,” but “go.” Seest thou again after the temptation refreshment?
then after the refreshment danger again? in that he was freed indeed from his banishment,
and came back again to his own country; and beheld the murderer of the children brought
to the slaughter;380but when he hath set foot on his own country, he finds again a remnant
of the former perils, the son of the tyrant living, and being king.</p>

<p>But how did Archelaus reign over Judæa, when Pontius Pilate was governor? Herod’s
death had recently taken place, and the kingdom had not yet been divided into many parts;
but as he had only just ended his life, the son for a while kept possession of the kingdom
“in the room of his father Herod;” his brother also bearing this name, which is the reason
why the evangelist added, “in the room of his father Herod.”</p>
<p>It may be said, however, “if he was afraid to settle in Judæa on account of Archelaus,
he had cause to fear Galilee also on account of Herod.” I answer, By his changing the place,
the whole matter was thenceforward thrown into shade; for the whole assault was upon
“Bethlehem and the coasts thereof.” Therefore now that the slaughter had taken place, the
youth Archelaus had no other thought, but that the whole was come to an end, and that
amongst the many, He that was sought had been destroyed. And besides, his father having
come to such an end of his life before his eyes, he became for the future more cautious about
farther proceedings, and about urging on that course of iniquity.</p>
<p>Joseph therefore comes to Nazareth, partly to avoid the danger, partly also delighting
to abide in his native place. To give him the more courage, he receives also an oracle from
the angel touching this matter. Luke, however, doth not say that he came there by Divine
warning, but that when they had fulfilled all the purification, they returned to Nazareth.381
What then may one say? That Luke is giving an account of the time before the going down
to Egypt, when he saith these things. For He would not have brought them down thither
before the purification, in order that nothing should be done contrary to the law, but he
waited for her to be purified, and to go to Nazareth, and that then they should go down to
Egypt. Then, after their return, He bids them go to Nazareth. But before this they were not
warned of God to go thither, but yearning after their native place, they did so of their own
accord. For since they had gone up for no other cause but on account of the taxing, and had
not so much as a place where to stay, when they had fulfilled that for which they had come
up, they went down to Nazareth.382</p>
<p>6. We see here the cause why the angel also, putting them at ease for the future, restores
them to their home. And not even this simply, but he adds to it a prophecy, “That it might
be fulfilled,” saith he, “which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.”383</p>
<p>And what manner of prophet said this? Be not curious, nor overbusy. For many of the
prophetic writings have been lost; and this one may see from the history of the Chronicles.384

For being negligent, and continually falling into ungodliness, some they suffered to perish,
others they themselves burnt up385and cut to pieces. The latter fact Jeremiah relates;386the
former, he who composed the fourth book of Kings, saying, that after387a long time the
book of Deuteronomy was hardly found, buried somewhere and lost. But if, when there was
no barbarian there, they so betrayed their books, much more when the barbarians had
overrun them. For as to the fact, that the prophet had foretold it, the apostles themselves in
many places call Him a Nazarene.388</p>
<p>“Was not this then,” one may say, “casting a shade over the prophecy touching Bethlehem?”
By no means: rather this very fact was sure greatly to stir up men, and to awaken
them to the search of what was said of Him. Thus, for example, Nathanael too enters on the
inquiry concerning Him, saying, “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?”389 For
the place was of little esteem; or rather not that place only, but also the whole district of
Galilee. Therefore the Pharisees said, “Search and look, for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.”
390 Nevertheless, He is not ashamed to be named even from thence, signifying that He
needs not ought of the things of men; and His disciples also He choses out of Galilee;
everywhere cutting off the pretexts of them who are disposed to be remiss, and giving tokens
that we have no need of outward things, if we practise virtue. For this cause He doth not
choose for Himself so much as a house; for “the Son of Man,” saith He, “hath not where to
lay His head;”391and when Herod is plotting against Him, He fleeth, and at His birth is laid
in a manger, and abides in an inn, and takes a mother of low estate; teaching us to think no
such thing a disgrace, and from the first outset trampling under foot the haughtiness of
man, and bidding us give ourselves up to virtue only.</p>
<p>7. For why dost thou pride thyself on thy country, when I am commanding thee to be
a stranger to the whole world? (so He speaks); when thou hast leave to become such as that
all the universe shall not be worthy of thee? For these things are so utterly contemptible,
that they are not thought worthy of any consideration even amongst the philosophers of
the Greeks, but are called Externals, and occupy the lowest place.</p>

they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.’”392 But tell me, when, and of what things was he

discoursing, and to whom? Why, to those of Gentile origin, who were puffing themselves
up on their faith, and exalting themselves against the Jews, and so breaking them off the
more: to quell the swelling pride of the one, and to win over the others, and thoroughly excite
them to the same emulation. For when he is speaking of those noble and great men, hear
how he saith, “They that say these things, show plainly that they seek a country; and truly
if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity
to have returned: but now they desire another, a better country.”393 And again, “These
all died in faith, not having obtained the promises, but having seen them afar off, and embraced
them.”394 And John too said unto those that were coming to him, “Think not to say,
We have Abraham to our father.”395 And Paul again, “For they are not all Israel, which are
of Israel; neither they, which are the children of the flesh, are they the children of God.”396
For what were the sons of Samuel advantaged, tell me, by their father’s nobleness, when
they were not heirs of their father’s virtue? And what profit had Moses’ sons, not having
emulated his perfection?397 Therefore neither did they inherit the dominion; but whilst
they enrolled him as their father, the rule of the people passed away to another, to him who
had become his son in the way of virtue. And what harm was it to Timothy, that he was of
a Greek father? Or what on the other hand again was Noah’s son profited by the virtue of
his father, when he became a slave instead of free? Seest thou, how little the nobleness of a
father avails his children in the way of advocacy?398 For the wickedness of Ham’s disposition
overcame the laws of nature, and cast him not only out of the nobility which he had in respect
of his father, but also out of his free estate. And what of Esau? Was he not son of Isaac, and
had he not his father to stand his friend? Yea, his father too endeavored and desired that he
should partake of the blessings, and he himself for the sake of this did all that was commanded
him. Nevertheless, because he was untoward,399none of these things profited him; but although
he was by birth first, and had his father on his side doing everything for this object,
yet not having God with him, he lost all.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of men? The Jews were sons of God, and gained nothing by this
their high birth. Now if a man, having become a son of God, but failing to show forth an

excellency meet for this noble birth, is even punished the more abundantly; why dost thou
bring me forward the nobleness of ancestors remote or near? For not under the old covenant400only,
but even under the new, one may find this rule to have held. For “as many as
received Him,” it is said “to them gave He power to become the sons of God.”401 And yet
many of these children Paul hath affirmed to be nothing profited by their father; “For if ye
be circumcised,” saith he, “Christ shall profit you nothing.”402 And if Christ be no help to
those who will not take heed to themselves, how shall a man stand up in their behalf?</p>
<p>8. Let us not therefore pride ourselves either on high birth, or on wealth, but rather
despise them who are so minded: neither let us be dejected at poverty. But let us seek that
wealth, which consists in good works; let us flee that poverty, which causes men to be in
wickedness, by reason of which also that rich man was poor;403wherefore he had not at his
command so much as a drop of water, and that, although he made much entreaty. Whereas,
who can be so poor amongst us,404as to want water enough even for comfort? There is none
such. For even they that are pining with extreme hunger, may have the comfort of a drop
of water; and not of a drop only, but of refreshment too far more abundant. Not so that rich
man, but he was poor even to this degree: and what was yet more grievous, he could not so
much as soothe his poverty from any source. Why then do we gape after riches, since they
bring us not into Heaven?</p>
<p>For tell me, if any king among those upon earth had said, It is impossible for him that
is rich to be distinguished at court, or to enjoy any honor; would ye not have thrown away
every one his riches with contempt? So then, if they cast us out from such honor as is in the
palaces below, they shall be worthy of all contempt: but, when the King of Heaven is day by
day crying aloud and saying, “It is hard with them, to set foot on that sacred threshold;”
shall we not give up all, and withdraw from our possessions, that with boldness we may
enter into the kingdom? And of what consideration are we worthy, who are at great pains
to encompass ourselves with the things that obstruct our way thither; and to hide them not
only in chests, but even in the earth, when we might entrust them to the guard of the very
Heavens? Since now surely thou art doing the same, as if any husbandman, having gotten
wheat wherewith to sow a rich land, was to leave the land alone, and bury all the wheat in
a pit, so as neither to enjoy it himself, nor for the wheat to come to ought, but decay and
waste. But what is their common plea, when we accuse them of these things? It gives no

little comfort, say they, to know that all is laid up for us in safety at home. Nay, rather not
to know of its being laid up is a comfort. For even if thou art not afraid of famine, yet other
more grievous things, on account of this store, must needs be a terror to thee: deaths, wars,
plots laid against thee. And if a famine should ever befall us, the people again, constrained
by the belly, takes weapon in hand against thy house. Or rather, in so doing, thou art first
of all bringing famine into our cities, and next thou art forming for thine own house this
gulf, more grievous than famine. For by stress of famine I know not any who have come to
a speedy end; there being in fact many means in many quarters which may be devised to
assuage that evil: but for possessions and riches, and the pursuits connected with them, I
can show many to have come by their ruin, some in secret, some openly. And with many
such instances the highways abound, with many the courts of law, and the market-places.
But why speak I of the highways, the courts of law and the market-places? Why, the very
sea thou mayest behold filled with their blood. For not over the land only, as it seems, hath
this tyranny prevailed, but over the ocean also hath walked in festal procession with great
excess. And one makes a voyage for gold, another, again, is stabbed for the same; and the
same tyrannical power hath made one a merchant, the other a murderer.</p>
<p>What then can be less trustworthy than Mammon, seeing that for his sake one travels,
and ventures, and is slain? “But who,” it is said, “will pity a charmer that is bitten with a
serpent?”405 For we ought, knowing its cruel tyranny, to flee that slavery, and destroy that
grievous longing. “But how,” saith one, “is this possible?” By introducing another longing,
the longing for Heaven. Since he that desires the kingdom will laugh covetousness to scorn;
he that is become Christ’s slave is no slave of mammon, but rather his lord; for him that
flieth from him, he is wont to follow, and to fly from him that pursues. He honors not so
much his pursuer as his despiser; no one doth he so laugh to scorn, as them that desire him;
nor doth he only laugh them to scorn, but wraps round them also innumerable bonds.</p>
<p>Be it ours then, however late, to loose these grievous chains. Why bring thy reasonable
soul into bondage to brute matter, to the mother of those untold evils? But, oh the absurdity!
that while we are warring against it in words, it makes war with us by deeds, and leads and
carries us everywhere about, insulting us as purchased with money, and meet for the lash;
and what can be more disgraceful and dishonorable than this?</p>
<p>Again: if we do not get the better of senseless forms of matter, how shall we have the
advantage of the incorporeal powers? If we despise not vile earth and abject stones, how
shall we bring into subjection the principalities and authorities? How shall we practise
temperance? I mean, if silver dazzle and overpower us, when shall we be able to hurry by a
fair face? For, in fact, some are so sold under this tyranny, as be moved somehow even at
the mere show of the gold, and in playfulness to say, that the very eyes are the better for a
<note type="footnote">405 Ecclus. xii. 13.</note>

<pb n="118"/>
gold coin coming in sight. But make not such jests, whoever thou art;406for nothing so injures
the eyes, both those of the body and those of the soul, as the lust of these things. For instance;
it was this grievous longing that put out the lamps of those virgins, and cast them out of the
bride chamber. This sight, which (as thou saidst) “doeth good to the eyes,” suffered not the
wretched Judas to hearken unto the Lord’s voice, but led him even to the halter, made him
burst asunder in the midst; and, after all that, conducted him on to hell.</p>
<p>What then can be more lawless than this? what more horrible? I do not mean the substance
of riches, but the unseasonable and frantic desire of them? Why, it even drops human
gore, and looks murder, and is fiercer than any wild beast, tearing in pieces them that fall
in its way, and what is much worse, it suffers them not even to have any sense of being so
mangled. For reason would that those who are so treated should stretch forth their hand to
them that pass by, and call them to their assistance, but these are even thankful for such
rendings of their flesh, than which what can be more wretched?</p>
<p>Let us then, bearing in mind all these things, flee the incurable disease; let us heal the
wounds it hath made, and withdraw ourselves from such a pest: in order that both here we
may live a secure and untroubled life, and attain to the future treasure; unto which God grant
that we may all attain,407by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
whom unto the Father together with the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and ever,
and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily X.</head>
<p>Matt. III. 1, 2.</p>
<p>“In those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, and saying,
Repent ye: for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</p>
<p>How “in those days”? For not then, surely, when He was a child, and came to Nazareth,
but thirty years after, John cometh; as Luke also testifies. How then is it said, “in those days”?
The Scripture is always wont to use this manner of speech, not only when it is mentioning
what occurs in the time immediately after, but also of things which are to come to pass many
years later. Thus also, for example, when His disciples came unto Him as He sat on the
Mount of Olives, and sought to learn about His coming, and the taking of Jerusalem:408and
yet ye know how great is the interval between those several periods. I mean, that having
spoken of the subversion of the mother city, and completed His discourse on that subject,
and being about to pass to that on the consummation, he inserted, “Then shall these things
also come to pass;”409not bringing together the times by the word then, but indicating that
time only in which these things were to happen. And this sort of thing he doth now also,
saying, “In those days.” For this is not put to signify the days that come immediately after,
but those in which these things were to take place, which he was preparing to relate.</p>
<p>“But why was it after thirty years,” it may be said, “that Jesus came unto His baptism”?
After this baptism He was thenceforth to do away with the law: wherefore even until this
age, which admits of all sins, He continues fulfilling it all; that no one might say, that because
He Himself could not fulfill it, He did it away. For neither do all passions assail us at all
times; but while in the first age of life there is much thoughtlessness and timidity, in that
which comes after it, pleasure is more vehement, and after this again the desire of wealth.
For this cause he awaits the fullness of His adult age, and throughout it all fulfills the law,
and so comes to His baptism, adding it as something which follows upon the complete
keeping of all the other commandments.</p>
<p>To prove that this was to Him the last good work of those enjoined by the law, hear His
own words: “For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”410 Now what He saith is
like this: “We have performed all the duties of the law, we have not transgressed so much
as one commandment. Since therefore this only remains, this too must be added, and so
shall we “fulfill all righteousness.” For He here calls by the name of “righteousness” the full
performance of all the commandments.</p>
<note type="footnote">408 Matt. xxiv. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">409 Matt. xxiv. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">410 Matt. iii. 15.</note>

<pb n="120"/>
<p>2. Now that on this account Christ came to His baptism, is from this evident. But
wherefore was this baptism devised for Him? For that not of himself did the son of
Zacharias proceed to this, but of God who moved him,—this Luke also declares, when he
saith, “The word of the Lord came unto him,”411that is, His commandment. And he himself
too saith, “He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, upon whom thou
shalt see the Spirit descending like a dove, and remaining on Him, the same is He which
baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”412 Wherefore then was he sent to baptize? The Baptist again
makes this also plain to us, saying, “I knew Him not, but that He should be made manifest
to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.”413</p>
<p>And if this was the only cause, how saith Luke, that “he came into the country about
Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins?”414 And yet it had
not remission, but this gift pertained unto the baptism that was given afterwards; for in this
“we are buried with Him,”415and our old man was then crucified with Him, and before the
cross there doth not appear remission anywhere; for everywhere this is imputed to His
blood. And Paul too saith, “But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,” not by the baptism of
John, but “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.”416 And
elsewhere too he saith, “John verily preached a baptism of repentance,” (he saith not “of
remission,”) “that they should believe on Him that should come after him.”417 For when
the sacrifice was not yet offered, neither had the spirit yet come down, nor sin was put away,
nor the enmity removed, nor the curse destroyed; how was remission to take place?</p>
<p>What means then, “for the remission of sins?”</p>
<p>The Jews were senseless, and had never any feeling of their own sins, but while they
were justly accountable for the worst evils, they were justifying themselves in every respect;
and this more than anything caused their destruction, and led them away from the faith.
This, for example, Paul himself was laying to their charge, when he said, that “they being
ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about418to establish their own, had not submitted
themselves unto the righteousness of God.”419 And again: “What shall we say then? That
the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained420to righteousness; but

<pb n="121"/>
Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained421unto the law of
righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works.”422</p>
<p>Since therefore this was the cause of their evils, John cometh, doing nothing else but
bringing them to a sense of their own sins. This, among other things, his very garb declared,
being that of repentance and confession. This was indicated also by what he preached, for
nothing else did he say, but “bring forth fruits meet for repentance.”423 Forasmuch then
as their not condemning their own sins, as Paul also hath explained, made them start off
from Christ, while their coming to a sense thereof would set them upon longing to seek
after their Redeemer, and to desire remission; this John came to bring about, and to persuade
them to repent, not in order that they might be punished, but that having become by repentance
more humble, and condemning themselves, they might hasten to receive remission.</p>
<p>But let us see how exactly he hath expressed it; how, having said, that he “came
preaching the baptism of repentance in the wilderness of Judæa,” he adds, “for remission,”
as though he said, For this end he exhorted them to confess and repent of their sins; not
that they should be punished, but that they might more easily receive the subsequent remission.
For had they not condemned themselves, they could not have sought after His grace;
and not seeking, they could not have obtained remission.</p>
<p>Thus that baptism led the way for this; wherefore also he said, that “they should believe
on Him which should come after him;”424together with that which hath been mentioned
setting forth this other cause of His baptism. For neither would it have been as much for
him to have gone about to their houses, and to have led Christ around, taking Him by the
hand, and to have said, “Believe in This Man;” as for that blessed voice to be uttered, and
all those other things performed in the presence and sight of all.</p>
<p>On account of this He cometh to the baptism. Since in fact both the credit of him that
was baptizing, and the purport of the thing itself,425was attracting the whole city, and calling
it unto Jordan; and it became a great spectacle.426
Therefore he humbles them also when they are come, and persuades them to have no
high fancies about themselves; showing them liable to the utmost evils, unless they would
repent, and leaving their forefathers, and all vaunting in them, would receive Him that was
coming.</p>

<p>Because in fact the things concerning Christ had been up to that time veiled, and many
thought He was dead, owing to the massacre which took place at Bethlehem. For though at
twelve years old He discovered Himself, yet did He also quickly veil Himself again. And for
this cause there was need of that splendid exordium and of a loftier beginning. Wherefore
also then for the first time he with clear voice proclaims things which the Jews had never
heard, neither from prophets, nor from any besides; making mention of Heaven, and of the
kingdom there, and no longer saying anything touching the earth.</p>
<p>But by the kingdom in this place he means His former and His last advent.</p>
<p>3. “But what is this to the Jews?” one may say, “for they know not even what thou sayest.”
“Why, for this cause,” saith he, “do I so speak, in order that being roused by the obscurity
of my words, they may proceed to seek Him, whom I preach.” In point of fact, he so excited
them with good hopes when they came near, that even many publicans and soldiers inquired
what they should do, and how they should direct their own life; which was a sign of being
thenceforth set free from all worldly things, and of looking to other greater objects, and of
foreboding427things to come. Yea, for all, both the sights and the words of that time, led
them unto lofty thoughts.</p>
<p>Conceive, for example, how great a thing it was to see a man after thirty years coming
down from the wilderness, being the son of a chief priest, who had never known the common
wants of men, and was on every account venerable, and had Isaiah with him. For he too was
present proclaiming him, and saying, “This is he who I said should come crying, and
preaching throughout the whole wilderness with a clear voice.” For so great was the earnestness
of the prophets touching these things, that not their own Lord only, but him also who
was to minister unto Him, they proclaimed a long time beforehand, and they not only
mentioned him, but the place too in which he was to abide, and the manner of the doctrine
which he had to teach when he came, and the good effect that was produced by him.</p>
<p>See, at least, how both the prophet and the Baptist go upon the same ideas, although
not upon the same words.</p>
<p>Thus the prophet saith that he shall come saying, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
his paths straight.”428 And he himself when he was come said, “Bring forth fruits meet for
repentance,”429which corresponds with, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” Seest thou that
both by the words of the prophet, and by his own preaching, this one thing is manifested
alone; that he was come, making a way and preparing beforehand, not bestowing the gift,
which was the remission, but ordering in good time the souls of such as should receive the
God of all?</p>

<pb n="123"/>
<p>But Luke expresses somewhat further: not repeating the exordium, and so passing on,
but setting down likewise all the prophecy. “For every valley,” saith he, “shall be filled; and
every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and
the rough ways smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”430 Dost thou perceive
how the prophet hath anticipated all by his words; the concourse of the people, the change
of things for the better, the easiness of that which was preached, the first cause of all that
was occurring, even if he hath expressed it rather as in figure, it being in truth a prophecy
which he was uttering? Thus, when he saith, “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain
and hill shall be brought low, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;” he is signifying
the exaltation of the lowly, the humiliation of the self-willed, the hardness of the law changed
into easiness of faith. For it is no longer toils and labors, saith he, but grace, and forgiveness
of sins, affording great facility of salvation. Next he states the cause of these things, saying,
“All flesh shall see the salvation of God;” no longer Jews and proselytes only, but also all
earth and sea, and the whole race of men. Because by “the crooked things” he signified our
whole corrupt life, publicans, harlots, robbers, magicians, as many as having been perverted
before afterwards walked in the right way: much as He Himself likewise said, “publicans
and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you,”431because they believed. And in other
words also again the prophet declared the self-same thing, thus saying, “Then wolves and
lambs shall feed together.”432 For like as here by the hills and valleys, he meant that incongruities
of character433are blended into one and the same evenness of self-restraint, so also
there, by the characters of the brute animals indicating the different dispositions of men,
he again spoke of their being linked in one and the same harmony of godliness. Here also,
as before, stating the cause. That cause is, “There shall be He that riseth to reign over the
Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust:”434much the same as here too he said, “All flesh
shall see the salvation of God,” everywhere declaring that the power and knowledge of these
our Gospels would be poured out to the ends of the world, converting the human race, from
a brutish disposition and a fierce temper to something very gentle and mild.</p>

<pb n="124"/>
<p>Observe, how the prophets foretold some things, others they left to the evangelists.
Wherefore also Matthew both sets down the prophecies, and adds his own part, not accounting
even this superfluous, to speak of the dress of the righteous man.</p>
<p>For indeed it was a marvellous and strange thing to behold so great austerity in a human
frame: which thing also particularly attracted the Jews, seeing in him the great Elijah, and
guided by what they then beheld, to the memory of that blessed man; or rather, even to a
greater astonishment. For the one indeed was brought up in cities and in houses, the other
dwelt entirely in the wilderness from his very swaddling clothes. For it became the forerunner
of Him who was to put away all the ancient ills, the labor, for example, the curse, the sorrow,
the sweat; himself also to have certain tokens of such a gift, and to come at once to be above
that condemnation. Thus he neither ploughed land, nor opened furrow, he ate not his bread
by the sweat of his face, but his table was hastily supplied, and his clothing more easily furnished
than his table, and his lodging yet less troublesome than his clothing. For he needed
neither roof, nor bed, nor table, nor any other of these things, but a kind of angel’s life in
this our flesh did he exhibit. For this cause his very garment was of hair, that by his dress
he might instruct men to separate themselves from all things human, and to have nothing
in common with the earth, but to hasten back to their earlier nobleness, wherein Adam was
before he wanted garments or robe. Thus that garb bore tokens of nothing less than a kingdom,
and of repentance.</p>
<p>And do not say to me, “Whence had he a garment of hair and a girdle, dwelling as he
did in the wilderness?” For if thou art to make a difficulty of this, thou wilt also inquire into
more things besides; how in the winters, and how in the heats of summer, he continued in
the wilderness, and this with a delicate body, and at an immature age? how the nature of
his infant flesh endured such great inconstancy of weather, and a diet so uncommon, and
all the other hardships arising from the wilderness?</p>
<p>Where now are the philosophers of the Greeks, who at random and for nought emu
lated the shamelessness of the Cynics (for what is the profit of being shut up in a tub, and
afterwards running into such wantonness)? they who encompassed themselves with rings
and cups, and men servants and maid servants, and with much pomp besides, falling into
either extreme. But this man was not so; but he dwelt in the wilderness as in Heaven,
showing forth all strictness of self-restraint. And from thence, like some angel from Heaven,
he went down unto the cities, being a champion of godliness, and a crowned victor over the
world, and a philosopher of that philosophy which is worthy of the heavens. And these
things were, when sin was not yet put away, when the law had not yet ceased, when death
was not yet bound, when the brazen gates were not yet broken up, but while the ancient
polity still was in force.</p>

<pb n="125"/>
<p>Such is the nature of a noble and thoroughly vigilant soul, for it is everywhere springing
forward, and passing beyond the limits set to it; as Paul436also did with respect to the new
polity.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, did he use a girdle with his raiment? This was customary with
them of old time, before men passed into this soft and loose kind of dress. Thus, for instance,
both Peter437appears to have been “girded,” and Paul; for it saith, “the man that owneth
this girdle.”438 And Elijah439too was thus arrayed, and every one of the saints, because they
were at work continually, laboring, and busying themselves either in journeyings, or about
some other necessary matter; and not for this cause only, but also with a view of trampling
under foot all ornaments, and practising all austerity. This very kind of thing accordingly
Christ declares to be the greatest praise of virtue, thus saying, “What went ye out for to see?
a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in king’s houses.”440</p>
<p>But if he, who was so pure, and more glorious than the heaven, and above all prophets,
than whom none greater was born, and who had such great boldness of speech, thus exercised
himself in austerity, scorning so exceedingly all dissolute delicacy, and training himself to
this hard life; what excuse shall we have, who after so great a benefit, and the unnumbered
burdens of our sins, do not show forth so much as the least part of his penance,441but are
drinking and surfeiting, and smelling of perfumes, and in no better trim than the harlot
women on the stage, and are by all means softening ourselves, and making ourselves an easy
prey to the devil?442</p>
<p>5. “Then went out to him all Judea, and Jerusalem, and all the region round about Jordan,
and were baptized of him, confessing their sins.”443</p>
<p>Seest thou how great power was in the coming of the prophet? how he stirred up all the
people; how he led them to a consideration of their own sins? For it was indeed worthy of
wonder to behold him in human form showing forth such things and using so great freedom
of speech, and rising up in condemnation of all as children, and having his great grace
beaming out from his countenance. And, moreover, the appearance of a prophet after the
<note type="footnote">436 As in refusing to be supported (in several cases) by those to whom he preached the gospel. See his account

<pb n="126"/>
great interval of time contributed to their amazement, because the gift had failed them, and
returned to them after a long time. And the nature of his preaching too was strange and
unusual. For they heard of none of those things to which they were accustomed; such as
wars and battles and victories below, and famine and pestilence, and Babylonians and Persians,
and the taking of the city, and the other things with which they were familiar, but of
Heaven and of the kingdom there, and of the punishment in hell. And it was for this cause,
let me add, that although they that committed revolt in the wilderness, those in the company
of Judas, and of Theudas,444had been all of them slain no great while before, yet they were
not the more backward to go out thither. For neither was it for the same objects that he
summoned them, as for dominion, or revolt, or revolution; but in order to lead them by the
hand to the kingdom on high. Wherefore neither did he keep them in the wilderness to take
them about with him, but baptizing them, and teaching them the rules concerning selfdenial,
he dismissed them; by all means instructing them to scorn whatever things are on
earth, and to raise themselves up to the things to come, and press on every day.</p>
<p>6. This man then let us also emulate, and forsaking luxury and drunkenness let us go
over unto the life of restraint. For this surely is the time of confession both for the uninitiated
and for the baptized; for the one, that upon their repentance they may partake of the sacred
mysteries; for the others, that having washed away their stain after baptism, they may ap-
proach the table with a clean conscience. Let us then forsake this soft and effeminate way
of living. For it is not, it is not possible at once both to do penance445and to live in luxury.
And this let John teach you by his raiment, by his food, by his abode. What then? dost thou
require us, you may say, to practise such self-restraint as this? I do not require it, but I advise
and recommend it. But if this be not possible to you, let us at least, though in cities, show
forth repentance, for the judgment is surely at our doors. But even if it were further off, we
ought not even so to be emboldened, for the term of each man’s life is the end of the world
virtually to him that is summoned. But that it is even at the doors, hear Paul saying, “The
night is far spent, the day is at hand;”446and again, “He that cometh will come, and will not
tarry.”447</p>
<p>For the signs too are now complete, which announce that day. For “this Gospel of the
Kingdoms,” saith He, “shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and
then shall the end come.”448 Attend with care to what is said. He said not, “when it hath

been believed by all men,” but “when it hath been preached to449all.” For this cause he also
said, “for a witness to the nations,” to show, that He doth not wait for all men to believe,
and then for Him to come. Since the phrase, “for a witness,” hath this meaning, “for accusation,”
“for reproof,” “for condemnation of them that have not believed.”</p>
<p>But we, while hearing these things and seeing them, slumber, and see dreams, sunk in
a lethargy, as in some very deepest night.450 For the things present are nothing better than
dreams, whether they be prosperous, or whether they be painful. Wherefore I entreat you
now at length to be awakened, and to look another way, unto the Sun of Righteousness. For
no man while sleeping can see the sun, nor delight his eyes with the beauty of its beams; but
whatever he may see, he beholds all as in a dream. For this cause we need much penance,
and many tears; both as being in a state of insensibility while we err, and because our sins
are great, and beyond excuse. And that I lie not, the more part of them that hear me are
witnesses. Nevertheless, although they be beyond excuse, let us repent, and we shall receive
crowns.</p>
<p>7. But by repentance I mean, not only to forsake our former evil deeds, but also to show
forth good deeds greater than those. For, “bring forth,” saith he, “fruits meet for repentance.”
451 But how shall we bring them forth? If we do the opposite things: as for instance,
hast thou seized by violence the goods of others? henceforth give away even thine own. Hast
thou been guilty of fornication for a long time? abstain even from thy wife for certain appointed
days; exercise continence. Hast thou insulted and stricken such as were passing by?
Henceforth bless them that insult thee, and do good to them that smite thee. For it sufficeth
not for our health to have plucked out the dart only, but we must also apply remedies to the
wound. Hast thou lived in self-indulgence, and been drunken in time past? Fast, and take
care to drink water, in order to destroy the mischief that hath so grown up within thee. Hast
thou beheld with unchaste eyes beauty that belonged to another? Henceforth do not so
much as look upon a woman at all, that thou mayest stand in more safety. For it is said,
“Depart from evil, and do good;”452and again, “Make thy tongue to cease from evil, and thy
lips that they speak no guile.”453“But tell me the good too.” “Seek peace, and pursue it:” I
mean not peace with man only, but also peace with God. And he hath well said, “pursue”
her: for she is driven away, and cast out; she hath left the earth, and is gone to sojourn in

Heaven. Yet shall we be able to bring her back again, if we will put away pride and boasting,
and whatsoever things stand in her way, and will follow this temperate and frugal life.454
For nothing is more grievous than wrath and fierce anger. This renders men both puffed
up and servile, by the former making them ridiculous, by the other hateful; and bringing in
opposite vices, pride and flattery, at the same time. But if we will cut off the greediness of
this passion, we shall be both lowly with exactness, and exalted with safety. For in our bodies
too all distempers arise from excess; and when the elements thereof leave their proper limits,
and go on beyond moderation, then all these countless diseases are generated, and grievous
kinds of death. Somewhat of the same kind one may see take place with respect to the soul
likewise.</p>
<p>8. Let us therefore cut away excess, and drinking the salutary medicine of moderation,
let us abide in our proper temperament, and give careful heed to our prayers. Though we
receive not, let us persevere that we may receive; and if we do receive, then because we have
received. For it is not at all His wish to defer giving, but by such delay He is contriving for
us to persevere. With this intent He doth also lengthen out455what is good for us better than
we do, and loves us more ardently than those who gave us birth. And let both these considerations
be a charm for us to chant to ourselves in every terror that occurs, that so we may
quell our despondency, and in all things glorify Him, who on our behalf doeth and ordereth
all, even God.</p>
<p>For so we shall both easily repulse all hostile devices, and attain unto the incorruptible
crowns: by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto
the Father glory, might, and honor, together with the Holy Ghost, now, and always, even
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XI.</head>
<p>Matt. III. 7.</p>
<p>“But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto
them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?”</p>
<p>How then doth Christ say, that they did not believe John?456 Because this was not believing,
to decline receiving Him whom he preached. For so they thought they regarded
their prophets and their lawgiver, nevertheless He said they had not regarded them, for-
asmuch as they received not Him, that was foretold by them. “For if ye had believed Moses,”
saith He, “ye would have believed Me.”457 And after this again, being asked by Christ, “The
baptism of John, whence is it?”458they said, “If we shall say, Of earth, we fear the people; if
we shall say, From heaven, He will say unto us, How then did ye not believe him?”</p>
<p>So that from all these things it is manifest that they came indeed and were baptized, yet
they did not abide in the belief of that which was preached. For John also points out their
wickedness, by their sending459unto the Baptist, and saying, “Art thou Elias? Art thou
Christ?” wherefore he also added, “they which were sent were of the Pharisees.”460</p>
<p>“What then? were not the multitudes also of this same mind”? one may say. Nay, the
multitudes in simplicity of mind had this suspicion, but the Pharisees, wishing to lay hold
of Him. For since it was acknowledged that Christ comes out of the village of David, and
this man was of the tribe of Levi, they laid a snare by the question, in order that if he should
say any such thing they might quickly come upon him. This at any rate he hath declared by
what follows; for on his not acknowledging any of the things which they expected, even so
they take hold of him, saying, “Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ?”461</p>
<p>And to convince thee that the Pharisees came with one mind, and the people with another,
hear how the evangelist hath declared this too; saying of the people, “that they came
and were baptized of him, confessing their sins;”462but concerning the Pharisees, no longer
like that, but that “when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming, he said, O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?” O greatness of
mind! How doth he discourse unto men ever thirsting after the blood of the prophets, and

in disposition no better than serpents! how doth he disparage both themselves and their
progenitors with all plainness!</p>
<p>2. “Yea,” saith one; “he speaks plainly enough, but the question is if there be any reason
in this plainness. For he did not see them sinning, but in the act of change; wherefore they
did not deserve blame, but rather praise and approbation, for having left city and houses,
and making haste to hear his preaching.”</p>
<p>What then shall we say? That he had not things present, and even now doing, in his
view, but he knew the secrets of their mind, God having revealed this. Since then they were
priding themselves on their forefathers, and this was like to prove the cause of their destruction,
and was casting them into a state of carelessness, he cuts away the roots of their pride.
For this cause Isaiah also calls them, “rulers of Sodom,” and “people of Gomorrah;”463and
another prophet saith, “Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians;”464and all withdraw them
from this way of thinking, bringing down their pride, which had caused them unnumbered
evils.</p>
<p>“But the prophets,” you will say, “naturally did so; for they saw them sinning: but in
this case, with what view and for what cause doeth he the same, seeing them obey him.” To
make them yet more tender-hearted.</p>
<p>But if one accurately mark his words, he hath also tempered his rebuke with commendation.
For he spake these things, as marveling at them, that they were become able, however
late, to do what seemed almost an impossibility for them. His rebuke, you see, is rather that
of one bringing them over, and working upon them to arouse themselves. For in that he
appears amazed, he implies both their former wickedness to be great, and their conversion
marvellous and beyond expectation. Thus, “what hath come to pass,” saith he, “that being
children of those men, and brought up so badly, they have repented? Whence hath come
so great a change? Who hath softened down the harshness of their spirit? Who corrected
that which was incurable?”</p>
<p>And see how straightway from the beginning he alarmed them, by laying first, for a
foundation, his words concerning hell. For he spake not of the usual topics: “Who hath
warned you to flee from wars, from the inroads of the barbarians, from captivities, from
famines, from pestilences?” but concerning another sort of punishment, never before made
manifest to them, he was striking the first preparatory note, saying thus, “Who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?”</p>
<p>And full well did he likewise call them, “generation of vipers.” For that animal too is
said to destroy the mother that is in travail with her, and eating through her belly, thus to
<note type="footnote">463 Is. i. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">464 Amos ix. 7.</note>

<pb n="131"/>
come forth unto light; which kind of thing these men also did being “murderers of fathers,
and murderers of mothers,”465and destroying their instructors with their own hands.</p>
<p>3. However, he stops not at the rebuke, but introduces advice also. For, “Bring forth,”
says he, “fruits meet for repentance.”466</p>
<p>For to flee from wickedness is not enough, but you must show forth also great virtue.
For let me not have that contradictory yet ordinary467case, that468refraining yourselves for
a little while, ye return unto the same wickedness. For we are not come for the same objects
as the prophets before. Nay, the things that are now are changed, and are more exalted,
forasmuch as the Judge henceforth is coming, His very self, the very Lord of the kingdom,
leading unto greater self-restraint, calling us to heaven, and drawing us upward to those
abodes. For this cause do I unfold the doctrine also touching hell, because both the good
things and the painful are for ever. Do not therefore abide as ye are, neither bring forward
the accustomed pleas, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the noble race of your ancestors.”</p>
<p>And these things he said, not as forbidding them to say that they were sprung from
those holy men, but as forbidding them to put confidence in this, while they were neglecting
the virtue of the soul; at once bringing forward publicly what was in their minds, and foretelling
things to come. Because after this they are found to say, “We have Abraham to our
father, and were never in bondage to any man.”469 Since then it was this, which most of all
lifted them up with pride and ruined them, he first puts it down.</p>
<p>And see how with his honor paid to the patriarch he combines his correction touching
these things. Namely, having said, “Think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,” he
said not, “for the patriarch shall not be able to profit you anything,” but somehow in a more
gentle and acceptable manner he intimated the self-same thing, by saying,</p>
<p>“For God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.”470</p>
<p>Now some say, that concerning the Gentiles he saith these things, calling them stones,
metaphorically; but I say, that the expression hath also another meaning. But of what kind
is this? Think not, saith he, that if you should perish, you would make the patriarch childless.
This is not, this is not so. For with God it is possible, both out of stones to give him men,
and to bring them to that relationship; since at the beginning also it was so done. For it was
like the birth of men out of stones, when a child came forth from that hardened womb.</p>

<p>This accordingly the prophet also was intimating, when he said, “Look unto the hard
rock, whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit, whence ye are digged: look unto Abraham
your father, and unto Sarah that bare you.”471 Now of this prophecy, you see, he reminds
them, showing that if at the beginning he made him a father, as marvellously as if he had
made him so out of stones, it was possible for this now also to come to pass. And see how
he both alarms them, and cuts them off: in that he said not, “He had already raised up,” lest
they should despair of themselves, but that He “is able to raise up:” and he said not, “He is
able out of stones to make men,” but what was a much greater thing, “kinsmen and children
of Abraham.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how for the time he drew them off from their vain imagination about things
of the body, and from their refuge in their forefathers; in order that they might rest the hope
of their salvation in their own repentance and continence? Seest thou how by casting out
their carnal relationship, he is bringing in that which is of faith?</p>
<p>4. Mark then how by what follows also he increases their alarm, and adds intensity to
their agonizing fear.</p>
<p>For having said that “God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham,”
he added, “And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees,”472by all means making
his speech alarming. For as he from his way of life had much freedom of speech, so they
needed his severe rebuke, having been left barren473now for a long time. For “why do I say”
(such are his words) “that ye are on the point of falling away from your relationship to the
patriarch and of seeing others, even those that are of stones, brought in to your pre-eminence?
Nay, not to this point only will your penalty reach, but your punishment will proceed further.
“For now,” saith he, “the axe is laid unto the root of the trees.” There is nothing more terrible
than this turn of his discourse. For it is no longer “a flying sickle,”474nor “the taking down
of a hedge,” nor “the treading under foot of the vineyard;”475but an axe exceeding sharp,
and what is worse, it is even at the doors. For inasmuch as they continually disbelieved the
prophets, and used to say, “Where is the day of the Lord:”476and “let the counsel of the
Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it,”477by reason that it was many years before
what they said came to pass; to lead them off from this encouragement also, he sets the terrors
close to them. And this he declared by saying “now,” and by his putting it to “the root.” “For
<note type="footnote">471 Is. li. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="133"/>
the space between is nothing now,” saith he, “but it is laid to the very root.” And he said
not, “to the branches,” nor “to the fruits,” but “to the root.” Signifying, that if they were
negligent, they would have incurable horrors to endure, and not have so much as a hope of
remedy. It being no servant who is now come, as those before Him were, but the very Lord
of all, bringing on them His fierce and most effectual vengeance.</p>
<p>Yet, although he hath terrified them again, he suffers them not to fall into despair; but
as before he said not “He hath raised up,” but “He is able to raise up children to Abraham”
(at once both alarming and comforting them); even so here also he did not say that “it hath
touched the root,” but “it is laid to the root, and is now hard by it, and shows signs of no
delay.” However, even though He hath brought it so near, He makes its cutting depend
upon you. For if ye change and become better men, this axe will depart without doing anything;
but if ye continue in the same ways, He will tear up the tree by the roots. And therefore,
observe, it is neither removed from the root, nor applied as it is doth it cut at all: the one,
that ye may not grow supine, the other to let you know that it is possible even in a short
time to be changed and saved. Wherefore he doth also from all topics heighten their fear,
thoroughly awakening and pressing them on to repentance. Thus first their falling away
from their forefathers; next, others being introduced instead; lastly, those terrors being at
their doors, the certainty of suffering incurable evils (both which he declared by the root
and the axe), was sufficient to rouse thoroughly those even that were very supine, and to
make them full of anxiety. I may add, that Paul too was setting forth the same, when he said,
“A short word478will the Lord make upon the whole world.”479</p>
<p>But be not afraid; or rather, be afraid, but despair not. For thou hast yet a hope of change;
the sentence is not quite absolute,480neither did the axe come to cut (else what hindered it
from cutting, close as it was to the root?); but on purpose by this fear to make thee a better
man, and to prepare thee to bring forth fruit. For this cause he added, “Therefore every tree,
which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.”481 Now by the
word “every,” he rejects again the privilege which they had from their noble descent; “Why,
if thou be Abraham’s own descendant,” saith he, “if thou have thousands of patriarchs to
enumerate, thou wilt but undergo a double punishment, abiding unfruitful.”</p>
<p>By these words he alarmed even publicans, the soldiers’ mind was startled by him, not
casting them into despair, yet ridding them of all security. For along with the terror, there
is also much encouragement in what he saith; since by the expression, “which bringeth not
forth good fruit,” he signified that what bears fruit is delivered from all vengeance.</p>
<note type="footnote">478 λγον.</note>

<note type="footnote">480 ατοτελς, self-executed.</note>

<pb n="134"/>
<p>5. “And how,” saith one, “shall we be able to bring forth fruit, when the edge is being
applied, and the time so strait, and the appointed season cut short.” “Thou wilt be able,”
saith he, “for this fruit is not of the same kind as that of common trees, waiting a long time,
and in bondage to the necessities482of seasons, and requiring much other management; but
it is enough to be willing, and the tree at once hath put forth its fruit. For not the nature of
the root only, but also the skill of the husbandman contributes the most to that kind of fruitbearing.”</p>
<p>For (let me add) on account of this,—lest they should say, “Thou art alarming and
pressing, and constraining us, applying an axe, and threatening us with being cut down, yet
requiring produce in time of punishment,”—he hath added, to signify the ease of bearing
that fruit, “I indeed baptize you with water, but He that cometh after me is mightier than I,
the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Holy
Ghost and with fire:”483implying hereby that consideration484only is needed and faith, not
labors and toils; and as it is easy to be baptized, so is it easy to be converted, and to become
better men. So having stirred their mind by the fear of God’s judgment, and the expectation
of His punishment, and by the mention of the axe, and by the loss of their ancestors, and
by the bringing in of those other children, and by the double vengeance of cutting off and
burning, and having by all means softened their hardness, and brought them to desire deliv-
erance from so great evils; then he brings in what he hath to say touching Christ; and not
simply, but with a declaration of His great superiority. Then in setting forth the difference
between himself and Him, lest he should seem to say this out of favor, he establishes the
fact by comparison of the gifts bestowed by each of them. For he did not at once say, “I am
not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe;” but when he had first set forth the little value
of his own baptism, and had shown that it hath nothing more than to lead them to repentance
(for he did not say with water of remission, but of repentance), he sets forth Christ’s also,
which is full of the unspeakable gift. Thus he seems to say, “Lest, on being told that He
cometh after me, thou shouldest despise Him as having come later; learn thou the virtue485of
His gift, and thou wilt clearly know that I uttered nothing worthy nor great, when I said, “I
am not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe.” So too when thou art told, “He is mightier
than I,” do not think I said this in the way of making a comparison. For I am not worthy
to be ranked so much as among His servants, no, not even the lowest of His servants, nor
to receive the least honored portion of His ministry.” Therefore He did not merely say, “His
<note type="footnote">482 ἀναγκα.</note>

<pb n="135"/>
shoes,” but not even “the latchet,” which kind of office was counted the last of all. Then to
hinder thy attributing what he had said to humility, he adds also the proof from the facts:
“For He shall baptize you,” saith he, “with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”</p>
<p>6. Seest thou how great is the wisdom of the Baptist? how, when He Himself is preaching,
He saith everything to alarm, and fill them with anxiety; but when He is sending men to
Him, whatever was mild and apt to recover them: not bringing forward the axe, nor the tree
that is cut down and burnt, and cast into the fire, nor the wrath to come, but remission of
sins, and removing of punishment, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,
and adoption, and brotherhood, and a partaking of the inheritance, and an abundant supply
of the Holy Ghost. For all these things he obscurely denoted, when he said, “He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost;” at once, by the very figure of speech, declaring the abundance of
the grace (for he said not, “He will give you the Holy Ghost,” but “He will baptize you with
the Holy Ghost”); and by the specification of fire on the other hand indicating the vehement
and uncontrollable quality of His grace.</p>
<p>Imagine only what sort of men it was meet for the hearers to become, when they considered
that they were at once to be like the prophets, and like those great ones. For it was
on this account, you see, that he made mention at all of fire; that he might lead them to reflect
on the memory of those men. Because, of all the visions that appeared unto them, I had almost
said, the more part appeared in fire; thus God discoursed with Moses in the bush, thus with
all the people in the mount Sinai, thus with Ezekiel on the cherubim.486</p>
<p>And mark again how he rouses the hearer, by putting that first which was to take place
after all. For the Lamb was to be slain, and sin to be blotted out, and the enmity to be destroyed,
and the burial to take place, and the resurrection, and then the Spirit to come. But
none of these things doth he mention as yet, but that first which was last, and for the sake
of which all the former were done, and which was fittest to proclaim His dignity; so that
when the hearer should be told that he was to receive so great a Spirit he might search with
himself, how and in what manner this shall be, while sin so prevails; that finding him full
of thought and prepared for that lesson, he might thereupon introduce what he had to say
touching the Passion, no man being any more offended, under the expectation of such a
gift.</p>
<p>Wherefore he again cried out, saying, “Behold the Lamb of God, which beareth the sin
of the world.”487 He did not say, “which remitteth,” but, that which implies a more guardian
care, “which heareth it.” For it is not all one, simply to remit, and to take it upon Himself.488
For the one was to be done without peril, the other with death.</p>
<note type="footnote">486 Ezek. i. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">487 John i. 29; Engl. Vers. in marg. [So R.V. marg. The Greek phrase is ὁ αρων, “he that taketh up.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">488 [ατν ναλαβεν is the better supported reading, but various conjectural emendations occur. “Himself to
assume it,” is the most literal rendering.—R.]</note>

<pb n="136"/>
<p>And again, he said, “He is Son of God.”489 But not even this declared His rank openly
to the hearers (for they did not so much as know yet how to conceive of Him as a true Son):
but by so great a gift of the Spirit that also was established. Therefore the Father also in
sending John gave him, as you know, this as a first token of the dignity of Him that was
come, saying, “Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining, the same
is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”490 Wherefore himself too saith, “I saw and
bare record that this is the Son of God;” as though the one were to all time the clear evidence
of the other.</p>
<p>7. Then, as having uttered the gentler part of his message, and soothed and relaxed the
hearer, he again binds him up, that he may not become remiss. For such was the nature of
the Jewish nation; by all encouraging things they were easily puffed up, and corrupted.
Wherefore he again adduces his terrors, saying, “Whose fan is in His hand.”491</p>
<p>Thus, as before he had spoken of the punishment, so here he points out the Judge likewise,
and introduces the eternal vengeance. For “He will burn the chaff,” saith he, “with
unquenchable fire.” Thou seest that He is Lord of all things, and that He is Himself the
Husbandman; albeit in another place He calls His Father the same. For “My Father,” saith
He, “is the Husbandman.”492 Thus, inasmuch as He had spoken of an axe, lest thou
shouldest suppose that the thing needed labor, and the separation was hard to make; by
another comparison he suggests the easiness of it, implying that all the world is His; since
He could not punish those who were not His own. For the present, it is true, all are mingled
together (for though the wheat appears gleaming through, yet it lies with the chaff, as on a
threshing floor, not as in a garner), but then, great will be the separation.</p>
<p>Where now are they by whom hell-fire493is disbelieved? Since surely here are two points
laid down, one, that He will baptize with the Holy Ghost, the other, that He will burn up
the disobedient. If then that is credible, so is this too, assuredly. Yea, this is why the two
predictions are put by him in immediate connection, that by that which hath taken place
already, he might accredit the other, as yet unaccomplished. For Christ too Himself in many
places doth so, often of the same things, and often of opposites, setting down two prophecies;
the one of which He performs here, the other He promises in the future; that such as are
too contentious may, from the one which has already come to pass, believe the other also,
which is not yet accomplished. For instance, to them that strip themselves of all that they

have for His sake494 He promised to give an hundred fold in the present world, and life
eternal in that which is to come; by the things already given making the future also credible.
Which, as we see, John likewise hath done in this place; laying down two things, that He
shall both baptize with the Holy Ghost, and burn up with unquenchable fire. Now then, if
He had not baptized with the Spirit the apostles, and all every day who are willing, thou
mightest have doubts concerning those other things too; but if that which seems to be
greater and more difficult, and which transcends all reason, hath been done, and is done
every day; how deniest thou that to be true, which is easy, and comes to pass according to
reason? Thus having said, “He shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire,” and having
thence promised great blessings; lest thou, released wholly from the former things, grow
supine, he hath added the fan, and the judgment thereby declared. Thus, “think not at all,”
saith he, “that your baptism suffices, if ye become ordinary persons495hereafter:” for we
need both virtue, and plenty of that known self-restraint.496 Therefore as by the axe he urges
them unto grace, and unto the font, so after grace he terrifies them by the fan, and the unquenchable
fire. And of the one sort, those yet unbaptized, he makes no distinction, but
saith in general, “Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,”497punishing
all the unbelievers. Whereas after baptism He works out a kind of division, because many
of them that believed would exhibit a life unworthy of their faith.</p>
<p>Let no man then become chaff, let no one be tossed to and fro, nor lie exposed to wicked
desires, blown about by them easily every way. For if thou continue wheat, though temptation
be brought on thee, thou wilt suffer nothing dreadful; nay, for in the threshing floor, the
wheels of the car, that are like saws,498do not cut in pieces the wheat; but if thou fall away
into the weakness of chaff, thou wilt both here suffer incurable ills, being smitten of all men,
and there thou wilt undergo the eternal punishment. For all such persons both before that
furnace become food for the irrational passions here, as chaff is for the brute animal: and
there again they are material and food for the flame.</p>
<p>Now to have said directly that He will judge men’s doings, would not so effectually
procure acceptance for His doctrine: but to blend with it the parable, and so establish it all,
was apter to persuade the hearer, and attract him by a more ample encouragement.

Wherefore also Christ Himself499for the most part so discourses with them; threshing floor,
and harvest, and vineyard, and wine-press, and field, and net, and fishing, and all things
familiar, and among which they were busied He makes ingredients in His discourses. This
kind of thing then the Baptist likewise did here, and offered an exceeding great demonstration
of his words, the giving of the Spirit. For “He who hath so great power, as both to forgive
sins, and to give the Spirit, much more will these things also be within His power:” so he
speaks.</p>
<p>Seest thou how now in due order the mystery500came to be laid as a foundation, before
the resurrection and judgment?501</p>
<p>“And wherefore,” it may be said, “did he not mention the signs and wonders which
were straightway to be done by Him?” Because this was greater than all, and for its sake all
those were done. Thus, in his mention of the chief thing, he comprehended all; death dissolved,
sins abolished, the curse blotted out, those long wars done away; our entrance into
paradise,502our ascent into heaven, our citizenship with the angels, our partaking of the
good things to come: for in truth this is the earnest of them all. So that in mentioning this,
he hath mentioned also the resurrection of our bodies, and the manifestation of His miracles
here, and our partaking of His kingdom, and the good things, which “eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man.”503 For all these things He bestowed
on us by that gift. It was therefore superfluous to speak of the signs that were immediately
to ensue, and which sight can judge of; but those were meet to be discoursed on,
whereof they doubted; as for instance, that He is the Son of God; that He exceeds John
beyond comparison; that He “beareth504the sin of the world;” that He will require an account
of all that we do; that our interests are not limited to the present, but elsewhere every one
will undergo the due penalty. For these things were not as yet proveable by sight.</p>
<p>8. Therefore, knowing these things, let us use great diligence, while we are in the
threshing floor; for it is possible while we are here, to change even out of chaff into wheat,
even as on the other hand many from wheat have become chaff. Let us not then be supine,
nor be carried about with every wind; neither let us separate ourselves from our brethren,
though they seem to be small and mean; forasmuch as the wheat also compared with the

chaff is less in measure, but better in nature. Look not therefore to the forms of outward
pomp, for they are prepared for the fire, but to this godly humility, so firm and indissoluble,
and which cannot be cut, neither is burnt by the fire. It being for their sake that He bears
long with the very chaff, that by their intercourse with them they may become better.
Therefore judgment is not yet, that we may be all crowned together, that from wickedness
many may be converted unto virtue.</p>
<p>Let us tremble then at hearing this parable. For indeed that fire is unquenchable. “And
how,” it may be said, “is it unquenchable?” Seest thou not this sun ever burning, and never
quenched? didst thou not behold the bush burning, and not consumed? If then thou also
desirest to escape the flame, lay up alms beforehand, and so thou wilt not even taste of that
fire. For if, while here, thou wilt believe what is told thee, thou shalt not so much as see this
furnace, after thy departure into that region; but if thou disbelieve it now, thou shalt know
it there full well by experience, when no sort of escape is possible. Since in truth no entreaty
shall avert the punishment from them who have not shown forth an upright life. For believing
surely is not enough, since even the devils tremble at God, but for all that they will be punished.</p>
<p>9. Wherefore our care of our conduct hath need to be great. Why, this is the very reason
of our continually assembling you here; not simply that ye should enter in, but that ye should
also reap some fruit from your continuance here. But if ye come indeed constantly, but go
away again reaping no fruit from thence, ye will have no advantage from your entering in
and attendance in this place.</p>
<p>For if we, when sending children to teachers, should we see them reaping no benefit
thereby, begin to be severe in blaming the teachers, and remove them often to others; what
excuse shall we have for not bestowing upon virtue even so much diligence as upon these
earthly things, but forever bringing our tablets home empty? And yet our teachers here are
more in number and greater. For no less than prophets and apostles and patriarchs, and all
righteous men, are by us set over you as teachers in every Church. And not even so is there
any profit, but if you have joined in chanting two or three Psalms, and making the accustomed
prayers at random and anyhow, are so dismissed, ye think this enough for your salvation.
Have ye not heard the prophet, saying (or rather God by the prophet), “This people honoreth
me with their lips, but their heart is far from me?”505</p>
<p>Therefore, lest this be our case too, wipe thou out the letters, or rather the impressions,
which the devil hath engraven in thy soul; and bring me a heart set free from worldly tumults,
that without fear I may write on it what I will. Since now at least there is nothing else to
discern, except his letters;—rapines, covetings, envy, jealousy. Wherefore of course, when
I receive your tablets, I am not able so much as to read them. For I find not the letters, which
<note type="footnote">505 Is. xxix. 13; comp. Mark vii. 6.</note>

<pb n="140"/>
we every Lord’s day inscribe on you, and so let you go; but others, instead of these, unintelligible
and misshapen. Then, when we have blotted them out, and have written those which
are of the Spirit, ye departing, and giving up your hearts to the works of the devil, give him
again power to substitute his own characters in you. What then will be the end of all this,
even without any words of mine, each man’s own conscience knoweth. For I indeed will
not cease to do my part, and to write in you the right letters. But if ye mar our diligence, for
our part our reward is unaltered, but your danger is not small.</p>
<p>Now, though I would fain say nothing to disgust you, yet I beseech again and entreat
you,506imitate at least the little children’s diligence in these matters. For so they first learn
the form of the letters, after that they practise themselves in distinguishing them put out of
shape, and then at last in their reading they proceed orderly by means of them. Just so let
us also do; let us divide virtue, and learn first not to swear, nor to forswear ourselves, nor
to speak evil; then proceeding to another row,507not to envy, not to lust, not to be gluttonous,
not to be drunken, not fierce, not slothful, so that from these we may pass on again to the
things of the Spirit, and practise continence, and neglect of the belly, temperance, righteousness,
to be above glory, and gentle and contrite in mind; and let us join these one with another,
and write them upon our soul.</p>
<p>10. And all these let us practise at home, with our own friends, with our wife, with our
children. And, for the present, let us begin with the things that come first, and are easier; as
for instance, with not swearing; and let us practise this one letter continually at home. For,
in truth, there are many at home to hinder this our practice; sometimes a man’s servant
provoking him, sometimes his wife annoying and angering him, sometimes an indocile and
disorderly child urges him on to threatening and swearing. If now at home, when thus
continually galled, thou shouldest attain not to be tempted into swearing, thou wilt in the
market-place also have power with ease to abide unconquered.</p>
<p>Yea, and in like sort, thou wilt attain to keep thyself from insulting any, by not insulting
thy wife, nor thy servants, nor any one else among those in thy house. For a man’s wife too
not seldom, praising this or that person, or bemoaning herself, stirs him up to speak evil of
that other. But do not thou let thyself be constrained to speak evil of him that is praised, but
bear it all nobly. And if thou shouldest perceive thy servants praising other masters, be not
perturbed, but stand nobly. Let thy home be a sort of lists, a place of exercise for virtue, that
having trained thyself well there, thou mayest with entire skill encounter all abroad.</p>
<p>Do this with respect to vainglory also. For if thou train thyself not to be vainglorious in
company of thy wife and thy servants, thou wilt not ever afterwards be easily caught by this

passion with regard to any one else. For though this malady be in every case grievous and
tyrannical, yet is it so especially when a woman is present. If we therefore in that instance
put down its power, we shall easily master it in the other cases also.</p>
<p>And with respect to the other passions too, let us do this self-same thing, exercising
ourselves against them at home, and anointing ourselves every day.</p>
<p>And that our exercise may be easier, let us further enact a penalty for ourselves, upon
our transgressing any of our purposes. And let the very penalty again be such as brings with
it not loss, but reward,—such as procures some very great gain. And this is so, if we sentence
ourselves to intenser fastings, and to sleeping often on the bare ground, and to other like
austerity. For in this way will much profit come unto us from every quarter; we shall both
live the sweet life of virtue here, and we shall attain unto the good things to come and be
perpetually friends of God.</p>
<p>But in order that the same may not happen again,—that ye may not, having here admired
what is said, go your way, and cast aside at random, wherever it may chance, the tablet of
your mind, and so allow the devil to blot out these things;—let each one, on returning home,
call his own wife, and tell her these things, and take her to help him; and from this day let
him enter into that noble school of exercise, using for oil the supply of the Spirit. And
though thou fall once, twice, many times in thy training, despair not, but stand again, and
wrestle; and do not give up until thou hast bound on thee the glorious crown of triumph
over the devil, and hast for the time to come stored up the riches of virtue in an inviolable
treasure-house.</p>
<p>For if thou shouldest establish thyself in the habits of this noble self-restraint, then, not
even when remiss, wilt thou be able to transgress any of the commandments, habit imitating
the solidity of nature. Yea, as to sleep is easy, and to eat, and to drink, and to breathe, so
also will the deeds of virtue be easy to us, and we shall reap to ourselves that pure pleasure,
resting in a harbor without a wave, and enjoying continual calm, and with a great freight
bringing our vessel into haven, in that City, on that day; and we shall attain unto the undecaying
crowns, unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory and might, now and always, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XII.</head>
<p>Matt. III. 13.</p>
<p>“Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan,” etc.</p>
<p>With the servants the Lord, with the criminals the Judge, cometh to be baptized. But be
not thou troubled; for in these humiliations His exaltation doth most shine forth. For He
who vouchsafed to be borne so long in a Virgin’s womb, and to come forth thence with our
nature, and to be smitten with rods, and crucified, and to suffer all the rest which He
suffered;—why marvellest thou if He vouchsafed also to be baptized, and to come with the
rest to His servant. For the amazement lay in that one thing, that being God, He would be
made Man; but the rest after this all follows in course of reason.</p>
<p>For this cause, let me add, John also by way of anticipation said all that he had said before,
that he “was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe;” and all the rest, as for instance,
that He is Judge, and rewards every man according to his desert, and that He will bestow
His Spirit abundantly on all; in order that when thou shouldest see Him coming to the
baptism, thou mightest not suspect anything mean. Therefore he forbids Him, even when
He was come, saying,</p>
<p>“I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me.”508 For, because the baptism
was “of repentance,” and led men to accuse themselves for their offenses, lest any one should
suppose that He too “cometh to Jordan” in this sort of mind, John sets it right beforehand,
by calling Him both Lamb, and Redeemer from all the sin that is in the world. Since He that
was able to take away the sins of the whole race of men, much more was He Himself without
sin. For this cause then he said not, “Behold, He that is without sin,” but what was much
more, He “that beareth the sin of the world,” in order that together with this truth thou
mightest receive that other with all assurance, and having received it mightest perceive, that
in the conduct of some further economy He cometh to the baptism. Wherefore also he said
to Him when He came, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”</p>
<p>And he said not, “And art Thou baptized of me?” nay, for this he feared to say: but what?
“And comest Thou to me?” What then doth Christ? What He did afterwards with respect
to Peter, this did He then also. For so he too would have forbidden Him to wash his feet,
but when he had heard, “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter,”
and “thou hast no part with me,”509he speedily withdrew from his determination, and went
over to the contrary. And this man again in like manner, when he had heard, “Suffer it to
be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness,”510straightway obeyed. For
<note type="footnote">508 Matt. iii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">509 John xiii. 7, 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">510 Matt. iii. 15. [R.V., “Suffer it (or me) now, for thus it becometh,” etc.—R.]</note>

<pb n="143"/>
they were not unduly contentious, but they manifested both love and obedience, and made
it their study to be ruled by their Lord in all things.</p>
<p>And mark how He urges him on that very ground which chiefly caused him to look
doubtfully on what was taking place; in that He did not say, “thus it is just,” but “thus it becometh.”
For, inasmuch as the point unworthy of Him was in his mind chiefly this, His being
baptized by His servant, He stated this rather than anything else, which is directly opposed
to that impression: as though He had said, “Is it not as unbecoming that thou avoidest and
forbiddest this? nay, for this self-same cause I bid thee suffer it, that it is becoming, and that
in the highest degree.”</p>
<p>And He did not merely say, “suffer,” but He added, “now.” “For it will not be so forever,”
saith He, “but thou shalt see me such as thou desirest; for the present, however, endure this.”
Next He shows also how this “becometh” Him. How then doth it so? “In that we fulfill the
whole law;” and to express this He said, “all righteousness.” For righteousness is the fulfilling
of the commandments. “Since then we have performed all the rest of the commandments,”
saith He, “and this alone remains, it also must be added: because I am come to do away the
curse that is appointed for the transgression of the law. I must therefore first fulfill it all,
and having delivered you from its condemnation, in this way bring it to an end. It becometh
me therefore to fulfill the whole law, by the same rule that it becometh me to do away the
curse that is written against you in the law: this being the very purpose of my assuming flesh,
and coming hither.”</p>
<p>2. “Then he suffereth Him. And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water; and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
like a dove, and lighting upon Him.”511</p>
<p>For inasmuch as many supposed that John was greater than He, because John had been
brought up all his time in the wilderness, and was son of a chief priest, and was clothed with
such raiment, and was calling all men unto his baptism, and had been born of a barren
mother; while Jesus, first of all, was of a damsel of ordinary rank (for the virgin birth was
not yet manifest to all); and besides, He had been brought up in an house, and held converse
with all men, and wore this common raiment; they suspected Him to be less than John,
knowing as yet nothing of those secret things;—and it fell out moreover that He was baptized
of John, which thing added support to this surmise, even if none of those mentioned before
had existed; for it would come into their mind that this man was one of the many (for were
He not one of the many, He would not have come with the many to the baptism), but that
John was greater than He and far more admirable:—in order therefore that this opinion
might not prevail with the multitude, the very heavens are opened, when He is baptized,
and the Spirit comes down, and a voice with the Spirit, proclaiming the dignity of the Only
<note type="footnote">511 Matt. iii. 15, 16. [R.V., “from the water,” and “coming” for “lighting.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="144"/>
Begotten. For since the voice that said, “This is my beloved Son,” would seem to the multitude
rather to belong to John, for It added not, “This that is baptized,” but simply This, and every
hearer would conceive it to be said concerning the baptizer, rather than the baptized, partly
on account of the Baptist’s own dignity, partly for all that hath been mentioned; the Spirit
came in form of a dove, drawing the voice towards Jesus, and making it evident to all, that
This was not spoken of John that baptized, but of Jesus who was baptized.</p>
<p>And how was it, one may say, that they did not believe, when these things came to pass?
Because in the days of Moses also many wonderful works were done, albeit not such as these;
and after all those, the voices, and the trumpets, and the lightnings, they both forged a calf,
and “were joined unto Baal-peor.” And those very persons too, who were present at the
time, and saw Lazarus arise, so far from believing in Him, who had wrought these things,
repeatedly attempted even to slay Him. Now if seeing before their eyes one rise from the
dead, they were so wicked, why marvel at their not receiving a voice wafted from above?
Since when a soul is uncandid and perverse, and possessed by the disease of envy, it yields
to none of these things; even as when it is candid it receives all with faith, and hath no great
need of these.</p>
<p>Speak not therefore thus, “They believed not,” but rather inquire, “Did not all things
take place which ought to have made them believe?” For by the prophet also God frames
this kind of defense of His own ways in general. That is, the Jews being on the point of ruin,
and of being given over to extreme punishment; lest any from their wickedness should calumniate
His providence, He saith, “What ought I to have done to this vineyard, that I have
not done?”512 Just so here likewise do thou reflect; “what ought to have been done, and was
not done?” And indeed whensoever arguments arise on God’s Providence, do thou make
use of this kind of defense, against those who from the wickedness of the many try to raise
a prejudice against it. See, for instance, what astonishing things are done, preludes of those
which were to come; for it is no more paradise, but Heaven that is opened.</p>
<p>But let our argument with the Jews stand over unto some other time; for the present,
God working with us, we would direct our discourse to what is immediately before us.</p>
<p>3. “And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and lo! the
heavens were opened unto Him.”513</p>
<p>Wherefore were the heavens opened? To inform thee that at thy baptism also this is
done, God calling thee to thy country on high, and persuading thee to have nothing to do
with earth. And if thou see not, yet never doubt it. For so evermore at the beginnings of all
wonderful and spiritual transactions, sensible visions appear, and such-like signs, for the
sake of them that are somewhat dull in disposition, and who have need of outward sight,
<note type="footnote">512 Is. v. 4. [Chrysostom varies from the LXX., introducing με δει, to strengthen his argument.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">513 Matt. iii. 16.</note>

<pb n="145"/>
and who cannot at all conceive an incorporeal nature, but are excited only by the things that
are seen: that so, though afterward no such thing occur, what hath been declared by them
once for all at the first may be received by thy faith.</p>
<p>For in the case of the apostles too, there was a “sound of a mighty wind,”514and visions
of fiery tongues appeared, but not for the apostles’ sake, but because of the Jews who were
then present. Nevertheless, even though no sensible signs take place, we receive the things
that have been once manifested by them. Since the dove itself at that time therefore appeared,
that as in place of a finger (so to say) it might point out to them that were present, and to
John, the Son of God. Not however merely on this account, but to teach thee also, that upon
thee no less at thy baptism the Spirit comes. But since then we have no need of sensible
vision, faith sufficing instead of all. For signs are “not for them that believe, but for them
that believe not.”515</p>
<p>But why in the fashion of a dove? Gentle is that creature, and pure. Forasmuch then as
the Spirit too is “a Spirit of meekness,”516 He therefore appears in this sort. And besides,
He is reminding us of an ancient history. For so, when once a common shipwreck had
overtaken the whole world, and our race was in danger of perishing, this creature appeared,
and indicated the deliverance from the tempest, and bearing an olive branch,517published
the good tidings of the common calm of the whole world; all which was a type of the things
to come. For in fact the condition of men was then much worse, and they deserved a much
sorer punishment. To prevent thy despairing, therefore, He reminds thee of that history.
Because then also, when things were desperate, there was a sort of deliverance and reformation;
but then by punishment, now, on the contrary, by grace and an unspeakable gift.518
Therefore the dove also appears, not bearing an olive branch, but pointing out to us our
Deliverer from all evils, and suggesting the gracious hopes. For not from out of an ark doth
she lead one man only, but the whole world she leads up into heaven at her appearing, and
instead of a branch of peace from an olive, she conveys the adoption to all the world’s offspring
in common.</p>
<p>Reflect now on the greatness of the gift, and do not account His dignity the less for His
appearing in such a likeness. For I actually hear some saying,519that “such as is the difference
between a man and a dove, so great is that between Christ and the Spirit: since the one ap-

peared in our nature, the other in the likeness of a dove.” What must we say then to these
things? That the Son of God did indeed take upon Him the nature of man, but the Spirit
took not on Him the nature of a dove. Therefore the evangelist also said not, “in the nature
of a dove,” but “in the form of a dove.” Accordingly, never after did He so much as appear
in this fashion, but at that moment only. And if on this account thou affirmest His dignity
to be less, the cherubim too will be made out by this reasoning much His superior, even as
much so as an eagle is to a dove: because they too were figured into that visible shape. And
the angels too superior again, for they no less have many times appeared in the fashion of
men. But these things are not so, indeed they are not. For the truth of an economy is one
thing, and the condescension of a temporary vision another.</p>
<p>Do not now, I pray thee, become unthankful towards thy Benefactor nor with the very
contraries520requite Him that hath bestowed on thee the fountain of blessedness. For where
adoption is vouchsafed, there is also the removing of evils, and the giving of all good things.</p>
<p>4. On this very account the Jewish baptism ceases, and ours takes its beginning. And
what was done with regard to the Passover, the same ensues in the baptism also. For as in
that case too, He acting with a view to both, brought the one to an end, but to the other He
gave a beginning: so here, having fulfilled the Jewish baptism, He at the same time opens
also the doors of that of the Church; as on one table then, so in one river now, He had both
sketched out the shadow, and now adds the truth. For this baptism alone hath the grace of
the Spirit, but that of John was destitute of this gift. For this very cause in the case of the
others that were baptized no such thing came to pass, but only in the instance of Him who
was to hand on521this; in order that, besides what we have said, thou mightest learn this
also, that not the purity of the baptizer, but the power of the baptized, had this effect. Not
until then, assuredly, were either the heavens opened, nor did the Spirit make His approach.
522 Because henceforth He leads us away from the old to the new polity, both
opening to us the gates on high, and sending down His Spirit from thence to call us to our
country there; and not merely to call us, but also with the greatest mark of dignity. For He
hath not made us angels and archangels, but He hath caused us to become “sons of God,”
and “beloved,” and so He draws us on towards that portion of ours.</p>
<p>Having then all this in thy mind, do thou show forth a life worthy of the love of Him
who calls thee, and of thy citizenship in that world, and of the honor that is given thee.
Crucified as thou art to the world, and having crucified it to thyself, show thyself with all
strictness a citizen of the city of the heavens. And do not, because thy body is not translated

unto heaven, suppose that thou hast anything to do with the earth; for thou hast thy Head
abiding above. Yea with this very purpose the Lord, having first come here and having
brought His angels, did then, taking thee with Him, depart thither; that even before thy
going up to that place, thou mightest understand that it is possible for thee to inhabit earth
as it were heaven.</p>
<p>Let us then keep watch over that noble birth, which we received from the beginning;
and let us every day seek more and more the palaces there, and account all that is here to
be a shadow and a dream. For so, had any king among those on earth, finding thee poor
and a beggar, made thee suddenly his son, never wouldest thou have thought upon thy
cottage, and thy cottage’s mean appointments. Yet surely in that case the difference is not
much. Do not then either in this case take account of any of the former things, for thou art
called unto much greater. For both He who calls is the Lord of the angels, and the good
things that are given surpass all both word and thought. Since not from earth to earth doth
He remove thee, as the king doth, but from earth to heaven, and from a mortal nature to
an immortal, and to glory unspeakable, then only possible to be properly manifested, when
we shall actually enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now then, having to partake of such blessings, do I see thee minding money, and
clinging to the pomp which is here? And dost thou not esteem all that is seen to be more
vile than beggars rags? And how wilt thou appear worthy of this honor? And what excuse
wilt thou have to plead? or rather, what punishment wilt thou not have to suffer, who after
so great a gift art running to thy former vomit? For no longer art thou punished merely as
a man, but as a son of God that hath sinned; and the greatness of thy honor becomes a mean
of bringing a sorer punishment on thee. Since we too punish not equally slaves that do
wrong, and sons committing the same offense; and most of all when they have received
some great kindness from us.</p>
<p>For if he who had paradise for his portion, for one disobedience underwent such
dreadful things after his honor; we, who have received Heaven, and are become joint heirs
with the Only Begotten, what excuse shall we have, for running to the serpent after the dove?
For it will be no longer, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,”523and thou “tillest
the ground,”524and those former words, that will be said to us;525but what is far more
grievous than these, the “outer darkness,”526the bonds that may not be burst, the venomous
worm, the “gnashing of teeth;” and this with great reason. For he that is not made better

even by so great a benefit, would justly suffer the most extreme, and a yet more grievous
punishment. Elias once opened and shut Heaven, but that was to bring down rain, and restrain
it; whereas to thee the heaven is not so opened, but in order for thee to ascend thither;
and what is yet more, not to ascend only, but to lead up others also, if thou wilt; such great
confidence and power hath He bestowed on thee in all that is His.</p>
<p>5. Forasmuch then as our house is there, there let us store up all, and leave nothing here,
lest we lose it. For here, though thou put a lock on it, and doors, and bars, and set thousands
of servants to watch it; though thou get the better of all the crafty ones, though thou escape
the eyes of the envious, the worms, the wasting that comes of time; which is impossible;—
death at any rate thou wilt never escape, but wilt be deprived of all those things
in one moment of time; and not deprived of them only, but wilt have to transfer them into
the hands often of thy very enemies. Whereas if thou wouldest transfer them into that house,
thou wilt be far above all. For there is no need to apply either key, or doors, or bars; such is
the virtue527of that city, so inviolable is this place, and by nature inaccessible to corruption
and all wickedness.</p>
<p>How then is it not of the utmost folly, where destruction and waste is the lot of all that
is stored, there to heap up all, but where things abide untouched and increase, there not to
lay up even the least portion; and this, when we are to live there forever? For this cause the
very heathens528disbelieve the things that we say, since our doings, not our sayings, are the
demonstration which they are willing to receive from us; and when they see us building
ourselves fine houses, and laying out gardens and baths, and buying fields, they are not
willing to believe that we are preparing for another sort of residence away from our city.</p>
<p>“For if this were so,” say they, “they would turn to money all they have here, and lay
them up beforehand there;” and this they divine from the things that are done in this world.
For so we see those who are very rich getting themselves houses and fields and all the rest,
chiefly in those cities in which they are to stay. But we do the contrary; and with all earnest
zeal we get possession of the earth, which we are soon after to leave; giving up not money
only, but even our very blood for a few acres and tenements: while for the purchase of
Heaven we do not endure to give even what is beyond our wants, and this though we are to
purchase it at a small price, and to possess it forever, provided we had once purchased it.</p>
<p>Therefore I say we shall suffer the utmost punishment, departing thither naked and
poor; or rather it will not be for our own poverty that we shall undergo these irremediable
calamities, but also for our making others to be such as ourselves. For when heathens see

them that have partaken of so great mysteries earnest about these matters, much more will
they cling themselves to the things heaping much fire upon our head. For when we, who
ought to teach them to despise all things that appear, do ourselves most of all urge them to
the lust of these things; when shall it be possible for us to be saved, having to give account
for the perdition of others? Hearest thou not Christ say, that He left us to be for salt and for
lights in this world, in order that we may both brace up529those that are melting in luxury,
and enlighten them that are darkened by the care of wealth? When therefore we even cast
them into more thorough darkness, and make them more dissolute, what hope shall we
have of salvation? There is none at all; but wailing and gnashing our teeth, and bound hand
and foot, we shall depart into the fire of hell, after being full well worn down by the cares
of riches.</p>
<p>Considering then all these things, let us loose the bands of such deceit, that we may not
at all fall into those things which deliver us over to the unquenchable fire. For he that is a
slave to money, the chains both here and there will have him continually liable to them; but
he that is rid of this desire will attain to freedom from both. Unto which that we also may
attain, let us break in pieces the grievous yoke of avarice, and make ourselves wings toward
Heaven; by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XIII.</head>
<p>Matt. IV. 1.</p>
<p>“Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.”</p>
<p>Then. When? After the descent of the Spirit, after the voice that was borne from above,
and said, “This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” And what was marvellous,
it was of the Holy Spirit; for this, he here saith, led Him up. For since with a view to our instruction
He both did and underwent all things; He endures also to be led up thither, and
to wrestle against the devil: in order that each of those who are baptized, if after his baptism
he have to endure greater temptations may not be troubled as if the result were unexpected,
but may continue to endure all nobly, as though it were happening in the natural course of
things.</p>
<p>Yea, for therefore thou didst take up arms, not to be idle, but to fight. For this cause
neither doth God hinder the temptations as they come on, first to teach thee that thou art
become much stronger; next, that thou mayest continue modest neither be exalted even by
the greatness of thy gifts, the temptations having power to repress thee; moreover, in order
that that wicked demon, who is for a while doubtful about thy desertion of him, by the
touchstone of temptations may be well assured that thou hast utterly forsaken and fallen
from him; fourthly, that thou mayest in this way be made stronger, and better tempered
than any steel; fifthly, that thou mayest obtain a clear demonstration of the treasures entrusted
to thee.</p>
<p>For the devil would not have assailed thee, unless he had seen thee brought to greater
honor. Hence, for example, from the beginning, he attacked Adam, because he saw him in
the enjoyment of great dignity. For this reason he arrayed himself against Job, because he
saw him crowned and proclaimed by the God of all.</p>
<p>How then saith He, “Pray that ye enter not into temptation.”530 For this cause he doth
not show thee Jesus simply going up, but “led up” according to the principle of the Economy;
531signifying obscurely by this, that we ought not of ourselves to leap upon it, but
being dragged thereto, to stand manfully.</p>
<p>And see whither the Spirit led Him up, when He had taken Him; not into a city and
forum, but into a wilderness. That is, He being minded to attract the devil, gives him a
handle not only by His hunger, but also by the place. For then most especially doth the
devil assail, when he sees men left alone, and by themselves. Thus did he also set upon the
woman in the beginning, having caught her alone, and found her apart from her husband.
<note type="footnote">530 Matt. xxvi. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">531 κατ τν λγον τ οκονομα.</note>

<pb n="151"/>
Just as when he sees us with others and banded together, he is not equally confident, and
makes no attack. Wherefore we have the greatest need on this very account to be flocking
together continually, that we may not be open to the devil’s attacks.</p>
<p>2. Having then found Him in the wilderness, and in a pathless wilderness (for that the
wilderness was such, Mark hath declared, saying, that He “was with the wild beasts”532),
behold with how much craft he draws near, and wickedness; and for what sort of opportunity
he watches. For not in his fast, but in his hunger he approaches Him; to instruct thee how
great a good fasting is, and how it is a most powerful shield against the devil, and that after
the font,533men should give themselves up, not to luxury and drunkenness, and a full table,
but to fasting. For, for this cause even He fasted, not as needing it Himself, but to instruct
us. Thus, since our sins before the font534were brought in by serving the belly: much as if
any one who had made a sick man whole were to forbid his doing those things, from which
the distemper arose; so we see here likewise that He Himself after the font brought in fasting.
For indeed both Adam by the incontinence of the belly was cast out of paradise; and the
flood in Noah’s time, this produced; and this brought down the thunders on Sodom. For
although there was also a charge of whoredom, nevertheless from this grew the root of each
of those punishments; which Ezekiel also signified when he said, “But this was the iniquity
of Sodom, that she waxed wanton in pride and in fullness of bread, and in abundance of
luxury.”535 Thus the Jews also per petrated the greatest wickedness, being driven upon
transgression by their drunkenness and delicacy.536</p>
<p>On this account then even He too fasts forty days, pointing out to us the medicines of
our salvation; yet proceeds no further, lest on the other hand, through the exceeding greatness
of the miracle the truth of His Economy537should be discredited. For as it is, this cannot
be, seeing that both Moses and Elias, anticipating Him, could advance to so great a length
of time, strengthened by the power of God. And if He had proceeded farther, from this
among other things His assumption of our flesh would have seemed incredible to many.</p>
<p>Having then fasted forty days and as many nights,</p>
<p>“He was afterwards an hungered;538” affording him a point to lay hold of and approach,
that by actual conflict He might show how to prevail and be victorious. Just so do wrestlers

also: when teaching their pupils how to prevail and overcome, they voluntarily in the lists
engage with others, to afford these in the persons of their antagonists the means of seeing
and learning the mode of conquest. Which same thing then also took place. For it being His
will to draw him on so far, He both made His hunger known to him, and awaited his approach,
and as He waited for him, so He dashed him to earth, once, twice, and three times,
with such ease as became Him.</p>
<p>3. But that we may not, by hurrying over these victories, mar your profit, let us begin
from the first assault, and examine each with exact care.</p>
<p>Thus, after He was an hungered, it is said, “The tempter came, and said unto Him, If
Thou be Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.”539</p>
<p>For, because he had heard a voice borne from above, and saying, “This is My beloved
Son;” and had heard also John bearing so large witness concerning Him, and after that saw
Him an hungered; he was thenceforth in perplexity, and neither could believe that He was
a mere man, because of the things spoken concerning Him; nor on the other hand receive
it that He was Son of God, seeing Him as he did in hunger. Whence being in perplexity he
utters ambiguous sounds. And much as when coming to Adam at the beginning, he feigns
things that are not, that he may learn the things that are; even so here also, not knowing
clearly the unutterable mystery of the Economy, and who He may be that is come, he attempts
to weave other nets, whereby he thought to know that which was hidden and obscure. And
what saith he? “If Thou be Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” He said
not, because thou art an hungered, but, “if Thou be Son of God;” thinking to cheat Him
with his compliments. Wherefore also he was silent touching the hunger, that he might not
seem to be alleging it, and upbraiding Him. For not knowing the greatness of the Economy
which was going on, he supposed this to be a reproach to Him. Wherefore flattering Him
craftily, he makes mention of His dignity only.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? To put down his pride, and to signify that there was nothing
shameful in what had happened, nor unbecoming His wisdom; that which the other had
passed over in silence to flatter Him, He brings forward and sets it forth, saying, “Man shall
not live by bread alone.”540</p>
<p>So that He begins with the necessity of the belly. But mark, I pray thee, the craft of that
wicked demon, and whence he begins his wrestlings, and how he doth not forget his proper
art. For by what means he cast out also the first man, and encompassed him with thousands
of other evils, with the same means here likewise he weaves his deceit; I mean, with incontinence
of the belly. So too even now one may hear many foolish ones say their bad words
by thousands because of the belly. But Christ, to show that the virtuous man is not compelled
<note type="footnote">539 Matt. iv. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">540 Matt. iv. 4.</note>

<pb n="153"/>
even by this tyranny to do anything that is unseemly, first hungers, then submits not to what
is enjoined Him; teaching us to obey the devil in nothing. Thus, because the first man did
hereby both offend God, and transgress the law, as much and more doth He teach
thee:—though it be no transgression which he commands, not even so to obey.</p>
<p>And why say I, “transgression”? “Why, even though something expedient be suggested
by the devils,541do not thou,” saith He, “even so give heed unto them.” Thus, for instance,
He stopped the mouths of those devils542also, proclaiming Him Son of God. And Paul too
again543rebuked them, crying this self-same thing; and yet what they said was profitable;
but he more abundantly dishonoring them, and obstructing their plot against us, drove
them away even when doctrines of salvation were preached by them, closing up their mouths,
and bidding them be silent.</p>
<p>And therefore neither in this instance did He consent to what was said. But what saith
He? “Man shall not live by bread alone.” Now His meaning is like this: “God is able even by
a word to nourish the hungry man;” bringing him a testimony out of the ancient Scripture,
and teaching us, though we hunger, yea, whatever we suffer, never to fall away from our
Lord.</p>
<p>But if a man say, “still He should have displayed Himself;” I would ask him, with what
intent, and for what reason? For not at all that he might believe did the other so speak, but
that he might, as he thought, over-argue544 Him into unbelief. Since the first of mankind
were in this way beguiled and over-argued by him, not putting earnest faith in God. For the
contrary of what God had said he promised them, and puffed them up with vain hopes, and
brought them to unbelief, and so cast them out of the blessings they actually possessed. But
Christ signifies Himself not to have consented, either to him then or afterwards to the Jews
his partisans, in their demand of signs: invariably instructing us, whatever we may have
power to do, yet to do nothing vainly and at random; nor even when want urges to obey the
devil.</p>
<p>4. What then doth this accursed one? Overcome, and unable to persuade Him to do his
bidding, and that when pressed by such violent hunger, he proceeds to another thing, saying,</p>
<p>“If Thou be Son of God, cast Thyself down; for it is written, He shall give His angels
charge concerning Thee, and in their hands they shall bear Thee up.”545</p>
<p>What can the reason be, that at each temptation He adds this, “If Thou be Son of God?”
Much the same as he did in that former case, he doth also at this time. That is, as he then

slandered God, saying, “In the day ye eat, your eyes shall be opened;”546thereby intending
to signify, that they were beguiled and overreached, and had received no benefit; even so in
this case also he insinuates this same thing, saying, “in vain God hath called Thee Son, and
hath beguiled Thee by His gift; for, if this be not so, afford us some clear proof that Thou
art of that power.” Then, because Christ had reasoned with him from Scripture, he also
brings in a testimony of the prophet.</p>
<p>How then doth Christ? He is not indignant, nor provoked, but with that extreme gentleness
He reasons with him again from the Scriptures, saying, “Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God:”547teaching us that we must overcome the devil, not by miracles, but by
forbearance and long-suffering, and that we should do nothing at all for display and vainglory.</p>
<p>But mark thou his folly, even by the very testimony which he produced. For while the
testimonies cited by the Lord were both of them spoken with exceeding fitness: his, on the
other hand, were chance and random sayings, neither did he bring forward on his part that
which applied to the matter in hand. For that it is written, “He shall give His angels charge
concerning Thee,” this surely is not advice to dash and toss one’s self down headlong; and
moreover, this was not so much as spoken concerning the Lord. However, this for the time
He did not expose, although there was both insult in his manner of speech, and great inconsistency.
For of God’s Son no man requires these things: but to cast one’s self down is the
part of the devil, and of demons. Whereas God’s part is to raise up even them that are down.
And if He ought to have displayed His own power, it would not have been by casting and
tossing Himself down at random, but by saving others. But to cast ourselves down precipices,
and into pits, pertains properly to his troop. Thus, for example, the juggler among them
doth everywhere.</p>
<p>But Christ, even when these things are said, doth not yet reveal Himself, but as man for
a while discourses with him. For the sayings, “Man shall not live by bread alone;” and, “Thou
shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,” suited one not greatly revealing Himself, but representing
Himself as one of the many.</p>
<p>But marvel thou not, if he in reasoning with Christ oftentimes turn himself about. For
as pugilists, when they have received deadly blows, reel about, drenched in much blood,
and blinded; even so he too, darkened by the first and the second blow, speaks at random
what comes uppermost: and proceeds to his third assault.</p>
<p>5. “And he leadeth Him up into a high mountain, and showeth Him all the kingdoms,
and saith, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then
saith He, Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and Him only shalt thou serve.”548</p>

<p>For since he was now come to sinning against the Father, saying, that all that is the
Father’s was his, and was endeavoring to make himself out to be God, as artificer of the
universe; He then rebuked him: but not even then with vehemence, but simply, “Get thee
hence, Satan;” which itself had in it something of command rather than of rebuke. For as
soon as He had said to him, “Get thee hence,” He caused him to take to flight; since he
brought not against Him any other temptations.</p>
<p>And how saith Luke, that “he ended all temptation.”549 To me it seems that in mentioning
the chief of the temptations, he had spoken of all, as though the rest too were included
in these. For the things that form the substance of innumerable evils are these: to be a slave
to the belly, to do anything for vainglory, to be in subjection to the madness of riches. Which
accordingly that accursed one considering, set last the most powerful of all, I mean the desire
of more: and though originally, and from the beginning, he was travailing to come to this,
yet he kept it for the last, as being of more force than the rest. For in fact this is the manner
of his wrestling, to apply those things last, which seem more likely to overthrow. And this
sort of thing he did with respect to Job likewise. Wherefore in this instance too, having begun
with the motives which seem to be viler and weaker, he goes on to the more prevailing.</p>
<p>How then are we to get the better of him? In the way which Christ that taught us, by
fleeing to God for refuge; and neither to be depressed in famine, as believing in God who
is able to feed even with a word; nor amidst whatever good things we may receive to tempt
Him who gave them, but to be content with the glory which is from above, making no account
of that which is of men, and on every occasion to despise what is beyond our need. For
nothing doth so make us fall under the power of the devil, as longing for more, and loving
covetousness. And this we may see even by what is done now. For now also there are those
who say, “All these things will we give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship;” who are
indeed men by nature, but have become his instruments. Since at that time too he approached
Him, not by himself only, but also by others. Which Luke also was declaring, when he said,
that “he departed from Him for a season;”550showing that hereafter he approached Him by
his proper instruments.</p>
<p>“And, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him.”551 For when the assault was
going on, He suffered them not to appear, that He might not thereby drive away the prey;
but after He had convicted him in all points, and caused him to take to flight, then they ap-

pear: that thou also mayest learn, that after thy victories which are copied from His, angels
will receive thee also, applauding thee, and waiting as guards on thee in all things. Thus, for
example, angels take Lazarus552away with them, after the furnace of poverty and of famine
and of all distress. For as I have already said, Christ on this occasion exhibits many things,
which we ourselves are to enjoy.</p>
<p>6. Forasmuch then as all these things have been done for thee, do thou emulate and
imitate His victory. And should any one approach thee of those who are that evil spirit’s
servants, and savor the things that be of him, upbraiding thee and saying, “If thou art marvellous
and great, remove the mountain;” be not troubled, nor confounded, but answer with
meekness, and say some such thing as thou hast heard thy Lord say: “Thou shalt not tempt
the Lord thy God.”</p>
<p>Or should he, offering glory and dominion, and an endless amount of wealth, enjoin
thee to worship him, do thou stand again manfully. For neither did the devil deal so with
the common Lord of us all only, but every day also he brings these his machinations to bear
on each of His servants, not in mountains only and in wildernesses, nor by himself: but in
cities likewise, in market-places, and in courts of justice, and by means of our own kindred,
even men. What then must we do? Disbelieve him altogether, and stop our ears against him,
and hate him when he flatters, and when he proffers more, then so much the more shun
him. Because in Eve’s case also, when he was most lifting her up with hopes, then he cast
her down, and did her the greatest evils. Yea, for he is an implacable enemy, and hath taken
up against us such war as excludes all treaty. And we are not so earnest for our own salvation,
as he is for our ruin. Let us then shun him, not with words only, but also with works; not
in mind only, but also in deed; and let us do none of the things which he approves, for so
shall we do all those which God approves. Yea, for he makes also many promises, not that
he may give, but that he may take. He promises by rapine, that he may deprive us of the
kingdom, and of righteousness; and sets treasures in the earth as a kind of gins or traps,
that he may deprive us both of these and of the treasures in Heaven, and he would have us
be rich here, that we may not be rich there.</p>
<p>And if he should not be able by wealth to cast us out of our portion there, he comes
another way, the way of poverty; as he did with respect to Job. That is, when he saw that
wealth did him no harm, he weaves his toils by poverty, expecting on that side to get the
better of him. But what could be more foolish than this? Since he that hath been able to bear
wealth with moderation, much more will he bear poverty with manliness; and he who desires
not riches when present, neither will he seek them when absent; even as that blessed man
did not, but by his poverty, on the other hand, he became still more glorious. For of his
possessions that wicked demon had power indeed to deprive him, but his love toward God

he not only could not take away, but made it even stronger, and when he had stripped him
of all, he caused him to abound with more blessings; wherefore also he was in perplexity.
For the more plagues he brought upon him, the more mighty he then saw him become. And
therefore, as you know, when he had gone through all, and had thoroughly tried his metal,
553because he made no way, he ran to his old weapon, the woman, and assumes a mask
of concern, and makes a tragical picture of his calamities in most pitiable tone, and feigns
that for removal of his evil he is introducing that deadly counsel.554 But neither so did he
prevail; nay, for his bait was perceived by that wondrous man, who with much wisdom
stopped the mouth of the woman speaking at his instigation.</p>
<p>Just so we likewise must act: though it be a brother, a tried friend, a wife, whom you
will of those nearest to us, whom he hath entered into, and so utters something not convenient,
555we must not receive the counsel for the person of him who so speaks, but for the
deadly counsel turn away from the speaker. Since in fact now also he doth many such things,
and puts before him a mask of sympathy, and while he seems to be friendly, he is instilling
his pernicious words, more grievous than poisons. Thus, as to flatter for evil is his part, so
to chastise for our good, is God’s.</p>
<p>7. Let us not then be deceived, neither let us by every mean seek after the life of ease.
For “whom the Lord loveth,” it is said, “He chasteneth.”556 Wherefore when we enjoy
prosperity, living in wickedness, then most of all should we grieve. For we ought ever to be
afraid while we sin, but especially when we suffer no ill. For when God exacts our penalties
by little and little, he makes our payment for these things easy to us; but when he is longsuffering
for each of our negligences, He is storing us up, if we continue in such things,
unto a great punishment. Since, if for the well-doers affliction be a necessary thing, much
more for them that sin.</p>
<p>See for instance how much long-suffering Pharaoh met with, and afterwards underwent
for all most extreme punishment: in how many things Nebuchadnezzar offended, yet at the
end expiated all; and the rich man, because he had suffered no great ill here, for this very
cause chiefly became miserable, for that having lived in luxury in the present life, he departed
to pay the penalty of all these things there, where he could not obtain anything at all to
soothe his calamity.</p>
<p>Yet for all this some are so cold and senseless, as to be always seeking only the things
that are here, and uttering those absurd sayings, “Let me enjoy all things present for a time,
and then I will consider about things out of sight: I will gratify my belly, I will be a slave to

pleasures, I will make full use of the present life; give me to-day, and take tomorrow.” Oh
excess of folly! Why, wherein do they who talk so differ from goats and swine? For if the
prophet557permits not them to be accounted men, that “neigh after their neighbors wife,”
who shall blame us for esteeming these to be goats and swine, and more insensible than
asses, by whom those things are held uncertain, which are more evident than what we see?
Why, if thou believest nothing else, attend to the devils in their scourging, to them who had
our hurt for their object in all their practice, both in word and deed. For thou wilt not, I am
sure, contradict this, that they do all to increase our security, and to do away with the fear
of hell, and to breed disbelief of the tribunals in that world. Nevertheless, they that are so
minded, by cryings and wailings do oftentimes proclaim the torments that are there.558
Whence is it then that they so speak, and utter things contrary to their own will? From no
other cause, but because they are under the pressure of stronger compulsion. For they would
have not been minded of their own accord to confess either that they are tormented by
dead men, or that they at all suffer anything dreadful.</p>
<p>Wherefore now have I said this? Because evil demons confess hell, who would fain have
hell disbelieved; but thou who enjoyest honor so great, and hast been a partaker in unutterable
mysteries, dost not so much as imitate them, but art become more hardened even than they.</p>
<p>8. “But who,” one will say, “hath come from those in hell, and hath declared these
things?” Why, who hath arrived here from heaven, and told us that there is a God who created
all things? And whence is it clear that we have a soul? For plainly, if thou art to believe the
things only that are in sight, both God and angels, and mind and soul, will be matter of
doubting to thee, and in this way thou wilt find all the doctrines of the truth gone.</p>
<p>Yet surely, if thou art willing to believe what is evident, the things invisible ought to be
believed by thee, rather than those which are seen. Even though what I say be a paradox,
nevertheless it is true, and among men of understanding is fully acknowledged. For whereas
the eyes are often deceived, not in the things unseen only (for of those they do not so much
as take cognizance), but even in those which men think they actually see, distance and atmosphere,
and absence of mind, and anger, and care, and ten thousand other things impeding
their accuracy; the reasoning power of the soul on the other hand, if it receive the light of
the divine Scriptures, will prove a more accurate, an unerring standard of realities.</p>
<p>Let us not then vainly deceive ourselves, neither in addition to the carelessness of our
life, which is the offspring of such doctrines as these, heap up to ourselves, for the very

doctrines themselves, a more grievous fire. For if there be no judgment, and we are not to
give account of our deeds, neither shall we receive rewards for our labors. Observe which
way your blasphemies tend, when ye say, that God, who is righteous, and loving, and mild,
overlooks so great labors and toils. And how can this be reasonable? Why, if by nothing
else, at any rate by the circumstances of thine own house, I bid thee weigh these things, and
then thou wilt see the absurdity. For though thou wert thyself savage and inhuman beyond
measure, and wilder than the very wild beasts, thou wouldest not choose at thy death to
leave unhonored the servant that had been affectionate to thee, but requitest him both with
freedom, and with a gift of money; and forasmuch as in thine own person hereafter, having
departed, thou wilt be able to do him no good, thou givest charge concerning him to the
future inheritors of thy substance, beseeching, exhorting, doing everything, so that he may
not remain unrewarded.</p>
<p>So then thou, who art evil, art so kind and loving towards thy servant; and will the Infinite
Goodness, that is, God, the Unspeakable Love to man, the kindness so vast: will He
overlook and leave uncrowned His own servants, Peter and Paul, and James, and John, those
who every day for His sake suffered hunger, were bound, were scourged, were drowned in
the sea, were given up to wild beasts, were dying, were suffering so great things as we cannot
so much as reckon up? And whereas the Olympic judge proclaims and crowns the victor,
and the master rewards the servant, and the king the soldier, and each in general him that
hath done him service, with what good things he can; shall God alone, after those so great
toils and labors, repay them with no good thing great or small? shall those just and pious
men, who have walked in every virtue, lie in the same state with adulterers, and parricides,
and manslayers, and violators of tombs? And in what way can this be reasonable? Since, if
there be nothing after our departure hence, and our interests reach no further than things
present, those are in the same case with these, or rather not so much as in the same. For
what though hereafter, as thou sayest, they fare alike? yet here, the whole of their time, the
wicked have been at ease, the righteous in chastisement. And this what sort of tyrant, what
savage and relentless man did ever so devise, touching his own servants and subjects?</p>
<p>Didst thou mark the exceeding greatness of the absurdity, and in what this argument
issues? Therefore if thou wilt not any other way, yet by these reasonings be instructed to rid
thyself of this wicked thought, and to flee from vice, and cleave to the toils which end in
virtue: and then shalt thou know certainly that our concerns are not bounded by the present
life. And if any one ask thee, “Who hath come from thence and brought word what is there?”
say unto him, “of men not one; for surely he would have been often disbelieved, as vaunting,
and exaggerating the thing; but the Lord of the angels hath brought word with exactness of
all those things. What need then have we of any man, seeing He, that will demand account
of us, crieth aloud every day, that He hath both made ready a hell, and prepared a kingdom;

<pb n="160"/>
and affords us clear demonstrations of these things? For if He were not hereafter to judge,
neither would he have exacted any penalty here.</p>
<p>9. “Well, but as to this very point how can it be reasonable? that of the wicked some
should be punished, others not? I mean, if God be no respecter of persons, as surely He is
not, why can it be that of one He exacts a penalty, but another He suffers to go away unpunished?
Why, this is again more inexplicable than the former.”</p>
<p>Yet if you are willing to hear what we say with candor, we will solve this difficulty also.</p>
<p>What then is the solution? He neither exacts penalty of all here, lest thou shouldest
despair of the resurrection, and lose all expectation of the judgment, as though all were to
give account here; nor doth He suffer all to go away unpunished, lest on the other hand
thou shouldest account all to be without His providence; but He both punishes and abstains
from punishing: by those whom He punishes, signifying that in that world also He will exact
a penalty of such as are unpunished here; and by those whom He doth not punish, working
upon thee to believe that there is some fearful trial after our departure hence.</p>
<p>But if He were altogether indifferent about our former deeds, He neither would have
punished any here, nor have conferred benefits. But now thou seest Him for thy sake
stretching out the heaven, kindling the sun, founding the earth, pouring forth the sea, expanding
the air, and appointing for the moon her courses, setting unchangeable laws for
the seasons of the years, and all other things too performing their own courses exactly at a
sign from Him. For both our nature, and that of creatures irrational, of them that creep,
that walk, that fly, that swim, in marshes, in springs, in rivers, in mountains, in forests, in
houses, in the air, in plains; plants also, and seeds, and trees, both wild and cultivated, both
fruitful and unfruitful; and all things in general, moved by that unwearied Hand, make
provision for our life, affording to us of themselves their ministry, not for our need only,
but also for our feeling of high station.559</p>
<p>Seeing therefore order so great and fair (and yet we have not mentioned so much as the
least portion thereof), darest thou say, that He who for thy sake hath wrought things so
many and great will overlook thee in the most critical points, and suffer thee when dead to
lie with the asses and swine: and that having honored thee with so great a gift, that of godliness,
whereby He hath even equaled thee with the angels, He will overlook thee after thy
countless labors and toils?</p>
<p>And how can this be reasonable? Why, these things, if we be silent “the stones will immediately
cry out;”560so plain are they, and manifest, and more lucid than the sunbeam itself.</p>
<p>Having then considered all these things, and having convinced our own soul, that after
our departure hence, we shall both stand at the fearful judgment-seat, and give account of

all that we have done, and shall bear our penalty, and submit to our sentence, if we continue
in our negligences; and shall receive crowns and unutterable blessings, if we are willing to
give a little heed to ourselves; let us both stop the mouths of them who gainsay these things,
and ourselves choose the way of virtue; that with due confidence departing to that tribunal,
we may attain unto the good things that are promised us, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion, now and ever, world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. IV. 12.</p>
<p>“Now when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, He departed into Galilee.”</p>
<p>1. Wherefore doth He depart? Again instructing us not to go to meet temptations,561but
to give place and withdraw ourselves. For it is no reproach, the not casting one’s self into
danger, but the failing to stand manfully when fallen into it. To teach us this accordingly,
and to soothe the envy of the Jews, He retires to Capernaum; at once fulfilling the proph-
ecy,562and making haste to catch the teachers of the world: for they, as you know, were
abiding there, following their craft.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how in every case when He is about to depart unto the Gentiles,
He hath the occasion given Him by Jews. For so in this instance, by plotting against His
forerunner, and casting him into prison, they thrust out Christ into the Galilee of the Gentiles.
For to show that He neither speaks of the Jewish nation by a part of it, nor signifies obscurely
all the tribes; mark how the Prophet distinguishes that place, saying “The land of Nephthalim,
by the way of the sea,563beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which sat in
darkness, saw great light:”564by darkness here not meaning that which is sensible, but men’s
errors and ungodliness. Wherefore he also added, “They which sat in the region and shadow
of death, to them light is sprung up.” For that thou mightest learn that neither the light nor
the darkness which he speaks of are sensible, in discoursing of the light, he called it not
merely light, but “a great light” which elsewhere he expresses by the word, True:565and in
describing the darkness, he termed it, “a shadow of death.”</p>
<p>Then implying that they did not of themselves seek and find, but that God showed
Himself to them from above, he saith to them, “Light is sprung up;” that is, the light of itself
sprang up and shone forth: it was not that they first ran to the light. For in truth the condition
of men was at the worst before Christ’s coming. Since they more than “walked in darkness;”
they “sat in darkness;” a kind of sign that they did not even hope to be delivered. For as
persons not even knowing where to put a step forward, so they sat, overtaken by the darkness,
not being able so much as to stand any more.</p>
<p>2. “From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand.”</p>

<pb n="163"/>
<p>“From that time:” what time? After John was cast into prison. And wherefore did He
not preach to them from the beginning? Indeed what occasion for John at all, when the
witness of His works was proclaiming Him?</p>
<p>That hence also thou mightest learn His dignity; namely, that as the Fathers, so He too
hath prophets; to which purpose Zacharias also spake; “And thou, child, shalt be called a
prophet of the Highest.”566 And that he might leave no occasion to the shameless Jews;
which motive He himself alleged, saying, “John came neither eating nor drinking, and they
say, he hath a devil. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of
her children.”567</p>
<p>And moreover it was necessary that what concerned Him should be spoken by another
first and not by Himself. For if even after both testimonies and demonstrations so many
and so great, they said, “Thou bearest record of Thyself, Thy record is not true:”568had He,
without John’s saying anything, come into the midst, and first borne record Himself; what
would they not have said? For this cause, neither did He preach before John, nor did He
work miracles, until John was cast into prison; lest in this way the multitude should be divided.
Therefore also John did no miracle at all; that by this means also might give over the
multitude to Jesus, His miracles drawing them unto Him.</p>
<p>Again, if even after so many divine precautions,569 John’s disciples, both before and
after his imprisonment, were jealously disposed towards Him, and the people too suspected
not Him but John to be the Christ; what would not the result have been, had none of these
things taken place? For this cause both Matthew distinctly notes, that “from that time He
began to preach;” and when He began His preaching, He Himself also taught this same
doctrine, which the other used to preach; and no word as yet concerning Himself doth the
doctrine which he preached say. Because it was for the time a great thing even for this to be
received, forasmuch as they had not as yet the proper opinion about Him. Therefore also
at the beginning He puts nothing severe or grievous, as the other did, mentioning an axe,
and a tree cut down; a fan, and a threshing-floor, and unquenchable fire; but His preludes
are gracious: the Heavens and the kingdom there are the good tidings which he declares to
His hearers.</p>
<p>3. “And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren, Simon that was surnamed
Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And He saith
<note type="footnote">566 Luke i. 76.</note>
<note type="footnote">567 Matt. xi. 18, 19. [The citation is from Matthew, not Luke, but the last clause in the R.V. reads: “And wisdom

<pb n="164"/>
unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they left their nets,
and followed Him.”570</p>
<p>And yet John saith that they were called in another manner. Whence it is evident that
this was a second call; and from many things one may perceive this. For there it is said, that
they came to Him when “John was not yet cast into prison;” but here, after he was in confinement.
And there Andrew calls Peter, but here Jesus calls both. And John saith, Jesus
seeing Simon coming, saith, “Thou art Simon, the Son of Jona, thou shalt be called Cephas,
which is by interpretation, a stone.”571 But Matthew saith that he was already called by that
name; for his words are, “Seeing Simon that was called Peter.” And from the place whence
they were called, and from many other things, one may perceive this; and from their ready
obedience, and abandonment of all. For now they were well instructed beforehand. Thus,
in the other case, Andrew is seen coming into His house, and hearing many things; but here,
having heard one bare word, they followed immediately. Since neither was it unnatural572for
them to follow Him at the beginning, and then leave Him again and return anew to their
own craft, when they saw both John thrown into prison, and Himself departing. Accordingly
you see that He finds them actually fishing. But He neither forbad them at the first when
minded to withdraw, nor having withdrawn themselves, did He let them go altogether; but
He gave way when they started aside from Him, and comes again to win them back; which
kind of thing is the great point in fishing.573</p>
<p>But mark both their faith, and their obedience. For though they were in the midst of
their work (and ye know how greedy a thing fishing is), when they heard His command,
they delayed not, they procrastinated not, they said not, “let us return home, and converse
with our kinsfolk,” but “they forsook all and followed,” even as Elisha did to Elijah.”574 Because
such is the obedience which Christ seeks of us, as that we delay not even a moment
of time, though something absolutely most needful should vehemently press on us.
Wherefore also when some other had come unto Him, and was asking leave to bury his own
father,575not even this did He permit him to do; to signify that before all we ought to esteem
the following of Himself.</p>
<p>But if thou should say, “the promise is very great;” even for this do I most admire them,
for that when they had not as yet seen any sign, they believed in so great a reach of promise,

and accounted all but second to that attendance. And this, because they believed that by
what words they were caught, by the same they would be able to catch others also.</p>
<p>To these, then, such was His promise: but to James and John He saith no such thing.
For the obedience of those that had gone before had by this time paved the way for these.
And besides they had also heard many things before concerning Him.</p>
<p>And see how he doth with exact care intimate unto us their poverty also: in that He
found them sewing up their nets. So exceeding great was their poverty, that they were
mending what was worn out, not being able to buy others. And this too was for the time no
small proof of virtue, their beating poverty with ease, their supporting themselves by honest
labor, their being bound one to another by the power of love, their having their father with
them, and attending upon them.</p>
<p>4. When therefore He had caught them, then He begins in their presence to work miracles,
by His deeds confirming the words of John concerning Him. And He was continually
frequenting their synagogues, even by this instructing them that He was not a sort of adversary
of God and deceiver, but that He was come in accordance with the Father.</p>
<p>And while frequenting them, He did not preach only, but also showed forth miracles.
And this, because on every occasion, whensoever anything is done strange and surprising,
and any polity is introduced, God is wont to work miracles as pledges of his power, which
He affords to them that are to receive His laws. Thus, for instance, when He was about to
make man, He created a whole world, and then gave him that law which he had in Paradise.
And when He was to give laws to Noah, He showed forth anew great miracles, in that He
reduced again the whole creation to its elements,576and made that fearful sea to prevail for
a full year; and in that, amid so great a tempest, He preserved that righteous man. And in
the time of Abraham too He vouchsafed many signs; as his victory in the war, the plague
upon Pharaoh, his deliverance from dangers. And when about to legislate for the Jews, He
showed forth those marvellous and great prodigies, and then gave the law. Just so in this
case also, being to introduce a certain high polity, and to tell them what they had never
heard, by the display of the miracles He confirms what He saith.</p>
<p>Thus because the kingdom He was preach ing appeared not, by the things that appear,
He makes it, though invisible, manifest.</p>
<p>And mark the evangelist’s care to avoid superfluity of words;577how he tells us not of
every one of them that are healed, but in a few words speeds over showers of miracles.578</p>

<p>For “they brought unto Him,” saith he, “all that were sick with divers diseases, and torments,
and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those
that had the palsy, and He healed them.”</p>
<p>But our inquiry is this; why it can have been that He demanded faith of none of them?
For He said not, what we find Him saying after this, “Believe ye that I am able to do
this?”579because He had not as yet given proof of His power. And besides, the very act of
approaching Him, and of bringing others to Him, exhibited no common faith. For they
brought them even from far; whereas they would never have brought them, unless they had
persuaded themselves of great things concerning Him.</p>
<p>Now then, let us too follow Him; for we also have many diseases of our soul, and these
especially He would fain heal. Since with this intent He corrects that other sort, that He may
banish these out of our soul.</p>
<p>5. Let us therefore come unto Him, and let us ask nothing pertaining to this life, but
rather remission of sins. For indeed He gives it even now, if we be in earnest. Since as then
“His fame went out into Syria,” so now into the whole world. And they indeed ran together
on hearing that He healed persons possessed: and thou, after having much more and
greater experience of His power, dost thou not rouse thyself and run?</p>
<p>But whereas they left both country, and friends, and kinsfolk; endurest thou not so
much as to leave thy house for the sake of drawing near, and obtaining far greater things?
Or rather we do not require of thee so much as this, but leave thy evil habits only, and thou
canst easily be made whole, remaining at home with thy friends.</p>
<p>But as it is, if we have any bodily ailment, we do and contrive everything to be rid of
what pains us; but when our soul is indisposed, we delay, and draw back. For which cause
neither from the other sort are we delivered: since the things that are indispensable are becoming
to us secondary, and the secondary indispensable; and letting alone the fountain of
our ills, we would fain cleanse out the streams.</p>
<p>For that our bodily ills are caused by the wickedness of the soul, is shown both by him
that had the palsy thirty and eight years, and by him that was let down through the roof,
and by Cain also before these; and from many other things likewise one may perceive this.
Let us do away then with the well-spring of our evils, and all the channels of our diseases
will be stayed. For the disease is not palsy only, but also our sin; and this more than that, by
how much a soul is better than a body.</p>
<p>Let us therefore now also draw nigh unto Him; let us entreat Him that He would brace
our paralyzed soul, and leaving all things that pertain to this life, let us take account of the
things spiritual only. Or if thou cleave unto these also, yet think of them after the other.</p>

<p>Neither must thou think lightly of it, because thou hast no pain in sinning; rather on
this very account most of all do thou lament, that thou feelest not the anguish of thine offenses.
For not because sin bites not, doth this come to pass, but because the offending soul
is insensible. Regard with this view them that have a feeling of their own sins, how they wail
more bitterly than such as are being cut, or burned; how many things they do, how many
suffer, how greatly they mourn and lament, in order to be delivered from their evil conscience.
They would not do any such thing, unless they were exceedingly pained in soul.</p>
<p>The best thing then is, to avoid sin in the first instance: the next to it, is to feel that we
sin, and thoroughly amend ourselves. But if we have not this, how shall we pray to God,
and ask forgiveness of our sins, we who take no account of these matters? For when thou
thyself who hast offended art unwilling to know so much as this very fact, that thou hast
sinned; for what manner of offenses will thou entreat God for pardon? For what thou
knowest not? And how wilt thou know the greatness of the benefit? Tell therefore thine offenses
in particular, that thou mayest learn for what thou receivest forgiveness, that so thou
mayest become grateful towards thy Benefactor.</p>
<p>But thou, when it is a man whom thou hast provoked, entreatest friends, neighbors,
and door-keepers, and spendest money, and consumest many days in visiting and petitioning,
and though he that is provoked utterly reject thee once, twice, ten thousand times over, thou
despondest not, but becoming more earnest thou makest the more entreaty; but when the
God of all is provoked, we gape, and throw ourselves back, and live in luxury and in
drunkenness, and do all things as usual. And when shall we be able to propitiate Him? and
how shall we by this very thing fail to provoke Him so much the more? For not so much
sinning, as signing without even pain, causes in Him indignation and wrath. Wherefore it
were meet after all this to sink into the very earth, and not so much as to behold this sun,
nor to breathe at all, for that having so placable a Master, we provoke Him first, and then
have no remorse for provoking Him. And yet He assuredly, even when He is wroth, doeth
not so as hating and turning away from us, but in order that in this way at least He may win
us over to Himself. For if He continued after insult befriending thee, thou wouldest the
more despise Him. Therefore in order that this may not be, He turns away for a little while,
to have thee ever with Himself.</p>
<p>6. Let us now, I pray you, take courage at His love to man, and let us show forth an
anxious repentance, before the day come on, which permits us not to profit thereby. For as
yet all depends on us, but then He that judges hath alone control over the sentence. “Let us
therefore come before His face with confession;”580let us bewail, let us mourn. For if we
should be able to prevail upon the Judge before the appointed day to forgive us our sins,
then we need not so much as enter into the court; as on the other hand, if this be not done,
<note type="footnote">580 Ps. xcv. 2, LXX.</note>

<pb n="168"/>
He will hear us publicly in the presence of the world, and we shall no longer have any hope
of pardon. For no one of those who have not done away with their sins here, when he hath
departed thither shall be able to escape his account for them; but as they who are taken out
of these earthly prisons are brought in their chains to the place of judgment, even so all
souls, when they have gone away hence bound with the manifold chains of their sins, are
led to the awful judgment-seat. For in truth our present life is nothing better than a prison.
But as when we have entered into that apartment, we see all bound with chains; so now if
we withdraw ourselves from outward show, and enter into each man’s life, into each man’s
soul, we shall see it bound with chains more grievous than iron: and this most especially if
thou enter into the souls of them that are rich. For the more men have about them, so much
the more are they bound. As therefore with regard to the prisoner, when thou seest him
with irons on his back, on his hands, and often on his feet too, thou dost therefore most of
all account him miserable; so also as to the rich man, when thou seest him encompassed
with innumerable affairs, let him not be therefore rich, but rather for these very things
wretched, in thine account. For together with these bonds, he hath a cruel jailor too, the
wicked love of riches; which suffers him not to pass out of this prison, but provides for him
thousands of fetters, and guards, and doors, and bolts; and when he hath cast him into the
inner prison, persuades him even to feel pleasure in these bonds; that he may not find so
much as any hope of deliverance from the evils which press on him.</p>
<p>And if in thought thou wert to lay open that man’s soul, thou wouldest see it not bound
only, but squalid, and filthy, and teeming with vermin. For no better than vermin are the
pleasures of luxury, but even more abominable, and destroy the body more, together with
the soul also; and upon the one and upon the other they bring ten thousand scourges of
sickness.</p>
<p>On account then of all these things let us entreat the Redeemer of our souls, that He
would both burst asunder our bands, and remove this our cruel jailor, and having set us
free from the burden of those iron chains, He would make our spirits lighter than any wing.
And as we entreat Him, so let us contribute our own part, earnestness, and consideration,
and an excellent zeal. For thus we shall be able both in a short time to be freed from the evils
which now oppress us, and to learn in what condition we were before, and to lay hold on
the liberty which belongs to us; unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power forever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XV.</head>
<p>Matt. V. 1, 2.</p>
<p>“And Jesus seeing the multitudes went up into the mountain, and when He was set, His disciples
came unto Him. And He opened His mouth, and taught them saying, Blessed,” etc.</p>
<p>See how unambitious He was, and void of boasting: in that He did not lead people about
with Him, but whereas, when healing was required, He had Himself gone about everywhere,
visiting both towns and country places; now when the multitude is become very great, He
sits in one spot: and that not in the midst of any city or forum, but on a mountain and in a
wilderness; instructing us to do nothing for display, and to separate ourselves from the tumults
of ordinary life,581and this most especially, when we are to study wisdom, and to
discourse of things needful to be done.</p>
<p>But when He had gone up into the mount, and “was set down, His disciples came unto
Him.” Seest thou their growth in virtue? and how in a moment582they became better men?
Since the multitude were but gazers on the miracles, but these from that hour desired also
to hear some great and high thing. And indeed this it was set Him on His teaching, and
made Him begin this discourse.</p>
<p>For it was not men’s bodies only that He was healing, but He was also amending their
souls; and again from the care of these He would pass to attendance on the other. Thus He
at once varied the succor that He gave, and likewise mingled with the instruction afforded
by His words, the manifestation of His glory from His works; and besides, He stopped the
shameless mouths of the heretics, signifying by this His care of both parts of our being, that
He Himself is the Maker of the whole creation. Therefore also on each nature He bestowed
abundant providence, now amending the one, now the other.</p>
<p>And in this way He was then employed. For it is said, that “He opened His mouth, and
taught them.” And wherefore is the clause added, “He opened His mouth”? To inform thee
that in His very silence He gave instruction, and not when He spoke only: but at one time
by “opening His mouth,” at another uttering His voice by the works which He did.</p>
<p>But when thou hearest that He taught them, do not think of Him as discoursing with
His disciples only, but rather with all through them.</p>
<p>For since the multitude was such as a multitude ever is,583and consisted moreover of
such as creep on the ground,584 He withdraws the choir of His disciples, and makes His

<pb n="170"/>
discourse unto them: in His conversation with them providing that the rest also, who were
yet very far from the level of His sayings, might find His lesson of self-denial no longer
grievous unto them. Of which indeed both Luke gave intimation, when he said, that He
directed His words unto them:585and Matthew too, clearly declaring the same, wrote, “His
disciples came unto Him, and He taught them.” For thus the others also were sure to be
more eagerly attentive to Him, than they would have been, had He addressed Himself unto
all.</p>
<p>2. Whence then doth He begin? and what kind of foundations of His new polity doth
He lay for us?</p>
<p>Let us hearken with strict attention unto what is said. For though it was spoken unto
them, it was written for the sake also of all men afterwards. And accordingly on this account,
though He had His disciples in His mind in His public preaching, yet unto them He limits
not His sayings, but applies all His words of blessing without restriction. Thus He said not,
“Blessed are ye, if ye become poor,” but “Blessed are the poor.” And I may add that even if
He had spoken of them, the advice would still be common to all. For so, when He saith, “Lo!
I am with you always, even unto the end of the world,”586 He is discoursing not with them
only, but also, through them, with all the world. And in pronouncing them blessed, who
are persecuted, and chased, and suffer all intolerable things; not for them only, but also for
all who arrive at the same excellency, He weaves His crown.</p>
<p>However, that this may be yet plainer, and to inform thee that thou hast great interest
in His sayings, and so indeed hath all mankind, if any choose to give heed; hear how He
begins these wondrous words.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.”587</p>
<p>What is meant by “the poor in spirit?” The humble and contrite in mind. For by “spirit”
He hath here designated the soul, and the faculty of choice. That is, since many are humble
not willingly, but compelled by stress of circumstances; letting these pass (for this were no
matter of praise), He blesses them first, who by choice humble and contract themselves.</p>
<p>But why said he not, “the humble,” but rather “the poor?” Because this is more than
that. For He means here them who are awestruck, and tremble at the commandments of
God. Whom also by His prophet Isaiah God earnestly accepting said, “To whom will I look,
but to him who is meek588and quiet, and trembleth at My words?”589 For indeed there are

<pb n="171"/>
many kinds of humility: one is humble in his own measure, another with all excess of
lowliness. It is this last lowliness of mind which that blessed prophet commends, picturing
to us the temper that is not merely subdued, but utterly broken, when he saith, “The sacrifice
for God is a contrite spirit, a contrite and an humble heart God will not despise.”590 And
the Three Children also offer this unto God as a great sacrifice, saying, “Nevertheless, in a
contrite soul, and in a spirit of lowliness, may we be accepted.”591 This Christ also now
blesses.</p>
<p>3. For whereas the greatest of evils, and those which make havoc of the whole world,
had their entering in from pride:—for both the devil, not being such before, did thus become
a devil; as indeed Paul plainly declared, saying, “Lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into
the condemnation of the devil:”592—and the first man, too, puffed up by the devil with these
hopes, was made an example of,593and became mortal (for expecting to become a god, he
lost even what he had; and God also upbraiding him with this, and mocking his folly, said,
“Behold, Adam is become as one of us”594; and each one of those that came after did hereby
wreck himself in impiety, fancying some equality with God:—since, I say, this was the
stronghold of our evils, and the root and fountain of all wickedness, He, preparing a remedy
suitable to the disease, laid this law first as a strong and safe foundation. For this being fixed
as a base, the builder in security lays on it all the rest. But if this be taken away, though a
man reach to the Heavens in his course of life,595it is all easily undermined, and issues in a
grievous end. Though fasting, prayer, almsgiving, temperance, any other good thing whatever,
be gathered together in thee; without humility all fall away and perish.</p>
<p>It was this very thing that took place in the instance of the Pharisee. For even after he
had arrived at the very summit, he “went down”596with the loss of all, because he had not
the mother of virtues: for as pride is the fountain of all wickedness, so is humility the principle
of all self-command. Wherefore also He begins with this, pulling up boasting by the very
root out of the soul of His hearers.</p>
<p>“And what,” one may ask, “is this to His disciples, who were on every account humble?
For in truth they had nothing to be proud of, being fishermen, poor, ignoble, and illiterate.”
Even though these things concerned not His disciples, yet surely they concerned such as
were then present, and such as were hereafter to receive the disciples, lest they should on

<pb n="172"/>
this account despise them. But it were truer to say that they did also concern His disciples.
For even if not then, yet by and by they were sure to require this help, after their signs and
wonders, and their honor from the world, and their confidence towards God. For neither
wealth, nor power, nor royalty itself, had so much power to exalt men, as the things which
they possessed in all fullness. And besides, it was natural that even before the signs they
might be lifted up, at that very time when they saw the multitude, and all that audience
surrounding their Master; they might feel some human weakness. Wherefore He at once
represses their pride.</p>
<p>And He doth not introduce what He saith by way of advice or of commandments, but
by way of blessing, so making His word less burthensome, and opening to all the course of
His discipline. For He said not, “This or that person,” but “they who do so, are all of them
blessed.” So that though thou be a slave, a beggar, in poverty, a stranger, unlearned,597there
is nothing to hinder thee from being blessed, if thou emulate this virtue.</p>
<p>4. Now having begun, as you see, where most need was, He proceeds to another commandment,
one which seems to be opposed to the judgment of the whole world. For
whereas all think that they who rejoice are enviable, those in dejection, poverty, and
mourning, wretched, He calls these blessed rather than those; saying thus,</p>
<p>“Blessed are they that mourn.”598</p>
<p>Yet surely all men call them miserable. For therefore He wrought the miracles beforehand,
that in such enactments as these He might be entitled to credit.</p>
<p>And here too again he designated not simply all that mourn, but all that do so for sins:
since surely that other kind of mourning is forbidden, and that earnestly, which relates to
anything of this life. This Paul also clearly declared, when he said, “The sorrow of the world
worketh death, but godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented
of.”599</p>
<p>These then He too Himself calls blessed, whose sorrow is of that kind; yet not simply
them that sorrow did He designate, but them that sorrow intensely. Therefore He did not
say, “they that sorrow,” but “they that mourn.” For this commandment again is fitted to
teach us entire self-control. For if those who grieve for children, or wife, or any other relation
gone from them, have no fondness for gain or pleasure during that period of their sorrow;
if they aim not at glory, are not provoked by insults, nor led captive by envy, nor beset by
any other passion, their grief alone wholly possessing them; much more will they who mourn
for their own sins, as they ought to mourn, show forth a self-denial greater than this.</p>

<note type="footnote">599 2 Cor. vii. 10. [R.V., “a repentance which bringeth no regret,” in the margin, “unto a salvation which
bringeth no regret.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="173"/>
<p>Next, what is the reward for these? “For they shall be comforted,” saith He.</p>
<p>Where shall they be comforted! tell me. Both here and there. For since the thing enjoined
was exceeding burthensome and galling, He promised to give that, which most of all made
it light. Wherefore, if thou wilt be comforted, mourn: and think not this a dark saying. For
when God doth comfort, though sorrows come upon thee by thousands like snow-flakes,
thou wilt be above them all. Since in truth, as the returns which God gives are always far
greater than our labors; so He hath wrought in this case, declaring them that mourn to be
blessed, not after the value of what they do, but after His own love towards man. For they
that mourn, mourn for misdoings, and to such it is enough to enjoy forgiveness, and obtain
wherewith to answer for themselves. But forasmuch as He is full of love towards man, He
doth not limit His recompense either to the removal of our punishments, or to the deliverance
from our sins, but He makes them even blessed, and imparts to them abundant consolation.</p>
<p>But He bids us mourn, not only for our own, but also for other men’s misdoings. And
of this temper were the souls of the saints: such was that of Moses, of Paul, of David; yea,
all these many times mourned for evils not their own.</p>
<p>5. “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”600 Tell me, what kind of earth?
Some601say a figurative earth, but it is not this, for nowhere in Scripture do we find any
mention of an earth that is merely figurative.602 But what can the saying mean? He holds
out a sensible prize; even as Paul also doth, in that when he had said, “Honor thy father and
thy mother,”603he added, “For so shalt thou live long upon the earth.” And He Himself
unto the thief again, “Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”604</p>
<p>Thus He doth not incite us by means of the future blessings only, but of the present
also, for the sake of the grosser sort of His hearers, and such as before the future seek those
others.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, further on also He said, “Agree with thine adversary.”605 Then He
appoints the reward of such self-command, and saith, “Lest at any time the adversary deliver
thee to the judge, and the judge to the officer.”606 Seest thou whereby He alarmed us? By
the things of sense, by what happens before our eyes. And again, “Whosoever shall say to
his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council.”607</p>
<note type="footnote">600 Or, “the land.”</note>

<pb n="174"/>
<p>And Paul too sets forth sensible rewards at great length, and uses things present in his
exhortations; as when he is discoursing about virginity. For having said nothing about the
heavens there, for the time he urges it by things present, saying, “Because of the present
distress,” and, “But I spare you,” and, “I would have you without carefulness.”608</p>
<p>Thus accordingly Christ also with the things spiritual hath mingled the sensible. For
whereas the meek man is thought to lose all his own, He promises the contrary, saying,
“Nay, but this is he who possesses his goods in safety, namely, he who is not rash, nor
boastful: while that sort of man shall often lose his patrimony, and his very life.”</p>
<p>And besides, since in the Old Testament the prophet used to say continually, “The meek
shall inherit the earth;”609 He thus weaves into His discourse the words to which they were
accustomed, so as not everywhere to speak a strange language.</p>
<p>And this He saith, not as limiting the rewards to things present, but as joining with these
the other sort of gifts also. For neither in speaking of any spiritual thing doth He exclude
such as are in the present life; nor again in promising such as are in our life, doth He limit
his promise to that kind. For He saith, “Seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things
shall be added unto you.”610 And again: “Whosoever hath left houses or brethren, shall receive
an hundred fold in this world, and in the future shall inherit everlasting life.”611</p>
<p>6. “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness.”612</p>
<p>What sort of righteousness? He means either the whole of virtue, or that particular virtue
which is opposed to covetousness.613 For since He is about to give commandment concerning
mercy, to show how we must show mercy, as, for instance, not of rapine or covetousness,
He blesses them that lay hold of righteousness.</p>
<p>And see with what exceeding force He puts it. For He said not, “Blessed are they which
keep fast by righteousness,” but, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:”
that not merely anyhow, but with all desire we may pursue it. For since this is
the most peculiar property of covetousness, and we are not so enamored of meat and drink,
as of gaining, and compassing ourselves with more and more, He bade us to transfer this
desire to a new object, freedom from covetousness.</p>
<p>Then He appoints the prize, again from things sensible; saying, “for they shall be filled.”
Thus, because it is thought that the rich are commonly made such by covetousness, “Nay,”
saith He, “it is just contrary: for it is righteousness that doeth this. Wherefore, so long as

<pb n="175"/>
thou doest righteously, fear not poverty, nor tremble at hunger. For the extortioners, they
are the very persons who lose all, even as he certainly who is in love with righteousness,
possesses himself the goods of all men in safety.”</p>
<p>But if they who covet not other men’s goods enjoy so great abundance,614much more
they who give up their own.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the merciful.”615</p>
<p>Here He seems to me to speak not of those only who show mercy in giving of money,
but those likewise who are merciful in their actions. For the way of showing mercy is manifold,
and this commandment is broad. What then is the reward thereof? “For they shall
obtain mercy.”</p>
<p>And it seems indeed to be a sort of equal recompence, but it is a far greater thing than
the act of goodness. For whereas they themselves show mercy as men, they obtain mercy
from the God of all; and it is not the same thing, man’s mercy, and God’s; but as wide as is
the interval between wickedness and goodness, so far is the one of these removed from the
other.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”616</p>
<p>Behold again the reward is spiritual. Now He here calls “pure,” either those who have
attained unto all virtue, and are not conscious to themselves of any evil; or those who live
in temperance. For there is nothing which we need so much in order to see God, as this last
virtue. Wherefore Paul also said, “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which
no man shall see the Lord.”617 He is here speaking of such sight as it is possible for man to
have.</p>
<p>For because there are many who show mercy, and who commit no rapine, nor are covetous,
who yet are guilty of fornication and uncleanness; to signify that the former alone
suffices not, He hath added this, much in the same sense as Paul, writing to the Corinthians,
bore witness of the Macedonians, that they were rich not only in almsgiving, but also in all
other virtue. For having spoken of the noble spirit618they had shown in regard of their
goods, he saith, “They gave also their own selves to the Lord, and to us.”619</p>
<p>7. “Blessed are the peace-makers.”620</p>

<p>Here He not only takes away altogether our own strife and hatred amongst ourselves,
but He requires besides this something more, namely, that we should set at one again others,
who are at strife.</p>
<p>And again, the reward which He annexes is spiritual. Of what kind then is it.</p>
<p>“For they shall be called the children of God.”</p>
<p>Yea, for this became the work of the Only Begotten, to unite the divided, and to reconcile
the alienated.</p>
<p>Then, lest thou shouldest imagine peace in all cases a blessing, He hath added,
<lg>
<l>“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.”621</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That is, for virtue’s sake, for succor622given to others, and for godliness: it being ever
His wont to call by the name of “righteousness” the whole practical wisdom of the soul.</p>
<p>“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you, and say all manner of evil
against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad.”623</p>
<p>As if He said, “Though they should call you sorcerers, deceivers, pestilent persons, or
whatever else, blessed are ye:” so He speaks. What could be newer than these injunctions?
wherein the very things which all others avoid, these He declares to be desirable; I mean,
being poor, mourning, persecution, evil report. But yet He both affirmed this, and convinced
not two, nor ten, nor twenty, nor an hundred, nor a thousand men, but the whole world.
And hearing things so grievous and galling, so contrary to the accustomed ways of men, the
multitudes “were astonished.” So great was the power of Him who spake.</p>
<p>However, lest thou shouldest think that the mere fact of being evil spoken of makes
men blessed, He hath set two limitations; when it is for His sake, and when the things that
are said are false: for without these, he who is evil spoken of, so far from being blessed, is
miserable.</p>
<p>Then see the prize again: “Because your reward is great in heaven.” But thou, though
thou hear not of a kingdom given in each one of the blessings, be not discouraged. For although
He give different names to the rewards, yet He brings all into His kingdom. Thus,
both when He saith, “they that mourn shall be comforted;” and, “they that show mercy shall
obtain mercy;” and, “the pure in heart shall see God;” and, the peacemakers “shall be called
the children of God;” nothing else but the Kingdom doth He shadow out by all these sayings.
For such as enjoy these, shall surely attain unto that. Think not therefore that this reward
is for the poor in spirit only, but for those also who hunger after righteousness, for the meek,
and for all the rest without exception.</p>

<p>Since on this account He hath set His blessing on them all, that thou mightest not look
for anything sensible: for that man cannot be blessed, who is crowned with such things as
come to an end with this present life, and hurry by quicker than a shadow.</p>
<p>8. But when He had said, “your reward is great,” he added also another consolation,
saying, “For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”</p>
<p>Thus, since that first, the promise of the Kingdom, was yet to come, and all in expectation,
He affords them comfort from this world; from their fellowship with those who before them
had been ill-treated.</p>
<p>For “think not,” saith He, “that for something inconsistent in your sayings and enactments
ye suffer these things: or, as being teachers of evil doctrines, ye are to be persecuted
by them; the plots and dangers proceed not of any wickedness in your sayings, but of the
malice of those who hear you. Wherefore neither are they any blame to you who suffer
wrong, but to them who do the wrong. And to the truth of these things all preceding time
bears witness. For against the prophets they did not even bring any charge of transgressing
the law, and of sentiments of impiety, that they stoned some, chased away others, encompassed
others with innumerable afflictions. Wherefore let not this trouble you, for of the
very same mind they do all that is done now.” Seest thou how He raised up their spirits, by
placing them near to the company of Moses and Elias?</p>
<p>Thus also Paul writing to the Thessalonians, saith, “For ye became followers of the
Churches of God, which are in Judea; for ye also have suffered the same things of your own
fellow-countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their
own prophets, and have driven us out; and they please not God, and are contrary to all
men.”624 Which same point here also Christ hath established.</p>
<p>And whereas in the other beatitudes, He said, “Blessed are the poor,” and “the merciful;”
here He hath not put it generally, but addresses His speech unto themselves, saying, “Blessed
are ye, when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and say every evil word:” signifying
that this is an especial privilege of theirs; and that beyond all others, teachers have this for
their own.</p>
<p>At the same time He here also covertly signifies His own dignity, and His equality in
honor with Him who begat Him. For “as they on the Father’s account,” saith He, “so shall
ye also for me suffer these things.” But when He saith, “the prophets which were before
you,” He implies that they were also by this time become prophets.</p>
<p>Next, declaring that this above all profits them, and makes them glorious, He did not
say, “they will calumniate and persecute you, but I will prevent it.” For not in their escaping
evil report, but in their noble endurance thereof, and in refuting them by their actions, He
<note type="footnote">624 1 Thess. ii. 14, 15.</note>

<pb n="178"/>
will have their safety stand: this being a much greater thing than the other; even as to be
struck and not hurt, is much greater than escaping the blow.</p>
<p>9. Now in this place He saith, “Your reward is great in heaven.” But Luke625reports Him
to have spoken this, both earnestly, and with more entire consolation; for He not only, as
you know, pronounces them blessed, who are evil spoken of for God’s sake, but declares
them likewise wretched, who are well spoken of by all men. For, “Woe unto you,” saith He,
“when all men shall speak well of you.” And yet the apostles were well spoken of, but not
by all men. Wherefore He said not, “Woe unto you, when men shall speak well of you,” but,
“when all men” shall do so: for it is not even possible that those who live in the practice of
virtue should be well spoken of by all men.</p>
<p>And again He saith, “When they shall cast out your name as evil, rejoice ye, and leap
for joy.”626 For not only of the dangers they underwent, but of the calumny also, He appoints
the recompence to be great. Wherefore He said not, “When they shall persecute, and kill
you,” but, “When they shall revile you, and say all manner of evil.” For most assuredly, men’s
evil reports have a sharper bite than their very deeds. For whereas, in our dangers, there are
many things that lighten the toil, as to be cheered627by all, to have many to applaud, to
crown, to proclaim our praise; here in our reproach even this consolation is destroyed. Because
we seem not to have achieved anything great; and this galls the combatant more than
all his dangers: at least many have gone on even to hang themselves, not bearing evil report.
And why marvellest thou at the others? since that traitor, that shameless and accursed one,
he who had ceased to blush for anything whatever, was wrought upon by this chiefly to
hurry to the halter. And Job again, all adamant as he was, and firmer than a rock; when he
had been robbed of all his possessions, and was suffering those incurable ills, and had become
on a sudden childless, and when he saw his body pouring out worms like a fountain, and
his wife attacking him, he repelled it all with ease; but when he saw his friends reproaching
and trampling upon him, and entertaining an evil opinion of him, and saying that he suffered
those things for some sins, and was paying the penalty of wickedness: then was there trouble,
then commotion, even in that great and noble-hearted man.628</p>
<p>And David also, letting pass all that he had suffered, sought of God a retribution for the
calumny alone. For, “Let him curse,” saith he, “for the Lord hath bidden him: that the Lord
may see my humiliation, and requite me for this cursing of his on this day.”629</p>

<pb n="179"/>
<p>And Paul too proclaims the triumph not of those only who incur danger, or are deprived
of their goods, but of these also, thus saying, “Call to remembrance the former days, in which
after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly whilst ye were made
a gazing stock by reproaches, and afflictions.”630 On this account then Christ hath appointed
the reward also to be great.</p>
<p>After this, lest any one should say, “Here thou givest no redress, nor stoppest men’s
mouths; and dost thou assign a reward there?” He hath put before us the prophets, to show
that neither in their case did God give redress. And if, where the rewards were at hand, He
cheered them with things to come; much more now, when this hope is become clearer, and
self-denial is increased.</p>
<p>And observe too, after how many commandments He hath put this, for surely He did
it not without reason, but to show that it is not possible for one unprovided, and unarmed
with all those other virtues, to go forth unto these conflicts. Therefore, you see, in each instance,
by the former precept making way for the following one, He hath woven a sort of
golden chain for us. Thus, first, he that is “humble,” will surely also “mourn” for his own
sins: he that so “mourns,” will be both “meek,” and “righteous,” and “merciful;” he that is
“merciful,” and “righteous,” and “contrite” will of course be also “pure in heart:” and such
a one will be “a peacemaker” too: and he that hath attained unto all these, will be moreover
arrayed against dangers, and will not be troubled when evil is spoken of him, and he is enduring
grievous trials innumerable.</p>
<p>10. Now then, after giving them due exhortation, He refreshes them again with praises.
As thus: the injunctions being high, and far surpassing those in the Old Testament; lest they
should be disturbed and confounded, and say, “How shall we be able to achieve these things?”
hear what He saith: “Ye are the salt of the earth.”631 Implying, that of absolute necessity He
enjoins all this. For “not for your own life apart,” saith He, “but for the whole world, shall
your account be. For not to two cities, nor to ten or twenty, nor to a single nation am I
sending you, as I sent the prophets; but to earth, and sea, and the whole world; and that in
evil case.” For by saying, “Ye are the salt of the earth,” He signified all human nature to have
“lost its savor,”632and to be decayed by our sins. For which cause, you see, He requires of
them such virtues, as are most necessary and useful for the superintendence of the common
sort. For first, the meek, and yielding, and merciful, and righteous, shuts not up his good
deeds unto himself only, but also provides that these good fountains should run over for
the benefit of others. And he again who is pure in heart, and a peacemaker, and is persecuted

being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions.” The text of the Homily omits “both.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">631 Matt. v. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">632 μωραι?eῖσαν.</note>

<pb n="180"/>
for the truth’s sake; he again orders his way of life for the common good. “Think not then,”
He saith, “that ye are drawn on to ordinary conflicts, or that for some small matters you are
to give account.” “Ye are the salt of the earth.”</p>
<p>What then? did they restore the decayed? By no means; for neither is it possible to do
any good to that which is already spoilt, by sprinkling it with salt. This therefore they did
not. But rather, what things had been before restored, and committed to their charge, and
freed from that ill savor, these they then salted, maintaining and preserving them in that
freshness,633which they had received of the Lord. For that men should be set free from the
rottenness of their sins was the good work of Christ; but their not returning to it again any
more was the object of these men’s diligence and travail.</p>
<p>Seest thou how by degrees He indicates their superiority to the very prophets? in that
He saith they are teachers, not of Palestine, but of the whole world; and not simply teachers,
but awful ones too. For this is the marvellous thing, that not by flattering, nor soothing, but
by sharply bracing634them, as salt, even so they became dear to all men.</p>
<p>“Now marvel not,” saith He, “if leaving all others, I discourse to you, and draw you on
to so great dangers. For consider over how many cities, tribes, and nations, I am to send
you to preside. Wherefore I would have you not only be prudent yourselves, but that you
should also make others the same. And such persons have great need to be intelligent, in
whom the salvation of the rest is at stake: they ought so much to abound in virtue, as to
impart of the profit to others also. For if ye do not become such as this, ye will not suffice
even for your own selves.</p>
<p>“Be not then impatient, as though my sayings were too burdensome. For while it is
possible for others who have lost their savor to return by your means, you, if you should
come to this, will with yourselves destroy others also. So that in proportion as the matters
are great, which ye have put into your hands, you need so much the greater diligence.”
Therefore He saith,</p>
<p>“But if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”635</p>
<p>For other men, though they fall never so often, may possibly obtain indulgence: but the
teacher, should this happen to him, is deprived of all excuse, and will suffer the most extreme
vengeance. Thus, lest at the words, “When they shall revile you, and persecute you, and say
all manner of evil against you,” they should be too timid to go forth: He tells them, “unless
ye are prepared to combat with all this, ye have been chosen in vain.” For it is not evil report
that ye should fear, but lest ye should prove partners in dissimulation.636 For then, “Ye will

<pb n="181"/>
lose your savor, and be trodden under foot:” but if ye continue sharply to brace them up,
and then are evil spoken of, rejoice; for this is the very use of salt, to sting the corrupt,637and
make them smart. And so their censure follows of course, in no way harming you, but rather
testifying your firmness. But if through fear of it you give up the earnestness that becomes
you, ye will have to suffer much more grievously, being both evil spoken of, and despised
by all. For this is the meaning of “trodden under foot.”</p>
<p>11. After this He leads on to another, a higher image.</p>
<p>“Ye are the light of the world.”638</p>
<p>“Of the world” again; not of one nation, nor of twenty states,639but of the whole inhabited
earth. And “a light” to the mind, far better than this sunbeam: like as they were also a spir-
itual salt. And before they are salt, and now light; to teach thee how great is the gain of these
strict640precepts, and the profit of that grave discipline: how it binds, and permits not to
become dissolute; and causes clear sight, leading men on to virtue.</p>
<p>“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle, and put it under
the bushel.”641</p>
<p>Again, by these words He trains them to strictness of life, teaching them to be earnest
in their endeavors, as set before the eyes of all men, and contending in the midst of the
amphitheatre of the world. For, “look not to this,” He saith, “that we are now sitting here,
that we are in a small portion of one corner. For ye shall be as conspicuous to all as a city
set on the ridge of a hill, as a candle in a house on the candlestick, giving light.”642</p>
<p>Where now are they who persevere in disbelieving the power of Christ? Let them hear
these things, and let them adore His might, amazed at the power of the prophecy. For consider
how great things he promised to them, who were not known even in their own country:
that earth and sea should know them, and that they should by their fame reach to the limits
of the inhabited world; or rather, not by their fame, but by the working of the good they
wrought. For it was not fame that bearing them everywhere made them conspicuous, but
also the actual demonstration by their works. Since, as though they had wings, more vehemently
than the sunbeam did they overrun the whole earth, sowing the light of godliness.643</p>
<p>But here He seems to me to be also training them to boldness of speech. For to say, “A
city set on a hill cannot be hid,” is to speak as declaring His own powers.644 For as that city

<pb n="182"/>
can by no means be hidden, so it was impossible that what they preached should sink into
silence and obscurity. Thus, since He had spoken of persecutions and calumnies, of plots
and wars, for fear they might think that these would have power to stop their mouths; to
encourage them, He saith, that so far from being hid, it should over-shine the whole world;
and that on this very account they should be illustrious and renowned.</p>
<p>By this then He declares His own power. In what follows, He requires that boldness of
speech which was due on their part; thus saying,</p>
<p>“Neither do men light a candle and put it under the bushel, but on the candlestick, and
it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.”645</p>
<p>“For I,” saith He, “it is true, have kindled the light, but its continuing to burn, let that
come of your diligence: not for your own sakes alone, but also for their sake, who are to
profit by these rays, and to be guided unto the truth. Since the calumnies surely shall not
be able to obscure your brightness, if you be still living a strict life, and as becomes those
who are to convert the whole world. Show forth therefore a life worthy of His grace; that
even as it is everywhere preached, so this light may everywhere accompany the same.</p>
<p>Next He sets before them another sort of gain, besides the salvation of mankind, enough
to make them strive earnestly, and to lead them unto all diligence. As thus, “Ye shall not
only,” saith He, “amend the world, if ye live aright, but ye will also give occasion that God
shall be glorified; even as if ye do the contrary, ye will both destroy men, and make God’s
name to be blasphemed.”</p>
<p>And how, it may be asked, shall God be glorified through us, if at least men are to speak
evil of us? Nay, not all men, and even they themselves who in envy do this, will in their
conscience admire and approve you; even as the outward flatterers of such as live in
wickedness do in mind accuse them.</p>
<p>What then? Dost thou command us to live for display and vain glory? Far from it; I say
not this; for I did not say, “Give ye diligence to bring forward your own good deeds,” neither
did I say, “Show them;” but “Let your light shine.” That is, “Let your virtue be great, and
the fire abundant, and the light unspeakable.” For when virtue is so great, it cannot lie hid,
though its pursuer shade it over ten thousand fold. Present unto them an irreprehensible
life, and let them have no true occasion of evil speaking; and then, though there be thousands
of evil-speakers, no man shall be able to cast any shade upon you. And well did He say,
“your light,” for nothing makes a man so illustrious, how manifold soever his will to be
concealed, as the manifestation of virtue. For as if he were clad with the very sunbeam, so
<note type="footnote">645 Matt. v. 15, 16. [R.V., “Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it
shineth unto all that are in the house. Even so let your light shine,” etc.—R.]</note>

<pb n="183"/>
he shines, yet brighter than it; not spending his rays on earth, but surmounting also Heaven
itself.</p>
<p>Hence also He comforts them more abundantly. For, “What though the slander pain
you,” saith He; “yet shall ye have many to honor God on your account. And in both ways
your recompence is gathering, as well because God is glorified through you, as because ye
are defamed for God’s sake. Thus, lest we should on purpose seek to be reproached, on
hearing that there is a reward for it: first, He hath not expressed that sentiment simply, but
with two limitations, namely, when what is said is false, and when it is for God’s sake:—and
next He signifies how not that only, but also good report, hath its great profit, the glory of
it passing on to God. And He holds out to them those gracious hopes. “For,” saith He, “the
calumny of the wicked avails not so much as to put all others in the dark, in respect of seeing
your light. For then only when you have “lost your savor” shall they tread you under foot;
but not when you are falsely accused, doing right. Yea, rather then shall there be many admiring,
not you only, but for your sake your Father also.” And He said not “God,” but “your
Father;” already sowing beforehand the seeds of that noble birth, which was about to be
bestowed upon them. Moreover, indicating His parity in honor, as He said above, “Grieve
not when ye are evil spoken of, for it is enough for you that for my sake you are thus spoken
of;” so here He mentions the Father: every where manifesting His equality.</p>
<p>12. Since then we know the gain that arises from this earnestness, and the danger of
indolence (for if our Lord be blasphemed because of us, that were far worse than our perdition),
let us “give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church
of God.”646 And while the life which we present before them is brighter than the sun, yet if
any one will speak evil of us, let us not grieve at being defamed, but only if we be defamed
with justice.</p>
<p>For, on the one hand, if we live in wickedness, though there be none to speak ill of us,
we shall be the most wretched of all men: on the other hand, if we apply ourselves to virtue,
though the whole world speak evil of us, at that very time we shall be more enviable than
any. And we shall draw on to follow us all who choose to be saved, for not the calumny of
the wicked, but our good life, will draw their attention. For indeed no trumpet is so clear as
the proof that is given by our actions: neither is the light itself so transparent as a pure life,
though our calumniators be beyond number.</p>
<p>I say, if all the above-mentioned qualities be ours; if we be meek and lowly and merciful;
if we be pure, and peacemakers; if hearing reproach, we revile not again, but rather rejoice;
then shall we attract all that observe us no less than the miracles do. And all will be kindly
disposed towards us, though one be a wild beast, a demon, or what you will.</p>
<note type="footnote">646 1 Cor. x. 32.</note>

<pb n="184"/>
<p>Or if there should even be some who speak evil of thee, be not thou at all troubled
thereat, nor because they revile thee in public, regard it; but search into their conscience,
and thou shalt see them applauding and admiring thee, and numbering up ten thousand
praises.</p>
<p>See, for instance, how Nebuchadnezzar praises the children in the furnace; yet surely
he was an adversary and an enemy. But upon seeing them stand nobly, he proclaims their
triumph, and crowns them: and that for nought else, but because they disobeyed him, and
hearkened unto the law of God. For the devil, when he sees himself effecting nothing, from
that time departs, fearing lest he should be the cause of our winning more crowns. And
when he is gone, even one who is abominable and depraved will recognize virtue, that mist
being withdrawn. Or if men still argue perversely, thou shalt have from God the greater
praise and admiration.</p>
<p>Grieve not now, I pray thee, neither despond; since the very apostles were to some a
“savor of death;”647to others, a “savor of life.” And if there be nothing to lay hold of in thyself,
thou art rid of all their charges; or rather, thou art become the more blessed. Shine out
therefore in thy life, and take no account of them who speak evil of thee. For it cannot, it
cannot be, that one careful of virtue, should not have many enemies. However, this is
nothing to the virtuous man. For by such means his brightness will increase the more
abundantly.</p>
<p>Let us then, bearing these things in mind, look to one object only; how to order our own
life with strictness. For thus we shall also guide to the life that is there, such as are now sitting
in darkness. For such is the virtue of that light, as not only to shine here, but also to conduct
its followers thither. For when men see us despising all things present, and preparing
ourselves for that which is to come, our actions will persuade them sooner than any discourse.
For who is there so senseless, that at sight of one, who within a day or two was living in
luxury and wealth, now stripping himself of all, and putting on wings, and arrayed to meet
both hunger and poverty, and all hardship, and dangers, and blood, and slaughter, and
everything that is counted dreadful; will not from this sight derive a clear demonstration of
the things which are to come?</p>
<p>But if we entangle ourselves in things present, and plunge ourselves in them more and
more, how will it be possible for them to be persuaded that we are hastening to another sojourn?</p>
<p>And what excuse after this shall we have, if the fear of God avail not so much with us,
as human glory availed with the Greek philosophers? For some of them did really both lay
aside wealth, and despised death, that they might make a show before men; wherefore also
<note type="footnote">647 1 Cor. ii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">648 ἀποδημαν.</note>

<pb n="185"/>
their hopes became vain. What plea then shall deliver us, when with so great things set before
us, and with so high a rule of self-denial laid open to us, we are not able even to do as they
did, but ruin both ourselves and others besides? For neither is the harm so great when a
heathen commits transgression, as when a Christian doeth the same. Of course not; for their
character is already lost, but ours, by reason of the grace of God, is even among the ungodly
venerable and glorious. Therefore when they would most revile us, and aggravate their evil
speech, they add some such taunt as, “Thou Christian:” a taunt which they would not utter,
did they not secretly entertain a great opinion of our doctrine.</p>
<p>Hast thou not heard how many, and how great precepts Christ enjoined? Now when
wilt thou be able to fulfill one of those commandments, while thou leavest all, and goest
about gathering interest, tacking together usuries, setting on foot transactions of business,
buying herds of slaves, procuring silver vessels, purchasing houses, fields, goods without
end? And I would this were all. But when to these unseasonable pursuits, thou addest even
injustice, removing landmarks,649taking away houses by violence, aggravating poverty, increasing
hunger, when wilt thou be able to set thy foot on these thresholds?</p>
<p>13. But sometimes thou showest mercy to the poor. I know it as well as thou. But even
in this again great is the mischief. For thou doest this either in pride or in vainglory, so as
not to profit even by thy good deeds. What can be more wretched than this, to be making
thy shipwreck in the very harbor? To prevent this, when thou hast done any good action,
seek not thanks from me, that thou mayest have God thy debtor. For, “Lend,” saith He,
“unto them from whom ye do not expect to receive.”650</p>
<p>Thou hast thy Debtor; why leave Him, and require it of me, a poor and wretched mortal?
What? is that Debtor displeased, when the debt is required of Him? What? is He poor? Is
He unwilling to pay? Seest thou not His unspeakable treasures? Seest thou not His indescribable
munificence? Lay hold then on Him, and make thy demand; for He is pleased when
one thus demands the debt of Him. Because, if He see another required to pay for what He
Himself owes, He will feel as though He were insulted, and repay thee no more; nay, He
justly finds fault, saying, “Why, of what ingratitude hast thou convicted me? what poverty
dost thou know to be in me, that thou hastenest by me, and resortest unto others? Hast thou
lent to One, and dost thou demand the debt of another?”</p>
<p>For although man received it, it was God that commanded thee to bestow; and His will
is to be Himself, and in the original sense,651debtor, and surety, affording thee ten thousand

occasion to demand the debt of Him from every quarter. Do not thou then let go so great
facility and abundance, and seek to receive of me who have nothing. Why, to what end dost
thou display to me thy mercy shown to the poor. What! was it I that said to thee, Give? was
it from me that thou didst hear this; that thou shouldest demand it back of me? He Himself
hath said, “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth to God.”652 Thou hast lent to God:653put
it to His account.</p>
<p>“But He doth not repay the whole now.” Well, this too He doth for thy good. For such
a debtor is He: not as many, who are anxious simply to repay that which is lent; whereas He
manages and doeth all things, with a view of investing likewise in security that which hath
been given unto Him. Therefore some, you see, He repays here: some He assigns654in the
other place.</p>
<p>14. Knowing therefore as we do these things, let us make our mercifulness abundant,
let us give proof of much love to man, both by the use of our money, and by our actions.
And if we see any one ill-treated and beaten in the market-place, whether we can pay down
money, let us do it: or whether by words we may separate them, let us not be backward. For
even a word has its re ward, and still more have sighs. And this the blessed Job said; “But I
wept for every helpless one, and I sighed when I saw a man in distress.”655 But if there be a
reward for tears and sighs; when words also, and an anxious endeavor, and many things
besides are added, consider how great the recompence becomes. Yea, for we too were enemies
to God, and the Only-begotten reconciled us, casting himself between, and for us receiving
stripes, and for us enduring death.</p>
<p>Let us then likewise do our diligence to deliver from countless evils such as are incurring
them; and not as we now do, when we see any beating and tearing one another: we are apt
to stand by, finding pleasure in the disgrace of others, and forming a devilish amphitheatre
around: than which what can be more cruel? Thou seest men reviled, tearing each other to
pieces, rending their clothes, smiting each other’s faces, and dost thou endure to stand by
quietly?</p>
<p>What! is it a bear that is fighting? a wild beast? a serpent? It is a man, one who hath in
every respect fellowship with thee: a brother, a member.656 Look not on, but separate them.
Take no pleasure, but amend the evil. Stir not up others to the shameful sight, but rather
drive off and separate those who are assembled. It is for shameless persons, and born

slaves,657to take pleasure in such calamities; for those that are mere refuse, for asses without
reason.</p>
<p>Thou seest a man behaving himself unseemly, and dost thou not account the unseemliness
thine own? Dost thou not interpose, and scatter the devil’s troop, and put an end to
men’s miseries?</p>
<p>“That I may receive blows myself,” saith one; “is this also thy bidding?” Thou wilt not
have to suffer even this; but if thou shouldest, the thing would be to thee a sort of martyrdom;
for thou didst suffer on God’s behalf. And if thou art slow to receive blows, consider that
thy Lord was not slow to endure the cross for thee.</p>
<p>Since they for their part are drunken in darkness; wrath being their tyrant and commander;
and they need some one who is sound to help them, both the wrong-doer, and he who
is injured; the one that he may be delivered from suffering evil, the other that he may cease
to do it. Draw nigh, therefore, and stretch forth the hand, thou that art sober to him that is
drunken. For there is a drunkenness of wrath too, and that more grievous than the drunkenness
of wine.</p>
<p>Seest thou not the seamen, how, when they see any meeting with shipwreck, they spread
their sails, and set out with all haste, to rescue those of the same craft out of the waves? Now,
if partakers in an art show so much care one for another, how much more ought they who
are partakers of the same nature to do all these things! Because in truth here too is a shipwreck,
a more grievous one than that; for either a man under provocation blasphemes, and
so throws all away: or he forswears himself under the sway of his wrath, and that way falls
into hell: or he strikes a blow and commits murder, and thus again suffers the very same
shipwreck. Go thou then, and put a stop to the evil; pull out them that are drowning, though
thou descend into the very depth of the surge; and having broken up the theatre of the
devil, take each one of them apart, and admonish him to quell the flame, and to lull the
waves.</p>
<p>But if the burning pile wax greater, and the furnace more grievous, be not thou terrified;
for thou hast many to help thee, and stretch forth the hand, if thou furnish but a beginning;
and above all thou surely hast with thee the God of peace. And if thou wilt first turn aside
the flames, many others also will follow, and of what they do well, thou wilt thyself receive
the reward.</p>
<p>Hear what precept Christ gave to the Jews, creeping as they did upon the earth: “If thou
see,” saith He, “thine enemy’s beast of burden falling down, do not hasten by, but raise it.”658
And thou must see that to separate and reconcile men that are fighting is a much lighter

thing than to lift up the fallen beast. And if we ought to help in raising our enemies’ ass,
much more our friends’ souls: and most when the fall is more grievous; for not into mire
do these fall, but into the fire of hell, not bearing the burden of their wrath. And thou, when
thou seest thy brother lying under the load, and the devil standing by, and kindling the pile,
thou runnest by, cruelly and unmercifully; a kind of thing not safe to do, even where brutes
are concerned.</p>
<p>And whereas the Samaritan, seeing a wounded man, unknown, and not at all appertaining
to him, both staid, and set him on a beast, and brought him home to the inn, and hired a
physician, and gave some money, and promised more: thou, seeing one fallen not among
thieves, but amongst a band of demons, and beset by anger; and this not in a wilderness,
but in the midst of the forum; not having to lay out money, nor to hire a beast, nor to bring
him on a long way, but only to say some words:—art thou slow to do it? and holdest back,
and hurriest by cruelly and unmercifully? And how thinkest thou, calling upon God, ever
to find Him propitious?</p>
<p>15. But let me speak also to you, who publicly disgrace yourselves: to him who is acting
despitefully, and doing wrong. Art thou inflicting blows? tell me; and kicking, and biting?
art thou become a wild boar, and a wild ass? and art thou not ashamed? dost thou not blush
at thus being changed into a wild beast, and betraying thine own nobleness? For though
thou be poor, thou art free; though thou be a working man, thou art a Christian.</p>
<p>Nay, for this very reason, that thou art poor, thou shouldest be quiet. For fightings belong
to the rich, not to the poor; to the rich, who have many causes to force them to war. But
thou, not having the pleasure of wealth, goest about gathering to thyself the evils of wealth,
enmities, and strifes, and fightings; and takest thy brother by the throat, and goest about to
strangle him, and throwest him down publicly in the sight of all men: and dost thou not
think that thou art thyself rather disgraced, imitating the violent passions of the brutes; nay
rather, becoming even worse than they? For they have all things in common; they herd one
with another, and go about together: but we have nothing in common, but all in confusion:
fightings, strifes, revilings, and enmities, and insults. And we neither reverence the heaven,
unto which we are called all of us in common; nor the earth, which He hath left free to us
all in common; nor our very nature; but wrath and the love of money sweeps all away.</p>
<p>Hast thou not seen him who owed the ten thousand talents, and then, after he was forgiven
that debt, took his fellow-servant by the throat for an hundred pence, what great evils
he underwent, and how he was delivered over to an endless punishment? Hast thou not
trembled at the example? Hast thou no fear, lest thou too incur the same? For we likewise
owe to our Lord many and great debts: nevertheless, He forbears, and suffers long, and
neither urges us, as we do our fellow-servants, nor chokes and takes us by the throat; yet
surely had he been minded to exact of us but the least part thereof, we had long ago perished.</p>

<pb n="189"/>
<p>16. Let us then, beloved, bearing these things in mind, be humbled, and feel thankful
to those who are in debt to us. For they become to us, if we command ourselves, an occasion
of obtaining most abundant pardon; and giving a little, we shall receive much. Why then
exact with violence, it being meet, though the other were minded to pay, for thee of thine
accord to excuse him, that thou mayest receive the whole of God? But now thou doest all
things, and art violent, and contentious,659to have none of thy debts forgiven thee; and
whilst thou art thinking to do despite unto thy neighbor, thou art thrusting the sword into
thyself, so increasing thy punishment in hell: whereas if thou wilt show a little self-command
here, thou makest thine own accounts easy. For indeed God therefore wills us to take the
lead in that kind of bounty, that He may take occasion to repay us with increase.</p>
<p>As many therefore as stand indebted to thee, either for money, or for trespasses, let
them all go free, and require of God the recompense of such thy magnanimity. For so long
as they continue indebted to thee, thou canst not have God thy debtor. But if thou let them
go free, thou wilt be able to detain thy God, and to require of Him the recompense of so
great self-restraint in bountiful measure. For suppose a man had come up and seeing thee
arresting thy debtor, had called upon thee to let him go free, and transfer to himself thy account
with the other: he would not choose to be unfair660after such remission, seeing he
had passed the whole demand to himself: how then shall God fail to repay us manifold, yea,
ten thousand fold, when for His commandment’s sake, if any be indebted to us, we urge no
complaint against them, great or small, but let them go exempt from all liability? Let us not
then think of the temporary pleasure that springs up in us by exacting of our debtors, but
of the loss, rather, how great! which we shall thereby sustain hereafter, grievously injuring
ourselves in the things which are eternal. Rising accordingly above all, let us forgive those
who must give account to us, both their debts and their offenses; that we may make our own
accounts prove indulgent, and that what we could not reach by all virtue besides, this we
may obtain by not bearing malice against our neighbors; and thus enjoy the eternal blessings,
by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might
now and always, even forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XVI.</head>
<p>Matt. V. 17.</p>
<p>“Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets.”</p>
<p>Why, who suspected this? or who accused Him, that He should make a defense against
this charge? Since surely from what had gone before661no such suspicion was generated.
For to command men to be meek, and gentle, and merciful, and pure in heart, and to strive
for righteousness, indicated no such design, but rather altogether the contrary.</p>
<p>Wherefore then can He have said this? Not at random, nor vainly: but inasmuch as He
was proceeding to ordain commandments greater than those of old, saying, “It was said to
them of old time, Thou shalt not kill;662but I say unto you, Be not even angry;” and to mark
out a way for a kind of divine and heavenly conversation;663in order that the strangeness
thereof might not disturb the souls of the hearers, nor dispose them quite to mutiny against
what He said He used this means of setting them right beforehand.</p>
<p>For although they fulfilled not the law, yet nevertheless they were possessed with much
conscientious regard to it; and whilst they were annulling it every day by their deeds, the
letters thereof they would have remain unmoved, and that no one should add anything more
to them. Or rather, they bore with their rulers adding thereto, not however for the better,
but for the worse. For so they used to set aside the honor due to our parents by additions
of their own, and very many others also of the matters enjoined them, they would free
themselves of664by these unseasonable additions.</p>
<p>Therefore, since Christ in the first place was not of the sacredotal tribe, and next, the
things which He was about to introduce were a sort of addition, not however lessening, but
enhancing virtue; He knowing beforehand that both these circumstances would trouble
them, before He wrote in their mind those wondrous laws, casts out that which was sure to
be harboring there. And what was it that was harboring there, and making an obstacle?</p>
<p>2. They thought that He, thus speaking, did so with a view to the abrogation of the ancient
institutions. This suspicion therefore He heals; nor here only doth He so, but elsewhere also
again. Thus, since they accounted Him no less than an adversary of God, from this sort of
reason, namely, His not keeping the sabbath; He, to heal such their suspicion, there also
again sets forth His pleas, of which some indeed were proper to Himself; as when He saith,
“My Father worketh, and I work;”665but some had in them much condescension, as when
<note type="footnote">661 [τν ερημνων.]</note>

<pb n="191"/>
He brings forward the sheep lost on the sabbath day,666and points out that the law is disturbed
for its preservation, and makes mention again of circumcision, as having this same
effect.667</p>
<p>Wherefore we see also that He often speaks words somewhat beneath Him, to remove
the semblance of His being an adversary of God.</p>
<p>For this cause He who had raised thousands of the dead with a word only, when He was
calling Lazarus, added also a prayer; and then, lest this should make Him appear less than
Him that begat Him, He, to correct this suspicion, added, “I said these things, because of
the people which standeth by, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.”668 And neither
doth He work all things as one who acted by His own power, that He might thoroughly
correct their weakness; nor doth He all things with prayer, lest He should leave matter of
evil suspicion to them that should follow, as though He were without strength or power:
but He mingles the latter with the former, and those again with these. Neither doth He this
indiscriminately, but with His own proper wisdom. For while He doeth the greater works
authoritatively, in the less He looks up unto Heaven. Thus, when absolving sins, and revealing
His secrets, and opening Paradise, and driving away devils, and cleansing lepers, and bridling
death, and raising the dead by thousands, He did all by way of command: but when, what
was much less than these, He was causing many loaves to spring forth out of few, then He
looked up to Heaven: signifying that not through weakness He doth this. For He who could
do the greater with authority, how in the lesser could He need prayer? But as I was saying,
He doeth this to silence their shamelessness. The same reckoning, then, I bid thee make of
His words also, when thou hearest Him speak lowly things. For many in truth are the causes
both for words and for actions of that cast: as, for instance, that He might not be supposed
alien from God; His instructing and waiting on all men; His teaching humility; His being
encompassed with flesh; the Jews’ inability to hear all at once; His teaching us to utter no
high word of ourselves. For this cause many times, having in His own person said much
that is lowly of Himself, the great things He leaves to be said by others. Thus He Himself
indeed, reasoning with the Jews, said, “Before Abraham was, I Am:”669but His disciple not
thus, but, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.”670</p>
<note type="footnote">666 Matt. xii. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">667 John vii. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">668 John xi. 42. [“These things” does not occur in the New Testament passage, but is inserted here to complete
the sense. Comp. R.V., “but because of the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe that
thou didst send me.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">669 John viii. 58.</note>
<note type="footnote">670 John i. 1.</note>

<pb n="192"/>
<p>Again, that He Himself made Heaven, and earth, and sea, and all things visible and invisible,
in His own person He nowhere expressly said: but His disciple, speaking plainly out,
and suppressing nothing, affirms this once, twice, yea often: writing that “all things were
made by Him;” and, “without Him was not one thing made;” and, He was in the world, and
the world was made by Him.”671</p>
<p>And why marvel, if others have said greater things of Him than He of Himself; since
(what is more) in many cases, what He showed forth by His deeds, by His words He uttered
not openly? Thus that it was Himself who made mankind He showed clearly even by that
blind man; but when He was speaking of our formation at the beginning, He said not, “I
made,” but “He who made them, made them male and female.”672 Again, that He created
the world and all things therein, He demonstrated by the fishes, by the wine, by the loaves,
by the calm in the sea, by the sunbeam which He averted on the Cross; and by very many
things besides: but in words He hath nowhere said this plainly, though His disciples are
continually declaring it, both John, and Paul, and Peter.</p>
<p>For if they who night and day hear Him discourse, and see Him work marvels; to whom
He explained many things in private, and gave so great power as even to raise the dead;
whom He made so perfect, as to forsake all things for Him: if even they, after so great virtue
and self-denial, had not strength to bear it all, before the supply of the Spirit; how could the
people of the Jews, being both void of understanding, and far behind such excellency, and
only by hazard present when He did or said anything, how could they have been persuaded
but that He was alien from the God of all, unless he had practised such great condescension
throughout?</p>
<p>For on this account we see that even when He was abrogating the sabbath, He did not
as of set purpose bring in such His legislation, but He puts together many and various pleas
of defense. Now if, when He was about to cause one commandment to cease, He used so
much reserve in His language,673that He might not startle the hearers; much more, when
adding to the law, entire as it was, another entire code of laws, did He require much management
and attention, not to alarm those who were then hearing Him.</p>
<p>For this same cause, neither do we find Him teaching everywhere clearly concerning
His own Godhead. For if His adding to the law was sure to perplex them so greatly, much
more His declaring Himself God.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore many things are uttered by Him, far below His proper dignity, and here
when He is about to proceed upon His addition to the law, He hath used abundance for
correction beforehand. For neither was it once only that He said, “I do not abrogate the
<note type="footnote">671 John i. 3, 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">672 Matt. xix. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">673 λγων οκονομ.</note>

<pb n="193"/>
law,” but He both repeated it again, and added another and a greater thing; in that, to the
words, “Think not that I am come to destroy,” He subjoined, “I am not come to destroy,
but to fulfill.”</p>
<p>Now this not only obstructs the obstinacy of the Jews, but stops also the mouths of those
heretics,674who say that the old covenant is of the devil. For if Christ came to destroy his
tyranny, how is this covenant not only not destroyed, but even fulfilled by Him? For He
said not only, “I do not destroy it;” though this had been enough; but “I even fulfill it:” which
are the words of one so far from opposing himself, as to be even establishing it.</p>
<p>And how, one may ask, did He not destroy it? in what way did He rather fulfill either
the law or the prophets? The prophets He fulfilled, inasmuch as He confirmed by His actions
all that had been said concerning Him; wherefore also the evangelist used to say in each
case, “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet.” Both when He was
born,675and when the children sung that wondrous hymn to Him, and when He sat on the
ass,676and in very many more instances He worked this same fulfillment: all which things
must have been unfulfilled, if He had not come.</p>
<p>But the law He fulfilled, not in one way only, but in a second and third also. In one way,
by transgressing none of the precepts of the law. For that He did fulfill it all, hear what He
saith to John, “For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”677 And to the Jews also
He said, “Which of you convinceth me of sin.”678 And to His disciples again, “The prince
of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me.”679 And the prophet too from the first
had said that “He did no sin.”680</p>
<p>This then was one sense in which He fulfilled it. Another, that He did the same through
us also; for this is the marvel, that He not only Himself fulfilled it, but He granted this to us
likewise. Which thing Paul also declaring said, “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
to every one that believeth.”681 And he said also, that “He judged sin in the flesh, that the
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh.”682 And again,
“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid! yea, we establish the law.”683

<pb n="194"/>
For since the law was laboring at this, to make man righteous, but had not power, He came
and brought in the way of righteousness by faith, and so established that which the law desired:
and what the law could not by letters, this He accomplished by faith. On this account
He saith, “I am not come to destroy the law.”</p>
<p>4. But if any one will inquire accurately, he will find also another, a third sense, in which
this hath been done. Of what sort is it then? In the sense of that future code of laws, which
He was about to deliver to them.</p>
<p>For His sayings were no repeal of the former, but a drawing out, and filling up of them.
Thus, “not to kill,” is not annulled by the saying, Be not angry, but rather is filled up and
put in greater security: and so of all the others.</p>
<p>Wherefore, you see, as He had before unsuspectedly cast the seeds of this teaching; so
at the time when from His comparison of the old and new commandments, He would be
more distinctly suspected of placing them in opposition, He used His corrective beforehand.
For in a covert way He had indeed already scattered those seeds, by what He had said. Thus,
“Blessed are the poor,” is the same as that we are not to be angry; and, “Blessed are the pure
in heart,” as not to “look upon a woman for lust;” and the “not laying up treasures on earth,”
harmonizes with, “Blessed are the merciful;” and “to mourn” also, “to be persecuted” and
“reviled,” coincide with “entering in at the strait gate;” and, “to hunger and thirst after
righteousness,” is nothing else than that which He saith afterwards, “Whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye also to them.” And having declared “the peace-maker
blessed,” He again almost said the same, when He gave command “to leave the gift,” and
hasten to reconciliation with him that was grieved, and about “agreeing with our adversary.”</p>
<p>But there He set down the rewards of them that do right, here rather the punishments
of them who neglect practice.684 Wherefore as in that place He said, “The meek shall inherit
earth;” so here, “He who calleth his brother fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire;” and there,
“The pure in heart shall see God;” here, he is a complete adulterer who looks unchastely.
And having there called “the peace-makers, sons of God;” here He alarms us from another
quarter, saying, “Lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge.” Thus also,
whereas in the former part He blesses them that mourn, and them that are persecuted; in
the following, establishing the very same point, He threatens destruction to them that go
not that way; for, “They that walk ‘in the broad way,’ saith He, ‘make their end there.’” And,
“Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” seems to me the same with, “Blessed are the merciful,”
and, “those that hunger after righteousness.”</p>
<p>But as I said, since He is going to say these things more clearly, and not only more
clearly, but also to add again more than had been already said (for He no longer merely
seeks a merciful man, but bids us give up even our coat; not simply a meek person, but to
<note type="footnote">684 [τν μ ποισυτων.]</note>

<pb n="195"/>
turn also the other cheek to him that would smite us): therefore He first takes away the apparent
contradiction.</p>
<p>On this account, then, as I have already stated, He said this not once only, but once and
again; in that to the words, “Think not that I am come to destroy,” He added, “I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfill.”</p>
<p>“For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass from the law, till all come to pass.”685</p>
<p>Now what He saith is like this: it cannot be that it should remain unaccomplished, but
the very least thing therein must needs be fulfilled. Which thing He Himself performed, in
that He completed686it with all exactness.</p>
<p>And here He signifies to us obscurely that the fashion of the whole world is also being
changed. Nor did He set it down without purpose, but in order to arouse the hearer, and
indicate, that He was with just cause introducing another discipline; if at least the very works
of the creation are all to be transformed, and mankind is to be called to another country,
and to a higher way of practising how to live.687</p>
<p>5. “Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach
men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven.”688</p>
<p>Thus, having rid Himself of the evil suspicion, and having stopped the mouths of them
who would fain gainsay, then at length He proceeds to alarm, and sets down a heavy, denunciation
in support of the enactments He was entering on.</p>
<p>For as to His having said this in behalf not of the ancient laws, but of those which He
was proceeding to enact, listen to what follows, “For I say unto you,” saith He, “Except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”689</p>
<p>For if He were threatening with regard to the ancient laws, how said He, “except it shall
exceed?” since they who did just the same as those ancients, could not exceed them on the
score of righteousness.</p>
<p>But of what kind was the required excess? Not to be angry, not even to look upon a
woman unchastely.</p>
<p>For what cause then doth He call these commandments “least,” though they were so
great and high? Because He Himself was about to introduce the enactment of them; for as
<note type="footnote">685 Matt. v. 18. [R.V., “Till Heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from
the law, till all things be accomplished.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="196"/>
He humbled Himself, and speaks of Himself frequently with measure, so likewise of His
own enactments, hereby again teaching us to be modest in everything. And besides, since
there seemed to be some suspicion of novelty, He ordered His discourse for a while with
reserve.690</p>
<p>But when thou hearest, “least in the kingdom of Heaven,” surmise thou nothing but
hell and torments. For He was used to mean by “the kingdom,” not merely the enjoyment
thereof, but also the time of the resurrection, and that awful coming. And how could it be
reasonable, that while he who called his brother fool, and trangressed but one commandment,
falls into hell; the breaker of them all, and instigator of others to the same, should be within
the kingdom. This therefore is not what He means, but that such a one will be at that time
least, that is, cast out, last. And he that is last will surely then fall into hell. For, being God,
He foreknew the laxity of the many, He foreknew that some would think these sayings were
merely hyperbolical, and would argue about the laws, and say, What, if any one call another
a fool, is he punished? If one merely look on a woman, doth he become an adulterer? For
this very cause He, destroying such insolence beforehand, hath set down the strongest denunciation
against either sort, as well them who transgress, as them who lead on others so
to do.</p>
<p>Knowing then His threat as we do, let us neither ourselves transgress, nor discourage
such as are disposed to keep these things.</p>
<p>“But whosoever shall do and teach,” saith He, “shall be called great.”</p>
<p>For not to ourselves alone, should we be profitable, but to others also; since neither is
the reward as great for him who guides himself aright, as for one who with himself adds
also another. For as teaching without doing condemns the teacher (for “thou which teachest
another,” it is said, “teachest thou not thyself”691?) so doing but not guiding others, lessens
our reward. One ought therefore to be chief in either work, and having first set one’s self
right, thus to proceed also to the care of the rest. For on this account He Himself hath set
the doing before the teaching; to intimate that so most of all may one be able to teach, but
in no other way. For one will be told, “Physician, heal thyself.”692 Since he who cannot teach
himself, yet attempts to set others right, will have many to ridicule him. Or rather such a
one will have no power to teach at all, his actions uttering their voice against him. But if he
be complete in both respects, “he shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p>6. “For I say unto you, Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”693</p>
<p>Here by righteousness He means the whole of virtue; even as also discoursing of Job,
He said, “He was a blameless man, righteous.”694 According to the same signification of the
word, Paul also called that man “righteous” for whom, as he said, no law is even set. “For,”
saith he, “a law is not made for a righteous man.”695 And in many other places too one
might find this name standing for virtue in general.</p>
<p>But observe, I pray thee, the increase of grace; in that He will have His newly-come
disciples better than the teachers in the old covenant. For by “Scribes and Pharisees” here,
He meant not merely the lawless, but the well-doers. For, were they not doing well, He
would not have said they have a righteousness; neither would He have compared the unreal
to the real.</p>
<p>And observe also here, how He commends the old law, by making a comparison between
it and the other; which kind of thing implies it to be of the same tribe and kindred. For more
and less, is in the same kind. He doth not, you see, find fault with the old law, but will have
it made stricter. Whereas, had it been evil,696 He would not have required more of it; He
would not have made it more perfect, but would have cast it out.</p>
<p>And how one may say, if it be such, doth it not bring us into the Kingdom? It doth not
now bring in them who live after the coming of Christ, favored as they are with more strength,
and bound to strive for greater things: since as to its own foster-children, them it doth bring
in one and all. Yea, for “many shall come,” saith He, “from east and west, and shall lie down
in the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”697 And Lazarus also receiving the great prize,
is shown dwelling in Abraham’s bosom. And all, as many as have shone forth with excellency
in the old dispensation, shone by it, every one of them. And Christ Himself, had it been in
anything evil or alien from Him, would not have fulfilled it all when He came. For if only
to attract the Jews He was doing this, and not in order to prove it akin to the new law, and
concurrent therewith; wherefore did He not also fulfill the laws and customs of the Gentiles,
that He might attract the Gentiles also?</p>
<p>So that from all considerations it is clear, that not from any badness in itself doth it fail
to bring us in, but because it is now the season of higher precepts.</p>
<p>And if it be more imperfect than the new, neither doth this imply it to be evil: since
upon this principle the new law itself will be in the very same case. Because in truth our
<note type="footnote">693 Matt. v. 20.</note>

<pb n="198"/>
knowledge of this, when compared with that which is to come, is a sort of partial and imperfect
thing, and is done away on the coming of that other. “For when,” saith He, “that which
is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away:”698even as it befell the old
law through the new. Yet we are not to blame the new law for this, though that also gives
place on our attaining unto the Kingdom: for “then,” saith He, “that which is in part shall
be done away:” but for all this we call it great.</p>
<p>Since then both the rewards thereof are greater, and the power given by the Spirit more
abundant, in reason it requires our graces to be greater also. For it is no longer “a land that
floweth with milk and honey,” nor a comfortable699old age, nor many children, nor corn
and wine, and flocks and herds: but Heaven, and the good things in the Heavens, and adoption
and brotherhood with the Only-Begotten, and to partake of the inheritance and to be
glorified and to reign with Him, and those unnumbered rewards. And as to our having received
more abundant help, hear thou Paul, when he saith, “There is therefore no condemnation
now to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit:700for the law of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sin and death.”701</p>
<p>7. And now after threatening the transgressors, and setting great rewards for them that
do right, and signifying that He justly requires of us something beyond the former measures;
He from this point begins to legislate, not simply, but by way of comparison with the ancient
ordinances, desiring to intimate these two things: first, that not as contending with the
former, but rather in great harmony with them, He is making these enactments; next, that
it was meet and very seasonable for Him to add thereto these second precepts.</p>
<p>And that this may be made yet clearer, let us hearken to the words of the Legislator.
What then doth He Himself say?
“Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill.”702</p>
<p>And yet it was Himself who gave those laws also, but so far He states them impersonally.
For if on the one hand He had said, “Ye have heard that I said to them of old,” the saying
would have been hard to receive, and would have stood in the way of all the hearers. If again,
on the other hand, after having said, “Ye have heard that it was said to them of old by my
Father,” He had added, “But I say,” He would have seemed to be taking yet more on Himself.</p>

<pb n="199"/>
<p>Wherefore He hath simply stated it, making out thereby one point only; the proof that
in fitting season He had come saying these things. For by the words, “It was said to them of
old,” He pointed out the length of the time, since they received this commandment. And
this He did to shame the hearer, shrinking from the advance to the higher class of His
commandments; as though a teacher should say to a child that was indolent, “Knowest thou
not how long a time thou hast consumed in learning syllables?” This then He also covertly
intimates by the expression, “them of old time,” and thus for the future summons them on
to the higher order of His instructions: as if He had said, “Ye are learning these lessons long
enough, and you must henceforth press on to such as are higher than these.”</p>
<p>And it is well that He doth not disturb the order of the commandments, but begins first
with that which comes earlier, with which the law also began. Yea, for this too suits with
one showing the harmony between them.</p>
<p>“But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be
in danger of the judgment.”703</p>
<p>Seest thou authority in perfection? Seest thou a bearing suited to a legislator? Why,
which among prophets ever spake on this wise? which among righteous men? which among
patriarchs? None; but, “Thus saith the Lord.” But the Son not so. Because they were publishing
their Master’s commands, He His Father’s. And when I say, “His Father’s,” I mean His
own. “For mine,” saith He, “are thine, and thine are mine.”704 And they had their fellowservants
to legislate for, He His own servants.</p>
<p>Let us now ask those who reject the law, “is, ‘Be not angry’ contrary to ‘Do no murder’?
or is not the one commandment the completion and the development of the other?” Clearly
the one is the fulfilling of the other, and that is greater on this very account. Since he who
is not stirred up to anger, will much more refrain from murder; and he who bridles wrath
will much more keep his hands to himself. For wrath is the root of murder. And you see
that He who cuts up the root will much more remove the branches; or rather, will not permit
them so much as to shoot out at all. Not therefore to abolish the law did He make these enactments,
but for the more complete observation of it. For with what design did the law
enjoin these things? Was it not, that no one might slay his neighbor? It follows, that he who
was opposing the law would have to enjoin murder. For to murder, were the contrary to
doing no murder. But if He doth not suffer one even to be angry, the mind of the law is established
by Him more completely. For he that studies to avoid murder will not refrain from
it equally with him that hath put away even anger; this latter being further removed from
the crime.</p>

What then do they affirm? They assert that the God who made the world, who “makes
His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, who sends the rain on the just and on the unjust,”
is in some sense an evil being.705 But the more moderate (forsooth) among them, though
declining this, yet while they affirm Him to be just, they deprive Him of being good. And
some other one, who is not, nor made any of the things that are, they assign for a Father to
Christ. And they say that he, who is not good, abides in his own, and preserves what are his
own; but that He, that is good, seeks what are another’s, and desires of a sudden to become
a Saviour to them whose Creator He was not.706 Seest thou the children of the devil, how
they speak out of the fountain of their father, alienating the work of creation from God:
while John cries out, “He came unto His own,” and, “The world was made by Him?”707</p>
<p>In the next place, they criticise the law in the old covenant, which bids put out “an eye
for an eye,” and “a tooth for a tooth;”708and straightway they insult and say, “Why, how
can He be good who speaks so?”</p>

become visible.” In this he agreed with the Oriental heretics generally. Marcion, his disciple, within a few years
improved on him (Hær. 42, sec. 3), “saying, that there are three principles: one, that on high, unnamed, and
unseen, which it pleases him to call the good God (this however, was not the Creator of any of the things that
are in the world): another, a visible God, Creator and Artificer: and, in the third place, the devil.…Now the

for tooth, and bruise for bruise. There is no tinge here of any permission for repaying an injury in kind, but the
whole drift of it is to restrain violence. That is, because that most stubborn and faithless people would count it
hard or even inconceivable to await God’s redress, which the prophet was afterwards to proclaim, in the words,
‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord;’ the commission of wrong during the interval was to be in a
manner smothered by the fear of immediate retribution.” [Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. III. p. 311.] St. Augustin
(contr. Adim. c. 8), says the same in reply to the Manichæans.</note>

<pb n="201"/>
<p>What then do we say in answer to this? That it is the highest kind of philanthropy. For
He made this law, not that we might strike out one another’s eyes, but that fear of suffering
by others might restrain us from doing any such thing to them. As therefore He threatened
the Ninevites with overthrow, not that He might destroy them, (for had that been His will,
He ought to have been silent), but that He might by fear make them better, and so quiet His
wrath: so also hath He appointed a punishment for those who wantonly assail the eyes of
others, that if good principle dispose them not to refrain from such cruelty, fear may restrain
them from injuring their neighbors’ sight.</p>
<p>And if this be cruelty, it is cruelty also for the murderer to be restrained, and the
adulterer checked. But these are the sayings of senseless men, and of those that are mad to
the extreme of madness. For I, so far from saying that this comes of cruelty, should say, that
the contrary to this would be unlawful, according to men’s reckoning. And whereas, thou
sayest, “Because He commanded to pluck out “an eye for an eye,” therefore He is cruel;” I
say, that if He had not given this commandment, then He would have seemed, in the judgment
of most men, to be that which thou sayest He is.</p>
<p>For let us suppose that this law had been altogether done away, and that no one feared
the punishment ensuing thereupon, but that license had been given to all the wicked to
follow their own disposition in all security, to adulterers, and to murderers,709to perjured
persons, and to parricides; would not all things have been turned upside down? would not
cities, market-places, and houses, sea and land, and the whole world, have been filled with
unnumbered pollutions and murders? Every one sees it. For if, when there are laws, and
fear, and threatening, our evil dispositions are hardly checked; were even this security taken
away, what is there to prevent men’s choosing vice? and what degree of mischief would not
then come revelling upon the whole of human life?</p>
<p>The rather, since cruelty lies not only in allowing the bad to do what they will, but in
another thing too quite as much; to overlook, and leave uncared for, him who hath done
no wrong, but who is without cause or reason suffering ill. For tell me; were any one to
gather together wicked men from all quarters, and arm them with swords, and bid them go
about the whole city, and massacre all that came in their way, could there be anything more
like a wild beast than he? And what if some other should bind, and confine with the utmost
strictness those whom that man had armed, and should snatch from those lawless hands
them, who were on the point of being butchered; could anything be greater humanity than
this?</p>
<p>Now then, I bid thee transfer these examples to the law likewise; for He that commands
to pluck out “an eye for an eye,” hath laid the fear as a kind of strong chain upon the souls
of the bad, and so resembles him, who detains those assassins in prison; whereas he who
<note type="footnote">709 [“And to thieves” should be inserted here. The omission was probably accidental.—R.]</note>

<pb n="202"/>
appoints no punishment for them, doth all but arm them by such security, and acts the part
of that other, who was putting the swords in their hands, and letting them loose over the
whole city.</p>
<p>Seest thou not, how the commandments, so far from coming of cruelty, come rather of
abounding mercy? And if on account of these thou callest the Lawgiver grievous, and hard
to bear with; tell me which sort of command is the more toilsome and grievous, “Do no
murder,” or, “Be not even angry”? Which is more in extreme, he who exacts a penalty for
murder, or for mere anger? He who subjects the adulterer to vengeance after the fact, or he
who enjoins a penalty even for the very desire, and that penalty everlasting? See ye not how
their reasoning comes round to the very contrary? how the God of the old covenant, whom
they call cruel, will be found mild and meek: and He of the new, whom they acknowledged
to be good, will be hard and grievous, according to their madness? Whereas we say, that
there is but one and the same Legislator of either covenant, who dispensed all meetly, and
adapted to the difference of the times the difference between the two systems of law.
Therefore neither are the first commandments cruel, nor the second hard and grievous, but
all of one and the same providential care.</p>
<p>For that He Himself gave the old covenant also, hear the affirmation of the prophet, or
rather (so we must speak), of Him who is both the one and the other: “I will make a covenant
with you, not according to the covenant which I made with your fathers.”710</p>
<p>But if he receive not this, who is diseased with the Manichæan doctrines,711let him hear
Paul saying the very same in another place, “For Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid,
and another by the freewoman; and these are two covenants.”712 As therefore in that
case the wives are different, the husband the same; so here too the covenants are two, the
Lawgiver one.</p>
<p>And to prove to thee that it was of one and the same mildness; in the one He saith, “An
eye for an eye,” but in this other,</p>
<p>“If one smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him
the other also.”713</p>
<p>For as in that case He checks him that doth the wrong with the fear of this suffering,
even so also in this. “How so,” it may be said, “when He bids turn to him the other cheek
also?” Nay, what of that? Since not to take away his fear did He enjoin this, but as charging
yourself to allow him to take his fill entirely. Neither did He say, that the other continues
unpunished, but, “do not thou punish;” at once both enhancing the fear of him that smiteth,
if he persist, and comforting him who is smitten.</p>

<p>9. But these things we have said, as one might say them incidentally, concerning all the
commandments. Now we must go on to that which is before us, and keep to the thread of
what had been affirmed. “He that is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger
of the judgment:” so He speaks. Thus He hath not altogether taken the thing away: first,
because it is not possible, being a man, to be freed from passions: we may indeed get the
dominion over them, but to be altogether without them is out of the question.</p>
<p>Next, because this passion is even useful, if we know how to use it at the suitable time.714
See, for instance, what great good was wrought by that anger of Paul, which he felt against
the Corinthians, on that well-known occasion; and how, as it delivered them from a grievous
pest, so by the same means again he recovered the people of the Galatians likewise, which
had fallen aside; and others too beside these. What then is the proper time for anger? When
we are not avenging ourselves, but checking others in their lawless freaks, or forcing them
to attend in their negligence.</p>
<p>And what is the unsuitable time? When we do so as avenging ourselves: which Paul also
forbidding, said “Avenge not yourselves, dearly beloved, but rather give place unto wrath.”715
When we are contending for riches: yea, for this hath he also taken away, where he saith,
“Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?”
716 For as this last sort is superfluous, so is the first necessary and profitable. But
most men do the contrary; becoming like wild beasts when they are injured themselves, but
remiss and cowardly when they see despite done to another: both which are just opposite
to the laws of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Being angry then is not a transgression, but being so unseasonably. For this cause the
prophet also said, “Be ye angry, and sin not.”717</p>
<p>10. “And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council.”</p>
<p>By the council in this place He means the tribunal of the Hebrews: and He hath mentioned
this now, on purpose that He might not seem everywhere to play the stranger and
innovator.</p>
<p>But this word, “Raca,” is not an expression of a great insolence, but rather of some
contempt and slight on the part of the speaker. For as we, giving orders either to our servants,
or to any very inferior person, say, “Away with thee; you here, tell such an one:”718so they

<pb n="204"/>
who make use of the Syrians’ language say, “Raca,” putting that word instead of “thou.” But
God, the lover of man, roots up even the least faults, commanding us to behave to one another
in seemly manner, and with due respect; and this with a view of destroying hereby
also the greater.</p>
<p>“But whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.”719</p>
<p>To many this commandment hath appeared grievous and galling, if for a mere word
we are really to pay so great a penalty. And some even say that it was spoken rather hyperbolically.
But I fear lest, when we have deceived ourselves with words here, we may in deeds
there suffer that extreme punishment.</p>
<p>For wherefore, tell me, doth the commandment seem overburdensome? Knowest thou
not that most punishments and most sins have their beginning from words? Yea, for by
words are blasphemies, and denials are by words, and revilings, and reproaches, and perjuries,
and bearing false witness.720 Regard not then its being a mere word, but whether it have
not much danger, this do thou inquire. Art thou ignorant that in the season of enmity, when
wrath is inflamed, and the soul kindled, even the least thing appears great, and what is not
very reproachful is counted intolerable? And often these little things have given birth even
to murder, and overthrown whole cities. For just as where friendship is, even grievous things
are light, so where enmity lies beneath, very trifles appear intolerable. And however simply
a word be spoken, it is surmised to have been spoken with an evil meaning. And as in fire:
if there be but a small spark, though thousands of planks lie by, it doth not easily lay hold
of them; but if the flame have waxed strong and high, it readily seizes not planks only, but
stones, and all materials that fall in its way; and by what things it is usually quenched, by
the same it is kindled the more (for some say that at such a time not only wood and tow,
and the other combustibles, but even water darted forth upon it doth but fan its power the
more); so is it also with anger; whatever any one may say, becomes food in a moment for
this evil conflagration. All which kind of evils Christ checking beforehand, had condemned
first him that is angry without a cause to the judgment, (this being the very reason why He
said, “He that is angry shall be in danger of the judgment”); then him that saith “Raca,” to
the council. But as yet these are no great things; for the punishments are here. Therefore
for him who calleth “fool” He hath added the fire of hell, now for the first time mentioning
the name of hell. For having before discoursed much of the kingdom, not until then did He
mention this; implying, that the former comes of His own love and indulgence towards
man, this latter of our negligence.</p>

<p>11. And see how He proceeds by little and little in His punishments, all but excusing
Himself unto thee, and signifying that His desire indeed is to threaten nothing of the kind,
but that we drag Him on to such denunciations. For observe: “I bade thee,” saith He, “not
be angry for nought, because thou art in danger of the judgment. Thou hast despised the
former commandment: see what anger hath produced; it hath led thee on straightway to
insult, for thou hast called thy brother ‘Raca.’ Again, I set another punishment, ‘the council.’
If thou overlook even this, and proceed to that which is more grievous, I visit thee no longer
with these finite punishments, but with the undying penalty of hell, lest after this thou
shouldest break forth721even to murder.” For there is nothing, nothing in the world more
intolerable than insolence; it is what hath very great power722to sting a man’s soul. But when
the word too which is spoken is in itself more wounding than the insolence, the blaze becomes
twice as great. Think it not then a light thing to call another “fool.” For when of that which
separates us from the brutes, and by which especially we are human beings, namely, the
mind and the understanding,—when of this thou hast robbed thy brother, thou hast deprived
him of all his nobleness.</p>
<p>Let us not then regard the words merely, but realizing the things themselves, and his
feeling, let us consider how great a wound is made by this word, and unto how much evil
it proceeds. For this cause Paul likewise cast out of the kingdom not only “the adulterous”
and “the effeminate,” but “the revilers”723also. And with great reason: for the insolent man
mars all the beauty of charity, and casts upon his neighbor unnumbered ills, and works up
lasting enmities, and tears asunder the members of Christ, and is daily driving away that
peace which God so desires: giving much vantage ground unto the devil by his injurious
ways, and making him the stronger. Therefore Christ Himself, cutting out the sinews of the
devil’s power, brought in this law.</p>
<p>For indeed He makes much account of love: this being above all things the mother of
every good, and the badge of His disciples, and the bond which holds together our whole
condition. With reason therefore doth He remove with great earnestness the roots and the
sources of that hatred which utterly spoils it.</p>
<p>Think not therefore that these sayings are in any wise hyperbolical, but consider the
good done by them, and admire the mildness of these laws. For there is nothing for which
God takes so much pains, as this; that we should be united and knit together one with an-

<pb n="206"/>
other. Therefore both in His own person, and by His disciples, as well those in the Old, as
in the New Testament, He makes so much account of this commandment; and is a severe
avenger and punisher of those who despise the duty. For in truth nothing so effectually gives
entrance and root to all wickedness, as the taking away of love. Wherefore He also said,
“When iniquity abounds, the love of the many shall wax cold.”724 Thus Cain became his
brother’s murderer; thus Esau; thus Joseph’s brethren; thus our unnumbered crimes have
come revelling in, this bond being dissevered. You see why He Himself also roots out
whatever things injure this, on every side, with great exactness.</p>
<p>12. Neither doth He stop at those precepts only which have been mentioned, but adds
also others more than those: whereby He signifies how much account He makes thereof.
Namely, having threatened by “the council,” by “the judgment,” and by “hell,” He added
other sayings again in harmony with the former, saying thus:</p>
<p>“If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go away;725first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”726</p>
<p>O goodness! O exceeding love to man! He makes no account of the honor due unto
Himself, for the sake of our love towards our neighbor; implying that not at all from any
enmity, nor out of any desire to punish, had He uttered those former threatenings, but out
of very tender affection. For what can be milder than these sayings? “Let my service,” saith
he, “be interrupted, that thy love may continue; since this also is a sacrifice, thy being reconciled
to thy brother.” Yea, for this cause He said not, “after the offering,” or “before the offering;”
but, while the very gift lies there, and when the sacrifice is already beginning, He
sends thee to be reconciled to thy brother; and neither after removing that which lies before
us,727nor before presenting the gift, but while it lies in the midst, He bids thee hasten
thither.</p>
<p>With what motive then doth He command so to do, and wherefore? These two ends,
as it appears to me, He is hereby shadowing out and providing for. First, as I have said, His
<note type="footnote">724 Matt. xxiv. 12. [“Shall be multiplied” is a more exact rendering of the verb in the first clause. Comp.

<note type="footnote">726 Matt. v. 23, 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">727 συνελντα τ προκεμενα. Mr. Field translates this, “quickly doing the work in hand:” alleging that the word
συναιρεν cannot well stand for “removing.” But its strict meaning seems to be “to pack up,” or “put into a small
compass.” So Odyss. xx. 95. χλαναν μν συνελν κα κεα, ποσιν νευδεν. And this meaning suits well enough with
the word προκεμενα, taken in its liturgical sense. [The technical sense of the verb is “to contract,” and the context
favors Field’s view. The command was neither “after hastening through the service (Latin, nec propere confecto
sacrificio) nor before beginning it.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="207"/>
will is to point out that He highly values charity,728and considers it to be the greatest sacrifice:
and that without it He doth not receive even that other; next, He is imposing such a necessity
of reconciliation, as admits of no excuse. For whoso hath been charged not to offer before
he be reconciled, will hasten, if not for love of his neighbor, yet, that this may not lie unconsecrated,
729to run unto him who hath been grieved, and do away the enmity. For this cause
He hath also expressed it all most significantly, to alarm and thoroughly to awaken him.
Thus, when He had said, “Leave thy gift,” He stayed not at this, but added, “before the altar”
(by the very place again causing him to shudder); “and go away.” And He said not merely,
“Go away,” but He added, “first, and then come and offer thy gift.” By all these things
making it manifest, that this table receives not them that are at enmity with each other.</p>
<p>Let the initiated hear this, as many as draw nigh in enmity: and let the uninitiated hear
too: yea, for the saying hath some relation to them also. For they too offer a gift and a sacrifice:
prayer, I mean, and alms-giving. For as to this also being a sacrifice, hear what the prophet
saith: “A sacrifice of praise will glorify me;”730and again, “Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of
praise;”731and, “The lifting up of mine hands is an evening sacrifice.”732 So that if it be but
a prayer, which thou art offering in such a frame of mind, it were better to leave thy prayer,
and become reconciled to thy brother, and then to offer thy prayer.</p>
<p>For to this end were all things done: to this end even God became man, and took order
for all those works, that He might set us at one.</p>
<p>And whereas in this place He is sending the wrong doer to the sufferer, in His prayer
He leads the sufferer to the wrong doer, and reconciles them. For as there He saith, “Forgive
men their debts;” so here, “If he hath ought against thee, go thy way unto him.”</p>
<p>Or rather, even here too He seems to me to be sending the injured person: and for some
such reason He said not, “Reconcile thyself to thy brother,” but, “Be thou rec onciled.” And
while the saying seems to pertain to the aggressor, the whole of it really pertains to him that
is aggrieved. Thus, “If thou art reconciled to him,” saith Christ, “through thy love to him
thou wilt have me also propitious, and wilt be able to offer thy sacrifice with great confidence.
But if thou art still irritated, consider that even I readily command that which is mine to be
lightly esteemed, that ye may become friends; and let these thoughts be soothing to thine
anger.”</p>
<p>And He said not, “When thou hast suffered any of the greater wrongs, then be reconciled;
but, “Though it be some trifle that he hath against thee.” And He added not, “Whether justly
<note type="footnote">728 [τν γπην, properly rendered “love” in the next sentence.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">729 ἀτλεστον.</note>
<note type="footnote">730 Ps. l. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">731 Ps. l. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">732 Ps. cxli. 2.</note>

<pb n="208"/>
or unjustly;” but merely, “If he hath ought against thee.” For though it be justly, not even
in that case oughtest thou to protract the enmity; since Christ also was justly angered with
us, yet nevertheless He gave Himself for us to be slain, “not imputing those trespasses.”733</p>
<p>For this cause Paul also, when urging us in another way to reconciliation, said, “Let not
the sun go down upon your wrath.”734 For much as Christ by this argument of the sacrifice,
so there Paul by that of the day, is urging us on to the self-same point. Because in truth he
fears the night, lest it overtake him that is smitten alone, and make the wound greater. For
whereas in the day there are many to distract, and draw him off; in the night, when he is
alone, and is thinking it over by himself, the waves swell, and the storm becomes greater.
Therefore Paul, you see, to prevent this, would fain commit him to the night already reconciled,
that the devil may after that have no opportunity, from his solitude, to rekindle the
furnace of his wrath, and make it fiercer. Thus also Christ permits not, though it be ever so
little delay, lest, the sacrifice being accomplished, such an one become more remiss, procrastinating
from day to day: for He knows that the case requires very speedy treatment. And
as a skillful physician exhibits not only the preventives of our diseases, but their correctives
also, even so doth He likewise. Thus, to forbid our calling “fool,” is a preventive of enmity;
but to command reconciliation is a means of removing the diseases that ensue on the enmity.</p>
<p>And mark how both commands are set forth with earnestness. For as in the former case
He threatened hell, so here He receives not the gift before the reconciliation, indicating great
displeasure, and by all these methods destroying both the root and the produce.</p>
<p>And first of all He saith, “Be not angry;” and after that, “revile not.” For indeed both
these are augmented, the one by the other: from enmity is reviling, from reviling enmity.
On this account then He heals now the root, and now the fruit; hindering indeed the evil
from ever springing up in the first instance: but if perchance it may have sprouted up and
borne its most evil fruit, then by all means He burns it down the more.</p>
<p>13. Therefore, you see, having mentioned, first the judgment, then the council, then
hell, and having spoken of His own sacrifice, He adds other topics again, thus speaking:</p>
<p>“Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him.”735</p>
<p>That is, that thou mayest not say, “What then, if I am injured;” “what if I am plundered,
and dragged too before the tribunal?” even this occasion and excuse He hath taken away:
for He commands us not even so to be at enmity. Then, since this injunction was great, He
draws His advice from the things present, which are wont to restrain the grosser sort more
than the future. “Why, what sayest thou?” saith He. “That thine adversary is stronger, and
doeth thee wrong? Of course then he will wrong thee more, if thou do not make it up, but
<note type="footnote">733 2 Cor. v. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">734 Eph. iv. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">735 Matt. v. 25.</note>

<pb n="209"/>
art forced to go into court. For in the former case, by giving up some money, thou wilt keep
thy person free; but when thou art come under the sentence of the judge, thou wilt both be
bound, and pay the utmost penalty. But if thou avoid the contest there, thou wilt reap two
good results: first, not having to suffer anything painful: and secondly, that the good done
will be thereafter thine own doing, and no longer the effect of compulsion on his part. But
if thou wilt not be ruled by these sayings, thou wrongest not him, so much as thyself.”</p>
<p>And see here also how He hastens him; for having said, “Agree with thine adversary,”
He added, “quickly;” and He was not satisfied with this, but even of this quickness He hath
required a further increase, saying, “Whilst thou art in the way with him;” pressing and
hastening him hereby with great earnestness. For nothing doth so much turn our life upside
down, as delay and procrastination in the performance of our good works. Nay, this hath
often caused us to lose all. Therefore, as Paul for his part saith, “Before the sun set, do away
the enmity;” and as He Himself had said above, “Before the offering is completed, be reconciled;”
so He saith in this place also, “Quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him,” before
thou art come to the doors of the court; before thou standest at the bar and art come to be
thenceforth under the sway of him that judgeth. Since, before entering in, thou hast all in
thine own control; but if thou set thy foot on that threshold, thou wilt not by ever so earnest
efforts be able to arrange thy matters at thy will, having come under the constraint of another.</p>
<p>But what is it “to agree?” He means either, “consent rather to suffer wrong?” or, “so
plead the cause, as if thou wert in the place of the other;” that thou mayest not corrupt justice
by self-love, but rather, deliberating on another’s cause as thine own, mayest so proceed to
deliver thy vote in this matter. And if this be a great thing, marvel not; since with this view
did He set forth all those His blessings, that having beforehand smoothed and prepared the
hearer’s soul, he might render it apter to receive all His enactments.</p>
<p>Now some say that He obscurely signifies the devil himself, under the name of the adversary;
and bids us have nothing of his, (for this, they say, is to “agree” with him): no
compromise being possible after our departure hence, nor anything awaiting us, but that
punishment, from which no prayers can deliver. But to me He seems to be speaking of the
judges in this world, and of the way to the court of justice, and of this prison.</p>
<p>For after he had abashed men by higher things, and things future, he alarms them also
by such as are in this life. Which thing Paul also doth, using both the future and the present
to sway his hearer: as when, deterring from wickedness, he points out to him that is inclined
to evil, the ruler armed: thus saying, “But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain; for he is a minister of God.”736 And again, enjoining us to
be subject unto him, he sets forth not the fear of God only, but the threatening also of the
other party, and his watchful care. “For ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
<note type="footnote">736 Rom. xiii. 4.</note>

<pb n="210"/>
also for conscience sake.”737 Because the more irrational, as I have already said, are wont
to be sooner corrected by these things, things which appear and are at hand. Wherefore
Christ also made mention, not of hell only, but also of a court of justice, and of being dragged
thither, and of the prison, and of all the suffering there; by all these means destroying the
roots of murder. For he who neither reviles, nor goes to law, nor prolongs enmity, how will
he ever commit murder? So that from hence also it is evident, that in the advantage of our
neighbor stands our own advantage. For he that agrees with his adversary, will benefit
himself much more; becoming free, by his own act, from courts of law, and prisons, and the
wretchedness that is there.</p>
<p>14. Let us then be obedient to His sayings; let us not oppose ourselves, nor be contentious;
for first of all, even antecedently to their rewards, these injunctions have their pleasure and
profit in themselves. And if to the more part they seem to be burdensome, and the trouble
which they cause, great; have it in thy mind that thou art doing it for Christ’s sake, and the
pain will be pleasant. For if we maintain this way of reckoning at all times, we shall experience
nothing burdensome, but great will be the pleasure we reap from every quarter; for our toil
will no longer seem toil, but by how much it is enhanced, so much the sweeter and pleasanter
doth it grow.</p>
<p>When therefore the custom of evil things, and the desire of wealth, keep on bewitching
thee; do thou war against them with that mode of thinking which tells us, “Great is the reward
we shall receive, for despising the pleasure which is but for a season;” and say to thy soul;
“Art thou quite dejected because I defraud thee of pleasure? Nay, be of good cheer, for I am
introducing thee into Heaven. Thou doest it not for man’s sake, but for God’s. Be patient
therefore a little while, and thou shalt see how great is the gain. Endure for the present life,
and thou shalt receive an unspeakable confidence.” For if we would thus discourse with our
own soul, and not only consider that which is burdensome in virtue, but take account also
of the crown that comes thereof, we shall quickly withdraw it from all wickedness.</p>
<p>For if the devil, holding out pleasure for a season, but pain for ever, is yet strong, and
prevails; seeing our case is just the reverse in these matters, the labor temporary, the pleasure
and profit immortal, what plea shall we have, if we follow not virtue after so great encouragement?
Why, the object of our labors is enough to set against all, and our clear persuasion
that for God’s sake we are enduring all this. For if one having the king his debtor, thinks he
hath sufficient security for all his life; consider how great will he be, who hath made the
Gracious and Everlasting God a debtor to himself, for good deeds both small and great. Do
<note type="footnote">737 Rom. v. 5.</note>

<pb n="211"/>
not then allege to me labors and sweats; for not by the hope only of the things to come, but
in another way also, God hath made virtue easy, assisting us everywhere, and putting His
hand to our work. And if thou wilt only contribute a little zeal, everything else follows. For
to this end He will have thee too to labor a little, even that the victory may be thine also.
And just as a king would have his own son present indeed in the array; he would have him
shoot with the bow,738and show himself, that the trophy may be reckoned his, while he
achieves it all Himself: even so doth God in our war against the devil: He requires of thee
one thing alone, that thou show forth a sincere hatred against that foe. And if thou contribute
this to Him, He by Himself brings all the war to an end. Though thou burn with anger, with
desire of riches, with any tyrannical passion whatever; if He see thee only stripping thyself
and prepared against it, He comes quickly to thee, and makes all things easy, and sets thee
above the flame, as He did those children of old in the Babylonian furnace: for they too
carried in with them nought but their good will.</p>
<p>In order then that we also may extinguish all the furnace of disordered pleasure here,
and so escape the hell that is there, let these each day be our counsels, our cares, and our
practice, drawing towards us the favor of God, both by our full purpose concerning good
works, and by our frequent prayers. For thus even those things which appear insupportable
now, will be most easy, and light, and lovely. Because, so long as we are in our passions, we
think virtue rugged and morose and arduous, vice desirable and most pleasing; but if we
would stand off from these but a little, then both vice will appear abominable and unsightly,
and virtue easy, mild, and much to be desired. And this you may learn plainly from those
who have done well. Hear, for instance, how of those passions Paul is ashamed, even after
his deliverance from them, saying, “For what fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye
are now ashamed?”739 But virtue, even after his labor, he affirms to be light, calling740the
laboriousness of our affliction momentary and “light,” and rejoicing in his sufferings, and
glorying in his tribulations, and taking a pride in the marks wherewith he had been branded
for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p>In order then that we too may establish ourselves in this habit, let us order ourselves
each day by what hath been said, and “forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, let us press on towards the prize of the
high calling:”741unto which God grant that we may all attain, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. V. 27, 28.</p>
<p>“Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time,742Thou shalt not commit adultery; but
I say unto you, that every one who looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.”</p>
<p>Having now finished the former commandment, and having extended it unto the height
of self-denial, He, advancing in course and order, proceeds accordingly unto the second,
herein too obeying the law.</p>
<p>“And yet,” it may be said, “this is not the second, but the third; for neither is the first,
“Thou shalt not kill,” but “The Lord thy God is one Lord.”743</p>
<p>Wherefore it is worth inquiring too, why He did not begin with that. Why was it then?
Because, had He begun from thence, He must have enlarged it also, and have brought in
Himself together with His Father.744 But it was not as yet time to teach any such thing
about Himself.</p>
<p>And besides, He was for a while practising His moral doctrine only, being minded from
this first, and from His miracles, to convince the hearers that He was the Son of God. Now,
if He had said at once, before He had spoken or done anything, “Ye have heard that it was
said to them of old time, “I am the Lord thy God, and there is none other but me,” but I say
unto you, Worship me even as Him; this would have made all regard Him as a madman.
For if, even after His teaching, and His so great miracles, while not even yet was He saying
this openly, they called Him possessed with a devil;745had He before all these attempted to
say any such thing, what would they not have said? what would they not have thought?</p>
<p>But by keeping back at the proper season His teaching on these subjects, He was causing
that the doctrine should be acceptable to the many. Wherefore now He passed it by quickly,
but when He had everywhere established it by His miracles, and by His most excellent
teaching, He afterwards unveiled it in words also.</p>
<p>For the present, however, by the manifestation of His miracles, and by the very manner
of His teaching, He unfolds it on occasion, gradually and quietly. For His enacting such
laws, and such corrections of laws, with authority, would lead on the attentive and under-
<note type="footnote">742 [The phrase “to them of old time” (το ρχαοι) is not found in the oldest mss. of the New Testament, in

<pb n="213"/>
standing hearer, by little and little, unto the word of His doctrine. For it is said, “they were
astonished at Him, because He taught not as their Scribes.”746</p>
<p>2. For beginning from those passions, which most belong to our whole race, anger, I
mean, and desire (for it is these chiefly that bear absolute sway within us, and are more
natural than the rest); He with great authority, even such as became a legislator, both corrected
them, and reduced them to order with all strictness. For He said not that the
adulterer merely is punished; but what He had done with respect to the murderer, this He
doth here also, punishing even the unchaste look: to teach thee wherein lies what He had
more than the scribes. Accordingly, He saith, “He that looketh upon a woman to lust after
her hath already committed adultery with her:” that is, he who makes it his business to be
curious about bright forms, and to hunt for elegant features, and to feast his soul with the
sight, and to fasten his eyes on fair countenances. For He came to set free from all evil deeds
not the body only, but the soul too before the body. Thus, because in the heart we receive
the grace of the Spirit, He cleanses it out first.</p>
<p>“And how,” one may say, “is it possible to be freed from desire?” I answer, first, if we
were willing, even this might be deadened, and remain inactive.</p>
<p>In the next place, He doth not here take away desire absolutely, but that desire which
springs up in men from sight. For he that is curious to behold fair countenances, is himself
chiefly the enkindler of the furnace of that passion, and makes his own soul a captive, and
soon proceeds also to the act.</p>
<p>Thus we see why He said not, “whosoever shall lust to commit adultery,” but, “whosoever
shall look to lust.” And in the case of anger He laid down a certain distinction, saying,
“without a cause,” and “for nought;” but here not so; rather once for all He took away the
desire. Yet surely both are naturally implanted, and both are set in us for our profit; both
anger, and desire: the one that we may chastise the evil, and correct those who walk disorderly;
the other that we may have children, and that our race may be recruited by such
successions.</p>
<p>Why then did He not make a distinction here also? Nay, very great is the distinction
which, if thou attend, thou wilt see here also included. For He said not simply, “whosoever
shall desire,” since it is possible for one to desire even when sitting in the mountains; but,
“Whosoever shall look to lust;” that is to say, he who gathers in lust unto himself; he who,
when nothing compels him, brings in the wild beast upon his thoughts when they are calm.
For this comes no longer of nature, but of self-indulgence. This even the ancient Scripture
corrects from the first, saying, “Contemplate not beauty which is another’s.”747 And then,
lest any one should say, “what then, if I contemplate, and be not taken captive,” He punishes
<note type="footnote">746 Matt. vii. 28, 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">747 Ecclus. ix. 8.</note>

<pb n="214"/>
the look, lest confiding in this security thou shouldest some time fall into sin. “What then,”
one may say, “if I should look, and desire indeed, but do no evil?” Even so thou art set among
the adulterers. For the Lawgiver hath pronounced it, and thou must not ask any more
questions. For thus looking once, twice, or thrice, thou wilt perhaps have power to refrain;
but if thou art continually doing this, and kindling the furnace, thou wilt assuredly be taken;
for thy station is not beyond that nature which is common to men. As we then, if we see a
child holding a knife, though we do not see him hurt, beat him, and forbid his ever holding
it; so God likewise takes away the unchaste look even before the act, lest at any time thou
shouldest fall in act also. For he who hath once kindled the flame, even when the woman
whom he hath beheld is absent, is forming by himself continually images of shameful things,
and from them often goes on even to the deed. For this cause Christ takes away even that
embrace which is in the heart only.</p>
<p>What now can they say, who have those virgin inmates?748 Why, by the tenor of this
law they must be guilty of ten thousand adulteries, daily beholding them with desire. For
this cause the blessed Job749also laid down this law from the beginning, blocking out from
himself on all sides this kind of gazing.</p>
<p>For in truth greater is the struggle on beholding, and not possessing the object of fondness:
nor is the pleasure so great which we reap from the sight, as the mischief we undergo
from increasing this desire; thus making our opponent strong, and giving more scope to
the devil, and no longer750able to repulse him, now that we have brought him into our inmost
parts, and have thrown our mind open unto him. Therefore He saith, “commit no adultery
with thine eyes, and thou wilt commit none with thy mind.”</p>
<p>For one may indeed behold in another way, such as are the looks of the chaste; wherefore
he did not altogether prohibit our seeing, but that seeing which is accompanied with desire.
And if He had not meant this, He would have said simply, “He who looketh on a woman.”</p>
<note type="footnote">748 τ συνοκου παρθνου, they were often called συνεισακτο. The practice of unmarried men, especially of the
clergy, having single young women in their houses, is a frequent object of warning and censure both in the
Homilies of the Fathers and in Church Canons. The earliest mention of such a thing, and of the sad abuse consequent
on it, appears to be in St. Irenæus, i. 6, 3: who lays it to the charge of the Valentinian heretics. Tertullian
(de Jejun. ad fin.) imputes it to the Catholics. St. Cyprian’s fourth Epistle (ed. Fell.) was written to repress and
punish an instance of it in the Church of Carthage. It was one of the charges against Paul of Samosata, and was
forbidden by the third canon of Nicæa. See Dr. Routh’s Reliquiæ Sacræ, 2,506, to which the editor is indebted
for this note. The custom seems to have prevailed particularly at Antioch, ib. 482. See also an oration of
Chrysostom on this subject, vi. 214.</note>

<p>But now He said not thus, but, “He who looketh to lust,” “he who looketh to please his
sight.”</p>
<p>For not at all to this end did God make thee eyes, that thou shouldest thereby introduce
adultery, but that, beholding His creatures, thou shouldest admire the Artificer.</p>
<p>Just then as one may feel wrath at random, so may one cast looks at random; that is,
when thou doest it for lust. Rather, if thou desirest to look and find pleasure, look at thine
own wife, and love her continually; no law forbids that. But if thou art to be curious about
the beauties that belong to another, thou art injuring both thy wife by letting thine eyes
wander elsewhere, and her on whom thou hast looked, by touching her unlawfully. Since,
although thou hast not touched her with the hand, yet hast thou caressed her with thine
eyes; for which cause this also is accounted adultery, and before that great penalty draws
after it no slight one of its own. For then all within him is filled with disquiet and turmoil,
and great is the tempest, and most grievous the pain, and no captive nor person in chains
can be worse off than a man in this state of mind. And oftentimes she who hath shot the
dart is flown away, while the wound even so remains. Or rather, it is not she who hath shot
the dart, but thou gavest thyself the fatal wound, by thine unchaste look. And this I say to
free modest women from the charge: since assuredly, should one deck herself out, and invite
towards herself the eyes of such as fall in her way; even though she smite not him that meets
with her, she incurs the utmost penalty: for she mixed the poison, she prepared the hemlock,
even though she did not offer the cup. Or rather, she did also offer the cup, though no one
were found to drink it.</p>
<p>3. “Why then doth He not discourse with them also?” it may be said. Because the laws
which He appoints are in every case common, although He seem to address Himself unto
men only. For in discoursing with the head, He makes His admonition common to the
whole body also. For woman and man He knows as one living creature, and nowhere distinguishes
their kind.</p>
<p>But if thou desirest to hear also His rebuke for them in particular, listen to Isaiah,751in
many words inveighing against them, and deriding their habit, their aspect, their gait, their
trailing garments, their tripping feet, their drooping necks. Hear with him the blessed
Paul752also, setting many laws for them; and both about garments, and ornaments of
gold,753and plaiting of hair, and luxurious754living, and all other such things, vehemently
rebuking this sex. And Christ too, by what follows next, obscurely intimated this very same;

for when He saith, “pluck out and cut off the eye that offendeth thee,”755 He speaks as indicating
His anger against them.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore also He subjoins,</p>
<p>“If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee.”756</p>
<p>Thus, lest thou shouldest say, “But what if she be akin to me? what if in any other way
she belong to me?” therefore He hath given these injunctions; not discoursing about our
limbs;—far from it,—for nowhere doth He say that our flesh is to be blamed for things, but
everywhere it is the evil mind that is accused. For it is not the eye that sees, but the mind
and the thought. Often, for instance, we being wholly turned elsewhere, our eye sees not
those who are present. So that the matter does not entirely depend upon its working. Again,
had He been speaking of members of the body, He would not have said it of one eye, nor
of the right eye only, but of both. For he who is offended by his right eye, most evidently
will incur the same evil by his left also. Why then did He mention the right eye, and add the
hand? To show thee that not of limbs is He speaking, but of them who are near unto us.
Thus, “If,” saith He, “thou so lovest any one, as though he were in stead of a right eye; if
thou thinkest him so profitable to thee as to esteem him in the place of a hand, and he hurts
thy soul; even these do thou cut off.” And see the emphasis; for He saith not, “Withdraw
from him,” but to show the fullness of the separation, “pluck it out,” saith He, “and cast it
from thee.”</p>
<p>Then, forasmuch as His injunction was sharp, He shows also the gain on either hand,
both from the benefits and from the evils, continuing in the metaphor.</p>
<p>“For it is profitable for thee,” saith He, “that one of thy members should perish, and not
that thy whole body should be cast into hell.”757</p>
<p>For while he neither saves himself, nor fails to destroy thee too, what kindness is it for
both to sink, whereas if they were separated, one at least might have been preserved?</p>
<p>But why did Paul then, it may be said, choose to become accursed?758 Not on condition
of gaining nothing, but with a view to the salvation of others. But in this case the mischief
pertains to both. And therefore He said not, “pluck out” only, but also “cast from thee:” to
receive him again no more, if he continue as he is. For so shalt thou both deliver him from
a heavier charge, and free thyself from ruin.</p>
<p>But that thou mayest see yet more clearly the profit of this law; let us, if you please, try
what hath been said, in the case of the body itself, by way of supposition. I mean, if choice

were given, and thou must either, keeping thine eye, be cast into a pit and perish, or plucking
it out, preserve the rest of thy body; wouldest thou not of course accept the latter? It is plain
to everyone. For this were not to act as one hating the eye, but as one loving the rest of the
body. This same reckoning do thou make with regard to men also and women: that if he
who harms thee by his friendship should continue incurable, his being thus cut off will both
free thee from all mischief, and he also will himself be delivered from the heavier charges,
not having to answer for thy destruction along with his own evil deeds.</p>
<p>Seest thou how full the law is of gentleness and tender care, and that which seems to
men in general to be severity, how much love towards man it discloses?</p>
<p>Let them hearken to these things, who hasten to the theatres, and make themselves
adulterers every day. For if the law commands to cut off him, whose connexion with us
tends to our hurt; what plea can they have, who, by their haunting those places, attract towards
them daily those even that have not yet become known to them, and procure to
themselves occasions of ruin without number?</p>
<p>For henceforth, He not only forbids us to look unchastely, but having signified the
mischief thence ensuing, He even straitens the law as He goes on, commanding to cut off,
and dissever, and cast somewhere far away. And all this He ordains, who hath
uttered759words beyond number about love, that in either way thou mightest learn His
providence, and how from every source He seeks thy profit.</p>
<p>4. “Now it hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing
of divorcement.760 But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the
cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is
put away, committeth adultery.”761</p>
<p>He goes not on to what lies before Him, until He have well cleared out the former topics.
For, lo, He shows us yet another kind of adultery. And what is this? There was an ancient
law made,762that he who hated his wife, for whatever kind of cause, should not be forbidden
to cast her out, and to bring home another instead of her. The law however did not command
him simply to do this, but after giving the woman a writing of divorcement, that it might
not be in her power to return to him again; that so at least the figure of the marriage might
remain.</p>
<p>For if He had not enjoined this, but it were lawful first to cast her out, and take another,
then afterwards to take back the former, the confusion was sure to be great, all men continu-

ally taking each others’ wives; and the matter thenceforth would have been direct adultery.
With a view to this, He devised, as no small mitigation, the writing of divorcement.</p>
<p>But these things were done by reason of another, a far greater wickedness; I mean, had
He made it necessary to keep in the house her even that was hated, the husband, hating,
would have killed her. For such was the race of the Jews. For they who did not spare children,
who slew prophets, and “shed blood as water,”763much more would they have showed no
mercy to women. For this cause He allowed the less, to remove the greater evil. For that this
was not a primary764law, hear Him saying, “Moses wrote these things according to the
hardness of your hearts,”765that ye might not slay them in the house, but rather put them
out. But forasmuch as He had taken away all wrath, having forbidden not murder only, but
even the mere feeling of anger, He with ease introduces this law likewise. With this view
also He is ever bringing to mind the former words, to signify that His sayings are not contrary
to them, but in agreement: that He is enforcing, not overthrowing them; perfecting, not
doing them away.</p>
<p>And observe Him everywhere addressing His discourse to the man. Thus, “He that
putteth away his wife,” saith He, “causeth her to commit adultery, and he that marrieth a
woman put away, committeth adultery.” That is, the former, though he take not another
wife, by that act alone hath made himself liable to blame, having made the first an adulteress;
the latter again is become an adulterer by taking her who is another’s. For tell me not this,
“the other hath cast her out;” nay, for when cast out she continues to be the wife of him that
expelled her. Then lest He should render the wife more self-willed, by throwing it all upon
him who cast her out, He hath shut against her also the doors of him who was afterwards
receiving her; in that He saith, “He who marrieth her that is put away committeth adultery;”
and so makes the woman chaste even though unwilling, and blocks up altogether her access
to all, and suffers her not to give an occasion for jealousy.766 For she who hath been made
aware that she positively must either keep the husband, who was originally allotted to her,
or being cast out of that house, not have any other refuge;—she even against her will was
compelled to make the best of her consort.</p>
<p>And if He discourse not at all unto her concerning these things, marvel not; for the
woman is rather a weak creature.767 For this cause letting her go, in his threatening against
the men He fully corrects her remissness. Just as if any one who had a prodigal child, leaving

him, should rebuke those who make him such, and forbid them to have intercourse, or to
approach him. And if that be galling, call to mind, I pray thee, His former sayings, on what
terms He had blessed His hearers; and thou wilt see that it is very possible and easy. For he
that is meek, and a peacemaker, and poor in spirit, and merciful, how shall he cast out his
wife? He that is used to reconcile others, how shall he be at variance with her that is his own?</p>
<p>And not thus only, but in another way also He hath lightened the enactment: forasmuch
as even for him He leaves one manner of dismissal, when He saith, “Except for the cause of
fornication;” since the matter had else come round again to the same issue. For if He had
commanded to keep her in the house, though defiling herself with many, He would have
made the matter end again in adultery.</p>
<p>Seest thou how these sayings agree with what had gone before? For he who looks not
with unchaste eyes upon another woman, will not commit whoredom; and not committing
whoredom, he will give no occasion to the husband to cast out his wife.</p>
<p>Therefore, you see, after this He presses the point without reserve, and builds up this
fear as a bulwark, urging on the husband the great danger, if he do cast her out, in that he
makes himself accountable for her adultery. Thus, lest thou being told, “pluck out the eye,”
shouldest suppose this to be said even of a wife: He added in good time this corrective, in
one way only giving leave to cast her out, but no otherwise.</p>
<p>5. “Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear
thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, swear not at all.”768</p>
<p>Why did He go straightway not to theft, but to false witness, passing over that commandment?
Because he that steals, doth upon occasion swear also; but he that knows not either
swearing or speaking falsehood, much less will he choose to steal. So that by this He hath
overthrown the other sin likewise: since falsehood comes of stealing.</p>
<p>But what means, “Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths?”769 It is this, “thou
shalt be true in swearing.” “But I say unto you, swear not at all.”</p>
<p>Next, to lead them farther away from swearing by God, He saith, “Neither by Heaven,
for it is God’s throne, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem,
for it is the city of the great King:”770still speaking out of the prophetical writings, and signifying
Himself not to be opposed to the ancients. This was because they had a custom of
swearing by these objects, and he intimates this custom near the end of his Gospel.771</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, on what ground He magnifies the elements; not from their own
nature, but from God’s relation to them, such as it had been in condescension declared. For
<note type="footnote">768 Matt. v. 33, 34.</note>
<note type="footnote">769 See Num. xxx. 2; Deut. xxiii. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">770 Isa. lxxvi. 1; Ps. xlviii. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">771 Matt. xxiii. 16, et seq.</note>

<pb n="220"/>
because the tyranny of idolatry was great, that the elements might not be thought worthy
of honor for their own sake, He hath assigned this cause, which we have mentioned, which
again would pass on to the glory of God. For He neither said, “because Heaven is beautiful
and great,” nor, “because earth is profitable;” but “because the one is God’s throne, the
other His footstool;” on every side urging them on towards their Lord.</p>
<p>“Neither by thy head,” saith He, “because thou canst not make one hair white or
black.”772</p>
<p>Here again, not as wondering at man, hath He withdrawn him from swearing by his
head (for so man himself would be worshipped), but as referring the glory to God, and signifying
that thou art not master even of thyself, and of course therefore not of the oaths
made by thy head. For if no one would give up his own child to another, much more will
not God give up His own work to thee. For though it be thy head, yet is it the property of
another; and so far from being master thereof, thou shalt not be able to do with it, no not
the least thing of all. For He said not, “Thou canst not make one hair grow;” but, “Not so
much as change its quality.”</p>
<p>“But what,” it may be said, “if any one should require an oath, and apply constraint?”
Let the fear of God be more powerful than the constraint: since, if thou art to bring forward
such excuses, thou wilt keep none of the things which are enjoined.</p>
<p>Yea, for first with respect to thy wife thou wilt say, “what if she be contentious and extravagant;”
and then as to the right eye, “what if I love it, and am quite on fire?” and of the
unchaste look, “what then, if I cannot help seeing?” and of our anger against a brother, “what
if I be hasty, and not able to govern my tongue?” and in general, all His sayings thou mayest
on this wise trample under foot. Yet surely with regard to human laws thou darest not in
any case use this allegation, nor say, “what then if this or that be the case,” but, willing or
unwilling, thou receivest what is written.</p>
<p>And besides, thou wilt never have compulsion to undergo at all. For he that hath
hearkened unto those former blessings, and hath framed himself to be such as Christ enjoined,
will have no such constraint to endure from any, being held in reverence and veneration
by all.</p>
<p>“But let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay: for that which exceedeth these cometh of
the evil one.”773</p>
<p>What is it then that “exceeds yea” and “nay”? it is the oath, not the perjury. For this
latter is quite acknowledged, and no man needs to learn that it is of the evil one; and it is

<pb n="221"/>
not an excess, but an opposite: whereas an excess means something more, and added over
and above: which kind of thing swearing is.</p>
<p>“What then,” saith one, “was it of the evil one? and if it was of the evil one, how was it
a law?” Well, this same thing thou wilt say concerning the wife also; how is that now accounted
adultery, which was before permitted?</p>
<p>What now may one reply to this? That the precepts then uttered had reference to the
weakness of them who were receiving the laws; since also to be worshipped with the vapor
of sacrifice is very unworthy of God, just as to lisp is unworthy of a philosopher. That kind
of thing accordingly was now laid down to be adultery, and swearing to be of the evil one,
now that the principles of virtue have advanced. But if these things had been, from the first,
laws of the devil, they would not have attained to so great goodness. Yea, for had those not
been forerunners in the first place, these which we now have would not have been so easily
received. Do not thou then require their excellency now, when their use is past: but then,
when the time was calling for them. Or rather, if thou wilt, even now: yea, for now also is
their virtue shown: and most of all for the very cause, by reason of which we find fault with
them. For their appearing such now, is the greatest commendation of them. For had they
not brought us up well, and made us meet for the reception of the greater precepts, they
would not have appeared such.</p>
<p>Therefore as the breast, when it hath fulfilled all its part, and is dismissing the child to
the more manly diet, after that appears useless; and the parents who before thought it necessary
for the babe, now abuse it with ten thousand mockeries (and many even not content
with words of abuse, anoint it also with bitter drugs; that when their words have not power
to remove the child’s unseasonable propensity towards it, the real things may quench their
longing): so also Christ saith, that they are of the evil one, not to indicate that the old law is
of the devil, but in order that with most exceeding earnestness He might lead them away
from their ancient poverty. And to them He saith these things; but with regard to the Jews,
who were insensible and persevered in the same ways, He hath anointed their city all round
with the terror of captivity, as with some bitter drug, and made it inaccessible. But since not
even this had power to restrain them, but they desired to see it again, running to it, just as
a child to the breast, He hid it from them altogether; both pulling it down, and leading away
the more part of them far from it: as it is with our cattle; many, by shutting out the calves,
in time induce them to forego their old familiar use of the milk.</p>
<p>But if the old law had belonged to the devil, it would not have led people away from
idolatry, but rather would have drawn them on and cast them into it; for this did the devil
desire. But now we see the opposite effect produced by the old law. And indeed this very
thing, the oath, was ordained of old for this cause, that they might not swear by the idols.
For “ye shall swear,” saith He, “by the true God.”774 They were then no small advantages
<note type="footnote">774 Jer. iv. 2. LXX. κα μσ, Ζ Κριο, μετ ληθεα ν, κρσει, κα ν δικαιοσν.</note>

<pb n="222"/>
which the law effected, but rather very great. For that they came unto the “strong meat,”
was the work of its care.</p>
<p>“What then,” it may be said, “is not swearing of the evil one?” Yes, indeed it is altogether
of the evil one; that is, now, after so high a rule of self-restraint; but then not so.</p>
<p>“But how,” one may say, “should the same thing become at one time good, at another
time not good?” Nay, I say the very contrary: how could it help becoming good and not
good, while all things are crying aloud, that they are so: the arts, the fruits of the earth, and
all things else?</p>
<p>See it, for example, taking place first in our own kind. Thus, to be carried, in the earliest
age of life, is good, but afterwards pernicious; to eat food that hath been softened in the
mouth, in the first scene of our life, is good, but afterwards it is full of disgust; to be fed upon
milk and to fly to the breast, is at first profitable and healthful, but tends afterwards to decay
and harm. Seest thou how the same actions, by reason of the times, appear good, and again
not so? Yea, and to wear the robe of a child is well as long as you are a boy, but contrariwise,
when you are become a man, it is disgraceful. Wouldest thou learn of the contrary case too,
how to the child again the things of the man are unsuited? Give the boy a man’s robe, and
great will be the laughter; and greater the danger, he being often upset in walking after that
fashion. Allow him to handle public affairs, and to traffic, and sow, and reap, and great again
will be the laughter.</p>
<p>And why do I mention these things? when killing, which among all is acknowledged to
be an invention of the evil one, killing, I say, having found its proper occasion, caused
Phinehas, who committed it, to be honored with the priesthood.775 For that killing is a work
of him whom I just now mentioned, hear what Christ saith; “Ye will do the works of your
Father; he was a manslayer from the beginning.”776 But Phinehas became a manslayer, and
“it was counted unto him” (so He speaks) “for righteousness:”777and Abraham again on
becoming not a man-slayer only, but (which was far worse) the slayer of his child, won more
and more approbation. And Peter too wrought a twofold slaughter, nevertheless what he
did was of the Spirit.778</p>
<p>Let us not then examine simply the acts, but the season too, and the causes, and the
mind, and the difference of persons, and whatsoever else may accompany them, these let
us search out with all exactness: for there is no arriving at the truth otherwise.</p>
<p>And let us be diligent, if we would attain unto the kingdom, to show forth something
more than the old commandments; since we cannot otherwise lay hold of the things of
<note type="footnote">775 Num. xxv. 8.</note>

Heaven. For if we arrive but at the same measure, that of the ancients, we shall stand without
that threshold; for “except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”779</p>
<p>6. Yet, although so heavy a threat is set down, there are some who so far from overpassing
this righteousness, even come short of it; so far from shunning oaths, they even
swear falsely; so far from avoiding an unchaste gaze, they even fall into the very act of
wickedness. And all the rest of the things which are forbidden, they dare to do, as though
past feeling: waiting for one thing only, the day of punishment, and the time when they are
to pay the most extreme penalty for their misdoings. And this is the portion of those only
who have ended their lives in wickedness. For these have reason to despair, and thenceforth
to expect nothing else but punishment; whereas they who are yet here, may have power
both to renew the fight and to conquer and be crowned with ease.</p>
<p>Despond not therefore, O man, neither put away thy noble earnestness; for in truth the
things are not grievous, which are enjoined. What trouble is it, I pray thee, to shun an oath?
What, does it cost any money? Is it sweat and hardship? It is enough to have willed only,
and the whole is done.</p>
<p>But if you allege to me thine habit; for this very reason most of all do I say, that thy doing
right is easy. For if thou bring thyself to another habit, thou hadst effected all.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, how among the Greeks, in many instances, persons lisping have
entirely cured by much practice their halting tongue; while others, who were used to shrug
up their shoulders in an unseemly way, and to be continually moving them, by putting a
sword over them, have broken themselves of it.780</p>
<p>For since you are not persuaded out of the Scriptures, I am compelled to shame you by
them that are without. This God also did unto the Jews, when He said, “Go ye forth unto
the Isles of Chittim, and send unto Kedar, and know if nations will change their gods; which
yet are no gods.”781 And to the brutes likewise He sends us oftentimes, saying on this wise,
“Go to the ant, thou sluggard, and emulate her ways:” and “go forth to the bee.”782</p>

<p>But if thou shouldest reply, “Habit has a wonderful power to beguile even those who
are very much in earnest:” this I likewise acknowledge; however, there is another thing
which I say with it; that as it is powerful to beguile, so also is it easy to be corrected. For if
thou wilt set over thyself at home many to watch thee, such as thy servant, thy wife, thy
friend, thou wilt easily break off from the bad habits, being hard pressed and closely restrained
by all. If thou succeed in doing this for ten days only, thou wilt after that no longer need
any further time, but all will be secured to thee, rooted anew in the firmness of the most
excellent habit.</p>
<p>When therefore thou art beginning to correct this, though thou shouldest transgress
thy law a first, a second, a third, a twentieth time, do not despair, but rise up again, and resume
the same diligence, and thou wilt surely prevail.</p>
<p>For perjury surely is no trifling mischief. If to swear is of the evil one, how great the
penalty which false swearing will bring! Did ye give praise to what hath been said?783 Nay,
I want not applause, nor tumults, nor noise. One thing only do I wish, that quietly and intelligently
listening, you should do what is said. This is the applause, this the panegyric for
me. But if thou praisest what I say, but doest not what thou applaudest, greater is the punishment,
more aggravated the accusation: and to us it is shame and ridicule. For the things
here present are no dramatic spectacle; neither do ye now sit gazing on actors, that ye may
merely applaud. This place is a spiritual school. Wherefore also there is but one thing aimed
at, duly to perform the things that have been spoken, and to show forth our obedience by
our works. For then only shall we have obtained all. Since as things are, to say the truth, we
have fairly given up in despair. For I have not ceased giving these admonitions either to
those whom I meet in private, or in discourse with you all in common. Yet I see no advantage
at all gained, but you are still clinging to the former rude beginnings, which thing is enough
to fill the teacher with weariness.</p>
<p>See, for example, Paul himself, hardly bearing it, because his scholars were delaying a
long time in their earlier lessons: “For when for the time,” saith he, “ye ought to be teachers,
ye have need to be taught again which be the first principles of the oracles of God.784”</p>
<p>Wherefore we too mourn and lament. And if I see you persisting, I will forbid you for
the future to set foot on this sacred threshold, and partake of the immortal mysteries; as we
do fornicators and adulterers, and persons charged with murder. Yea, for it is better to offer

<p>Let me have no rich man, no potentate, puffing at me here, and drawing up his eyebrows;
all these things are to me a fable, a shade, a dream. For no one of those who are now rich,
will stand up for me there, when I am called to account and accused, as not having thoroughly
vindicated the laws of God, with all due earnestness. For this, this ruined even that admirable
old man,786though in his own life giving no handle for blame; yet for all that, because he
overlooked the treading under foot of God’s laws, he was chastised with his children, and
paid that grievous penalty. And if, where the absolute authority of nature was so great, he
who failed to treat his own children with due firmness endured so grievous a punishment;
what indulgence shall we have, freed as we are from that dominion, and yet ruining all by
flattery?</p>
<p>In order therefore that ye may not destroy both us and your own selves with us, be
persuaded, I entreat you; set very many to watch over you, and call you to account, and so
free yourselves from the habit of oaths; that going on orderly from thence, ye may both with
all facility succeed in attaining unto all other virtue, and may enjoy the good things to come;

<head>Homily XVIII.</head>
<p>Matt. V. 38, 39, 40.</p>
<p>“Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say
unto you, that ye resist not the evil:787but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek,
turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
coat, let him have thy cloak also.”</p>
<p>Seest thou that it was not of an eye that He was speaking before, when He made the law
to pluck out the offending eye, but of him who by his friendship is harming us, and casting
us into the gulf of destruction? For He who in this place uses so great strength of expression,
and who, not even when another is plucking out your eye, permits you to strike out his;
how should He have made it a law to strike out one’s own?</p>
<p>But if any one accuses the ancient law, because it commands such retaliation, he seems
to me very unskillful in the wisdom that becomes a legislator, and ignorant of the virtue of
opportunities, and the gain of condescension. For if he considered who were the hearers of
these sayings, and how they were disposed, and when they received this code of laws, he
will thoroughly admit the wisdom of the Lawgiver, and will see that it is one and the same,
who made both those laws and these, and who wrote each of them exceeding profitably,
and in its due season. Yes, for if at the beginning He had introduced these high and most
weighty commandments, men would not have received either these, or the others; but now
ordaining them severally in their due time, He hath by the two corrected the whole world.</p>
<p>And besides, He commanded this, not that we might strike out one another’s eyes, but
that we might keep our hands to ourselves. For the threat of suffering hath effectually restrained
our inclination to be doing.</p>
<p>And thus in fact He is silently dropping seed of much self-restraint, at least in that He
commands to retaliate with just the same acts. Yet surely he that began such transgression
were worthy of a greater punishment, and this the abstract nature of justice788demands.
But forasmuch as He was minded to mingle mercy also with justice, He condemns him
whose offenses were very great to a punishment less than his desert: teaching us even while
we suffer to show forth great consideration.</p>
<p>Having therefore mentioned the ancient law, and recognized it all, He signifies again,
that it is not our brother who hath done these deeds, but the evil one. For this cause he hath
also subjoined, “But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil one.” He did not say, “resist
<note type="footnote">787 [R.V. text, “him that is evil.” Chrysostom interprets τ πονηρ, “the evil one.” In verse 40 the R.V. renders
“would go to law with thee.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">788 ὁ το δικαου λγο.</note>

<pb n="227"/>
not your brother,” but “the evil one,” signifying that on his motion men dare so to act; and
in this way relaxing and secretly removing most of our anger against the aggressor, by
transferring the blame to another.</p>
<p>“What then?” it is said, “ought we not to resist the evil one?” Indeed we ought, but not
in this way, but as He hath commanded, by giving one’s self up to suffer wrongfully; for
thus shalt thou prevail over him. For one fire is not quenched by another, but fire by water.
And to show thee that even under the old law he that suffered rather prevails, that he it is
who wins the crown; examine just what is done, and thou wilt see that his advantage is great.
For as he that hath begun with unjust acts, will have himself destroyed the eyes of both, his
neighbor’s and his own (wherefore also he is justly hated of all, and ten thousand accusations
are aimed at him): so he that hath been injured, even after his equal retaliation, will have
done nothing horrible. Wherefore also he hath many to sympathize with him, as being clear
from that offense even after he hath retaliated. And though the calamity be equal to both
parties, yet the sentence passed on it is not equal, either with God, or with men. It should
seem then, that neither is the calamity equal in the end.</p>
<p>Now whereas at the beginning He said, “he that is angry with his brother without a
cause,” and “he that calleth him fool shall be in danger of hell fire,” here He requires yet
more entire self-restraint, commanding him that suffers ill not merely to be quiet, but even
to be more exceedingly earnest in his turn,789by offering the other cheek.</p>
<p>And this He saith, not as legislating about such a blow as this only, but as teaching also
what forbearance we should practise in all our other trials. For just as when He saith, “whoso
calleth his brother fool, is in danger of hell,” He speaks not of this word only, but also of all
reviling; even so here also He is making a law, not so much for our bearing it manfully, when
smitten, as that we should be undisturbed, whatever we suffer. Because of this He both there
singled out the extremest insult, and here hath set down that which seems to be of all blows
most opprobrious, the blow on the cheek, so full of all insolence. And He commands this
as having regard both of him that strikes and of him that is stricken. Since both he that is
insulted will not think that he suffers any harm, being thus framed to self-restraint (nay, he
will not even have any sense of the insult, as striving rather for a prize than as receiving a
blow); and he that is offering the affront will be made ashamed, and not add a second blow,
though he be fiercer than any wild beast, yea, rather will condemn himself heartily for the
former. For nothing so restrains the wrong doers, as when the injured bear what is done
with gentleness. And it not only restrains them from rushing onward, but works upon them
also to repent for what has gone before, and in wonder at such forbearance to draw back.
And it makes them more our own, and causes them to be slaves, not merely friends, instead
of haters and enemies; even as avenging one’s self does just the contrary: for it both disgraces
<note type="footnote">789 ἀντιφιλοτιμεσθαι .</note>

<pb n="228"/>
each of the two, and makes them worse, and their anger it heightens into a greater flame;
yea, often no less than death itself is the end of it, going on from bad to worse. Wherefore
He not only forbade thee to be angry when smitten, but even enjoined thee to satiate the
other’s desire, that so neither may the former blow appear to have befallen thee against thy
will. For thus, lost as he may be to shame, thou wilt be able to smite him with a mortal blow,
rather than if thou hadst smitten him with thine hand; or if his shamelessness be still
greater, thou wilt make him gentle in proportion.</p>
<p>2. “And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy
cloak also.”790</p>
<p>For not in the matter of blows only, but of our goods also, He would have such forbearance
exhibited. Wherefore He again employs the same strong figure.791 That is, as in the
other case He commands to overcome in suffering, so here again, by allowing ourselves to
be deprived of more than the wrong doer expected. However, He did not put it so merely,
but with something to enhance it: not saying, “give thy cloak to him that asketh,” but “to
him that would sue thee at the law,” that is, “if he drag thee into court, and give thee trouble.”</p>
<p>And just as, after He had bidden not to call another fool, nor to be angry without cause,
He went on and required more, in that He commanded to offer the right cheek also; even
so here, having said, “Agree with thine adversary,” He again amplifies the precept. For now
He orders us not only to give what the other would have, but even to show forth a greater
liberality.</p>
<p>“What then!” one may say, “am I to go about naked?” We should not be naked, if we
obeyed these sayings with exactness; rather more abundantly than any should we be clothed.
For first, no one would attack men of this disposition; and next, if there chanced to be any
one so savage and ungentle, as to proceed even so far, yet many more would be found to
clothe him, who acted with such self-denial, not with garments only, but even with their
own flesh, if it were possible.</p>
<p>Further: even though one were of necessity to go about naked on account of this sort
of self-denial, neither so were it any disgrace. Since Adam too was “naked”792in paradise,
“and was not ashamed;” and Isaiah was “naked, and barefoot,” and more glorious than all
the Jews;793and Joseph794also, when he stripped himself, did then more than ever shine
forth. For to be thus naked is no evil, but to be so clad, as we now are, with costly garments,

<pb n="229"/>
this is both disgraceful and ridiculous. For this cause, you see, those had praise of God, but
these He blames, both by prophets and by apostles.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore suppose His injunctions impossible. Nay, for besides their expediency,
they are very easy, if we are sober-minded; and the profit of them is so great as to be
an exceeding help, not to ourselves only, but to those also who are using us despitefully.
And in this chiefly stands their excellence, that while they induce us to suffer wrong, they
by the same means teach them also that do the wrong to control themselves. For while he
on his part thinks it a great thing to take what belongs to others, but thou signifiest to him,
that to thee it is easy to give even what he doth not ask: while thou bringest in liberality for
a counterpoise to his meanness, and a wise moderation to his covetousness: consider what
a lesson he will get, being taught not by sayings, but by actual deeds, to scorn vice and to
seek after virtue.</p>
<p>For God will have us profitable not to ourselves alone, but to all our neighbors as well.
Now if thou givest, and abstainest from suing, thou hast sought thine own advantage only;
but if thou give him some other thing, thou hast made him too better, and so sent him away.
Of this nature is salt, which is what He would have them to be; seeing it both recruits795itself,
and keeps all other bodies with which it may associate: of this nature is light; for it shows
objects both to a man’s self and to all others. Forasmuch then as He hath set thee in the rank
of these things, help thou likewise him who is sitting in darkness, and teach him that neither
before did he take any thing by force: persuade him that he hath done no despite. Yea, for
thus thou thyself also wilt be had in more respect and reverence, if thou signify that thou
gavest freely and wert not robbed. Make therefore his sin, through thy moderation, an instance
of thine own bounty.</p>
<p>3. And if thou think this a great thing, wait, and thou wilt see clearly, that neither yet
hast thou attained to perfection. For not even here doth He stop with thee, who is laying
down the laws of patient endurance, but He proceeds even further, thus saying,</p>
<p>“If any one shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain.”796</p>
<p>Seest thou the height of self-denial? in this at least, that after giving thy coat, and thy
cloak, not even if thine enemy should wish to use thy naked body for hardships and labors,
not even so (saith He), must thou forbid him. For He would have us possess all things in
common, both our bodies and our goods, as with them that are in need, so with them that
insult us: for the latter comes of manliness, the former of mercifulness.</p>
<p>Because of this, He said, “If any one shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain:”
again leading thee higher up, and commanding thee to show forth the same kind of ambition.</p>
<note type="footnote">795 συγκροτε.</note>
<note type="footnote">796 Matt. v. 41.</note>

<pb n="230"/>
<p>For if the things of which He spake at the beginning, being far less than these, have so
great blessings pronounced on them; consider what sort of portion awaits them, who duly
perform these, and what they become even before their rewards, in a human and passible797body
winning entire freedom from passion. Since when neither insult, nor blows,
nor the spoiling of their property, galls them; while they give way to no such thing, but
rather add in large measure to their endurance; reflect what kind of training their soul is
undergoing.</p>
<p>On this account then, as in regard of blows, as in regard of our goods, so in this case
also, He hath bidden us act. “For why,” saith He, “do I mention insult, and property? Though
he should want to make use of thy very own limbs for toil and weary work, and this unjustly,
do thou again conquer and overpass His unjust desire.”</p>
<p>For “to compel”798is this, to drag unjustly and without any reason, and by way of despite.
Nevertheless, for this also be thou ready in thy station, so as to suffer more than the other
would fain do to thee.</p>
<p>“Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou
away.”799</p>
<p>These last are less than what went before; but marvel not, for this He is ever wont to do,
mingling the small with the great. And if these be little in comparison with those, let them
hearken, who take the goods of others, who distribute their own among harlots, and kindle
to themselves a double fire, both by the unrighteous income, and by the pernicious outlay.
But by “borrowing,” here, He means not the compact with usury, but the use merely.
And elsewhere He even amplifies it, saying that we should give to them, from whom we do
not expect to receive.800</p>
<p>4. “Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine
enemy. But I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them which despitefully use
you: bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you. That ye may become
like801your Father which is in Heaven; for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”802</p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p>See how He hath set the highest pinnacle on our good deeds. For this is why He teaches
not only to endure a blow, but to offer the right cheek also; not only to add the cloak to the
coat, but to travel also two miles with him who compels thee to go one; in order that thou
mightest receive with all facility that which is much more than these. “But what,” one may
say, “is more than these?” Not even to count as an enemy him who is doing these things: or
rather even somewhat else more than this. For He said not, “do not hate,” but “love;” He
said not, “do not injure,” but “do good.”</p>
<p>And if any one should examine accurately, he will see that even to these things somewhat
is added, much greater than they are. For neither did He simply command to love, but to
pray.</p>
<p>Seest thou how many steps He hath ascended, and how He hath set us on the very
summit of virtue? Nay, mark it, numbering from the beginning. A first step is, not to begin
with injustice: a second, after he hath begun, to vindicate one’s self by equal retaliation; a
third, not to do unto him that is vexing us the same that one hath suffered, but to be quiet;
a fourth, even to give one’s self up to suffer wrongfully; a fifth, to give up yet more than the
other, who did the wrong, wishes; a sixth, not to hate him who hath done so; a seventh, even
to love him; an eighth, to do him good also; a ninth, to entreat God Himself on his behalf.
Seest thou, what height of self-command? Wherefore glorious too, as we see, is the reward
which it hath. That is, because the thing enjoined was great, and needed a fervent803soul,
and much earnestness, He appoints for it also such a reward, as for none of the former. For
He makes not mention here of earth, as with respect to the meek; nor of comfort and mercy,
as with regard to the mourners and the merciful; nor of the kingdom of Heaven; but of that
which was more thrilling than all; our becoming like God, in such wise as men might become
so. For He saith, “That ye may become like unto your Father which is in Heaven.”</p>
<p>And observe, I pray thee, how neither in this place, nor in the preceding parts, doth He
call Him His own Father, but in that instance, “God,” and “a great King,” when He was
discoursing about oaths, and here, “their Father.” And this He doth, as reserving for the
proper season what He had to say touching these points.</p>
<p>5. Then, bringing the likeness yet closer, He saith,</p>
<p>“Because He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain upon
just and unjust.”804</p>
<p>“For He too, so far from hating,” so He speaks, “even pours benefits on those that insult
Him.” Yet surely in no respect is the case parallel, not only because of the surpassing nature
of His benefits, but also by reason of the excellence of His dignity. For thou indeed art despised
by thy fellow-slave, but He by His slave, who hath also received ten thousand benefits
<note type="footnote">803 νεανικ.</note>
<note type="footnote">804 Matt. v. 45.</note>

<pb n="232"/>
from Him: and thou indeed givest words, in praying for him, but He, deeds, very great and
marvellous, kindling the sun, and giving the annual showers. “Nevertheless, even so I grant
thee to be mine equal, in such wise as it is possible for a man so to be.”</p>
<p>Hate not then the man that doeth thee wrong, who is procuring thee such good things,
and bringing thee to so great honor. Curse not him that uses thee despitefully; for so hast
thou undergone the labor, but art deprived of the fruit; thou wilt bear the loss, but lose the
reward; which is of the utmost folly, having borne the more grievous, not to bear what is
less than it. “But how,” saith one, “is it possible for this to take place?” Having seen God
become man, and descend so far, and suffer so much for thy sake, dost thou still inquire
and doubt, how it is possible to forgive thy fellow-servants their injuriousness? Hearest thou
not Him on the cross, saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do?”805 Hearest
thou not Paul, when he saith, “He who is gone up on high, and is sitting on the right hand
intercedeth for us?”806 Seest thou not that even after the cross, and after He had been received
up, He sent the apostles unto the Jews that had slain Him, to bring them His ten thousand
blessings, and this, though they were to suffer ten thousand terrors at their hands?</p>
<p>6. But hast thou been greatly wronged? Nay, what hast thou endured like thy Lord,
bound, beaten with whips, with rods, spit upon by servants, enduring death, and that death,
which is of all deaths the most shameful, after ten thousand favors shown? And even if thou
hast been greatly wronged, for this very cause most of all do thou do him good, that thou
mayest both make thine own crown more glorious, and set thy brother free from the worst
infirmity. For so too the physicians, when they are kicked, and shamefully handled by the
insane, then most of all pity them, and take measures for their perfect cure, knowing that
the insult comes of the extremity of their disease. Now I bid thee too have the same mind
touching them that are plotting against thee, and do thou so treat them that are injuring
thee. For it is they above all that are diseased, it is they who are undergoing all the violence.
Deliver him then from this grievous contumely, and grant him to let go his anger, and set
him free from that grievous demon, wrath. Yea, for if we see persons possessed by devils,
we weep for them; we do not seek to be ourselves also possessed.</p>
<p>Now let us do this too likewise with respect to them that are angry; for in truth the enraged
are like the possessed; yea rather, are more wretched than they, being mad with consciousness
of it. Wherefore also their frenzy is without excuse. Trample not then on the
fallen, but rather pity him. For so, should we see any one troubled with bile, blinded and
giddy, and straining to cast up this evil humor, we stretch forth a hand, and continue to
support him through his struggles, and though we stain our garments, we regard it not, but
seek one thing only, how we may set him free from this grievous distress. This then let us
<note type="footnote">805 Luke xxiii. 34.</note>
<note type="footnote">806 Rom. viii. 34.</note>

<pb n="233"/>
do with respect to the angry also, and continue to bear them up when vomiting and struggling;
nor let him go, until he put from him all the bitterness. And then shall he feel toward
thee the greatest thankfulness; when he is at rest, then he will know clearly from how great
trouble thou hast released him.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of the thanks from him? for God will straightway crown thee, and
will requite thee with ten thousand honors, because thou hast freed thy brother from a
grievous disease; and that brother too will honor thee as a master, ever reverencing thy
forbearance.</p>
<p>Seest thou not the women that are in travail, how they bite those that stand by, and they
are not pained? or rather they are pained, but bear it bravely, and sympathize with them
who are in sorrow and are torn by those pangs. These do thou too emulate, and prove not
softer than women. For after these women have brought forth (for these men are more
feeble minded than women), then they will know thee to be a man in comparison.807of
Heaven?</p>
<p>9. What then can we deserve, who are commanded to emulate God, and are perhaps in
a way not so much as to equal the publicans? For if “to love them that love us” be the part
of publicans, sinners, and heathens: when we do not even this (and we do it not, so long as
we envy our brethren who are in honor), what penalty shall we not incur, commanded as
we are to surpass the scribes, and taking our place below the heathens? How then shall we
behold the kingdom, I pray thee? how shall we set foot on that holy threshold, who are not
surpassing even the publicans? For this He covertly signified, when He said, “Do not even
the publicans the same?”</p>
<p>And this thing most especially we may admire in His teaching, that while in each instance
He sets down with very great fullness the prizes of the conflicts; such as “to see God,” and
“to inherit the kingdom of Heaven,” and “to become sons of God,” and “like God,” and “to
obtain mercy,” and “to be comforted,” and “the great reward:” if anywhere He must needs
mention things grievous, He doth this in a subdued tone. Thus in the first place, the name
of hell He hath set down once only in so many sentences; and in some other instances too,
it is with reserve that He corrects the hearer, and as though he were managing His discourse
rather in the way of shaming than threatening him; where He saith, “do not even the publicans
the same?” and, “if the salt have lost its savor;” and, “he shall be called least in the
kingdom of Heaven.”</p>
<p>And there are places where He puts down the sin itself by way of punishment, leaving
to the hearer to infer the grievousness of the punishment: as when He saith, “he hath committed
adultery with her in his heart;” and, “he that putteth away causeth her to commit
adultery;” and, “That which is more than these is of the evil one.” For to them that have
<note type="footnote">807 σε τν νδρα εσονταιἁψδα.</note>

<pb n="234"/>
understanding, instead of the mention of the punishment, the very greatness of the sin is
sufficient for correction.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He here brings forward the heathens and the publicans, by the quality
of the person putting the disciple to shame. Which Paul too did, saying, “Sorrow not, even
as the rest which have no hope;”808and, “Even as the Gentiles which know not God.”809</p>
<p>And to signify that He requires nothing very overpowering, but a little more than was
accustomed, He saith,</p>
<p>“Do not even the Gentiles810the same?”811 Yet nevertheless He stops not the discourse
at this, but makes it end with His rewards, and those good hopes, saying,</p>
<p>“Be ye therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father.”812</p>
<p>And He intersperses everywhere abundantly the name of the heavens, by the very place
thoroughly elevating their minds. For as yet, I know not how, they were somewhat weak
and dull.</p>
<p>10. Let us then, bearing in mind all the things which have been said, show forth great
love even towards our enemies; and let us cast away that ridiculous custom, to which many
of the more thoughtless give way, waiting for those that meet them to address them first.
Towards that which hath a great blessing, they have no zeal; but what is ridiculous, that they
follow after.</p>
<p>Wherefore now dost thou not address him first? “Because he is waiting for this,” is the
reply. Nay, for this very reason most of all thou shouldest have sprung forward to him, that
thou mightest win the crown. “No,” saith he, “since this was his object.” And what can be
worse than this folly? That is, “Because this,” saith he, “was his object;—to become procurer
of a reward for me;—I will not put my hand to what he has thus suggested.” Now if he first
address thee, thou gainest nothing, even though thou accost him. But if thou be first to
spring forward and speak to him, thou hast made thyself profit of his pride, and hast gathered
in a manner abundant fruit from his obstinacy.813 What is it then but the utmost folly, when
we are to reap so large fruit from bare words, to give up the gain; and condemning him, to
stumble at the very same thing? For if thou blamest him for this, that he first waits to be
addressed by another, wherefore dost thou emulate that same thing which thou accusest?

That which thou saidst was evil, why art thou to imitate the same as good? Seest thou how
that nothing is more senseless than a man who associates with wickedness? Wherefore, I
entreat, let us flee this evil and ridiculous practice. Yea, for ten thousand friendships hath
this pestilence overthrown, many enmities hath it wrought.</p>
<p>For this cause then let us anticipate them. Since we who are commanded to take blows,
and be compelled to journey,814and to be stripped by enemies, and to bear it; what kind of
indulgence should we deserve, exhibiting so great contentiousness in a mere formal address?</p>
<p>11. “Why,” saith one, “we are despised and spit upon, the moment we have given him
up this.” And in order that man may not despise thee, dost thou offend God? And in order
that thy frenzied fellow servant may not despise thee, dost thou despise the Lord, who hath
bestowed on thee benefits so great? Nay, if it be amiss that thine equal should despise thee,
how much more that thou shouldest despise the God that made thee?</p>
<p>And together with this, consider that other point also; that when he despises thee, he is
at that very moment employed in procuring to thee a greater reward. Since for God’s sake
thou submittest to it, because thou hast hearkened to His laws. And this, to what kind of
honor is it not equal? to how many diadems? Be it my portion both to be insulted and despised
for God’s sake, rather than to be honored by all kings; for nothing, nothing is equal
to this glory.</p>
<p>This then let us pursue, in such wise as Himself commanded, and making no account
of the things of men, but showing forth perfect self restraint in all things, let us so direct our
own lives. For so even now, from this very time, we shall enjoy the good things of the
heavens, and of the crowns that are there, walking as angels among men, going about in the
earth like the angelic powers, and abiding apart from all lust, from all turmoil.</p>
<p>And together with all these things we shall receive also the unutterable blessings: unto
which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory, and power, and worship, with the unoriginate Father, and the Holy and
Good Spirit, now and always, even forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. VI. 1.</p>
<p>“Take heed that ye do not your alms815before men, to be seen of them.”</p>
<p>He roots out in what remains the most tyrannical passion of all, the rage and madness
with respect to vainglory, which springs up in them that do right. For at first He had not at
all discoursed about it; it being indeed superfluous, before He had persuaded them to do
any of the things which they ought, to teach in which way they should practise and pursue
them.</p>
<p>But after He had led them on to self-command, then He proceeds to purge away also
the alloy which secretly subsists with it. For this disease is by no means of random birth;
but when we have duly performed many of the commandments.</p>
<p>It behooved therefore first to implant virtue, and then to remove the passion which
mars its fruit.</p>
<p>And see with what He begins, with fasting, and prayer, and almsgiving: for in these good
deeds most especially it is wont to make its haunt. The Pharisee, for instance, was hereby
puffed up, who saith, “I fast twice a week, I give tithes of my substance.”816 And he was
vainglorious too in his very prayer, making it for display. For since there was no one else
present, he pointed himself out to the publican,817saying, “I am not as the rest of men, nor
even as this publican.”818</p>
<p>And mark how Christ began, as though He were speaking of some wild beast, hard to
catch, and crafty to deceive him who was not very watchful. Thus, “take heed,” saith He, “as
to your alms.” So Paul also speaks to the Philippians; “Beware of dogs.”819 And with reason,
for820the evil beast comes in upon us secretly, and without noise puffs all away, and unobservedly
carries out all that is within.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as He had made much discourse about almsgiving, and brought forward
God, “Who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and the good,”821and by motives from all
<note type="footnote">815 [All authorities of an early period, including many fathers prior to Chrysostom, read δικαιοσνην (comp.

quarters had urged them on to this, and had persuaded them to exult in the abundance of
their giving; He finishes by taking away also all things that encumber this fair olive tree. For
which same cause He saith, “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men,” for that which
was before mentioned, is “God’s” almsgiving.</p>
<p>2. And when He had said, “not to do it before men,” He added, “to be seen of them.”
And though it seems as if the same thing were said a second time, yet if any one give particular
attention, it is not the same thing, but one is different from the other; and it hath great
security, and unspeakable care and tenderness. For it may be, both that one doing alms before
men may not do it to be seen of them, and again that one not doing it before men may do
it to be seen of them. Wherefore it is not simply the thing, but the intent, which He both
punishes and rewards. And unless such exactness were employed, this would make many
more backward about the giving of alms, because it is not on every occasion altogether
possible to do it secretly. For this cause, setting thee free from this restraint, He defines both
the penalty and the reward not by the result of the action, but by the intention of the doer.</p>
<p>That is, that thou mayest not say, “What? am I then the worse, should another see?”—“it
is not this,” saith He, “that I am seeking, but the mind that is in thee, and the tone of what
thou doest.” For His will is to bring our soul altogether into frame, and to deliver it from
every disease. Now having, as you see, forbidden men’s acting for display, and having taught
them the penalty thence ensuing, namely, to do it vainly, and for nought, He again rouses
their spirits by putting them in mind of the Father, and of Heaven, that not by the loss alone
He might sting them, but also shame them by the recollection of Him who gave them being.</p>
<p>“For ye have no reward,” saith He, “with your Father which is in Heaven.”822</p>
<p>Nor even at this did He stop, but proceeds yet further, by other motives also increasing
their disgust. For as above He set forth publicans and heathens, by the quality of the person
shaming their imitators, so also in this place the hypocrites.</p>
<p>“Therefore when thou doest thine alms,” saith He, “do not sound a trumpet before thee,
as the hypocrites do.”823</p>
<p>Not that they had trumpets, but He means to display the greatness of their frenzy, by
the use of this figure of speech, deriding and making a show824of them hereby.</p>
<p>And well hath He called them “hypocrites” for the mask was of mercy, but the spirit of
cruelty and inhumanity. For they do it, not because they pity their neighbors, but that they
themselves may enjoy credit; and this came of the utmost cruelty; while another was perishing
with hunger, to be seeking vainglory, and not putting an end to his suffering.</p>

<pb n="238"/>
<p>It is not then the giving alms which is required, but the giving as one ought, the giving
for such and such an end.825</p>
<p>Having then amply derided those men, and having handled them so, that the hearer
should be even ashamed of them, He again corrects thoroughly the mind which is so distempered:
and having said how we ought not to act, He signifies on the other hand how we
ought to act. How then ought we to do our alms?826</p>
<p>“Let not thy left hand know,” saith He, “what thy right hand doeth.”827</p>
<p>Here again His enigmatical meaning is not of the hands, but He hath put the thing hyperbolically.
As thus: “If it can be,” saith He, “for thyself not to know it, let this be the object
of thine endeavor; that, if it were possible, it may be concealed from the very hands that
minister.” It is not, as some say, that we should hide it from wrong-headed828men, for He
hath here commanded that it should be concealed from all.</p>
<p>And then the reward too; consider how great it is. For after He had spoken of the punishment
from the one, He points out also the honor derived from the other; from either side
urging them, and leading them on to high lessons. Yea, for He is persuading them to know
that God is everywhere present, and that not by our present life are our interests limited,
but a yet more awful tribunal will receive us when we go hence, and the account of all our
doings, and honors, and punishments: and that no one will be hid in doing anything either
great or small, though he seem to be hid from men. For all this did He darkly signify, when
He said,</p>
<p>“Thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”829</p>
<p>Setting for him a great and august assemblage of spectators, and what He desires, that
very thing bestowing on him in great abundance. “For what,” saith He, “dost thou wish? is
it not to have some to be spectators of what is going on? Behold then, thou hast some; not
angels, nor archangels, but the God of all.” And if thou desire to have men also as spectators,
neither of this desire doth He deprive thee at the fitting season, but rather in greater
abundance affords it unto thee. For, if thou shouldest now make a display, thou wilt be able
to make it to ten only, or twenty, or (we will say) a hundred persons: but if thou take pains
to lie hid now, God Himself will then proclaim thee in the presence of the whole universe.
Wherefore above all, if thou wilt have men see thy good deeds, hide them now, that then

all may look on them with the more honor, God making them manifest, and extolling them,
and proclaiming them before all. Again, whereas now they that behold will rather condemn
thee as vainglorious; when they see thee crowned, so far from condemning, they will even
admire thee, all of them. When therefore by waiting a little, thou mayest both receive a reward,
and reap greater admiration; consider what folly it is to cast thyself out of both these;
and while thou art seeking thy reward from God, and while God is beholding, to summon
men for the display of what is going on. Why, if display must be made of our love, to our
Father above all should we make it; and this most especially, when our Father hath the power
both to crown and to punish.</p>
<p>And let me add, even were there no penalty, it were not meet for him who desires glory,
to let go this our theatre, and take in exchange that of men. For who is there so wretched,
as that when the king was hastening to come and see his achievements, he would let him
go, and make up his assembly of spectators of poor men and beggars? For this cause then,
He not only commands to make no display, but even to take pains to be concealed: it not
being at all the same, not to strive for publicity, and to strive for concealment.</p>
<p>3. “And when ye pray,” saith He, “ye shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray
standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets. Verily I say unto you, they
have their reward.”830</p>
<p>“But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door,
pray to thy Father which is in secret.”831</p>
<p>These too again He calls “hypocrites,” and very fitly; for while they are feigning to pray
to God, they are looking round after men; wearing the garb not of suppliants, but of ridiculous
persons. For he, who is to do a suppliant’s office, letting go all other, looks to him alone,
who hath power to grant his request. But if thou leave this one, and go about wandering
and casting around thine eyes everywhere, thou wilt depart with empty hands. For this was
thine own will. Wherefore He said not, “such shall not receive a reward,” but, “they have it
out:” that is, they shall indeed receive one, but from those of whom they themselves desire
to have it. For God wills not this: He rather for His part was willing to bestow on men the
recompence that comes from Himself; but they seeking that which is from men, can be no
longer justly entitled to receive from Him, for whom they have done nothing.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, the lovingkindness of God, in that He promises to bestow on us
a reward, even for those good things which we ask of Him.</p>
<p>Having then discredited them, who order not this duty as they ought, both from the
place and from their disposition of mind, and having shown that they are very ridiculous:
<note type="footnote">830 Matt. vi. 5. [R.V., “to stand and pray,” and, “They have received their reward.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">831 Matt. vi. 6. [R.V., “Enter into thine inner chamber and having shut thy door, pray,” etc.—R.]</note>

<pb n="240"/>
He introduces the best manner of prayer, and again gives the reward, saying, “Enter into
thy closet.”</p>
<p>“What then,” it may be said, “ought we not to pray in church?” Indeed we ought by all
means, but in such a spirit as this. Because everywhere God seeks the intention of all that is
done. Since even if thou shouldest enter into thy closet, and having shut the door, shouldest
do it for display, the doors will do thee no good.</p>
<p>It is worth observing in this case also, how exact the definition, which He made when
He said, “That they may appear unto men.” So that even if thou shut the doors, this He desires
thee duly to perform, rather than the shutting of the doors, even to shut the doors of the
mind. For as in everything it is good to be freed from vainglory, so most especially in prayer.
For if even without this, we wander and are distracted, when shall we attend unto the things
which we are saying, should we enter in having this disease also? And if we who pray and
beseech attend not, how do we expect God to attend?</p>
<p>4. But yet some there are, who after such and so earnest charges, behave themselves so
unseemly in prayer, that even when their person is concealed, they make themselves manifest
to all by their voice, crying out disorderly,832and rendering themselves objects of ridicule
both by gesture and voice. Seest thou not that even in a market place, should any one come
up doing like this, and begging clamorously, he wilt drive away him whom he is petitioning;
but if quietly, and with the proper gesture, then he rather wins over him that can grant the
favor?</p>
<p>Let us not then make our prayer by the gesture of our body, nor by the loudness of our
voice, but by the earnestness of our mind: neither with noise and clamor and for display,
so as even to disturb those that are near us, but with all modesty,833and with contrition in
the mind, and with inward tears.</p>
<p>But art thou pained in mind, and canst not help crying aloud? yet surely it is the part
of one exceedingly pained to pray and entreat even as I have said. Since Moses too was
pained, and prayed in this way and was heard; for this cause also God said unto him,
“Wherefore criest thou unto me.”834 And Hannah too again, her voice not being heard,
accomplished all she wished, forasmuch as her heart cried out.835 But Abel prayed not only
when silent, but even when dying, and his blood sent forth a cry more clear than a trumpet.836</p>
<p>Do thou also then groan, even as that holy one, I forbid it not. “Rend,” as the prophet
commanded,837“thine heart, and not thy garments.” Out of deeps call upon God, for it is

<pb n="241"/>
said, “Out of the depths have I cried to Thee, O Lord.”838 From beneath, out of the heart,
draw forth a voice, make thy prayer a mystery. Seest thou not that even in the houses of
kings all tumult is put away, and great on all sides is the silence? Do thou also therefore,
entering as into a palace,—not that on the earth, but what is far more awful than it, that
which is in heaven,—show forth great seemliness. Yea, for thou art joined to the choirs of
angels, and art in communion with archangels, and art singing with the seraphim. And all
these tribes show forth much goodly order, singing with great awe that mystical strain, and
their sacred hymns to God, the King of all. With these then mingle thyself, when thou art
praying, and emulate their mystical order.</p>
<p>For not unto men art thou praying, but to God, who is everywhere present, who hears
even before the voice, who knows the secrets of the mind. If thou so pray, great is the reward
thou shalt receive.</p>
<p>“For thy Father,” saith He, “who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.”839</p>
<p>He said not, “shall freely give thee,” but, “shall reward thee;” yea, for He hath made
Himself a debtor to thee, and even from this hath honored thee with great honor. For because
He Himself is invisible, He would have thy prayer be so likewise.</p>
<p>5. Then He speaks even the very words of the prayer.</p>
<p>“When ye pray,” saith He, “use no vain repetitions, even as the heathen do.”840</p>
<p>You see that when He was discoursing of almsgiving, He removed only that mischief
which comes of vainglory, and added nothing more; neither did He say whence one should
give alms; as from honest labor, and not from rapine nor covetousness: this being abundantly
acknowledged among all. And also before that, He had thoroughly cleared up this point,
when He blessed them “that hunger after righteousness.”</p>
<p>But touching prayer, He adds somewhat over and above; “not to use vain repetitions.”
And as there He derides the hypocrites, so here the heathen; shaming the hearer everywhere
most of all by the vileness of the persons. For since this, in most cases, is especially biting
and stinging, I mean our appearing to be likened to outcast persons; by this topic He dissuades
them; calling frivolousness, here, by the name of “vain repetition:” as when we ask
of God things unsuitable, kingdoms, and glory, and to get the better of enemies, and
abundance of wealth, and in general what does not at all concern us.</p>
<p>“For He knoweth,” saith He, “what things ye have need of.”841</p>
<p>And herewith He seems to me to command in this place, that neither should we make
our prayers long; long, I mean, not in time, but in the number and length of the things

mentioned. For perseverance indeed in the same requests is our duty: His word being,
“continuing instant in prayer.”842</p>
<p>And He Himself too, by that example of the widow, who prevailed with the pitiless and
cruel ruler, by the continuance of her intercession;843and by that of the friend, who came
late at night time, and roused the sleeper from his bed,844not for his friendship’s, but for
his importunity’s sake; what did He, but lay down a law, that all should continually make
supplication unto Him? He doth not however bid us compose a prayer of ten thousand
clauses, and so come to Him and merely repeat it. For this He obscurely signified when He
said, “They think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.”</p>
<p>“For He knoweth,” saith He, “what things ye have need of.” And if He know, one may
say, what we have need of, wherefore must we pray? Not to instruct Him, but to prevail with
Him; to be made intimate with Him, by continuance in supplication; to be humbled; to be
reminded of thy sins.</p>
<p>6. “After this manner, therefore, pray ye,” saith He: “Our Father, which art in heaven.”845
See how He straightway stirred up the hearer, and reminded him of all God’s bounty
in the beginning. For he who calls God Father, by him both remission of sins, and taking
away of punishment, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, and adoption,
and inheritance, and brotherhood with the Only-Begotten, and the supply of the Spirit, are
acknowledged in this single title. For one cannot call God Father, without having attained
to all those blessings. Doubly, therefore, doth He awaken their spirit, both by the dignity of
Him who is called on, and by the greatness of the benefits which they have enjoyed. But
when He saith, “in Heaven,” He speaks not this as shutting up God there, but as withdrawing
him who is praying from earth, and fixing him in the high places, and in the dwellings above.</p>
<p>He teaches, moreover, to make our prayer common, in behalf of our brethren also. For
He saith not, “my Father, which art in Heaven,” but, “our Father,” offering up his supplications
for the body in common, and nowhere looking to his own, but everywhere to his
neighbor’s good. And by this He at once takes away hatred, and quells pride, and casts out
envy, and brings in the mother of all good things, even charity, and exterminates the inequality
of human things, and shows how far the equality reaches between the king and the poor
man, if at least in those things which are greatest and most indispensable, we are all of us

fellows. For what harm comes of our kindred below, when in that which is on high we are
all of us knit together, and no one hath aught more than another; neither the rich more than
the poor, nor the master than the servant, neither the ruler than the subject, nor the king
than the common soldier, nor the philosopher than the barbarian, nor the skillful than the
unlearned? For to all hath He given one nobility, having vouchsafed to be called the Father
of all alike.</p>
<p>7. When therefore He hath reminded us of this nobility, and of the gift from above, and
of our equality with our brethren, and of charity; and when He hath removed us from earth,
and fixed us in Heaven; let us see what He commands us to ask after this. Not but, in the
first place, even that saying alone is sufficient to implant instruction in all virtue. For he
who hath called God Father, and a common Father, would be justly bound to show forth
such a conversation, as not to appear unworthy of this nobility, and to exhibit a diligence
proportionate to the gift. Yet is He not satisfied with this, but adds, also another clause, thus
saying,</p>
<p>“Hallowed be Thy name.”</p>
<p>Worthy of him who calls God Father, is the prayer to ask nothing before the glory of
His Father, but to account all things secondary to the work of praising Him. For “hallowed”
is glorified. For His own glory He hath complete, and ever continuing the same, but He
commands him who prays to seek that He may be glorified also by our life. Which very
thing He had said before likewise, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”846 Yea, and the seraphim
too, giving glory, said on this wise, “Holy, holy, holy.”847 So that “hallowed” means this, viz.
“glorified.” That is, “vouchsafe,” saith he, “that we may live so purely, that through us all
may glorify Thee.” Which thing again appertains unto perfect self-control, to present to all
a life so irreprehensible, that every one of the beholders may offer to the Lord the praise due
to Him for this.</p>
<p>“Thy kingdom come.”848</p>
<p>And this again is the language of a right-minded child, not to be rivetted to things that
are seen, neither to account things present some great matter; but to hasten unto our Father,
and to long for the things to come. And this springs out of a good conscience, and a soul
set free from things that are on earth. This, for instance, Paul himself was longing after every
day: wherefore he also said, that “even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit,
groan, waiting for an adoption, the redemption of our body.”849 For he who hath this

fondness,850can neither be puffed up by the good things of this life, nor abashed by its sorrows;
but as though dwelling in the very heavens, is freed from each sort of irregularity.851</p>
<p>“Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.”</p>
<p>Behold a most excellent train of thought! in that He bade us indeed long for the things
to come, and hasten towards that sojourn; and, till that may be, even while we abide here,
so long to be earnest in showing forth the same conversation as those above. For ye must
long, saith He, for heaven, and the things in heaven; however, even before heaven, He hath
bidden us make the earth a heaven and do and say all things, even while we are continuing
in it, as having our conversation there; insomuch that these too should be objects of our
prayer to the Lord. For there is nothing to hinder our reaching the perfection of the powers
above, because we inhabit the earth; but it is possible even while abiding here, to do all, as
though already placed on high. What He saith therefore is this: “As there all things are done
without hindrance, and the angels are not partly obedient and partly disobedient, but in all
things yield and obey (for He saith, ‘Mighty in strength, performing His word’);852so
vouchsafe that we men may not do Thy will by halves, but perform all things as Thou willest.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He hath taught us also to be modest, by making it clear that virtue is
not of our endeavors only, but also of the grace from above? And again, He hath enjoined
each one of us, who pray, to take upon himself the care of the whole world. For He did not
at all say, “Thy will be done” in me, or in us, but everywhere on the earth; so that error may
be destroyed, and truth implanted, and all wickedness cast out, and virtue return, and no
difference in this respect be henceforth between heaven and earth. “For if this come to pass,”
saith He, “there will be no difference between things below and above, separated as they are
in nature; the earth exhibiting to us another set of angels.”</p>

text is, Τ στι, Τον ρτον τν πιυσιον; Το φμερον. The word ἐπιοσιο is found only in Matt. vi. 11, Luke xi. 3, and
in the Christian literature based on these passages. As all Biblical scholars are aware, the etymology and meaning
are still open to discussion. See Thayer’s Greek Lexicon, New Testament, sub voce. The Fathers generally gave it
a spiritual or mystical sense, and Chrysostom’s position is, therefore, the more important. The modern views
may be inferred from the R.V., which in the text of both renders the word “daily,” with the margin “Greek, our
bread for the coming day,” but the American Company add as a second marginal rendering, “our needful bread.”
These two marginal renderings represent two distinct etymologies, while “daily” is an explanatory or inferential
rendering, for which the authority of Chrysostom has furnished strong support.—R.]</note>

<p>For because He had said thus, “Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,” but was
discoursing to men encompassed with flesh, and subject to the necessities of nature, and
incapable of the same impassibility with the angels:—while He enjoins the commands to be
practised by us also, even as they perform them; He condescends likewise, in what follows,
to the infirmity of our nature. Thus, “perfection of conduct,” saith He, “I require as great,
not however freedom from passions; no, for the tyranny of nature permits it not: for it requires
necessary food.” But mark, I pray thee, how even in things that are bodily, that which
is spiritual abounds. For it is neither for riches, nor for delicate living, nor for costly raiment,
nor for any other such thing, but for bread only, that He hath commanded us to make our
prayer. And for “daily bread,” so as not to “take thought for the morrow.”855 Because of
this He added, “daily bread,” that is, bread for one day.</p>
<p>And not even with this expression is He satisfied, but adds another too afterwards,
saying, “Give us this day;” so that we may not, beyond this, wear ourselves out with the care
of the following day. For that day, the interval856before which thou knowest not whether
thou shalt see, wherefore dost thou submit to its cares?</p>
<p>This, as He proceeded, he enjoined also more fully, saying, “Take no thought for the
morrow.” He would have us be on every hand unencumbered and winged for flight, yielding
just so much to nature as the compulsion of necessity requires of us.</p>
<p>9. Then forasmuch as it comes to pass that we sin even after the washing of regeneration,
He, showing His love to man to be great even in this case, commands us for the remission
of our sins to come unto God who loves man, and thus to say,
“Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.”857</p>
<p>Seest thou surpassing mercy? After taking away so great evils, and after the unspeakable
greatness of His gift, if men sin again, He counts them such as may be forgiven. For that
this prayer belongs to believers, is taught us both by the laws of the church, and by the beginning
of the prayer. For the uninitiated could not call God Father. If then the prayer belongs
to believers, and they pray, entreating that sins may be forgiven them, it is clear that not
even after the laver is the profit of repentance taken away. Since, had He not meant to signify
this, He would not have made a law that we should so pray. Now He who both brings sins
to remembrance, and bids us ask forgiveness, and teaches how we may obtain remission
and so makes the way easy; it is perfectly clear that He introduced this rule of supplication,
as knowing, and signifying, that it is possible even after the font858to wash ourselves from

our offenses; by reminding us of our sins, persuading us to be modest; by the command to
forgive others, setting us free from all revengeful passion; while by promising in return for
this to pardon us also, He holds out good hopes, and instructs us to have high
views859concerning the unspeakable mercy of God toward man.</p>
<p>But what we should most observe is this, that whereas in each of the clauses He had
made mention of the whole of virtue, and in this way had included also the forgetfulness of
injuries (for so, that “His name be hallowed,” is the exactness of a perfect conversation; and
that “His will be done,” declares the same thing again: and to be able to call God “Father,”
is the profession of a blameless life; in all which things had been comprehended also the
duty of remitting our anger against them that have transgressed): still He was not satisfied
with these, but meaning to signify how earnest He is in the matter, He sets it down also in
particular, and after the prayer, He makes mention of no other commandment than this,
saying thus:</p>
<p>“For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you.”860</p>
<p>So that the beginning is of us, and we ourselves have control over the judgment that is
to be passed upon us. For in order that no one, even of the senseless, might have any complaint
to make, either great or small, when brought to judgment; on thee, who art to give
account, He causes the sentence to depend; and “in what way soever thou hast judged for
thyself,861in the same,” saith He, “do I also judge thee.” And if thou forgive thy fellow servant,
thou shalt obtain the same favor from me; though indeed the one be not equal to the other.
For thou forgivest in thy need, but God, having need of none: thou, thy fellow slave; God,
His slave: thou liable to unnumbered charges; God, being without sin. But yet even thus
doth He show forth His lovingkindness towards man.</p>
<p>Since He might indeed, even without this, forgive thee all thine offenses; but He wills
thee hereby also to receive a benefit; affording thee on all sides innumerable occasions of
gentleness and love to man, casting out what is brutish in thee, and quenching wrath, and
in all ways cementing thee to him who is thine own member.</p>
<p>For what canst thou have to say? that thou hast wrongfully endured some ill of thy
neighbor? (For these only are trespasses, since if it be done with justice, the act is not a
trespass.) But thou too art drawing near to receive forgiveness for such things, and for much
greater. And even before the forgiveness, thou hast received no small gift, in being taught
to have a human soul, and in being trained to all gentleness. And herewith a great reward
shall also be laid up for thee elsewhere, even to be called to account for none of thine offenses.</p>

<p>What sort of punishment then do we not deserve, when after having received the privilege,
we betray our salvation? And how shall we claim to be heard in the rest of our matters,
if we will not, in those which depend on us, spare our own selves?</p>
<p>10. “And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil one: for Thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.”862
Here He teaches us plainly our own vileness, and quells our pride, instructing us to deprecate
all conflicts, instead of rushing upon them. For so both our victory will be more
glorious, and the devil’s overthrow more to be derided. I mean, that as when we are dragged
forth, we must stand nobly; so when we are not summoned, we should be quiet, and wait
for the time of conflict; that we may show both freedom from vainglory, and nobleness of
spirit.</p>
<p>And He here calls the devil “the wicked one,” commanding us to wage against him a
war that knows no truce, and implying that he is not such by nature. For wickedness863is
not of those things that are from nature, but of them that are added by our own choice. And
he is so called pre-eminently, by reason of the excess of his wickedness, and because he, in
no respect injured by us, wages against us implacable war. Wherefore neither said He, “deliver
us from the wicked ones,” but, “from the wicked one;” instructing us in no case to entertain
displeasure against our neighbors, for what wrongs soever we may suffer at their
hands, but to transfer our enmity from these to him, as being himself the cause of all our
wrongs.</p>
<p>Having then made us anxious as before conflict, by putting us in mind of the enemy,
and having cut away from us all our remissness; He again encourages and raises our spirits,
by bringing to our remembrance the King under whom we are arrayed, and signifying Him
to be more powerful than all. “For Thine,” saith He, “is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory.”</p>
<p>Doth it not then follow, that if His be the kingdom, we should fear no one, since there
can be none to withstand, and divide the empire with him. For when He saith, “Thine is the
kingdom,” He sets before us even him, who is warring against us, brought into subjection,
though he seem to oppose, God for a while permitting it. For in truth he too is among God’s
servants, though of the degraded class, and those guilty of offense; and he would not dare
set upon any of his fellow servants, had he not first received license from above. And why
say I, “his fellow servants?” Not even against swine did he venture any outrage, until He

one” is unqualifedly accepted; (2) that the doxology is given without any suggestion of doubt respecting the
genuineness of it. Here, as so often, the exegetical accuracy of Chrysostom appears to exceed his critical estimate
of the Greek text of the New Testament.—R.]</note>

Himself allowed him;864nor against flocks, nor herds, until he had received permission from
above.865</p>
<p>“And the power,” saith He. Therefore, manifold as thy weakness may be, thou mayest
of right be confident, having such a one to reign over thee, who is able fully to accomplish
all, and that with ease, even by thee.</p>
<p>“And the glory, for ever. Amen.” Thus He not only frees thee from the dangers that are
approaching thee, but can make thee also glorious and illustrious. For as His power is great,
so also is His glory unspeakable, and they are all boundless, and no end of them. Seest thou
how He hath by every means anointed His Champion, and hath framed Him to be full of
confidence?</p>
<p>11. Then, as I said before, meaning to signify, that of all things He most loathes and
hates bearing malice, and most of all accepts the virtue which is opposite to that vice; He
hath after the prayer also again put us in mind of this same point of goodness; both by the
punishment set, and by the reward appointed, urging the hearer to obey this command.</p>
<p>“For if ye forgive men,” saith He, “your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye
forgive not, neither will He forgive you.”866</p>
<p>With this view He hath again mentioned heaven also, and their Father; to abash the
hearer by this topic likewise; that he of all people, being of such a Father, should be made a
wild beast of; and summoned as he is to heaven, should cherish an earthly and ordinary867sort
of mind. Since not by grace only, you see, ought we to become His children, but also by our
works. And nothing makes us so like God, as being ready to forgive the wicked and wrongdoers;
even as indeed He had taught before, when He spake of His “making the sun to shine
on the evil and on the good.”868</p>
<p>For this same cause again in every one of the clauses He commands us to make our
prayers common, saying, “Our Father,” and “Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,”
and “Give us the bread, and forgive us our debts,” and “lead us not into temptation,” and
“deliver us;” everywhere commanding us to use this plural word, that we may not retain so
much as a vestige of anger against our neighbor.</p>
<p>How great punishment then must they deserve, who after all this, so far from themselves
forgiving, do even entreat God for vengeance on their enemies, and diametrically as it were
transgress this law; and this while He is doing and contriving all, to hinder our being at

variance one with another? For since love is the root of all that is good, He removing from
all sides whatever mars it, brings us together, and cements us to each other. For there is not,
there is not one, be he father, or mother, or friend, or what you will, who so loved us as the
God who created us. And this, above all things, both His daily benefits and His precepts
make manifest. But if thou tell me of the pains, and of the sorrows, and of the evils of life;
consider in how many things thou offendest Him every day, and thou wilt no longer marvel,
though more than these evils should come upon thee, but if thou shouldest enjoy any good,
then thou wilt marvel, and be amazed. But as it is, we look upon the calamities that come
upon us, but the offenses, whereby we offend daily, we consider not: therefore we are perplexed.
Since if we did but reckon up with strictness our sins of one day only, in that case
we should know well how great evils we must be liable to.</p>
<p>And to let pass the other misdoings of which we have been guilty, each one for himself,
and to speak of what have been committed this day; although of course I know not in what
each of us may have sinned, yet such is the abundance of our misdoings, that not even he
who knew all exactly would be able to choose from among these only. Which of us, for instance,
hath not been careless in his prayers? Which hath not been insolent, or vainglorious?
Who hath not spoken evil of his brother, hath not admitted a wicked desire, hath not looked
with unchaste eyes, hath not remembered things with hostile feeling, even till he made his
heart swell?</p>
<p>And if while we are in church, and in a short time we have become guilty of so great
evils; what shall be when we are gone out from hence? If in the harbor the waves are so high,
when we are gone forth into the channel of wickednesses, the forum I mean, and to public
business, and our cares at home, shall we indeed be able so much as to know ourselves again?</p>
<p>But yet from our so great and so many sins, God hath given us a short and easy way of
deliverance, and one that is free from all toil. For what sort of toil is it to forgive him that
hath grieved us? Nay, it is a toil not to forgive, but to keep up our enmity: even as to be delivered
from the anger, both works in us a great refreshment, and is very easy to him that
is willing. For there is no sea to be crossed, nor long journey to be travelled, nor summits
of mountains to be passed over, nor money to be spent, no need to torment thy body; but
it suffices to be willing only, and all our sins are done away.</p>
<p>But if so far from forgiving him thyself, thou makest intercession to God against him,
what hope of salvation wilt thou then have, if at the very time when thou oughtest rather to
appease God, even then thou provokest Him; putting on the garb of a suppliant, but uttering
the cries of a wild beast, and darting out against thyself those shafts of the wicked one?
Wherefore Paul also, making mention of prayer, required nothing so much as the observance
of this commandment; for He saith, “lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.”869

And if when thou hast need of mercy, not even then wilt thou let go thine anger, but art
rather exceedingly mindful of it, and that, although thou knowest thou art thrusting the
sword into thyself; when will it be possible for thee to become merciful, and to spew out the
evil venom of this wickedness?</p>
<p>But if thou hast not yet seen this outrageousness in its full extent, suppose it happening
among men, and then thou wilt perceive the excess of the insolence. As thus: should one
approach thee who are a man, seeking to obtain mercy, and then, in the midst of his lying
on the ground, should see an enemy, and leaving off to supplicate thee, begin to beat him;
wouldest thou not make thyself more angry with him? This do thou consider as taking place
with regard to God also. For so thou likewise, making supplication unto God, leavest thy
supplication in the midst, and smitest thine enemy with thy words, and insultest the laws
of God. Him who made a law to dismiss all anger, thou art summoning against those that
have vexed thee, and requiring Him to do things contrary to His own commandments. Is
it not enough for thee in the way of revenge, that thou thyself transgressest the law of God,
but entreatest thou Him likewise to do so? What? hath He forgotten what He commanded?
What? is He a man who spake these things? It is God, who knows all things, and whose will
is, that His own laws be kept with the utmost exactness, and who, so far from doing these
things which thou art requiring of Him, doth even regard thee who sayest these things,
merely because thou sayest them, with aversion and hatred, and exacts of thee the most extreme
penalty. How then seekest thou to obtain of Him things, from which He very seriously
bids thee refrain?</p>
<p>Yet some there are, who have come to such a point of brutishness, as not only to make
intercession against their enemies, but even to curse their children, and to taste, if only it
might be, of their very flesh; or rather they are even tasting thereof. For tell me not this, that
thou hast not fixed thy teeth in the body of him that vexed thee; since thou hast done, at
least as far as concerned thee, what is much more grievous; in claiming that wrath from
above should fall upon him, and that he should be delivered over to undying punishment,
and be overthrown with his whole house.</p>
<p>Why, what sort of bites are as ferocious as this? what kind of weapons as bitter? Not so
did Christ instruct thee; not so did He command thee to stain thy mouth with blood. Nay,
mouths made bloody with human flesh are not so shocking as tongues like these.</p>
<p>How then wilt thou salute thy brother? how wilt thou touch the sacrifice? how taste the
Lord’s blood, when thou hast so much venom upon thy mind? Since when thou sayest,
“Rend him in pieces, and overthrow his house, and destroy all,” when thou art imprecating
on him ten thousand deaths, thou art in nothing different from a murderer, or rather from
a wild beast that devours men.</p>

<pb n="251"/>
<p>Let us cease then from this disease and madness, and that kindliness which He com
manded let us show forth towards them that have vexed us: that we may become like “our
Father which is in heaven.” And we shall cease therefrom, if we call to mind our own sins;
if we strictly search out all our misdeeds at home, abroad, and in the market, and in church.</p>
<p>12. For if for nothing else, surely for our disrespectfulness here we are worthy to undergo
the utmost punishment. For when prophets are chanting, and apostles singing hymns, and
God is discoursing, we wander without, and bring in upon us a turmoil of worldly business.
And we do not afford to the laws of God so great stillness, even as the spectators in the
theatres to the emperor’s letters, keeping silence for them. For there, when these letters are
being read, deputies at once, and governors, and senate, and people, stand all upright, with
quietness hearkening to the words. And if amid that most profound silence any one should
suddenly leap up and cry out, he suffers the utmost punishment, as having been insolent to
the emperor. But here, when the letters from heaven are being read, great is the confusion
on all sides. And yet both He who sent the letters is much greater than this our king,870and
the assembly more venerable: for not men only, but angels too are in it; and these triumphs,
of which the letters bear us the good tidings, are much more awful than those on earth.
Wherefore not men only, but angels also and archangels; both the nations of heaven, and
all we on the earth, are commanded to give praise. For, “Bless the Lord,” it is said, “all His
works.”871 Yea, for His are no small achievements, rather they surpass all speech, and
thought, and understanding of man.</p>
<p>And these things the prophets proclaim every day, each of them in a different way
publishing this glorious triumph. For one saith, “Thou hast gone up on high, Thou hast led
captivity captive, and hast received gifts amongst men.”872 And, “The Lord strong and
mighty in battle.”873 And another saith, “He shall divide the spoils of the strong.”874 For
indeed to this purpose He came, that He might “preach deliverance to captives, and recovery
of sight to the blind.”875</p>
<p>And raising aloud the cry of victory over death, he said, “Where, O Death, is thy victory?
Where, O Grave, is thy sting?”876 And another again, declaring glad tidings of the most
profound peace, said, “They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into

of Sion, for lo! thy King cometh to thee meek, riding upon an ass, and a young colt;”878another
proclaims His second coming also, saying on this wise, “The Lord, whom ye seek, will
come, and who will abide the day of His coming?879 Leap ye as calves set free from bonds.”880
And another again, amazed at such things, said, “This is our God; there shall none other be
accounted of in comparison of Him.”881</p>
<p>Yet, nevertheless, while both these and many more sayings than these are being uttered,
while we ought to tremble, and not so much as account ourselves to be on the earth; still,
as though in the midst of a forum, we make an uproar and disturbance, and spend the whole
time of our solemn assembly882in discoursing of things which are nothing to us.</p>
<p>When therefore both in little things, and in great, both in hearing, and in doing, both
abroad, and at home, in the church, we are so negligent; and together with all this, pray also
against our enemies: whence are we to have any hope of salvation, adding to so great sins
yet another grievous enhancement, and equivalent to them all, even this unlawful prayer?</p>
<p>Have we then hereafter any right to marvel, if aught befall us of the things which are
unexpected and painful? whereas we ought to marvel when no such thing befalls us. For the
former is in the natural order of things, but the latter were beyond all reason and expectation.
For surely it is beyond reason, that they who are become enemies of God, and are provoking
Him to anger, should enjoy sunshine and showers, and all the rest; who being men surpass
the barbarity of wild beasts, setting themselves one against another, and by the biting of
their neighbors staining their own tongues with blood: after the spiritual table, and His so
great benefits, and His innumerable injunctions.</p>
<p>Therefore, considering these things, let us cast up that venom; let us put an end to our
enmities, and let us make the prayers that become such as we are. Instead of the brutality
of devils, let us take upon us the mildness of angels; and in whatsoever things we may have
been injured, let us, consider ing our own case, and the reward appointed us for this commandment,
soften our anger; let us assuage the billows, that we may both pass through the
present life calmly, and when we have departed thither, may find our Lord such as we have
been towards our fellow-servants. And if this be a heavy and fearful thing, let us make it
light and desirable; and let us open the glorious gates of confidence towards Him; and what

may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XX.883</head>
<p>Matt. VI. 16.</p>
<p>“And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance. For they disfigure their
faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.”</p>
<p>Here it were well to sigh aloud, and to wail bitterly: for not only do we imitate the hypocrites,
but we have even surpassed them. For I know, yea I know many, not merely fasting
and making a display of it, but neglecting to fast, and yet wearing the masks of them that
fast, and cloaking themselves with an excuse worse than their sin.</p>
<p>For “I do this,” say they, “that I may not offend the many.” What sayest thou? There is
a law of God which commands these things, and dost thou talk of offense? And thinkest
thou that in keeping it thou art offending, in transgressing it, delivering men from offense?
And what can be worse than this folly?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not leave off becoming worse than the very hypocrites, and making thine
hypocrisy double? And when thou considerest the great excess of this evil, wilt thou not be
abashed at the force of the expression now before us? In that He did not say, “they act a
part,” merely, but willing also to touch them more deeply, He saith, “For they disfigure their
faces;” that is, they corrupt, they mar them.</p>
<p>But if this be a disfiguring of the face, to appear pale for vainglory, what should we say
concerning the women who corrupt their faces with colorings and paintings to the ruin of
the unchaste sort of young men? For while those harm themselves only, these women harm
both themselves and them who behold them. Wherefore we should fly both from the one
pest and from the other, keeping at distance enough and to spare. For so He not only commanded
to make no display, but even to seek to be concealed. Which thing He had done
before likewise.</p>
<p>And whereas in the matter of almsgiving, He did not put it simply, but having said,
“Take heed not to do it before men,” He added, “to be seen of them;” yet concerning fasting
and prayer, He made no such limitation. Why could this have been? Because for almsgiving
to be altogether concealed is impossible, but for prayer and fasting, it is possible.</p>
<p>As therefore, when He said, “Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,” it
was not of hands that He was speaking, but of the duty of being strictly concealed from all;
and as when He commanded us to enter into our closet, not there alone absolutely, nor
there primarily, did He command us to pray, but He covertly intimated the same thing
<note type="footnote">883 [Or Homily XXI. in the Latin versions; see note on
Homily XIX., sec. 6, p. 134.—R.]</note>

<pb n="255"/>
again; so likewise here, in commanding us “to be anointed,” He did not enact that we positively
must anoint ourselves; for then we should all of us be found transgressors of this law;
and above all, surely, they who have taken the most pains to keep it, the societies of the
monks, who have taken up their dwelling on the mountains. It was not this then that He
enjoined, but, forasmuch as the ancients had a custom to anoint themselves continually,
when they were taking their pleasure and rejoicing (and this one may see clearly from
David884and from Daniel);885 He said that we were to anoint ourselves, not that we should
positively do this, but that by all means we might endeavor, with great strictness, to hide
this our acquisition. And to convince thee that so it is, He Himself, when by action exhibiting
what He enjoined in words, having fasted forty days, and fasted in secret, did neither anoint
nor wash Himself: nevertheless, though He did not these things, He most assuredly fulfilled
the whole without vainglory. It is this then that He enjoins on us likewise, both bringing
before us the hypocrites, and by a twice repeated charge dissuading the hearers.</p>
<p>And somewhat else He signified by this name, this of hypocrites,886 I mean. That is,
not only by the ridiculousness of the thing, nor by its bringing an extreme penalty, but also
by showing that such deceit is but for a season, doth He withdraw us from that evil desire.
For the actor seems glorious just so long as the audience is sitting; or rather not even then
in the sight of all. For the more part of the spectators know who it is, and what part he is
acting. However, when the audience is broken up, he is more clearly discovered to all. Now
this, you see, the vainglorious must in all necessity undergo. For even here they are manifest
to the majority, as not being that which they appear to be, but as wearing a mask only; but
much more will they be detected hereafter, when all things appear “naked and open.”887</p>
<p>And by another motive again He withdraws them from the hypocrites, by showing that
His injunction is light. For He doth not make the fast more strict, nor command us to
practise more of it, but not to lose the crown thereof. So that what seems hard to bear, is
common to us and to the hypocrites, for they also fast; but that which is lightest, namely,
not to lose the reward after our labors, “this is what I command,” saith He; adding nothing
to our toils, but gathering our wages for us with all security, and not suffering us to go away
unrewarded, as they do. Nay, they will not so much as imitate them that wrestle in the
Olympic games, who although so great a multitude is sitting there, and so many princes,
desire to please but one, even him who adjudges the victory amongst them; and this, though
he be much their inferior. But thou, though thou hast a twofold motive for displaying the
victory to Him, first, that He is the person to adjudge it, and also, that He is beyond compar-

ison superior to all that are sitting in the theatre,—thou art displaying it to others, who so
far from profiting, do privily work thee the greatest harm.</p>
<p>However, I do not forbid even this, saith He. Only, if thou art desirous to make a show
to men, also, wait, and I will bestow on thee this too in fuller abundance, and with great
profit. For as it is, this quite breaks thee off from the glory which is with me, even as to
despise these things unites thee closely; but then shalt thou enjoy all in entire security; having,
even before that last, no little fruit to reap in this world also, namely, that thou hast trodden
under foot all human glory, and art freed from the grievous bondage of men, and art become
a true worker of virtue. Whereas now, as long at least as thou art so disposed, if thou
shouldest be in a desert, thou wilt be deserted by all thy virtue, having none to behold thee.
This is to act as one insulting virtue itself, if thou art to pursue it not for its own sake, but
with an eye to the ropemaker, and the brazier, and the common people of the baser sort,
that the bad and they that are far removed from virtue may admire thee. And thou art calling
the enemies of virtue to the display and the sight thereof, as if one were to choose to live
continently, not for the excellency of continence, but that he might make a show before
prostitutes. Thou also, it would seem, wouldest not choose virtue, but for the sake of virtue’s
enemies; whereas thou oughtest indeed to admire her on this very ground, that she hath
even her enemies to praise her,—yet to admire her (as is meet), not for others, but for her
own sake. Since we too, when we are loved not for our own, but for others’ sake, account
the thing an insult. Just so I bid thee reckon in the case of virtue as well, and neither to follow
after her for the sake of others, nor for men’s sake to obey God; but men for God’s sake.
Since if thou do the contrary, though thou seem to follow virtue, thou hast provoked equally
with him who follows her not. For just as he disobeyed by not doing, so thou by doing unlawfully.</p>
<p>2. “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth.”888</p>
<p>Thus, after He hath cast out the disease of vainglory, and not before, He seasonably
introduces His discourse of voluntary poverty.889 For nothing so trains men to be fond of
riches, as the fondness for glory. This, for instance, is why men devise those herds of slaves,
and that swarm of eunuchs, and their horses with trappings of gold, and their silver tables,
and all the rest of it, yet more ridiculous; not to satisfy any wants, nor to enjoy any pleasure,
but that they may make a show before the multitude.</p>
<p>Now above He had only said, that we must show mercy; but here He points out also
how great mercy we must show, when He saith, “Lay not up treasure.” For it not being
possible at the beginning to introduce all at once His discourse on contempt of riches, by
reason of the tyranny of the passion, He breaks it up into small portions, and having set free
<note type="footnote">888 Matt. vi. 19. [“upon the earth,” so R.V.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">889 ἀκτημοσυν.</note>

<pb n="257"/>
the hearer’s mind, instills it therein, so as that it shall become acceptable. Wherefore, you
see, He said first, “Blessed are the merciful;” and after this, “Agree with thine adversary;”
and after that again, “If any one will sue thee at the law and take thy coat, give him thy cloak
also;” but here, that which is much greater than all these. For there His meaning was, “if
thou see a law-suit impending, do this; since to want and be freed from strife, is better than
to possess and strive;” but here, supposing neither adversary nor any one at law with thee,
and without all mention of any other such party, He teaches the contempt of riches itself
by itself, implying that not so much for their sake who receive mercy, as for the giver’s sake,
He makes these laws: so that though there be no one injuring us, or dragging us into a court
of justice, even so we may despise our possessions, bestowing them on those that are in
need.</p>
<p>And neither here hath He put the whole, but even in this place it is gently spoken; although
He had in the wilderness shown forth to a surpassing extent His conflicts in that
behalf.890 However He doth not express this, nor bring it forward; for it was not yet time
to reveal it; but for a while He searches out for reasons, maintaining the place of an adviser
rather than a lawgiver, in His sayings on this subject.</p>
<p>For after He had said, “Lay not up treasures upon the earth,” He added, “where moth
and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.”</p>
<p>For the present He signifies the hurtfulness of the treasure here, and the profit of what
is there, both from the place, and from the things which mar it. And neither at this point
doth He stop, but adds also another argument.</p>
<p>And first, what things they most fear, from these He urges them. For “of what art thou
afraid?” saith He: “lest thy goods should be spent, if thou give alms? Nay, then give alms,
and so they will not be spent; and, what is more, so far from being spent, they will actually
receive a greater increase; yea, for the things in heaven are added unto them.”</p>
<p>However, for a time He saith it not, but puts it afterwards. But for the present, what had
most power to persuade them, that He brings forward, namely, that the treasure would thus
remain for them unspent.</p>
<p>And on either hand He attracts them. For He said not only, “If thou give alms, it is
preserved:” but He threatened also the opposite thing, that if thou give not, it perishes.</p>
<p>And see His unspeakable prudence. For neither did He say, “Thou dost but leave them
to others;” since this too is pleasant to men: He alarms them however on a new ground, by
signifying that not even this do they obtain: since though men defraud not, there are those
which are sure to defraud, “the moth” and “the rust.” For although this mischief seem very
easy to restrain, it is nevertheless irresistible and uncontrollable, and devise what thou wilt,
thou wilt be unable to check this harm.</p>
<note type="footnote">890 Matt. iv. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="258"/>
<p>“What then, doth moth891make away with the gold?” Though not moth,892yet thieves
do. “What then, have all been despoiled?” Though not all, yet the more part.</p>
<p>3. On this account then He adds another argument, which I have already mentioned,
saying,</p>
<p>“Where the man’s treasure is, there is his heart also.”893</p>
<p>For though none of these things should come to pass, saith He, thou wilt undergo no
small harm, in being nailed to the things below, and in becoming a slave instead of a freeman,
and casting thyself out of the heavenly things, and having no power to think on aught that
is high, but all about money, usuries and loans, and gains, and ignoble traffickings. Than
this what could be more wretched? For in truth such an one will be worse off than any slave,
bringing upon himself a most grievous tyranny, and giving up the chiefest thing of all, even
the nobleness and the liberty of man. For how much soever any one may discourse unto
thee, thou wilt not be able to hear any of those things which concern thee, whilst thy mind
is nailed down to money; but bound like a dog to a tomb, by the tyranny of riches, more
grievously than by any chain, barking at all that come near thee, thou hast this one employment
continually, to keep for others what thou hast laid up. Than this what can be more
wretched?</p>
<p>However, forasmuch as this was too high for the mind of His hearers, and neither was
the mischief within easy view of the generality, nor the gain evident, but there was need of
a spirit of more self-command to perceive either of these; first, He hath put it after those
other topics, which are obvious, saying, “Where the man’s treasure is, there is his heart also;”
and next He makes it clear again, by withdrawing His discourse from the intellectual to the
sensible, and saying,</p>
<p>“The light of the body is the eye.”894</p>
<p>What He saith is like this: Bury not gold in the earth, nor do any other such thing, for
thou dost but gather it for the moth, and the rust, and the thieves. And even if thou
shouldest entirely escape these evils, yet the enslaving of thine heart, the nailing it to all that
is below, thou wilt not escape: “For wheresoever thy treasure may be, there is thine heart
also.” As then, laying up stores in heaven, thou wilt reap not this fruit only, the attainment
of the rewards for these things, but from this world thou already receivest thy recompence,
in getting into harbor there, in setting thine affections on the things that are there, and

<pb n="259"/>
caring for what is there (for where thou hast laid up thy treasures, it is most clear thou
transferrest thy mind also); so if thou do this upon earth, thou wilt experience the contrary.</p>
<p>But if the saying be obscure to thee, hear what comes next in order. “The light of the
body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if
thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. But if the light that is in thee be
darkness, how great is the darkness!”895</p>
<p>He leads His discourse to the things which are more within the reach of our senses. I
mean, forasmuch as He had spoken of the mind as enslaved and brought into captivity, and
there were not many who could easily discern this, He transfers the lesson to things outward,
and lying before men’s eyes, that by these the others also might reach their understanding.
Thus, “If thou knowest not,” saith He, “what a thing it is to be injured in mind, learn it from
the things of the body; for just what the eye is to the body, the same is the mind to the soul.”
As therefore thou wouldest not choose to wear gold, and to be clad in silken garments, thine
eyes withal being put out, but accountest their sound health more desirable than all such
superfluity (for, shouldest thou lose this health or waste it, all thy life besides will do thee
no good): for just as when the eyes are blinded, most of the energy of the other members is
gone, their light being quenched; so also when the mind is depraved, thy life will be filled
with countless evils:896—as therefore in the body this is our aim, namely, to keep the eye
sound, so also the mind in the soul. But if we mutilate this, which ought to give light to the
rest, by what means are we to see clearly any more? For as he that destroys the fountain,
dries up also the river, so he who hath quenched the understanding hath confounded all
his doings in this life. Wherefore He saith, “If the light that is in thee be darkness, how great
is the darkness?”</p>
<p>For when the pilot is drowned, and the candle is put out, and the general is taken prisoner;
what sort of hope will there be, after that, for those that are under command?</p>
<p>Thus then, omitting now to speak of the plots to which wealth gives occasion, the strifes,
the suits (these indeed He had signified above, when He said, “The adversary shall deliver
thee to the judge, and the judge to the officer”); and setting down what is more grievous
than all these, as sure to occur, He so withdraws us from the wicked desire. For to inhabit
the prison is not nearly so grievous, as for the mind to be enslaved by this disease; and the
former is not sure to happen, but the other is connected as an immediate consequent with
the desire of riches. And this is why He puts it after the first, as being a more grievous thing,
and sure to happen.</p>
<note type="footnote">895 Matt. vi. 22, 23. [In verse 23, “If therefore” is the correct reading, and some mss. of the Homilies have this
reading here.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">896 [In the Greek text, the parenthesis extends to this place.—R.]</note>

<pb n="260"/>
<p>For God, He saith, gave us understanding, that we might chase away all ignorance, and
have the right judgment of things, and that using this as a kind of weapon and light against
all that is grievous or hurtful, we might remain in safety. But we betray the gift for the sake
of things superfluous and useless.</p>
<p>For what is the use of soldiers arrayed in gold, when the general is dragged along a
captive? what the profit of a ship beautifully equipped, when the pilot is sunk beneath the
waves? what the advantage of a well-proportioned body, when the sight of the eyes is stricken
out? As therefore, should any one cast into sickness the physician (who should be in good
health, that he may end our diseases), and then bid him lie on a silver couch, and in a
chamber of gold, this will nothing avail the sick persons; even so, if thou corrupt the mind
(which hath power to put down our passions),897although thou set it by a treasure, so far
from doing it any good, thou hast inflicted the very greatest loss, and hast harmed thy whole
soul.</p>
<p>4. Seest thou how by those very things, through which most especially men everywhere
affect wickedness, even by these most of all He deters them from it, and brings them back
to virtue? “For with what intent dost thou desire riches?” saith He; “is it not that thou mayest
enjoy pleasure and luxury? Why now, this above all things thou wilt fail to obtain thereby,
it will rather be just contrary.” For if, when our eyes are stricken out, we perceive not any
pleasant thing, because of such our calamity; much more will this be our case in the perversion
and maiming of the mind.</p>
<p>Again, with what intent dost thou bury it in the earth? That it may be kept in safety?
But here too again it is the contrary, saith He.</p>
<p>And thus, as in dealing with him that for vainglory fasts and gives alms and prays, by
those very things which he most desires He had allured him not to be vainglorious:—“for
with what intent,” saith He, “dost thou so pray and give alms? for love of the glory that may
be had from men? then do not pray thus,” saith He, “and so thou shalt obtain it in the day
that is to come:”—so He hath taken captive the covetous man also, by those things for which
he was most earnest. Thus: “what wouldest thou?” saith He, “to have thy wealth preserved,
and to enjoy pleasure? Both these things I will afford thee in great abundance, if thou lay
up thy gold in that place, where I bid thee.”</p>
<p>It is true that hereafter He displayed more clearly the evil effect of this on the mind, I
mean, when He made mention of the thorns;898but for the present, even here He hath
strikingly intimated899the same, by representing him as darkened who is beside himself in
this way.</p>

<p>And as they that are in darkness see nothing distinct, but if they look at a rope, they
suppose it to be a serpent, if at mountains and ravines, they are dead with fear; so these also:
what is not alarming to them that have sight, that they regard with suspicion. Thus among
other things they tremble at poverty: or rather not at poverty only, but even at any trifling
loss. Yea, and if they should lose some little matter, those who are in want of necessary food
do not so grieve and bewail themselves as they. At least many of the rich have come even
to the halter, not enduring such ill fortune: and to be insulted also, and to be despitefully
used, seems to them so intolerable, that even because of this again many have actually torn
themselves from this present life. For to everything wealth had made them soft, except to
the waiting on it. Thus, when it commands them to do service unto itself, they venture on
murders, and stripes, and revilings, and all shame. A thing which comes of the utmost
wretchedness; to be of all men most effeminate, where one ought to practise self-command,
but where more caution was required, in these cases again to become more shameless and
obstinate. Since in fact the same kind of thing befalls them, as one would have to endure
who had spent all his goods on unfit objects. For such an one, when the time of necessary
expenditure comes on, having nothing to supply it, suffers incurable evils, forasmuch as all
that he had hath been ill spent beforehand.</p>
<p>And as they that are on the stage, skilled in those wicked arts, do in them go through
many things strange and dangerous, but in other necessary and useful things none so ridiculous
as they; even so is it with these men likewise. For so such as walk upon a stretched rope,
making a display of so much courage, should some great emergency demand daring or
courage, they are not able, neither do they endure even to think of such a thing. Just so they
likewise that are rich, daring all for money, for self-restraint’s sake endure not to submit to
anything, be it small or great. And as the former practise both a hazardous and fruitless
business; even so do these undergo many dangers and downfalls, but arrive at no profitable
end. Yea, they undergo a twofold darkness, both having their eyes put out by the perversion
of their mind, and being by the deceitfulness of their cares involved in a great mist.
Wherefore neither can they easily so much as see through it. For he that is in darkness, is
freed from the darkness by the mere appearance of the sun; but he that hath his eyes mutilated
not even when the sun shines; which is the very case of these men: not even now that the
Sun of Righteousness hath shone out, and is admonishing, do they hear, their wealth having
closed their eyes. And so they have a twofold darkness to undergo, part from themselves,
part from disregard to their teacher.</p>
<p>5. Let us then give heed unto Him exactly, that though late we may at length recover
our sight. And how may one recover sight? If thou learn how thou wast blinded. How then
wast thou blinded? By thy wicked desire. For the love of money, like an evil humor900which
hath collected upon a clear eyeball, hath caused the cloud to become thick.</p>
<note type="footnote">900 χυμ.</note>

<pb n="262"/>
<p>But even this cloud may be easily scattered and broken, if we will receive the beam of
the doctrine of Christ; if we will hear Him admonishing us, and saying, “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth.”</p>
<p>“But,” saith one, “what avails the hearing to me, as long as I am possessed by the desire?”
Now in the first place, there will be power in the continual hearing to destroy even the desire.
Next, if it continue to possess thee, consider that this thing is not really so much as a desire.
For what sort of desire is this, to be in grievous bondage, and to be subject to a tyranny, and
to be bound on all sides, and to dwell in darkness, and to be full of turmoil, and to endure
toils without profit, and to keep thy wealth for others, and often for thy very enemies? with
what sort of desire do these things agree? or rather of what flight and aversion are they not
worthy? What sort of desire, to lay up treasure in the midst of thieves? Nay, if thou dost at
all desire wealth, remove it where it may remain safe and unmolested. Since what you are
now doing is the part of one desiring, not riches, surely, but bondage, and affront,901and
loss, and continual vexation. Yet thou, were any one among men on earth to show thee a
place beyond molestation, though he lead thee out into the very desert, promising security
in the keeping of thy wealth,—thou art not slow nor backward; thou hast confidence in him,
and puttest out thy goods there; but when it is God instead of men who makes thee this
promise, and when He sets before thee not the desert, but Heaven, thou acceptest the contrary.
Yet surely, how manifold soever be their security below, thou canst never become free
from the care of them. I mean, though thou lose them not, thou wilt never be delivered from
anxiety lest thou lose. But there thou wilt undergo none of these things: and mark, what is
yet more, thou dost not only bury thy gold, but plantest it. For the same is both treasure
and seed; or rather it is more than either of these. For the seed remains not for ever, but this
abides perpetually. Again, the treasure germinates not, but this bears thee fruits which
never die.</p>
<p>6. But if thou tellest me of the time, and the delay of the recompence, I too can point
out and tell how much thou receivest back even here: and besides all this, from the very
things of this life, I will try to convict thee of making this excuse to no purpose. I mean, that
even in the present life thou providest many things which thou art not thyself to enjoy; and
should any one find fault, thou pleadest thy children and their children, and so thinkest
thou hast found palliation enough for thy superfluous labors. For when in extreme old age
thou art building splendid houses, before the completion of which (in many instances) thou
wilt have departed; when thou plantest trees, which will bear their fruit after many
years;902when thou art buying properties and inheritances, the ownership of which thou

<note type="footnote">902 [In the Greek text, bracketted by Field, and in the Latin, occurs this clause: “when” [or “for when”] “thou
plantest trees in the field, the fruit of which will yield after many (μυρα) years.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="263"/>
wilt acquire after a long time, and art eagerly busy in many other such things, the enjoyment
whereof thou wilt not reap; is it indeed for thine own sake, or for those to come after, that
thou art so employed? How then is it not the utmost folly, here not at all to hesitate903at the
delay of time; and this though thou art by this delay to lose all the reward of thy labors: but
there, because of such waiting to be altogether torpid; and this, although it bring thee the
greater gain, and although it convey not thy good things on to others, but procure the gifts
for thyself.</p>
<p>But besides this, the delay itself is not long; nay, for those things are at the doors, and
we know not but that even in our own generation all things which concern us may have
their accomplishment, and that fearful day may arrive, setting before us the awful and incorruptible
tribunal. Yea, for the more part of the signs are fulfilled, and the gospel moreover
hath been preached in all parts of the world, and the predictions of wars, and of earthquakes,
and of famines, have come to pass, and the interval is not great.</p>
<p>But is it that thou dost not see any signs? Why, this self-same thing is a very great sign.
For neither did they in Noah’s time see any presages of that universal destruction, but in
the midst of their playing, eating, marrying, doing all things to which they were used, even
so they were overtaken by that fearful judgment. And they too in Sodom in like manner,
living in delight, and suspecting none of what befell them, were consumed by those lightnings,
which then came down upon them.</p>
<p>Considering then all these things, let us betake ourselves unto the preparation for our
departure hence.</p>
<p>For even if the common day of the consummation never overtake us, the end of each
one is at the doors, whether he be old or young; and it is not possible for men after they
have gone hence, either to buy oil any more, or to obtain pardon by prayers, though he that
entreats be Abraham,904or Noah, or Job, or Daniel.905</p>
<p>While then we have opportunity, let us store up for ourselves beforehand much confidence,
let us gather oil in abundance, let us remove all into Heaven, that in the fitting time,
and when we most need them, we may enjoy all: by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory, and the might, now and always, and forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. VI. 24.</p>
<p>“No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he
will hold to one and despise the other.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how by degrees He withdraws us from the things that now are, and at greater
length introduces what He hath to say, touching voluntary poverty, and casts down the
dominion of covetousness?</p>
<p>For He was not contented with His former sayings, many and great as they were, but
He adds others also, more and more alarming.906</p>
<p>For what can be more alarming than what He now saith, if indeed we are for our riches
to fall from the service of Christ? or what more to be desired, if indeed, by despising wealth,
we shall have our affection towards Him and our charity perfect?907 For what I am continually
repeating, the same do I now say likewise, namely, that by both kinds He presses the hearer
to obey His sayings; both by the profitable, and by the hurtful; much like an excellent
physician, pointing out both the disease which is the consequence of neglect, and the good
health which results from obedience.</p>
<p>See, for instance, what kind of gain He signifies this to be, and how He establishes the
advantage of it by their deliverance from the contrary things. Thus, “wealth,” saith He, “hurts
you not in this only, that it arms robbers against you, nor in that it darkens your mind in
the most intense degree, but also in that it casts you out of God’s service, making you captive
of lifeless riches, and in both ways doing you harm, on the one hand, by causing you to be
slaves of what you ought to command; on the other, by casting you out of God’s service,
whom, above all things, it is indispensable for you to serve.” For just as in the other place,
He signified the mischief to be twofold, in both laying up here, “where moth corrupteth,”
and in not laying up there, where the watch kept is impregnable; so in this place, too, He
shows the loss to be twofold, in that it both draws off from God, and makes us subject to
mammon.</p>
<p>But He sets it not down directly, rather He establishes it first upon general considerations,
saying thus; “No man can serve two masters:” meaning here two that are enjoining opposite
things; since, unless this were the case, they would not even be two. For so, “the multitude
<note type="footnote">906 [“More in number and more terrible.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">907 [ἀκριβ.]</note>

<pb n="265"/>
of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul,”908and yet were they divided into
many bodies; their unanimity however made the many one.</p>
<p>Then, as adding to the force of it, He saith, “so far from serving, he will even hate and
abhor:” “For either he will hate the one,” saith He, “and love the other, or else he will hold
to the one and despise the other.” And it seems indeed as if the same thing were said twice
over; He did not however choose this form without purpose, but in order to show that the
change for the better is easy. I mean, lest thou shouldest say, “I am once for all made a slave;
I am brought under the tyranny of wealth,” He signifies that it is possible to transfer one’s
self, and that as from the first to the second, so also from the second one may pass over to
the first.</p>
<p>2. Having thus, you see, spoken generally, that He might persuade the hearer to be an
uncorrupt judge of His words, and to sentence according to the very nature of the things;
when he hath made sure of his assent, then, and not till then, He discovers Himself. Thus
He presently adds, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” Let us shudder to think what we
have brought Christ to say; with the name of God, to put that of gold. But if this be shocking,
its taking place in our deeds, our preferring the tyranny of gold to the fear of God, is much
more shocking.</p>
<p>“What then? Was not this possible among the ancients?” By no means. “How then,”
saith one, “did Abraham, how did Job obtain a good report?” Tell me not of them that are
rich, but of them that serve riches. Since Job also was rich, but he served not mammon, but
possessed it and ruled over it, and was a master, not a slave. Therefore he so possessed all
those things, as if he had been the steward of another man’s goods; not only not extorting
from others, but even giving up his own to them that were in need. And what is more, when
he had them they were no joy to him: so he also declared, saying, “If I did so much as rejoice
when my wealth waxed great:”909wherefore neither did he grieve when it was gone. But
they that are rich are not now such as he was, but are rather in a worse condition than any
slave, paying as it were tribute to some grievous tyrant. Because their mind is as a kind of
citadel occupied by the love of money, which from thence daily sends out unto them its
commands full of all iniquity, and there is none to disobey. Be not therefore thus over
subtle.910 Nay, for God hath once for all declared and pronounced it a thing impossible for
the one service and the other to agree. Say not thou, then, “it is possible.” Why, when the
one master is commanding thee to spoil by violence, the other to strip thyself of thy possessions;
the one to be chaste, the other to commit fornication; the one to be drunken and
luxurious, the other to keep the belly in subjection; the one again to despise the things that

<pb n="266"/>
are, the other to be rivetted to the present; the one to admire marbles, and walls, and roofs,
the other to contemn these, but to honor self-restraint: how is it possible that these should
agree?</p>
<p>Now He calls mammon here “a master,” not because of its own nature, but on account
of the wretchedness of them that bow themselves beneath it. So also He calls “the belly a
god,”911not from the dignity of such a mistress, but from the wretchedness of them that are
enslaved: it being a thing worse than any punishment, and enough, before the punishment,
in the way of vengeance on him who is involved in it. For what condemned criminals can
be so wretched, as they who having God for their Lord, do from that mild rule desert to this
grievous tyranny, and this when their act brings after it so much harm even here? For indeed
their loss is unspeakable by so doing: there are suits, and molestations, and strifes, and toils,
and a blinding of the soul; and what is more grievous than all, one falls away from the highest
blessings; for such a blessing it is to be God’s servant.</p>
<p>3. Having now, as you see, in all ways taught the advantage of contemning riches, as
well for the very preservation of the riches, as for the pleasure of the soul, and for acquiring
self-command, and for the securing of godliness; He proceeds to establish the practicability
of this command. For this especially pertains to the best legislation, not only to enjoin what
is expedient, but also to make it possible. Therefore He also goes on to say,</p>
<p>“Take no thought912for your life,913what ye shall eat.”</p>
<p>That is, lest they should say, “What then? if we cast all away, how shall we be able to
live?” At this objection, in what follows, He makes a stand, very seasonably. For as surely
as if at the beginning He had said, “Take no thought,” the word would have seemed burdensome;
so surely, now that He hath shown the mischief arising out of covetousness, His admonition
coming after is made easy to receive. Wherefore neither did He now simply say,
“Take no thought,” but He added the reason, and so enjoined this. After having said, “Ye
cannot serve God and mammon,” He added, “therefore I say unto you, take no thought.
Therefore;” for what? Because of the unspeakable loss. For the hurt you receive is not in
riches only, rather the wound is in the most vital parts, and in that which is the overthrow
of your salvation; casting you as it does out from God, who made you, and careth for you,
and loveth you.</p>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you, take no thought.” Thus, after He hath shown the hurt to be
unspeakable, then and not before He makes the commandment stricter; in that He not only

bids us cast away what we have, but forbids to take thought even for our necessary food,
saying, “Take no thought for your soul, what ye shall eat.” Not because the soul needs food,
for it is incorporeal; but He spake according to the common custom. For though it needs
not food, yet can it not endure to remain in the body, except that be fed. And in saying this,
He puts it not simply so, but here also He brings up arguments, some from those things
which we have already, and some from other examples.</p>
<p>From what we have already, thus saying:</p>
<p>“Is not the soul more than meat, and the body more than the raiment?”914</p>
<p>He therefore that hath given the greater, how shall He not give the less? He that hath
fashioned the flesh that is fed, how shall He not bestow the food? Wherefore neither did He
simply say, “Take no thought what ye shall eat,” or “wherewithal ye shall be clothed;” but,
“for the body,” and, “for the soul:” forasmuch as from them He was to make His demonstrations,
carrying on His discourse in the way of comparison. Now the soul He hath given once
for all, and it abides such as it is; but the body increases every day. Therefore pointing out
both these things, the immortality of the one, and the frailty of the other, He subjoins and
says,</p>
<p>“Which of you can add one cubit unto his stature?”915</p>
<p>Thus, saying no more of the soul, since it receives not increase, He discoursed of the
body only; hereby making manifest this point also, that not the food increases it, but the
providence of God. Which Paul showing also in other ways, said, “So then, neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”916</p>
<p>From what we have already, then, He urges us in this way: and from examples of other
things, by saying, “Behold the fowls of the air.”917 Thus, lest any should say, “we do good
by taking thought,” He dissuades them both by that which is greater, and by that which is
less; by the greater, i.e. the soul and the body; by the less, i.e. the birds. For if of the things
that are very inferior He hath so much regard, how shall He not give unto you? saith He.
And to them on this wise, for as yet it was an ordinary918multitude: but to the devil not
thus; but how? “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God.”919 But here He makes mention of the birds, and this in a way greatly
to abash them; which sort of thing is of very great value for the purpose of admonition.</p>

<p>4. However, some of the ungodly have come to so great a pitch of madness, as even to
attack His illustration. Because, say they, it was not meet for one strengthening920moral
principle, to use natural advantages as incitements to that end. For to those animals, they
add, this belongs by nature. What then shall we say to this? That even though it is theirs by
nature, yet possibly we too may attain it by choice. For neither did He say, “behold how the
birds fly,” which were a thing impossible to man; but that they are fed without taking thought,
a kind of thing easy to be achieved by us also, if we will. And this they have proved, who
have accomplished it in their actions.</p>
<p>Wherefore it were meet exceedingly to admire the consideration of our Lawgiver, in
that, when He might bring forward His illustration from among men, and when He might
have spoken of Moses and Elias and John, and others like them, who took no thought; that
He might touch them more to the quick, He made mention of the irrational beings. For had
He spoken of those righteous men, these would have been able to say, “We are not yet become
like them.” But now by passing them over in silence, and bringing forward the fowls of the
air, He hath cut off from them every excuse, imitating in this place also the old law. Yea, for
the old covenant likewise sends to the bee, and to the ant,921and to the turtle, and to the
swallow.922 And neither is this a small sign of honor, when the same sort of things, which
those animals possess by nature, those we are able to accomplish by an act of our choice. If
then He take so great care of them which exist for our sakes, much more of us; if of the servants,
much more of the master. Therefore He said, “Behold the fowls,” and He said not,
“for they do not traffic, nor make merchandise,”923for these were among the things that
were earnestly forbidden. But what? “they sow not, neither do they reap.” “What then?”
saith one, “must we not sow?” He said not, “we must not sow,” but “we must not take
thought;” neither that one ought not to work, but not to be low-minded, nor to rack one’s
self with cares. Since He bade us also be nourished, but not in “taking thought.”</p>
<p>Of this lesson David also lays the foundation from old time, saying enigmatically on
this wise, “Thou openest Thine hand, and fillest every living thing with bounty;”924and
again, “To Him that giveth to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens that call upon
Him.”925</p>
<p>“Who then,” it may be said, “have not taken thought”? Didst thou not hear how many
of the righteous I adduced? Seest thou not with them Jacob, departing from his father’s

house destitute of all things? Dost thou not hear him praying and saying, “If the Lord give
me bread to eat and raiment to put on?”926which was not the part of one taking thought,
but of one seeking all of God. This the apostles also attained, who cast away all, and took
no thought: also, the “five thousand,” and the “three thousand.”927</p>
<p>5. But if thou canst not bear, upon hearing so high words, to release thyself from these
grievous bonds, consider the unprofitableness of the thing, and so put an end to thy care.
For</p>
<p>“Which of you by taking thought” (saith He) “can add one cubit unto his stature.”928</p>
<p>Seest thou how by that which is evident, He hath manifested that also which is obscure?
Thus, “As unto thy body,” saith He, “thou wilt not by taking thought be able to add, though
it be ever so little; so neither to gather food; think as thou mayest otherwise.” Hence it is
clear that not our diligence, but the providence of God, even where we seem to be active,
effects all. So that, were He to forsake us, no care, nor anxiety, nor toil, nor any other such
thing, will ever appear to come to anything, but all will utterly pass away.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore suppose His injunctions are impossible: for there are many who
duly perform them, even as it is. And if thou knowest not of them, it is nothing marvellous,
since Elias too supposed he was alone, but was told, “I have left unto myself seven thousand
men.”929 Whence it is manifest that even now there are many who show forth the apostolical
life; like as the “three thousand” then, and the “five thousand.”930 And if we believe not,
it is not because there are none who do well, but because we are far from so doing. So that
just as the drunkard would not easily believe, that there exists any man who doth not taste
even water (and yet this hath been achieved by many solitaries in our time931); nor he who
connects himself with numberless women, that it is easy to live in virginity; nor he that extorts
other men’s goods, that one shall readily give up even his own: so neither will those, who
daily melt themselves down with innumerable anxieties, easily receive this thing.</p>
<p>Now as to the fact, that there are many who have attained unto this, we might show it
even from those, who have practised this self-denial even in our generation.</p>
<p>But for you, just now, it is enough to learn not to covet, and that almsgiving is a good
thing; and to know that you must impart of what ye have. For these things if thou wilt duly
perform, beloved, thou wilt speedily proceed to those others also.</p>

<p>6. For the present therefore let us lay aside our excessive sumptuousness, and let us endure
moderation, and learn to acquire by honest labor all that we are to have: since even
the blessed John, when he was discoursing with those that were employed upon the tribute,
and with the soldiery, enjoined them “to be content with their wages.”932 Anxious though
he were to lead them on to another, and a higher self-command, yet since they were still
unfit for this, he speaks of the lesser things. Because, if he had mentioned what are higher
than these, they would have failed to apply themselves to them, and would have fallen from
the others.</p>
<p>For this very reason we too are practising you933in the inferior duties. Yes, because as
yet, we know, the burden of voluntary poverty is too great for you, and the heaven is not
more distant from the earth, than such self-denial from you. Let us then lay hold, if it be
only of the lowest commandments, for even this is no small encouragement. And yet some
amongst the heathens have achieved even this, though not in a proper spirit, and have
stripped themselves of all their possessions.934 However, we are contented in your case, if
alms are bestowed abundantly by you; for we shall soon arrive at those other duties too, if
we advance in this way. But if we do not so much as this, of what favor shall we be worthy,
who are bidden to surpass those under the old law, and yet show ourselves inferior to the
philosophers among the heathens? What shall we say, who when we ought to be angels and
sons of God, do not even quite maintain our being as men? For to spoil and to covet comes
not of the gentleness of men, but of the fierceness of wild beasts; nay, worse than wild beasts
are the assailers of their neighbor’s goods. For to them this comes by nature, but we who
are honored with reason, and yet are falling away unto that unnatural vileness, what indulgence
shall we receive?</p>
<p>Let us then, considering the measures of that discipline which is set before us, press on
at least to the middle station, that we may both be delivered from the punishment which is
to come, and proceeding regularly, may arrive at the very summit of all good things; unto
which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. VI. 28, 29.</p>
<p>“Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I
say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.”</p>
<p>Having spoken of our necessary food, and having signified that not even for this should
we take thought, He passes on in what follows to that which is more easy. For raiment is
not so necessary as food.</p>
<p>Why then did He not make use here also of the same example, that of the birds, neither
mention to us the peacock, and the swan, and the sheep? for surely there were many such
examples to take from thence. Because He would point out how very far the argument may
be carried both ways:935both from the vileness936of the things that partake of such elegance,
and from the munificence vouchsafed to the lilies, in respect of their adorning. For this
cause, when He hath decked them out, He doth not so much as call them lilies any more,
but “grass of the field.”937 And He is not satisfied even with this name, but again adds another
circumstance of vileness, saying, “which to-day is.” And He said not, “and to-morrow
is not,” but what is much baser yet, “is cast into the oven.” And He said not, “clothe,” but
“so clothe.”</p>
<p>Seest thou everywhere how He abounds in amplifications and intensities? And this He
doth, that He may touch them home: and therefore He hath also added, “shall He not much
more clothe you?” For this too hath much emphasis: the force of the word, “you,” being no
other than to indicate covertly the great value set upon our race, and the concern shown for
it; as though He had said, “you, to whom He gave a soul, for whom He fashioned a body,
for whose sake He made all the things that are seen, for whose sake He sent prophets, and
gave the law, and wrought those innumerable good works; for whose sake He gave up His
only begotten Son.”</p>
<p>And not till He hath made His proof clear, doth He proceed also to rebuke them, say
ing, “O ye of little faith.” For this is the quality of an adviser: He doth not admonish only,
but reproves also, that He may awaken men the more to the persuasive power of His words.</p>
<p>Hereby He teaches us not only to take no thought, but not even to be dazzled at the
costliness of men’s apparel. Why, such comeliness is of grass, such beauty of the green herb:
or rather, the grass is even more precious than such apparelling. Why then pride thyself on
things, whereof the prize rests with the mere plant, with a great balance in its favor?</p>

<pb n="272"/>
<p>And see how from the beginning He signifies the injunction to be easy; by the contraries
again, and by the things of which they were afraid, leading them away from these cares.
Thus, when He had said, “Consider the lilies of the field,” He added, “they toil not:” so that
in desire to set us free from toils, did He give these commands. In fact, the labor lies, not in
taking no thought, but in taking thought for these things. And as in saying, “they sow not,”
it was not the sowing that He did away with, but the anxious thought; so in saying, “they
toil not, neither do they spin,” He put an end not to the work, but to the care.</p>
<p>But if Solomon was surpassed by their beauty, and that not once nor twice, but
throughout all his reign:—for neither can one say, that at one time He was clothed with
such apparel, but after that He was so no more; rather not so much as on one day did He
array Himself so beautifully: for this Christ declared by saying, “in all his reign:” and if it
was not that He was surpassed by this flower, but vied with that, but He gave place to all
alike (wherefore He also said, “as one of these:” for such as between the truth and the
counterfeit, so great is the interval between those robes and these flowers):—if then he acknowledged
his inferiority, who was more glorious than all kings that ever were: when wilt
thou be able to surpass, or rather to approach even faintly to such perfection of form?</p>
<p>After this He instructs us, not to aim at all at such ornament. See at least the end thereof;
after its triumph “it is cast into the oven:” and if of things mean, and worthless, and of no
great use, God hath displayed so great care, how shall He give up thee, of all living creatures
the most important?</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He make them so beautiful? That He might display His own wisdom
and the excellency of His power; that from everything we might learn His glory. For not
“the Heavens only declare the glory of God,”938but the earth too; and this David declared
when he said, “Praise the Lord, ye fruitful trees, and all cedars.”939 For some by their fruits,
some by their greatness, some by their beauty, send up praise to Him who made them: this
too being a sign of great excellency of wisdom, when even upon things that are very vile
(and what can be viler than that which to-day is, and to-morrow is not?) He pours out such
great beauty. If then to the grass He hath given that which it needs not (for what doth the
beauty thereof help to the feeding of the fire?) how shall He not give unto thee that which
thou needest? If that which is the vilest of all things, He hath lavishly adorned, and that as
doing it not for need, but for munificence, how much more will He honor thee, the most
honorable of all things, in matters which are of necessity.</p>
<p>2. Now when, as you see, He had demonstrated the greatness of God’s providential care,
and they were in what follows to be rebuked also, even in this He was sparing, laying to their
<note type="footnote">938 Ps. xix. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">939 Ps. cxlviii. 9.</note>

<pb n="273"/>
charge not want, but poverty, of faith. Thus, “if God,” saith He, “so clothe the grass of the
field, much more you, O ye of little faith.”940</p>
<p>And yet surely all these things He Himself works. For “all things were made by Him,
and without Him was not so much as one thing made.”941 But yet He nowhere as yet makes
mention of Himself: it being sufficient for the time, to indicate His full power, that He said
at each of the commandments, “Ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time,
but I say unto you.”</p>
<p>Marvel not then, when in subsequent instances also He conceals Himself, or speaks
something lowly of Himself: since for the present He had but one object, that His word
might prove such as they would readily receive, and might in every way demonstrate that
He was not a sort of adversary of God, but of one mind, and in agreement with the Father.</p>
<p>Which accordingly He doth here also; for through so many words as He hath spent He
ceases not to set Him before us, admiring His wisdom, His providence, His tender care extending
through all things, both great and small. Thus, both when He was speaking of Jerusalem,
He called it “the city of the Great King;”942and when He mentioned Heaven, He
spake of it again as “God’s throne;”943and when He was discoursing of His economy in the
world, to Him again He attributes it all, saying, “He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and
on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”944 And in the prayer too He
taught us to say, His “is the kingdom and the power and the glory.” And here in discoursing
of His providence, and signifying how even in little things He is the most excellent of artists,
He saith, that “He clothes the grass of the field.” And nowhere doth He call Him His own
Father, but theirs; in order that by the very honor He might reprove them, and that when
He should call Him His Father, they might no more be displeased.</p>
<p>Now if for bare necessaries one is not to take thought, what pardon can we945deserve,
who take thought for things expensive? Or rather, what pardon can they deserve, who do
even without sleep, that they may take the things of others?</p>
<p>3. “Therefore take no thought, saying, what shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or,
wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the nations of the world
seek.”946</p>

<pb n="274"/>
<p>Seest thou how again He hath both shamed them the more, and hath also shown by the
way, that He had commanded nothing grievous nor burdensome? As therefore when He
said, “If ye love them which love you,” it is nothing great which ye practise, for the very
Gentiles do the same; by the mention of the Gentiles He was stirring them up to something
greater: so now also He brings them forward to reprove us, and to signify that it is a necessary
debt which He is requiring of us. For if we must show forth something more than the Scribes
or Pharisees, what can we deserve, who so far from going beyond these, do even abide in
the mean estate of the Gentiles, and emulate their littleness of soul?</p>
<p>He doth not however stop at the rebuke, but having by this reproved and roused them,
and shamed them with all strength of expression, by another argument He also comforts
them, saying, “For your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.” He
said not, “God knoweth,” but, “your Father knoweth;” to lead them to a greater hope. For
if He be a Father, and such a Father, He will not surely be able to overlook His children in
extremity of evils; seeing that not even men, being fathers, bear to do so.</p>
<p>And He adds along with this yet another argument. Of what kind then is it? That “ye
have need” of them. What He saith is like this. What! are these things superfluous, that He
should disregard them? Yet not even in superfluities did He show Himself wanting in regard,
in the instance of the grass: but now are these things even necessary. So that what thou
considerest a cause for thy being anxious, this I say is sufficient to draw thee from such
anxiety. I mean, if thou sayest, “Therefore I must needs take thought, because they are necessary;”
on the contrary, I say, “Nay, for this self-same reason take no thought, because
they are necessary.” Since were they superfluities, not even then ought we to despair, but to
feel confident about the supply of them; but now that they are necessary, we must no longer
be in doubt. For what kind of father is he, who can endure to fail in supplying to his children
even necessaries? So that for this cause again God will most surely bestow them.</p>
<p>For indeed He is the artificer of our nature, and He knows perfectly the wants thereof.
So that neither canst thou say, “He is indeed our Father, and the things we seek are necessary,
but He knows not that we stand in need of them.” For He that knows our nature itself, and
was the framer of it, and formed it such as it is; evidently He knows its need also better than
thou, who art placed in want of them: it having been by His decree, that our nature is in
such need. He will not therefore oppose Himself to what He hath willed, first subjecting it
of necessity to so great want, and on the other hand again depriving it of what it wants, and
of absolute necessaries.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore be anxious, for we shall gain nothing by it, but tormenting ourselves.
For whereas He gives both when we take thought, and when we do not, and more of the
two, when we do not; what dost thou gain by thy anxiety, but to exact of thyself a superfluous
penalty? Since one on the point of going to a plentiful feast, will not surely permit himself
to take thought for food; nor is he that is walking to a fountain anxious about drink.

<pb n="275"/>
Therefore seeing we have a supply more copious than either any fountain, or innumerable
banquets made ready, the providence of God; let us not be beggars, nor little minded.</p>
<p>4. For together with what hath been said, He puts also yet another reason for feeling
confidence about such things, saying,</p>
<p>“Seek ye the kingdom of Heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.”947</p>
<p>Thus when He had set the soul free from anxiety, then He made mention also of Heaven.
For indeed He came to do away with the old things, and to call us to a greater country.
Therefore He doeth all, to deliver us from things unnecessary, and from our affection for
the earth. For this cause He mentioned the heathens also, saying that “the Gentiles seek after
these things;” they whose whole labor is for the present life, who have no regard for the
things to come, nor any thought of Heaven. But to you not these present are the chief
things,948but other than these. For we were not born for this end, that we should eat and
drink and be clothed, but that we might please God, and attain unto the good things to
come. Therefore as things here are secondary in our labor, so also in our prayers let them
be secondary. Therefore He also said, “Seek ye the kingdom of Heaven, and all these things
shall be added unto you.”</p>
<p>And He said not, “shall be given,” but “shall be added,” that thou mightest learn, that
the things present are no great part of His gifts, compared with the greatness of the things
to come. Accordingly, He doth not bid us so much as ask for them, but while we ask for
other things, to have confidence, as though these also were added to those. Seek then the
things to come, and thou wilt receive the things present also; seek not the things that are
seen, and thou shalt surely attain unto them. Yea, for it is unworthy of thee to approach thy
Lord for such things. And thou, who oughtest to spend all thy zeal and thy care for those
unspeakable blessings, dost greatly disgrace thyself by consuming it on the desire of transitory
things.</p>
<p>“How then?” saith one, “did He not bid us ask for bread?” Nay, He added, “daily,” and
to this again, “this day,” which same thing in fact He doth here also. For He said not, “Take
no thought,” but, “Take no thought for the morrow,” at the same time both affording us
liberty, and fastening our soul on those things that are more necessary to us.</p>
<p>For to this end also He bade us ask even those, not as though God needed reminding
by us, but that we might learn that by His help we accomplish whatever we do accomplish,
and that we might be made more His own by our continual prayer for these things.</p>
<note type="footnote">947 Matt. vi. 33. [The reading of this verse given by Chrysostom is peculiar. The best authorities support the
form accepted in the R.V., “his kingdom and his righteousness.” But the reading of the received text is ancient.

<note type="footnote">948 προηγομενα .</note>

<pb n="276"/>
<p>Seest thou how by this again He would persuade them, that they shall surely receive the
things present? For He that bestows the greater, much more will He give the less. “For not
for this end,” saith He, “did I tell you not to take thought nor to ask, that ye should suffer
distress, and go about naked, but in order that ye might be in abundance of these things
also:” and this, you see, was suited above all things to attract them to Him. So that like as in
almsgiving, when deterring them from making a display to men, He won upon them chiefly
by promising to furnish them with it more liberally;—“for thy Father,” saith He, “who seeth
in secret, shall reward thee openly;”949—even so here also, in drawing them off from seeking
these things, this is His persuasive topic, that He promises to bestow it on them, not seeking
it, in greater abundance. Thus, to this end, saith He, do I bid thee not seek, not that thou
mayest not receive, but that thou mayest receive plentifully; that thou mayest receive in the
fashion950that becomes thee, with the profit which thou oughtest to have; that thou mayest
not, by taking thought, and distracting thyself in anxiety about these, render thyself unworthy
both of these, and of the things spiritual; that thou mayest not undergo unnecessary distress,
and again fall away from that which is set before thee.</p>
<p>5. “Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof:” that is to say, the affliction, and the bruising thereof.951 Is it not enough for thee,
to eat thy bread in the sweat of thy face? Why add the further affliction that comes of anxiety,
when thou art on the point to be delivered henceforth even from the former toils?</p>
<p>By “evil” here He means, not wickedness, far from it, but affliction, and trouble, and
calamities; much as in another place also He saith, “Is there evil in a city, which the Lord
hath not done?”952nor any thing like these, but the scourges which are borne from above.
And again, “I,” saith He, “make peace, and create evils:”953 For neither in this place doth
He speak of wickedness,954but of famines, and pestilences, things accounted evil by most
men: the generality being wont to call these things evil. Thus, for example, the priests and
prophets of those five lordships, when having yoked the kine to the ark, they let them go
without their calves,955gave the name of “evil” to those heaven-sent plagues, and the dismay
and anguish which thereby sprang up within them.</p>

<pb n="277"/>
<p>This then is His meaning here also, when He saith, “sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.” For nothing so pains the soul, as carefulness and anxiety. Thus did Paul also, when
urging to celibacy, give counsel, saying, “I would have you without carefulness.”956</p>
<p>But when He saith, “the morrow shall take thought for itself,” He saith it not, as though
the day took thought for these things, but forasmuch as He had to speak to a people somewhat
imperfect, willing to make what He saith more expressive, He personifies the time, speaking
unto them according to the custom of the generality.</p>
<p>And here indeed He advises, but as He proceeds, He even makes it a law, saying, “provide
neither gold nor silver, nor scrip for your journey.”957 Thus, having shown it all forth in
His actions, then after that He introduces the verbal enactment of it more determinately,
the precept too having then become more easy of acceptance, confirmed as it had been
previously by His own actions. Where then did He confirm it by His actions? Hear Him
saying, “The Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.”958 Neither is He satisfied with
this only, but in His disciples also He exhibits His full proof of these things, by fashioning
them too in like manner, yet not suffering them to be in want of anything.</p>
<p>But mark His tender care also, how He surpasses the affection of any father. Thus, “This
I command,” saith He, “for nothing else, but that I may deliver you from superfluous anxieties.
For even if to-day thou hast taken thought for to-morrow, thou wilt also have to take
thought again to-morrow. Why then what is over and above? Why force the day to receive
more than the distress which is allotted to it, and together with its own troubles add to it
also the burden of the following day; and this, when there is no chance of thy lightening the
other by the addition so taking place, but thou art merely to exhibit thyself as coveting superfluous
troubles?” Thus, that He may reprove them the more, He doth all but give life to
the very time, and brings it in as one injured, and exclaiming against them for their causeless
despite. Why, thou hast received the day, to care for the things thereof. Wherefore then add
unto it the things of the other day also? Hath it not then burden enough in its own anxiety?
Why now, I pray, dost thou make it yet heavier? Now when the Lawgiver saith these things,
and He that is to pass judgment on us, consider the hopes that He suggests to us, how good
they are; He Himself testifying, that this life is wretched and wearisome, so that the anxiety
even of the one day is enough to hurt and afflict us.</p>
<p>6. Nevertheless, after so many and so grave words, we take thought for these things, but
for the things in Heaven no longer: rather we have reversed His order, on either side fighting
against His sayings. For mark; “Seek ye not the things present,” saith He, “at all;” but we are
<note type="footnote">956 1 Cor. vii. 32. [R.V., “to be free from care;” ἀμερμνου, a compound of the same origin as the word rendered

<pb n="278"/>
seeking these things for ever: “seek the things in Heaven,” saith He; but those things we seek
not so much as for a short hour, but according to the greatness of the anxiety we display
about the things of the world, is the carelessness we entertain in things spiritual; or rather
even much greater. But this doth not prosper for ever; neither can this be for ever. What if
for ten days we think scorn? if for twenty? if for an hundred? must we not of absolute necessity
depart, and fall into the hands of the Judge?</p>
<p>“But the delay hath comfort.” And what sort of comfort, to be every day looking for
punishment and vengeance? Nay, if thou wouldest have some comfort from this delay, take
it by gathering for thyself the fruit of amendment after repentance. Since if the mere delay
of vengeance seem to thee a sort of refreshment, far more is it gain not to fall into the vengeance.
Let us then make full use of this delay, in order to have a full deliverance from the
dangers that press upon us. For none of the things enjoined is either burdensome or grievous,
but all are so light and easy, that if we only bring a genuine purpose of heart, we may accomplish
all, though we be chargeable with countless offenses. For so Manasses had perpetrated
innumerable pollutions, having both stretched out his hands against the saints, and brought
abominations into the temple, and filled the city with murders, and wrought many other
things beyond excuse; yet nevertheless after so long and so great wickedness, he washed
away from himself all these things.959 How and in what manner? By repentance, and consideration.</p>
<p>For there is not, yea, there is not any sin, that doth not yield and give way to the power
of repentance, or rather to the grace of Christ. Since if we would but only change, we have
Him to assist us. And if thou art desirous to become good, there is none to hinder us; or
rather there is one to hinder us, the devil, yet hath he no power, so long as thou choosest
what is best, and so attractest God to thine aid. But if thou art not thyself willing, but startest
aside, how shall He protect thee? Since not of necessity or compulsion, but of thine own
will, He wills thee to be saved. For if thou thyself, having a servant full of hatred and aversion
for thee, and continually going off, and fleeing away from thee, wouldest not choose to keep
him, and this though needing his services; much less will God, who doeth all things not for
His own profit, but for thy salvation, choose to retain thee by compulsion; as on the other
hand, if thou show forth a right intention only, He would not choose ever to give thee up,
no, not whatever the devil may do. So that we are ourselves to blame for our own destruction.
Because we do not approach, nor beseech, nor entreat Him, as we ought: but even if we do
draw nigh, it is not as persons who have need to receive, neither is it with the proper faith,
nor as making demand, but we do all in a gaping and listless way.</p>
<p>7. And yet God would have us demand things of Him, and for this accounts Himself
greatly bound to thee.960 For He alone of all debtors, when the demand is made, counts it
<note type="footnote">959 2 Chron. xxxiii. 1–20; 2 Kings xxi. 1–18.</note>
<note type="footnote">960 [κα χριν χει σοι τοτου πολλν.]</note>

<pb n="279"/>
a favor, and gives what we have not lent Him. And if He should see him pressing earnestly
that makes the demand, He pays down even what He hath not received of us; but if sluggishly,
He too keeps on making delays; not through unwillingness to give, but because He is pleased
to have the demand made upon Him by us. For this cause He told thee also the example of
that friend, who came by night, and asked a loaf;961and of the judge that feared not God,
nor regarded men.962 And He stayed not at similitudes, but signified it also in His very actions,
when He dismissed that Phoenician woman, having filled her with His great gift.963
For through her He signified, that He gives to them that ask earnestly, even the things that
pertain not to them. “For it is not meet,” saith He, “to take the children’s bread, and to
give964it unto the dogs.” But for all that He gave, because she demanded of him earnestly.
But by the Jews He showed, that to them that are careless, He gives not even their own. They
accordingly received nothing, but lost what was their own. And while these, because they
asked not, did not receive so much as their very own; she, because she assailed Him with
earnestness, had power to obtain even what pertained to others, and the dog received what
was the children’s. So great a good is importunity. For though thou be a dog, yet being importunate,
thou shalt be preferred to the child being negligent: for what things affection
accomplishes not, these, all of them, importunity did accomplish. Say not therefore, “God
is an enemy to me, and will not hearken.” He doth straightway answer thee, continually
troubling him, if not because thou art His friend, yet because of thine importunity. And
neither the enmity, or the unseasonable time, nor anything else becomes an hindrance. Say
not, “I am unworthy, and do not pray;” for such was the Syrophoenician woman too. Say
not, “I have sinned much, and am not able to entreat Him whom I have angered;” for God
looks not at the desert, but at the disposition. For if the ruler that feared not God, neither
was ashamed of men, was overcome by the widow, much more will He that is good be won
over by continual entreaty.</p>
<p>So that though thou be no friend, though thou be not demanding thy due, though thou
hast devoured thy Father’s substance, and have been a long time out of sight, though without
honor, though last of all, though thou approach Him angry, though much displeased; be
willing only to pray, and to return, and thou shalt receive all, and shall quickly extinguish
the wrath and the condemnation.</p>
<p>But, “behold, I pray,” saith one, “and there is no result.” Why, thou prayest not like
those; such I mean as the Syrophoenician woman, the friend that came late at night, and the
widow that is continually troubling the judge, and the son that consumed his father’s goods.

<pb n="280"/>
For didst thou so pray, thou wouldest quickly obtain. For though despite have been done
unto Him, yet is He a Father; and though He have been provoked to anger, yet is He fond
of His children; and one thing only doth He seek, not to take vengeance for our affronts,
but to see thee repenting and entreating Him. Would that we were warmed in like measure,
as those bowels are moved to the love of us. But this fire seeks a beginning only, and if thou
afford it a little spark, thou kindlest a full flame of beneficence. For not because He hath
been insulted, is He sore vexed, but because it is thou who art insulting Him, and so becoming
frenzied. For if we being evil, when our children molest965us, grieve on their account; much
more is God, who can not so much as suffer insult, sore vexed on account of thee, who hast
committed it. If we, who love by nature, much more He, who is kindly affectioned beyond
nature. “For though,” saith He, “a woman should forget the fruits of her womb, yet will I
not forget thee.”966</p>
<p>8. Let us therefore draw nigh unto Him, and say, “Truth, Lord; for even the dogs eat of
the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”967 Let us draw nigh “in season, out of
season:” or rather, one can never draw nigh out of season, for it is unseasonable not to be
continually approaching. For of Him who desires to give it is always seasonable to ask: yea,
as breathing is never out of season, so neither is praying unseasonable, but rather not praying.
Since as we need this breath, so do we also the help that comes from Him; and if we be
willing, we shall easily draw Him to us. And the prophet, to manifest this, and to point out
the constant readiness of His beneficence, said, “We shall find Him prepared as the morning.”
968 For as often as we may draw nigh, we shall see Him awaiting our movements. And
if we fail to draw from out of His ever-springing goodness, the blame is all ours. This, for
example, was His complaint against certain Jews, when He said, “My mercy is as a morning
cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.”969 And His meaning is like this; “I indeed have

<note type="footnote">966 Isa. xlix. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">967 Matt. xv. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">968 Hosea vi. 3, LXX. “His going forth is prepared as the morning,” agreeing with the present Hebrew copies.
The sentiment of both readings (as we so often find, apparently by a special Providence) is the same. [R.V., “His
going forth is sure as the morning.” This, too, conveys the same general sentiment, but is a more accurate rendering
of the Hebrew.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">969 Hosea vi. 4. A.V., “Your goodness is as the morning cloud;” and so also LXX. τ λεο μν. And with this the
Hebrew copies agree, as did St. Jerome’s (in loc. t. vi. 63, Venet. 1768). But St. Cyril (in loc. t. iii. 96), reads τ λεο
μο And St. Jerome’s Commentary shows that according to his interpretation the two readings came to the same
meaning. “Your mercy, that wherewith I have always had mercy upon you, hath passed by…for now is the
captivity near.” [R.V., “For your goodness (or, kindness) is as a morning cloud.” In the Homily δ occurs, but is
not translated.—R.]</note>

supplied all my part, but ye, as a hot sun coming over scatters both the cloud and the dew,
and makes them vanish, so have ye by your great wickedness restrained the unspeakable
Beneficence.”</p>
<p>Which also itself again is an instance of providential care: that even when He sees us
unworthy to receive good, He withholds His benefits, lest He render us careless. But if we
change a little, even but so much as to know that we have sinned, He gushes out beyond the
fountains, He is poured forth beyond the ocean; and the more thou receivest, so much the
more doth He rejoice; and in this way is stirred up again to give us more. For indeed He
accounts it as His own wealth, that we should be saved, and that He should give largely to
them that ask. And this, it may seem, Paul was declaring when He said, that He is “rich unto
all and over all that call upon Him.”970 Because when we pray not, then He is wroth; when
we pray not, then doth He turn away from us. For this cause “He became poor, that He
might make us rich;”971for this cause He underwent all those sufferings, that He might incite
us to ask.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore despair, but having so many motives and good hopes, though we
sin every day, let us approach Him, entreating, beseeching, asking the forgiveness of our
sins. For thus we shall be more backward to sin for the time to come; thus shall we drive
away the devil, and shall call forth the lovingkindness of God, and attain unto the good
things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“Judge not, that ye be not judged.”</p>
<p>What then? Ought we not to blame them that sin? Because Paul also saith this selfsame
thing: or rather, there too it is Christ, speaking by Paul, and saying,972“Why dost thou judge
thy brother? And thou, why dost thou set at nought thy brother?” and, “Who art thou that
judgest another man’s servant?”973 And again, “Therefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come.”974</p>
<p>How then doth He say elsewhere, “Reprove, rebuke, exhort,”975and, “Them that sin
rebuke before all?”976 And Christ too to Peter, “Go and tell him his fault between thee and
him alone,” and if he neglect to hear, add to thyself another also; and if not even so doth he
yield, declare it to the church likewise?”977 And how hath He set over us so many to reprove;
and not only to reprove, but also to punish? For him that hearkens to none of these, He hath
commanded to be “as a heathen man and a publican.”978 And how gave He them the keys
also? since if they are not to judge, they will be without authority in any matter, and in vain
have they received the power to bind and to loose.</p>
<p>And besides, if this were to obtain, all would be lost alike, whether in churches, or in

And why say I, friends? unless we judge our enemies, we shall never be able to put an end
to our enmity, but all things will be turned upside down.</p>
<p>What then can the saying be? Let us carefully attend, lest the medicines of salvation,
and the laws of peace, be accounted by any man laws of overthrow and confusion. First of
all, then, even by what follows, He hath pointed out to them that have understanding the
excellency of this law, saying, “Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but

<p>But if to many of the less attentive, it seem yet rather obscure, I will endeavor to explain
it from the beginning. In this place, then, as it seems at least to me, He doth not simply
command us not to judge any of men’s sins, neither doth He simply forbid the doing of
such a thing, but to them that are full of innumerable ills, and are trampling upon other
men for trifles. And I think that certain Jews too are here hinted at, for that while they were
bitter accusing their neighbors for small faults, and such as came to nothing, they were
themselves insensibly committing deadly981sins. Herewith towards the end also He was
upbraiding them, when He said, “Ye bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, but ye
will not move them with your finger,”982and, “ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and have
omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.”983</p>
<p>Well then, I think that these are comprehended in His invective; that He is checking
them beforehand as to those things, wherein they were hereafter to accuse His disciples. For
although His disciples had been guilty of no such sin, yet in them were supposed to be offenses;
as, for instance, not keeping the sabbath, eating with unwashen hands, sitting at meat
with publicans; of which He saith also in another place, “Ye which strain at the gnat, and
swallow the camel.”984 But yet it is also a general law that He is laying down on these matters.</p>
<p>And the Corinthians985too Paul did not absolutely command not to judge, but not to
judge their own superiors, and upon grounds that are not acknowledged; not absolutely to
refrain from correcting them that sin. Neither indeed was He then rebuking all without
distinction, but disciples doing so to their teachers were the object of His reproof; and they
who, being guilty of innumerable sins, bring an evil report upon the guiltless.</p>
<p>This then is the sort of thing which Christ also in this place intimated; not intimated
merely, but guarded986it too with a great ter ror, and the punishment from which no
prayers can deliver.</p>
<p>2. “For with what judgment ye judge,” saith He, “ye shall be judged.”987
That is, “it is not the other,” saith Christ, “that thou condemnest, but thyself, and thou
art making the judgment-seat dreadful to thyself, and the account strict.” As then in the
forgiveness of our sins the beginnings are from us, so also in this judgment, it is by ourselves
that the measures of our condemnation are laid down. You see, we ought not to upbraid

nor trample upon them, but to admonish; not to revile, but to advise; not to assail with
pride, but to correct with tenderness. For not him, but thyself, dost thou give over to extreme
vengeance, by not sparing him, when it may be needful to give sentence on his offenses.</p>
<p>Seest thou, how these two commandments are both easy, and fraught with great blessings
to the obedient, even as of evils on the other hand, to the regardless? For both he that forgives
his neighbor, hath freed himself first of the two from the grounds of complaint, and that
without any labor; and he that with tenderness and indulgence inquires into other men’s
offenses, great is the allowance988of pardon, which he hath by his judgment laid up beforehand
for himself.</p>
<p>“What then!” say you: “if one commit fornication, may I not say that fornication is a
bad thing, nor at all correct him that is playing the wanton?” Nay, correct him, but not as
a foe, nor as an adversary exacting a penalty, but as a physician providing medicines. For
neither did Christ say, “stay not him that is sinning,” but “judge not;” that is, be not bitter
in pronouncing sentence.</p>
<p>And besides, it is not of great things (as I have already observed), nor of things prohibited,
that this is said, but of those which are not even counted offenses. Wherefore He said also.</p>
<p>“Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye?”989</p>
<p>Yea, for many now do this; if they see but a monk wearing an unnecessary garment,
they produce against him the law of our Lord,990while they themselves are extorting without
end, and defrauding men every day. If they see him but partaking rather largely of food,
they become bitter accusers, while they themselves are daily drinking to excess and surfeiting:
not knowing, that besides their own sins, they do hereby gather up for themselves a greater
flame, and deprive themselves of every plea. For on this point, that thine own doings must
be strictly inquired into, thou thyself hast first made the law, by thus sentencing those of
thy neighbor. Account it not then to be a grievous thing, if thou art also thyself to undergo
the same kind of trial.</p>
<p>“Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye.”991</p>
<p>Here His will is to signify the great wrath, which He hath against them that do such
things. For so, wheresoever He would indicate that the sin is great, and the punishment and
wrath in store for it grievous, He begins with a reproach.992 As then unto him that was exacting
the hundred pence, He said in His deep displeasure, “Thou wicked servant, I forgave
thee all that debt;”993even so here also, “Thou hypocrite.” For not of protecting care comes

such a judgment, but of ill will to man; and while a man puts forward a mask of benevolence,
he is doing a work of the utmost wickedness, causing reproaches without ground, and accusations,
to cleave unto his neighbors, and usurping a teacher’s rank, when he is not worthy
to be so much as a disciple. On account of this He called him “hypocrite.” For thou, who in
other men’s doings art so bitter, as to see even the little things; how hast thou become so
remiss in thine own, as that even the great things are hurried over by thee?</p>
<p>“First cast out the beam out of thine own eye.”</p>
<p>Seest thou, that He forbids not judging, but commands to cast out first the beam from
thine eye, and then to set right the doings of the rest of the world? For indeed each one
knows his own things better than those of others; and sees the greater rather than the less;
and loves himself more than his neighbor. Wherefore, if thou doest it out of guardian care,
I bid thee care for thyself first, in whose case the sin is both more certain and greater. But
if thou neglect thyself, it is quite evident that neither dost thou judge thy brother in care for
him, but in hatred, and wishing to expose him. For what if he ought to be judged? it should
be by one who commits no such sin, not by thee.</p>
<p>Thus, because He had introduced great and high doctrines of self denial, lest any man
should say, it is easy so to practise it in words; He willing to signify His entire confidence,
and that He was not chargeable with any of the things that had been mentioned, but had
duly fulfilled all, spake this parable. And that, because He too was afterwards to judge,
saying, “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.”994 Yet was not he chargeable
with what hath been mentioned; for neither did He pull out a mote, nor had He a beam on
His eyes, but being clean from all these, He so corrected the faults of all. “For it is not at all
meet,” saith He, “to judge others, when one is chargeable with the same things.” And why
marvel at His establishing this law, when even the very thief knew it upon the cross, saying
to the other thief, “Dost not thou fear God, seeing we are in the same condemnation;”995expressing
the same sentiments with Christ?</p>
<p>But thou, so far from casting out thine own beam, dost not even see it, but another’s
mote thou not only seest, but also judgest, and essayest to cast it out; as if any one seized
with a grievous dropsy, or indeed with any other incurable disease, were to neglect this, and
find fault with another who was neglecting a slight swelling. And if it be an evil not to see
one’s own sins, it is a twofold and threefold evil to be even sitting in judgment on others,
while men themselves, as if past feeling, are bearing about beams in their own eyes: since
no beam is so heavy as sin.</p>

text.—R.]</note>

<pb n="286"/>
<p>His injunction therefore in these words is as follows, that he who is chargeable with
countless evil deeds, should not be a bitter censor of other men’s offenses, and especially
when these are trifling. He is not overthrowing reproof nor correction, but forbidding men
to neglect their own faults, and exult over those of other men.</p>
<p>For indeed this was a cause of men’s going unto great vice, bringing in a twofold
wickedness. For he, whose practice it had been to slight his own faults, great as they were,
and to search bitterly into those of others, being slight and of no account, was spoiling
himself two ways: first, by thinking lightly of his own faults; next, by incurring enmities and
feuds with all men, and training himself every day to extreme fierceness, and want of feeling
for others.</p>
<p>3. Having then put away all these things, by this His excellent legislation, He added yet
another charge, saying,</p>
<p>“Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.”996</p>
<p>“Yet surely further on,” it will be said, “He commanded, “What ye have heard in the
ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.”997 But this is in no wise contrary to the former.
For neither in that place did He simply command to tell all men, but to whom it should be
spoken, to them He bade speak with freedom.998 And by “dogs” here He figuratively described
them that are living in incurable ungodliness, and affording no hope of change for
the better; and by “swine,” them that abide continually in an unchaste life, all of whom He
hath pronounced unworthy of hearing such things. Paul also, it may be observed, declared
this when He said, “But a natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, for they are
foolishness unto him.”999 And in many other places too He saith that corruption of life is
the cause of men’s not receiving the more perfect doctrines. Wherefore He commands not
to open the doors to them; for indeed they become more insolent after learning. For as to
the well-disposed and intelligent, things appear venerable when revealed, so to the insensible,
when they are unknown rather. “Since then from their nature, they are not able to learn
them, “let the thing be hidden,” saith He, “that1000at least for ignorance they may reverence

them. For neither doth the swine know at all what a pearl is. Therefore since he knows not,
neither let him see it, lest he trample under foot what he knows not.”</p>
<p>For nothing results, beyond greater mischief to them that are so disposed when they
hear; for both the holy things are profaned1001by them, not knowing what they are; and
they are the more lifted up and armed against us. For this is meant by, “lest they trample
them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.”1002</p>
<p>Nay, “surely,” saith one, “they ought to be so strong as to remain equally impregnable
after men’s learning them, and not to yield to other people occasions against us.” But it is
not the things that yield it, but that these men are swine; even as when the pearl is trampled
under foot, it is not so trampled, because it is really contemptible, but because it fell among
swine.</p>
<p>And full well did He say, “turn again and rend you:” for they feign gentleness,1003so as
to be taught: then after they have learnt, quite changing from one sort to another, they jeer,
mock and deride us, as deceived persons. Therefore Paul also said to Timothy,1004“Of whom
be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words;” and again in another place,
“From such turn away,”1005and, “A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition,
reject.”1006</p>
<p>It is not, you see, that those truths furnish them with armor, but they become fools in
this way of their own accord, being filled with more willfulness. On this account it is no
small gain for them to abide in ignorance, for so they are not such entire scorners. But if
they learn, the mischief is twofold. For neither will they themselves be at all profited thereby,
but rather the more damaged, and to thee they will cause endless difficulties.</p>
<p>Let them hearken, who shamelessly associate with all, and make the awful things contemptible.
For the mysteries we too therefore celebrate with closed doors, and keep out the
uninitiated, not for any weakness of which we have convicted our rites, but because the
many are as yet imperfectly prepared for them. For this very reason He Himself also discoursed
much unto the Jews in parables, “because they seeing saw not.” For this, Paul likewise
commanded “to know how we ought to answer every man.”1007</p>

<p>For inasmuch as He had enjoined things great and marvellous, and had commanded
men to be superior to all their passions, and had led them up to Heaven itself, and had enjoined
them to strive after the resemblance, not of angels and archangels, but (as far as was
possible) of the very Lord of all; and had bidden His disciples not only themselves duly to
perform all this, but also to correct others, and to distinguish between the evil and them
that are not such, the dogs and them that are not dogs (although there be much that is hidden
in men):—that they might not say, “these things are grievous and intolerable,” (for indeed
in the sequel Peter did utter some such things, saying, “Who can be saved?”1009and again,
“If the case of the man be so, it is not good to marry): in order therefore that they might not
now likewise say so; as in the first place even by what had gone before He had proved it all
to be easy, setting down many reasons one upon another, of power to persuade men: so
after all He adds also the pinnacle of all facility, devising as no ordinary relief to our toils,
the assistance derived from persevering prayers. Thus, we are not ourselves, saith He, to
strive alone, but also to invoke the help from above: and it will surely come and be present
with us, and will aid us in our struggles, and make all easy. Therefore He both commanded
us to ask, and pledged Himself to the giving.</p>
<p>However, not simply to ask did He command us, but with much assiduity and earnestness.
For this is the meaning of “seek.” For so he that seeks, putting all things out of his
mind, is taken up with that alone which is sought, and forms no idea of any of the persons
present. And this which I am saying they know, as many as have lost either gold, or servants,
and are seeking diligently after them.</p>
<p>By “seeking,” then, He declared this; by “knocking,” that we approach with earnestness
and a glowing mind.</p>
<p>Despond not therefore, O man, nor show less of zeal about virtue, than they do of desire
for wealth. For things of that kind thou hast often sought and not found, but nevertheless,
though thou know this, that thou art not sure to find them, thou puttest in motion every
mode of search; but here, although having a promise that thou wilt surely receive, thou dost
not show even the smallest part of that earnestness. And if thou dost not receive straightway,
do not even thus despair. For to this end He said, “knock,” to signify that even if He should
not straightway open the door, we are to continue there.</p>
<p>5. And if thou doubt my affirmation, at any rate believe His example.</p>

<p>“For what man is there of you,” saith He, “whom if his son ask bread, will he give him
a stone?”1010</p>
<p>Because, as among men, if thou keep on doing so, thou art even accounted troublesome,
and disgusting: so with God, when thou doest not so, then thou dost more entirely provoke
Him. And if thou continue asking, though thou receive not at once, thou surely wilt receive.
For to this end was the door shut, that He may induce thee to knock: to this end He doth
not straightway assent, that thou mayest ask. Continue then to do these things, and thou
wilt surely receive. For that thou mightest not say, “What then if I should ask and not re-
ceive?” He hath blocked up1011thy approach with that similitude, again framing arguments,
and by those human things urging us to be confident on these matters; implying by them
that we must not only ask, but ask what we ought.1012</p>
<p>“For which of you is there, a father, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he give him
a stone?” So that if thou receive not, thy asking a stone is the cause of thy not receiving. For
though thou be a son, this suffices not for thy receiving: rather this very thing even hinders
thy receiving, that being a son, thou askest what is not profitable.</p>
<p>Do thou also therefore ask nothing worldly, but all things spiritual, and thou wilt surely
receive. For so Solomon,1013because he asked what he ought, behold how quickly he received.
Two things now, you see, should be in him that prays, asking earnestly, and asking what he
ought: “since ye too,” saith He, “though ye be fathers, wait for your sons to ask: and if they
should ask of you anything inexpedient, ye refuse the gifts; just as, if it be expedient, ye
consent and bestow it.” Do thou too, considering these things, not withdraw until thou receive;
until thou have found, retire not; relax not thy diligence, until the door be opened.
For if thou approach with this mind, and say, “Except I receive, I depart not;” thou wilt
surely receive, provided thou ask such things, as are both suitable for Him of whom thou
askest to give, and expedient for thee the petitioner. But what are these? To seek the things
spiritual, all of them; to forgive them that have trespassed, and so to draw nigh asking forgiveness;
“to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting.”1014 If we thus ask, we shall
receive. As it is, surely our asking is a mockery, and the act of drunken rather than of sober
men.</p>

<p>“What then,” saith one, “if I ask even spiritual things, and do not receive?” Thou didst
not surely knock with earnestness; or thou madest thyself unworthy to receive; or didst
quickly leave off.</p>
<p>“And wherefore,” it may be inquired, “did He not say, what things we ought to ask”?
Nay verily, He hath mentioned them all in what precedes, and hath signified for what things
we ought to draw nigh. Say not then, “I drew nigh, and did not receive.” For in no case is it
owing to God that we receive not, God who loves us so much as to surpass even fathers, to
surpass them as far as goodness doth this evil nature.</p>
<p>“For if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
your heavenly Father.”1015</p>
<p>Now this He said, not to bring an evil name on man’s nature, nor to condemn our race
as bad; but in contrast to His own goodness He calls paternal tenderness evil,1016so great is
the excess of His love to man.</p>
<p>Seest thou an argument unspeakable, of power to arouse to good hopes even him that
hath become utterly desperate?</p>
<p>Now here indeed He signifies His goodness by means of our fathers, but in what precedes
by the chief among His gifts, by the “soul,”1017by the body. And nowhere doth He set down
the chief of all good things, nor bring forward His own coming:—for He who thus made
speed to give up His Son to the slaughter, “how shall He not freely give us all things?”—because
it had not yet come to pass. But Paul indeed sets it forth, thus saying, “He that spared
not His own Son, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things.”1018 But His
discourse with them is still from the things of men.</p>
<p>6. After this, to indicate that we ought neither to feel confidence in prayer, while neglecting
our own doings; nor, when taking pains, trust only to our own endeavors; but both
to seek after the help from above, and contribute withal our own part; He sets forth the one
in connection with the other. For so after much exhortation, He taught also how to pray,
and when He had taught how to pray, He proceeded again to His exhortation concerning
what we are to do; then from that again to the necessity of praying continually, saying, “Ask,”
and “seek,” and “knock.” And thence again, to the necessity of being also diligent ourselves.</p>

<p>Summing up all in brief, and signifying, that virtue is compendious, and easy, and
readily known of all men.</p>
<p>And He did not merely say, “All things whatsoever ye would,” but, “Therefore all things
whatsoever ye would.” For this word, “therefore,” He did not add without purpose, but with
a concealed meaning: “if ye desire,” saith He, “to be heard, together with what I have said,
do these things also.” What then are these? “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you.” Seest thou how He hath hereby also signified that together with prayer we need exact
conversation?1020 And He did not say, “whatsoever things thou wouldest to be done unto
thee of God, those do unto thy neighbor;” lest thou should say, “But how is it possible? He
is God and I am man:” but, “whatsoever thou wouldest to be done unto thee of thy fellow
servant, these things do thou also thyself show forth towards thy neighbor.” What is less
burdensome than this? what fairer?</p>
<p>Then the praise also, before the rewards, is exceeding great.</p>
<p>“For this is the law and the prophets.” Whence it is evident, that virtue is according to
our nature; that we all, of ourselves, know our duties; and that it is not possible for us ever
to find refuge in ignorance.</p>
<p>7. “Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to
destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: and strait is the gate and narrow1021is
the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”1022
And yet after this He said, “My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”1023 And in what
He hath lately said also, He intimated the same: how then doth He here say it is strait and
confined? In the first place, if thou attend, even here He points to it as very light, and easy,
and accessible. “And how,” it may be said, “is the narrow and confined way easy?” Because
it is a way and a gate; even as also the other, though it be wide, though spacious, is also a
way and a gate. And of these there is nothing permanent, but all things are passing away,
both the pains and the good things of life.</p>
<p>And not only herein is the part of virtue easy, but also by the end again it becomes yet
easier. For not the passing away of our labors and toils, but also their issuing in a good end
(for they end in life) is enough to console those in conflict. So that both the temporary nature
of our labors, and the perpetuity of our crowns, and the fact that the labors come first, and
the crowns after, must prove a very great relief in our toils. Wherefore Paul also called their

more when heaven is set forth, and the unspeakable blessings, and the eternal rewards, will
no one feel any of the present hardships. Or if any account it, even thus, to be toilsome, the
suspicion comes of nothing but their own remissness.</p>
<p>See, at any rate, how He on another side also makes it easy, commanding not to hold
intercourse with the dogs, nor to give one’s self over to the swine, and to “beware of the false
prophets;” thus on all accounts causing men to feel as if in real conflict. And the very fact
too of calling it narrow contributed very greatly towards making it easy; for it wrought on
them to be vigilant. As Paul then, when he saith, “We wrestle not against flesh and
blood,”1025doth so not to cast down, but to rouse up the spirits of the soldiers: even so He
also, to shake the travellers out of their sleep, called the way rough. And not in this way only
did He work upon men, to be vigilant, but also by adding, that it contains likewise many to
supplant them; and, what is yet more grievous, they do not even attack openly, but hiding
themselves; for such is the race of the false prophets. “But look not to this,” saith He, “that
it is rough and narrow, but where it ends; nor that the opposite is wide and spacious, but
where it issues.”</p>
<p>And all these things He saith, thoroughly to awaken our alacrity; even as elsewhere also
He said, “Violent men take it by force.”1026 For whoever is in conflict, when he actually sees
the judge of the lists marvelling at the painfulness of his efforts, is the more inspirited.</p>
<p>Let it not then bewilder us, when many things spring up hence, that turn to our vexation.
For the way is strait, and the gate narrow, but not the city.1027 Therefore must one neither
look for rest here, nor there expect any more aught that is painful.</p>
<p>Now in saying, “Few there be that find it,” here again He both declared the careless
ness of the generality, and instructed His hearers not to regard the felicities of the many,
but the labors of the few. For the more part, saith He, so far from walking this way, do not
so much as make it their choice: a thing of most extreme criminality. But we should not regard

the many, nor be troubled thereat, but emulate the few; and, by all means equipping1028ourselves,
should so walk therein.</p>
<p>For besides that it is strait, there are also many to overthrow us in the way that leads
thither. Wherefore He also added,</p>
<p>8. “Beware of false prophets, for they will come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly
they are ravening wolves.”1029 Behold together with the dogs and swine another kind of
ambush and conspiracy, far more grievous than that. For those are acknowledged and open,
but these shaded over. For which cause also, while from those He commanded to hold off,
these He charged men to watch with exact care, as though it were not possible to see them
at the first approach. Wherefore He also said, “beware”; making us more exact to discern
them.</p>
<p>Then, lest when they had heard that it was narrow and strait, and that they must walk
on a way opposite to the many, and must keep themselves from swine and dogs, and together
with these from another more wicked kind, even this of wolves; lest, I say, they should sink
down at this multitude of vexations, having both to go a way contrary to most men, and
therewith again to have such anxiety about these things: He reminded them of what took
place in the days of their fathers, by using the term, “false prophets,” for then also no less
did such things happen. Be not now, I pray you, troubled (so He speaks), for nothing new
nor strange is to befall you. Since for all truth the devil is always secretly substituting its
appropriate deceit.</p>
<p>And by the figure of “false prophets,” here, I think He shadows out not the heretics, but
them that are of a corrupt life, yet wear a mask of virtue; whom the generality are wont to
call by the name of impostors.1030 Wherefore He also said further,</p>
<p>“By their fruits ye shall know them.”1031</p>
<p>For amongst heretics one may often find actual goodness,1032but amongst those whom
I was mentioning, by no means.</p>
<p>“What then,” it may be said, “if in these things too they counterfeit?” “Nay, they will be
easily detected; for such is the nature of this way, in which I commanded men to walk,
painful and irksome; but the hypocrite would not choose to take pains, but to make a show
only; wherefore also he is easily convicted.” Thus, inasmuch as He had said, “there be few

that find it,” He clears them out again from among those, who find it not, yet feign so to do,
by commanding us not to look to them that wear the masks only, but to them who in reality
pursue it.</p>
<p>“But wherefore,” one may say, “did He not make them manifest, but set us on the search
for them?” That we might watch, and be ever prepared for conflict, guarding against our
disguised as well as against our open enemies: which kind indeed Paul also was intimating,
when he said, that “by their good words they deceive the hearts of the simple.”1033 Let us
not be troubled therefore, when we see many such even now. Nay, for this too Christ foretold
from the beginning.</p>
<p>And see His gentleness: how He said not, “Punish them,” but, “Be not hurt by them,”
“Do not fall amongst them unguarded.” Then that thou mightest not say, “it is impossible
to distinguish that sort of men,” again He states an argument from a human example, thus
saying,</p>
<p>“Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? even so every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.”1034</p>
<p>Now what He saith is like this: they have nothing gentle nor sweet; it is the sheep only
so far as the skin; wherefore also it is easy to discern them. And lest thou shouldest have
any the least doubt, He compares it to certain natural necessities, in matters which admit
of no result but one. In which sense Paul also said, “The carnal mind is death; for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”1035</p>
<p>And if He states the same thing twice, it is not tautology. But, lest any one should say,
“Though the evil tree bear evil fruit, it bears also good, and makes the distinction difficult,
the crop being twofold:” “This is not so,” saith He, “for it bears evil fruit only, and never
can bear good: as indeed in the contrary case also.”</p>
<p>“What then? Is there no such thing as a good man becoming wicked? And the contrary
again takes place, and life abounds with many such examples.”</p>
<p>But Christ saith not this, that for the wicked there is no way to change, or that the good
cannot fall away, but that so long as he is living in wickedness, he will not be able to bear
good fruit. For he may indeed change to virtue, being evil; but while continuing in wickedness,
he will not bear good fruit.</p>

<pb n="295"/>
<p>What then? did not David, being good, bear evil fruit? Not continuing good, but being
changed; since, undoubtedly, had he remained always what he was, he would not have
brought forth such fruit. For not surely while abiding in the habit of virtue, did he commit
what he committed.</p>
<p>Now by these words He was also stopping the mouths of those who speak evil at random,
and putting a bridle on the lips of all calumniators. I mean, whereas many suspect the good
by reason of the bad, He by this saying hath deprived them of all excuse. “For thou canst
not say, ‘I am deceived and beguiled;’ since I have given thee exactly this way of distinguishing
them by their works, having added the injunction to go to their actions, and not to confound
all at random.”</p>
<p>9. Then forasmuch as He had not commanded to punish, but only to beware of them,
He, at once both to comfort those whom they vex, and to alarm and change them, set up as
a bulwark against1036them the punishment they should receive at His hands, saying,</p>
<p>“Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.”1037</p>
<p>Then, to make the saying less grievous, He added,</p>
<p>“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”1038</p>
<p>That He might not seem to introduce the threatening as His leading topic, but to be
stirring up their mind in the way of admonition and counsel.</p>
<p>Here He seems to me to be hinting at the Jews also, who were exhibiting such fruits.
Wherefore also He reminded them of the sayings of John, in the very same terms delineating
their punishment. For he too said the very same, making mention to them of an “axe,” and
of a “tree cut down,” and of “unquenchable fire.”</p>
<p>And though it appear indeed to be some single judgment, the being burnt up, yet if one
examine carefully, these are two punishments. For he that is burnt is also cast of course out
of God’s kingdom; and this latter punishment is more grievous than the other. Now I know
indeed that many tremble only at hell, but I affirm the loss of that glory to be a far greater
punishment than hell. And if it be not possible to exhibit it such in words, this is nothing
marvellous. For neither do we know the blessedness of those good things, that we should
on the other hand clearly perceive the wretchedness ensuing on being deprived of them;
since Paul, as knowing these things clearly, is aware, that to fall from Christ’s glory is more
grievous than all. And this we shall know at that time, when we shall fall into the actual trial
of it.</p>
<p>But may this never be our case, O thou only-begotten Son of God, neither may we ever
have any experience of this irremediable punishment. For how great an evil it is to fall from

<pb n="296"/>
those good things, cannot indeed be accurately told: nevertheless, as I may be able, I will
labor and strive by an example to make it clear to you, though it be but in some small degree.</p>
<p>Let us then imagine a wondrous child, having besides His virtue the dominion of the
whole world, and in all respects so virtuous, as to be capable of bringing all men to the
yearning of a father’s affection. What theft do you think the father of this child would not
gladly suffer, not to be cast out of His society? And what evil, small or great, would he not
welcome, on condition of seeing and enjoying Him? Now let us reason just so with respect
to that glory also. For no child, be he never so virtuous, is so desirable and lovely to a father,
as the having our portion in those good things, and “to depart and be with Christ.”1039</p>
<p>No doubt hell, and that punishment, is a thing not to be borne. Yet though one suppose
ten thousand hells, he will utter nothing like what it will be to fail of that blessed glory, to
be hated of Christ, to hear “I know you not,”1040to be accused for not feeding Him when
we saw Him an hungered.1041 Yea, better surely to endure a thousand thunderbolts, than
to see that face of mildness turning away from us, and that eye of peace not enduring to
look upon us. For if He, while I was an enemy, and hating Him, and turning from Him, did
in such wise follow after me, as not to spare even Himself, but to give Himself up unto
death: when after all this I do not vouchsafe to Him so much as a loaf in His hunger, with
what kind of eyes shall I ever again behold Him?</p>
<p>But mark even here His gentleness; in that He doth not at all speak of His benefits, nor
say, “Thou hast despised Him that hath done thee so much good:” neither doth He say, “Me,
who brought thee from that which is not into being, who breathed into thee a soul, and set
thee over all things on earth, who for thy sake made earth, and heaven, and sea, and air, and
all things that are, who had been dishonored by thee, yea accounted of less honor than the
devil, and did not even so withdraw Himself, but had innumerable thoughts for thee after
it all; who chose to become a slave, who was beaten with rods and spit upon, who was slain,
who died the most shameful death, who also on high makes intercession for thee, who freely
gives thee His Spirit, who vouchsafes to thee a kingdom, who makes thee such promises,
whose will it is to be unto thee Head, and Bridegroom, and Garment, and House, and Root,
and Meat, and Drink, and Shepherd, and King, and who hath taken thee to be brother, and
heir, and joint-heir with Himself; who hath brought thee out of darkness into the dominion
of light.” These things, I say, and more than these He might speak of, but He mentions none
of these; but what? only the sin itself.</p>
<p>Even here He shows His love, and indicates the yearning which He hath toward thee:
not saying, “Depart into the fire prepared for you,” but “prepared for the devil.” And before
<note type="footnote">1039 Phil. i. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">1040 Matt. xxv. 12.</note>

<pb n="297"/>
He tells them what wrongs they had done, and neither so doth He endure to mention all,
but a few. And before these He calls the other sort, those who have done well, to signify
from this too that He is blaming them justly.</p>
<p>What amount of punishment, then, is so grievous as these words? For if any one seeing
but a man who was his benefactor an hungered, would not neglect him; or if he should
neglect him, being upbraided with it, would choose rather to sink into the earth than to hear
of it in the presence of two or three friends; what will be our feelings, on hearing these words
in the presence of the whole world; such as He would not say even then, were He not earnestly
accounting for His own doings? For that not to upbraid did He bring these things forward,
but in self-defense, and for the sake of showing, that not without ground nor at random was
He saying, “depart from me;” this is evident from His unspeakable benefits. For if He had
been minded to upbraid, He would have brought forwards all these, but now He mentions
only what treatment He had received.</p>
<p>10. Let us therefore, beloved, fear the hearing these words. Life is not a plaything: or
rather our present life is a plaything, but the things to come are not such; or perchance our
life is not a plaything only, but even worse than this. For it ends not in laughter, but rather
brings exceeding damage on them who are not minded to order their own ways strictly. For
what, I pray thee, is the difference between children who are playing at building houses, and
us when we are building our fine houses? what again between them making out their dinners,
and us in our delicate fare? None, but just that we do it at the risk of being punished. And
if we do not yet quite perceive the poverty of what is going on, no wonder, for we are not
yet become men; but when we are become so, we shall know that all these things are childish.</p>
<p>For so those other things too, as we grow to manhood, we laugh to scorn; but when we
are children we account them to be worth anxiety; and while we are gathering together
potsherds and mire we think no less of ourselves than they who are erecting their great circuits
of walls. Nevertheless they straightway perish and fall down, and not even when
standing can they be of any use to us, as indeed neither can those fine houses. For the citizen
of Heaven they cannot receive, neither can he bear to abide in them, who hath his country
above; but as we throw down these with our feet, so he too those by his high spirit. And as
we laugh at the children, weeping at that overthrow, even so these also, when we are bewailing
it all, do not laugh only, but weep also: because both their bowels are compassionate, and
great is the mischief thence arising.</p>
<p>Let us therefore become men. How long are we to crawl on the earth, priding ourselves
on stones and stocks? How long are we to play? And would we played only! But now we
even betray our own salvation; and as children when they neglect their learning, and practise
themselves in these things at their leisure, suffer very severe blows; even so we too, spending
all our diligence herein, and having then our spiritual lessons required of us in our works,
and not being able to produce them, shall have to pay the utmost penalty. And there is none

<pb n="298"/>
to deliver us; though he be father, brother, what you will. But while these things shall all
pass away, the torment ensuing upon them remains immortal and unceasing; which sort of
thing indeed takes place with respect to the children as well, their father destroying their
childish toys altogether for their idleness, and causing them to weep incessantly.</p>
<p>11. And to convince thee that these things are such, let us bring before us wealth, that
which more than anything seems to be worthy of our pains, and let us set against it a virtue
of the soul (which soever thou wilt), and then shalt thou see most clearly the vileness
thereof. Let us, I say, suppose there are two men (and I do not now speak of injuriousness,
1042but as yet of honest wealth); and of these two, let the one get together money, and
sail on the sea, and till the land, and find many other ways of merchandise (although I know
not quite, whether, so doing, he can make honest gains); nevertheless let it be so, and let it
be granted that his gains are gotten with honesty; that he buys fields, and slaves, and all such
things, and suppose no injustice connected therewith. But let the other one, possessing as
much, sell fields, sell houses, and vessels of gold and silver, and give to the poor; let him
supply the necessitous, heal the sick, free such as are in straits, some let him deliver from
bonds, others let him release that are in mines, these let him bring back from the noose,
those, who are captives, let him rescue from their punishment. Of whose side then would
you be? And we have not as yet spoken of the future, but as yet of what is here. Of whose
part then would ye be? his that is gathering gold, or his that is doing away with calamities?
with him that is purchasing fields, or him who is making himself a harbor of refuge for the
human race? him that is clothed with much gold, or him that is crowned with innumerable
blessings? Is not the one like some angel come down from Heaven for the amendment of
the rest of mankind; but the other not so much as like a man, but like some little child that
is gathering all together vainly and at random?</p>
<p>But if to get money honestly be thus absurd, and of extreme madness; when not even
the honesty is there, how can such a man choose but be more wretched than any? I say, if
the absurdity be so great; when hell is added thereto, and the loss of the kingdom, how great
wailings are due to him, both living and dead?</p>
<p>12. Or wilt thou that we take in hand some other part also of virtue? Let us then introduce
again another man, who is in power, commanding all, invested with great dignity, having
a gorgeous herald, and girdle, and lictors, and a large company of attendants. Doth not this
seem great, and meet to be called happy? Well then, against this man again let us set another,
him that is patient of injuries, and meek, and lowly, and long suffering; and let this last be
despitefully used, be beaten, and let him bear it quietly, and bless them that are doing such
things.</p>
<note type="footnote">1042 [πλεονεξα.]</note>

<pb n="299"/>
<p>Now which is the one to be admired, I pray thee? He that is puffed up, and inflamed,
or he that is self-subdued? Is not the one again like the powers above, that are so free from
passion, but the other like a blown bladder, or a man who hath the dropsy, and great inflammation?
The one like a spiritual physician, the other, a ridiculous child that is puffing out
his cheeks?</p>
<p>For why dost thou pride thyself, O man? Because thou art borne on high in a chariot?
Because a yoke of mules is drawing thee? And what is this? Why, this one may see befalling
mere logs of wood and stones. Is it that thou art clothed with beautiful garments? But look
at him that is clad with virtue for garments, and thou wilt see thyself to be like withering
hay, but him like a tree that bears marvellous fruit, and affords much delight to the beholders.
For thou art bearing about food for worms and moths, who, if they should set upon thee,
will quickly strip thee bare of this adorning (for truly garments and gold and silver, are the
one, the spinning of worms; the other earth and dust, and again become earth and nothing
more): but he that is clothed with virtue hath such raiment, as not only worms cannot hurt,
but not even death itself. And very naturally; for these virtues of the soul have not their
origin from the earth, but are a fruit of the Spirit; wherefore neither are they subject to the
mouths of worms. Nay, for these garments are woven in Heaven, where is neither moth,
nor worm, nor any other such thing.</p>
<p>Which then is better, tell me? To be rich, or to be poor? To be in power, or in dishonor?
In luxury, or in hunger? It is quite clear; to be in honor, and enjoyment, and wealth.
Therefore, if thou wouldest have the things and not the names, leave the earth and what is
here, and find thee a place to anchor in Heaven: for what is here is a shadow, but all things
there are immovable, stedfast, and beyond any assault.</p>
<p>Let us therefore choose them with all diligent care, that we may be delivered from the
turmoil of the things here, and having sailed into that calm harbor, may be found with our
lading abundant, and with that unspeakable wealth of almsgiving; unto which God grant
we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
the glory and the might, world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXIV.</head>
<p>Matt. VII. 21.</p>
<p>“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven, but
he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.”</p>
<p>Wherefore said He not, “but he that doeth my will?” Because for the time it was a great
gain1043for them to receive even this first; yea it was very great, considering their weakness.
And moreover He intimated the one also by the other. And withal this may be mentioned,
that in fact there is no other will of the Son besides that of the Father.</p>
<p>And here He seems to me to be censuring the Jews chiefly, laying as they did the whole
stress upon the doctrines, and taking no care of practice. For which Paul also blames them,
saying, “Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
and knowest His will:”1044“Who then are these men?” you ask. Many of them that believed
received gifts such as he that was casting out devils,1045and was not with Him; such as Judas;
for even he too, wicked as he was, had a gift. And in the Old Testament also this may be
found, in that grace hath oftentimes wrought upon unworthy persons, that it might do good
to others. That is, since all men were not meet for all things, but some were of a pure life,
not having so great faith, and others just the contrary; by these sayings, while He urges the
one to show forth much faith, the others too He was summoning by this His unspeakable
gift to become better men. Wherefore also with great abundance did He bestow that grace.
For “we wrought,” it is said, “many mighty works.” But “then will I profess unto them, I
knew you not.” For “now indeed they suppose they are my friends; but then shall they know,
that not as to friends did I give to them.”</p>
<p>And why marvel if He hath bestowed gifts on men that have believed on Him, though
without life suitable to their faith, when even on those who have fallen from both these, He
is unquestionably found working? For so Balaam was an alien both from faith and from a
truly good life; nevertheless grace wrought on him for the service1046of other men. And
Pharaoh too was of the same sort: yet for all that even to him He signified the things to
come. And Nebuchadnezzar was very full of iniquity; yet to him again He revealed what
was to follow after many generations.1047 And again to the son of this last, though surpassing

his father in iniquity, He signified the things to come, ordering a marvellous and great dispensation.
1048 Accordingly because then also the beginnings of the gospel were taking place,
and it was requisite that the manifestation of its power should be abundant, many even of
the unworthy used to receive gifts. Howbeit, from those miracles no gain accrued to them;
rather they are the more punished. Wherefore unto them did He utter even that fearful
saying, “I never knew you:” there being many for whom His hatred begins already even
here; whom He turns away from, even before the judgment.</p>
<p>Let us fear therefore, beloved; and let us take great heed to our life, neither let us account
ourselves worse off, in that we do not work miracles now. For that will never be any advantage
to us, as neither any disadvantage in our not working them, if we take heed to all virtue.
Because for the miracles we ourselves are debtors, but for our life and our doings we have
God our debtor.</p>
<p>3. Having now, you see, finished all, having discoursed accurately of all virtue, and
pointed out the pretenders to it, of divers kinds, both such as for display fast and make
prayers, and such as come in the sheep’s hide; and them too that spoil it, whom He also
called swine and dogs: He proceeds to signify how great is the profit of virtue even here,
and how great the mischief of wickedness, by saying,</p>
<p>“Whosoever therefore heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened
unto a wise man.”1049</p>
<p>As thus: What they shall suffer who do not (although they work miracles), ye have heard;
but ye should know also what such as obey all these sayings shall enjoy; not in the world to
come only, but even here. “For whosoever,” saith He, “heareth these sayings of mine, and
doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He varies His discourse; at one time saying, “Not every one that saith
unto me, Lord, Lord,” and revealing Himself; at another time, “He that doeth the will of my
Father;” and again, bringing in Himself as judge, “For many will say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and I will say, I know you not.” And here again
He indicates Himself to have the power over all, this being why He said, “Whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine.”</p>
<p>Thus whereas all His discourse had been touching the future; of a kingdom, and an
unspeakable reward and consolation, and the like; His will is, out of things here also to give
them their fruits, and to signify how great is the strength of virtue even in the present life.
What then is this her strength? To live in safety, to be easily subdued by no terror, to stand
superior to all that despitefully use us. To this what can be equal? For this, not even he that

wears the diadem can provide for himself, but that man who follows after virtue. For he
alone is possessed of it in full abundance: in the ebb and flow1050of the things present he
enjoys a great calm. The truly marvellous thing being this, that not in fair weather, but when
the storm is vehement, and the turmoil great, and the temptations continual, he cannot be
shaken ever so little.</p>
<p>“For the rain descended,” saith He, “the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.”1051</p>
<p>By “rain” here, and “floods,” and “winds,” He is expressing metaphorically the calamities
and afflictions that befall men; such as false accusations, plots, bereavements, deaths, loss
of friends, vexations from strangers, all the ills in our life that any one could mention. “But
to none of these,” saith He, “doth such a soul give way; and the cause is, it is founded on the
rock.” He calls the stedfastness of His doctrine a rock; because in truth His commands are
stronger than any rock, setting one above all the waves of human affairs. For he who keeps
these things strictly, will not have the advantage of men only when they are vexing him, but
even of the very devils plotting against him. And that it is not vain boasting so to speak, Job
is our witness, who received all the assaults of the devil, and stood unmoveable; and the
apostles too are our witnesses, for that when the waves of the whole world were beating
against them, when both nations and princes, both their own people and strangers, both
the evil spirits, and the devil, and every engine was set in motion, they stood firmer than a
rock, and dispersed it all.</p>
<p>And now, what can be happier than this kind of life? For this, not wealth, not strength
of body, not glory, not power, nor ought else will be able to secure, but only the possession
of virtue. For there is not, nay there is not another life we may find free from all evils, but
this alone. And ye are witnesses, who know the plots in king’s courts, the turmoils and the
troubles in the houses of the rich. But there was not among the apostles any such thing.</p>
<p>What then? Did no such thing befall them? Did they suffer no evil at any man’s hand?
Nay, the marvel is this above all things, that they were indeed the object of many plots, and
many storms burst upon them, but their soul was not overset by them, nor thrown into
despair, but with naked bodies they wrestled, prevailed, and triumphed.</p>
<p>Thou then likewise, if thou be willing to perform these things exactly, shall laugh all ills
to scorn. Yea, for if thou be but strengthened with such philosophy as is in these admonitions,
nothing shall be able to hurt thee. Since in what is he to harm thee, who is minded to lay
plots? Will he take away thy money? Well, but before their threatening thou wast commanded
to despise it, and to abstain from it so exceedingly, as not so much as even to ask any such
thing of thy Lord. But doth he cast thee into prison? Why, before thy prison, thou wast en-

joined so to live, as to be crucified even to all the world. But doth he speak evil? Nay, from
this pain also Christ hath delivered thee, by promising thee without toil a great reward for
the endurance of evil, and making thee so clear from the anger and vexation hence arising,
as even to command thee to pray for them. But doth he banish thee and involve thee in innumerable
ills? Well, he is making the crown more glorious for thee. But doth he destroy
and murder thee? Even hereby he profits thee very greatly, procuring for thee the rewards
of the martyrs, and conducting thee more quickly into the untroubled haven, and affording
thee matter for a more abundant recompence, and contriving for thee to make a gain of the
universal penalty.1052 Which thing indeed is most marvellous of all, that the plotters, so far
from injuring at all, do rather make the objects of their despite more approved. To this what
can be comparable? I mean, to the choice of such a mode of life as this, and no other, is.</p>
<p>Thus whereas He had called the way strait and narrow; to soothe our labors on this side
also, He signifies the security thereof to be great, and great the pleasure; even as of the op-
posite course great is the unsoundness, and the detriment. For as virtue even from things
here was signified by Him to have her rewards, so vice also her penalties. For what I am ever
saying, that I will say now also: that in both ways He is everywhere bringing about the salvation
of His hearers on the one hand by zeal for virtue, on the other by hatred of vice. Thus,
because there would be some to admire what He said, while they yield no proof of it by their
works, He by anticipation awakens their fears, saying, Though the things spoken be good,
hearing is not sufficient for security, but there is need also of obedience in actions, and the
whole lies chiefly in this. And here He ends His discourse, leaving the fear at its height in
them.</p>
<p>For as with regard to virtue, not only from the things to come did He urge them
(speaking of a kingdom, and of Heaven, and an unspeakable reward, and comfort, and the
unnumbered good things): but also from the things present, indicating the firm and immoveable
quality of the Rock; so also with respect to wickedness, not from the expected things
only doth He excite their fears (as from the tree that is cut down, and the unquenchable fire,
and the not entering into the kingdom, and from His saying, “I know you not”): but also
from the things present, the downfall, I mean, in what is said of the house.</p>
<p>4. Wherefore also He made His argument more expressive, by trying its force1053in a
parable; for it was not the same thing to say, “The virtuous man shall be impregnable, but
the wicked easily subdued,” as to suppose a rock, and a house, and rivers, and rain, and
wind, and the like.</p>

<p>“And every one,” saith He, “that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.”1054</p>
<p>And well did He call this man “foolish”: for what can be more senseless than one
building a house on the sand, and while he submits to the labor, depriving himself of the
fruit and refreshment, and instead thereof undergoing punishment? For that they too, who
follow after wickedness, do labor, is surely manifest to every one: since both the extortioner,
and the adulterer, and the false accuser, toil and weary themselves much to bring their
wickedness to effect; but so far from reaping any profit from these their labors, they rather
undergo great loss. For Paul too intimated this when he said, “He that soweth to his flesh,
shall of his flesh reap corruption.”1055 To this man are they like also, who build on the sand;
as those that are given up to fornication, to wantonness, to drunkenness, to anger, to all the
other things.</p>
<p>Such an one was Ahab, but not such Elijah (since when we have put virtue and vice
along side of one another, we shall know more accurately the difference): for the one had
built upon the rock, the other on the sand; wherefore though he were a king, he feared and
trembled at the prophet, at him that had only his sheepskin. Such were the Jews but not the
apostles; and so though they were few and in bonds, they exhibited the steadfastness of the
rock; but those, many as they were, and in armor, the weakness of the sand. For so they said,
“What shall we do to these men?”1056 Seest thou those in perplexity, not who are in the
hands of others, and bound, but who are active in holding down and binding? And what
can be more strange than this? Hast thou hold of the other, and art yet in utter perplexity?
Yes, and very naturally. For inasmuch as they had built all on the sand, therefore also were
they weaker than all. For this cause also they said again, “What do ye, seeking to bring this
man’s blood upon us?”1057 What saith he? Dost thou scourge, and art thou in fear? entreatest
thou despitefully, and art in dismay? Dost thou judge, and yet tremble? So feeble is
wickedness.</p>
<p>But the Apostles not so, but how? “We cannot but speak the things which we have seen
and heard.”1058 Seest thou a noble spirit? seest thou a rock laughing waves to scorn? seest
thou a house unshaken? And what is yet more marvellous; so far from turning cowards
themselves at the plots formed against them, they even took more courage, and cast the
others into greater anxiety. For so he that smites adamant, is himself the one smitten; and
he that kicks against the pricks, is himself the one pricked, the one on whom the severe

wounds fall: and he who is forming plots against the virtuous, is himself the one in jeopardy.
For wickedness becomes so much the weaker, the more it sets itself in array against virtue.
And as he who wraps up fire in a garment, extinguishes not the flame, but consumes the
garment; so he that is doing despite to virtuous men, and oppressing them, and binding
them, makes them more glorious, but destroys himself.1059 For the more ills thou sufferest,
living righteously, the stronger art thou become; since the more we honor self-restraint, the
less we need anything; and the less we need anything, the stronger we grow, and the more
above all. Such a one was John; wherefore him no man pained, but he caused pain to Herod;
so he that had nothing prevailed against him that ruled; and he that wore a diadem, and
purple, and endless pomp, trembles, and is in fear of him that is stripped of all, and not even
when beheaded could he without fear see his head. For that even after his death he had the
terror of him in full strength, hear what He saith, “This is John, whom I slew.”1060 Now the
expression, “I slew,” is that of one not exulting, but soothing his own terror, and persuading
his troubled soul to call to mind, that he himself slew him. So great is the force of virtue,
that even after death it is more powerful than the living. For this same cause again, when
he was living, they that possessed much wealth came unto him, and said, “What shall we
do?”1061 Is so much yours, and are ye minded to learn the way of your prosperity from him
that hath nothing? the rich from the poor? the soldiers from him that hath not even a house?</p>
<p>Such an one was Elias too: wherefore also with the same freedom did he discourse to
the people. For as the former said, “Ye generation of vipers;”1062so this latter, “How long
will ye halt upon both your hips?”1063 And the one said, “Hast thou killed, and inherited?”
1064the other, “It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife.”1065</p>
<p>Seest thou the rock? Seest thou the sand; how easily it sinks down, how it yields to
calamities? how it is overthrown, though it have the support of royalty, of number, of nobility?
For them that pursue it, it makes more senseless than all.</p>
<p>And it doth not merely fall, but with great calamity: for “great indeed,” He saith, “was
the fall of it.” The risk not being of trifles, but of the soul, of the loss of Heaven, and those
immortal blessings. Or rather even before that loss, no life so wretched as he must live that
follows after this; dwelling with continual despondencies, alarms, cares, anxieties; which a

certain wise man also was intimating when he said, “The wicked fleeth, when no man is
pursuing.”1066 For such men tremble at their shadows, suspect their friends, their enemies,
their servants, such as know them, such as know them not; and before their punishment,
suffer extreme punishment here. And to declare all this, Christ said, “And great was the fall
of it;” shutting up these good commandments with that suitable ending, and persuading
even by the things present the most unbelieving to flee from vice.</p>
<p>For although the argument from what is to come be vaster, yet is this of more power to
restrain the grosser sort, and to withdraw them from wickedness. Wherefore also he ended
with it, that the profit thereof might make its abode in them.</p>
<p>Conscious therefore of all these things, both the present, and the future, let us flee from
vice, let us emulate virtue, that we may not labor fruitlessly and at random, but may both
enjoy the security here, and partake of the glory there: unto which God grant we may all
attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory
and the might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXV.</head>
<p>Matt. VII. 28.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at His
doctrine.”1067</p>
<p>Yet was it rather natural for them to grieve at the unpleasantness of His sayings, and to
shudder at the loftiness of His injunctions; but now so great was the power of the Teacher,
that many of them were even caught thereby, and thrown into very great admiration, and
persuaded by reason of the sweetness of His sayings, not even when He ceased to speak, to
depart from Him at all afterwards. For neither did the hearers depart, He having come
down from the mountain, but even then the whole auditory followed Him; so great a love
for His sayings had He instilled into them.</p>
<p>But they were astonished most of all at His authority. For not with reference to another,
like the prophet and Moses, did He say what He said; but everywhere indicating Himself to
be the person that had the power of deciding. For so, when setting forth His laws, He still
kept adding, “But I say unto you.” And in reminding them of that day, He declared Himself
to be the judge, both by the punishments, and by the honors.</p>
<p>And yet it was likely that this too would disturb them. For if, when they saw Him by
His works showing forth His authority, the scribes were for stoning and persecuting Him;
while there were words only to prove this, how was it other than likely for them to be offended?
and especially when at first setting out these things were said, and before He had given
proof of His own power? But however, they felt nothing of this; for when the heart and mind
is candid, it is easily persuaded by the words of the truth. And this is just why one sort, even
when the miracles were proclaiming His power, were offended; while the other on hearing
mere words were persuaded and followed Him. This, I would add, the evangelist too is intimating,
when he saith, “great multitudes followed Him,”1068not any of the rulers, nor of
the scribes, but as many as were free from vice, and had their judgment uncorrupted. And
throughout the whole gospel thou seest that such clave unto Him. For both while He spake,
they used to listen in silence, not making any intrusion, nor breaking in upon the connexion
of His sayings, nor tempting Him, and desiring to find a handle like the Pharisees; and after
His exhortation they followed Him again, marvelling.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, the Lord’s consideration, how He varies the mode of
profiting His hearers, after miracles entering on words, and again from the instruction by
His words passing to miracles. Thus, both before they went up into the mountain, He healed
<note type="footnote">1067 [R.V., “When Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1068 Matt. viii. 1.</note>

<pb n="308"/>
many, preparing the way for His sayings; and after finishing that long discourse to the people,
He comes again to miracles, confirming what had been said by what was done. And so, because
He was teaching as “one having authority,” lest His so teaching should be thought
boasting and arrogant, He doth the very same in His works also, as having authority to heal;
that they might no more be perplexed at seeing Him teach in this way, when He was working
His miracles also in the same.</p>
<p>2. “For when He was come down from the mountain, there came a leper, saying, Lord,
if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.”1069 Great was the understanding and the faith of
him who so drew near. For he did not interrupt the teaching, nor break through the auditory,
but awaited the proper time, and approaches Him “when He is come down.” And not at
random, but with much earnestness, and at His knees, he beseeches Him,1070as another
evangelist saith, and with the genuine faith and right opinion about him. For neither did he
say, “If Thou request it of God,” nor, “If Thou pray,” but, “If Thou wilt, Thou canst make
me clean.” Nor did he say, “Lord, cleanse me,” but leaves all to Him, and makes His recovery
depend on Him, and testifies that all the authority is His.</p>
<p>“What then,” saith one, “if the leper’s opinion was mistaken?” It were meet to do away
with it, and to reprove, and set it right. Did He then so do? By no means; but quite on the
contrary, He establishes and confirms what had been said. For this cause, you see, neither
did He say, “Be thou cleansed,” but, “I will, be thou clean;” that the doctrine might no longer
be a thing of the other’s surmising, but of His own approval.</p>
<p>But the apostles not so: rather in what way? The whole people being in amazement, they
said, “Why give heed to us, as though by our own power or authority we had made him to
walk?”1071 But the Lord, though He spake oftentimes many things modestly, and beneath
His own glory, what saith He here, to establish the doctrine of them that were amazed at
Him for His authority? “I will, be thou clean.” Although in the many and great signs which
He wrought, He nowhere appears to have uttered this word. Here however, to confirm the
surmise both of all the people and of the leper touching His authority, He purposely added,
“I will.”</p>
<p>And it was not that He said this, but did it not; but the work also followed immediately.
Whereas, if he had not spoken well, but the saying had been a blasphemy, the work ought
to have been interrupted. But now nature herself gave way at His command, and that speedily,

as was meet, even more speedily than the evangelist hath said. For the word, “immediately,”
falls far short of the quickness that there was in the work.</p>
<p>But He did not merely say, “I will, be thou clean,” but He also “put forth His hand, and
touched him;” a thing especially worthy of inquiry. For wherefore, when cleansing him by
will and word, did He add also the touch of His hand? It seems to me, for no other end, but
that He might signify by this also, that He is not subject to the law, but is set over it; and
that to the clean, henceforth, nothing is unclean.1072 For this cause, we see, Elisha did not
so much as see Naaman, but though he perceived that he was offended at his not coming
out and touching him, observing the strictness of the law, he abides at home, and sends him
to Jordan to wash. Whereas the Lord, to signify that He heals not as a servant, but as absolute
master, doth also touch. For His hand became not unclean from the leprosy, but the leprous
body was rendered clean by His holy hand.</p>
<p>Because, as we know, He came not to heal bodies only, but also to lead the soul unto
self-command. As therefore He from that time forward no more forbad to eat with unwashen
hands, introducing that excellent law, which relates to the indifference of meats; just so in
this case also, to instruct us for the future, that the soul must be our care;—that leaving the
outward purifications, we must wipe that clean, and dread the leprosy thereof alone, which
is sin (for to be a leper is no hindrance to virtue):—He Himself first touches the leper, and
no man finds fault. For the tribunal was not corrupt, neither were the spectators under the
power of envy. Therefore, so far from blaming, they were on the contrary astonished at the
miracle, and yielded thereto: and both for what He said, and for what He did, they adored
his uncontrollable power.</p>
<p>3. Having therefore healed his body, He bids him,</p>
<p>“Tell no man, but show himself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
for a testimony unto them.”1073</p>
<p>Now some say, that for this intent He bade him tell no man, that they might practise
no craft about the discerning of his cure; a very foolish suspicion on their part. For He did
not so cleanse as to leave the cleansing questionable, but He bids him “tell no man,” teaching
us to avoid boasting and vainglory. And yet He well knew that the other would not obey,
but would proclaim his benefactor: nevertheless He doth His own part.</p>
<p>“How then elsewhere doth He bid them tell of it?” one may ask. Not as jostling with or
opposing Himself, but as teaching men to be grateful. For neither in that place did He give
command to proclaim Himself, but to “give glory to God;”1074by this leper training us to

<pb n="310"/>
be clear of pride and vainglory, by the other to be thankful and grateful; and instructing on
every occasion to offer to the Lord the praise of all things that befall us. That is, because
men for the most part remember God in sickness, but grow slacker after recovery; He bids
them continually both in sickness and in health to give heed to the Lord, in these words,
“give glory to God.”</p>
<p>But wherefore did He command him also to show himself to the priest, and to offer a
gift? To fulfill the law here again.1075 For neither did He in every instance set it aside, nor
in every instance keep it, but sometimes He did the one, sometimes the other; by the one
making way for the high rule1076of life that was to come, by the other checking for a while
the insolent speech of the Jews, and condescending to their infirmity. And why marvel, if
just at the beginning He Himself did this, when even the very apostles, after they were
commanded to depart unto the Gentiles, after the doors were opened for their teaching
throughout the world, and the law shut up, and the commandments made new, and all the
ancient things had ceased, are found sometimes observing the law, sometimes neglecting
it?</p>
<p>But what, it may be said, doth this saying, “Show thyself to the priest,” contribute to the
keeping of the law? No little. Because it was an ancient law, that the leper when cleansed
should not entrust to himself the judgment of his cleansing, but should show himself to the
priest, and present the demonstration thereof to his eyes, and by that sentence be numbered
amongst the clean. For if the priest said not “The leper is cleansed,” he remained still with
the unclean without the camp. Wherefore he saith, “Show thyself to the priest, and offer the
gift that Moses commanded.” He said not, “which I command,” but for a time remits him
to the law, by every means stopping their mouths. Thus, lest they should say, He had seized
upon the priests’ honor; though He performed the work Himself, yet the approving it He
entrusted to them, and made them sit as judges of His own miracles. “Why, I am so far,”
He saith, “from striving either with Moses or with the priests, that I guide the objects of my
favor to submit themselves unto them.”</p>
<p>But what is, “for a testimony unto them”? For reproof, for demonstration, for accusation,
if they be unthankful. For since they said, as a deceiver and impostor we persecute Him, as
an adversary of God, and a transgressor of the law; “Thou shalt bear me witness,” saith He,
“at that time, that I am not a transgressor of the law. Nay, for having healed thee, I remit
thee to the law, and to the approval of the priests;” which was the act of one honoring the
law, and admiring Moses, and not setting himself in opposition to the ancient doctrines.</p>
<p>And if they were not in fact to be the better, hereby most of all one may perceive His
respect for the law, that although He foreknew they would reap no benefit, He fulfilled all
<note type="footnote">1075 Lev. xiv. 1–32.</note>
<note type="footnote">1076 φιλοσοφ.</note>

<pb n="311"/>
His part. For this very thing He did indeed foreknow, and foretold it: not saying, “for their
correction,” neither, “for their instruction,” but, “for a testimony unto them,” that is, for
accusation, and for reproof, and for a witness that all hath been done on my part; and though
I foreknew they would continue incorrigible, not even so did I omit what ought to be done;
only they continued keeping up to the end their own wickedness.1077</p>
<p>This, we may observe, He saith elsewhere also; “This gospel shall be preached in all the
world for a testimony to all the nations, and then shall the end come;”1078to the nations, to
them that obey not, to them that believe not. Thus, lest any one should say, “And wherefore
preach to all, if all are not to believe?”—it is that I may be found to have done all my own
part, and that no man may hereafter be able to find fault, as though he had not heard. For
the very preaching shall bear witness against them, and they will not be able hereafter to
say, “We heard not;” for the word of godliness “hath gone out unto the ends of the world.”1079</p>
<p>4. Therefore bearing these things in mind, let us also fulfill all our duties to our neighbor,
and to God let us give thanks continually. For it is too monstrous, enjoying as we do His
bounty in deed every day, not so much as in word to acknowledge the favor; and this, though
the acknowledgment again yield all its profit to us. Since He needs not, be sure, anything of
ours: but we stand in need of all things from Him. Thus thanksgiving itself adds nothing to
Him, but causes us to be nearer to Him. For if men’s bounties, when we call them to memory,
do the more warm us with their proper love-charm;1080much more when we are continually
bringing to mind the noble acts of our Lord towards us, shall we be more diligent in regard
of His commandments.</p>
<p>For this cause Paul also said, “Be ye thankful.”1081 For the best preservative of any benefit
is the remembrance of the benefit, and a continual thanksgiving.</p>
<p>For this cause even the awful mysteries, so full of that great salvation, which are celebrated
at every communion, are called a sacrifice of thanksgiving,1082because they are the commemoration
of many benefits, and they signify the very sum of God’s care for us, and by all
means they work upon us to be thankful. For if His being born of a virgin was a great miracle,

to pour forth His blood, and to give Himself to us for a spiritual feast and banquet,—what
can that be called? Let us therefore give Him thanks continually, and let this precede both
our words and our works.</p>
<p>But let us be thankful not for our own blessings alone, but also for those of others; for
in this way we shall be able both to destroy our envy, and to rivet our charity, and make it
more genuine. Since it will not even be possible for thee to go on envying them, in behalf
of whom thou givest thanks to the Lord.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as you know, the priest also enjoins to give thanks for the world, for the
former things, for the things that are now, for what hath been done to us before, for what
shall befall us hereafter, when that sacrifice1083is set forth.</p>
<p>For this is the thing both to free us from earth, and to remove us into heaven, and to
make us angels instead of men. Because they too form a choir, and give thanks to God for
His good things bestowed on us, saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will towards men.”1084“And what is this to us, that are not upon earth, nor are men?”
“Nay, it is very much to us, for we have been taught so to love our fellow serv ants, as even
to account their blessings ours.”</p>
<p>Wherefore Paul also, everywhere in his epistles, gives thanks for God’s gracious acts to
the world.</p>
<p>Let us too therefore continually give thanks, for our own blessings, and for those of
others, alike for the small and for the great. For though the gift be small, it is made great by
being God’s gift, or rather, there is nothing small that cometh from Him, not only because
it is bestowed by Him, but also in its very nature.</p>
<p>And to pass over all the rest, which exceed the sand in multitude; what is equal to the
dispensation1085that hath taken place for our sake? In that what was more precious to Him
than all, even His only-begotten Son, Him He gave for us His enemies; and not only gave,
but after giving, did even set Him before us as food;1086 Himself doing all things that were
for our good, both in giving Him, and in making us thankful for all this. For because man
is for the most part unthankful, He doth Himself everywhere take in hand and bring about
what is for our good. And what He did with respect to the Jews, by places, and times, and
feasts, reminding them of His benefits, that He did in this case also, by the manner of the
sacrifice bringing us to a perpetual remembrance of His bounty in these things.</p>

<p>No one hath so labored that we should be approved, and great, and in all things rightminded,
as the God who made us. Wherefore both against our will He befriends us often,
and without our knowledge oftener than not. And if thou marvel at what I have said, I point
to this as having occurred not to any ordinary person, but to the blessed Paul. For even that
blessed man, when in much danger and affliction, often besought God that the temptations
might depart from him: nevertheless God regarded not his request, but his profit, and to
signify this He said, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in
weakness.”1087 So that before He hath told him the reason, He benefits him against his will,
and without his knowing it.</p>
<p>5. Now what great thing doth He ask, in requiring us to be thankful in return for such
tender care? Let us then obey, and everywhere keep up this. Since neither were the Jews by
anything ruined so much, as by being unthankful; those many stripes, one after another,
were brought upon them by nothing else than this; or rather even before those stripes this
had ruined and corrupted their soul. “For the hope of the unthankful,” saith one, “is like
the winter’s hoar frost;”1088it benumbs and deadens the soul, as that doth our bodies.</p>
<p>And this springs from pride, and from thinking one’s self worthy of something. But the
contrite will acknowledge grounds of thanksgiving to God, not for good things only, but
also for what seem to be adverse; and how much soever he may suffer, will count none of
his sufferings undeserved. Let us then also, the more we advance in virtue, so much the
more make ourselves contrite; for indeed this, more than anything else is virtue. Because,
as the sharper our sight is, the more thoroughly do we learn how distant we are from the
sky; so the more we advance in virtue, so much the more are we instructed in the difference
between God and us. And this is no small part of true wisdom,1089to be able to perceive our
own desert. For he best knows himself, who accounts himself to be nothing. Thus we see
that both David and Abraham, when they were come up to the highest pitch of virtue, then
best fulfilled this; and would call themselves, the one, “earth and ashes,”1090the other, “a
worm;”1091and all the saints too, like these, acknowledge their own wretchedness. So that
he surely who is lifted up in boasting, is the very person to be most ignorant of himself.
Wherefore also in our common practice we are wont to say of the proud, “he knows not
himself,” “he is ignorant of himself.” And he that knows not himself, whom will he know?
For as he that knows himself will know all things, so he who knows not this, neither will he
know the rest.</p>

<p>Such an one was he that saith, “I will exalt my throne above the Heavens.”1092and did
not account himself to be worthy so much as of the title of the apostles, after so many and
so great deeds of goodness.</p>
<p>Him therefore let us emulate and follow. And we shall follow him, if we rid ourselves
of earth, and of things on earth. For nothing makes a man to be so ignorant of himself, as
the being rivetted to worldly concerns: nor does anything again so much cause men to be
rivetted to worldly concerns, as ignorance of one’s self: for these things depend upon each
other. I mean, that as he that is fond of outward glory, and highly esteems the things present,
if he strive for ever, is not permitted to understand himself; so he that overlooks these things
will easily know himself; and having come to the knowledge of himself, he will proceed in
order to all the other parts of virtue.</p>
<p>In order therefore that we may learn this good knowledge, let us, disengaged from all
the perishable things that kindle in us so great flame, and made aware of their vileness, show
forth all lowliness of mind, and self-restraint: that we may attain unto blessings, both present
and future: by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory,
might, and honor, to the Father, together with the Holy and Good Spirit, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. VIII. 5.</p>
<p>“And when He was entered into Capernaum, there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching
Him, and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home1093sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.”</p>
<p>The leper came unto Him “when He was come down from the mountain,” but this
centurion, “when He was entered into Capernaum.” Wherefore then did neither the one
nor the other go up into the mountain? Not out of remissness, for indeed the faith of them
both was fervent, but in order not to interrupt His teaching.</p>
<p>But having come unto Him, he saith, “My servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
grievously tormented.” Now some say, that by way of excuse he mentioned also the cause,
why he had not brought him. “For neither was it possible,” saith he, “paralyzed as he was,
and tormented, and at his last gasp, to lift and convey him.” For that he was at the point of
expiring, Luke saith; “He was even ready to die.”1094 But I say, this is a sign of his having
great faith, even much greater than theirs, who let one down through the roof.1095 For because
he knew for certain, that even a mere command was enough for the raising up of the patient,
he thought it superfluous to bring him.</p>
<p>What then doth Jesus? What He had in no case done before, here He doeth. For
whereas on every occasion He was used to follow the wish of His supplicants, here He rather
springs toward it, and offers not only to heal him, but also to come to the house. And this
He doth, that we might learn the virtue of the centurion. For if He had not made this offer,
but had said, “Go thy way, let thy servant be healed;” we should have known none of these
things.</p>
<p>This at least He did, in an opposite way, in the case also of the Phoenician woman. For
here, when not summoned to the house, of His own accord He saith, He will come, that
thou mightest learn the centurion’s faith and great humility; but in the case of the Phoenician
woman, He both refuses the grant, and drives her, persevering therein, to great perplexity.</p>
<p>For being a wise physician and full of resources, He knows how to bring about contraries
the one by the other.1096 And as here by His freely-offered coming, so there by His peremptory
putting off and denial, He unfolds the woman’s faith. So likewise He doth in Abraham’s

case, saying, “I will by no means hide from Abraham my servant;”1097to make thee know
that man’s kindly affection, and his care for Sodom. And in the instance of Lot,1098they that
were sent refuse to enter into his house, to make thee know the greatness of that righteous
man’s hospitality.</p>
<p>What then saith the centurion? “I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my
roof.”1099 Let us hearken, as many as are to receive Christ: for it is possible to receive Him
even now. Let us hearken, and emulate, and receive Him with as great zeal; for indeed, when
thou receivest a poor man who is hungry and naked, thou hast received and cherished Him.</p>
<p>2. “But say in a word only,1100and my servant shall be healed.”</p>
<p>See this man also, how, like the leper, he hath the right opinion touching Him. For
neither did this one say, “entreat,” nor did he say, “pray, and beseech,” but “command only.”
And then from fear lest out of modesty He refuse, he saith,</p>
<p>“For I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to this man,
go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he
doeth it.”1101</p>
<p>“And what of that,” saith one, “if the centurion did suspect it to be so? For the question
is, whether Christ affirmed and ratified as much.” Thou speakest well, and very sensibly.
Let us then look to this very thing; and we shall find what happened in the case of the leper,
the same happening here likewise. For even as the leper said, “If thou wilt” (and not from
the leper only are we positive about His authority, but also from the voice of Christ; in that,
so far from putting an end to the suspicion, He did even confirm it more, by adding what
were else superfluous to say, in the phrase, “I will, be thou cleansed,” in order to establish
that man’s doctrine): so here too, it is right to see whether any such thing occurred. In fact,
we shall find this same thing again taking place. For when the centurion had spoken such
words, and had testified His so great prerogative; so far from blaming, He did even approve
it, and did somewhat more than approve it. For neither hath the evangelist said, that He
praised the saying only, but declaring a certain earnestness in His praise, that He even
“marvelled;” and neither did He simply marvel, but in the presence also of the whole people,
and set Him as an example to the rest, that they should emulate Him.</p>
<p>Seest thou how each of them that bore witness of His authority is “marvelled at? And
the multitudes were astonished at His doctrine, because He taught as one having authority;”
1102and so far from blaming them, He both took them with Him when He came down,

and by His words of cleansing to the leper, confirmed their judgment. Again, that leper said,
“If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean;”1103and so far from rebuking, He on the contrary
cleansed him by such treatment as He had said. Again, this centurion saith, “Speak the word
only, and my servant shall be healed:”1104and “marvelling” at him, He said, “I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.”1105</p>
<p>Now, to convince thee of this by the opposite also; Martha having said nothing of this
sort, but on the contrary, “Whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, He will give Thee;”1106so far
from being praised, although an acquaintance, and dear to Him, and one of them that had
shown great zeal toward Him, she was rather rebuked and corrected by Him, as not having
spoken well; in that He said to her, “Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou
shouldest see the glory of God?”1107blaming her, as though she did not even yet believe.
And again, because she had said, “Whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, He will give Thee;” to
lead her away from such a surmise, and to teach her that He needs not to receive from another,
but is Himself the fountain of all good things, He saith, “I am the resurrection and
the life;”1108that is to say, “I wait not to receive active power,1109but work all of myself.”</p>
<p>Wherefore at the centurion He both marvels, and prefers him to all the people, and
honors him with the gift of the kingdom, and provokes the rest to the same zeal. And to
show thee that for this end He so spake, viz. for the instructing of the rest to believe in like
manner, listen to the exactness of the evangelist, how he hath intimated it. For,</p>
<p>“Jesus,” saith he, “turned Him about, and said to them that followed Him, I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.”1110</p>
<p>It follows, that to have high imaginations concerning Him, this especially is of faith,
and tends to procure the kingdom and His other blessings. For neither did His praise reach
to words only, but He both restored the sick man whole, in recompence of his faith, and
weaves for him a glorious crown, and promises great gifts, saying on this wise,</p>
<p>“Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down in the bosoms of Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out.”1111</p>

<p>Thus, since He had shown many miracles, He proceeds to talk with them more unreservedly.</p>
<p>Then, that no one might suppose His words to come of flattery, but that all might be
aware that such was the mind of the centurion, He saith,</p>
<p>“Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.”1112</p>
<p>And straightway the work followed, bearing witness to his character.1113nothing; for
the question is, whether each of them has set before us the zealousness of the man, and his
having had the right opinion concerning Christ. But it is likely, that after sending his friends,
he himself also came and said these things. And if Luke did not speak of the one, no more
did Matthew of the other; and this is not the part of men disagreeing amongst themselves,
but rather of those that are filling up the things omitted by one another. But see by another
thing also how Luke hath proclaimed his faith, saying that his servant “was ready to die.”1114
Nevertheless, not even this cast him into despondency, neither did it cause him to give up:
but even so he trusted that he should prevail. And if Matthew affirm Christ to have said, “I
have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel,” and hereby to show clearly that he was not
an Israelite; while Luke saith, “He built our synagogue;” neither is this a contradiction. For
it was possible for one, even though not a Jew, both to build the synagogue, and to love the
nation.</p>
<p>4. But do not thou, I pray thee, merely inquire what was said by him, but add thereto
his rank also, and then thou wilt see the man’s excellency. Because in truth great is the pride
of them that are in places of command, and not even in afflictions do they take lower ground.
He, for example, who is set down in John, is for dragging Him unto his house, and saith,
“Come down, for my child is ready to die.”1115 But not so this man; rather he is far superior
both to him, and to those who let down the bed through the roof. For he seeks not for His
bodily presence, neither did He bring the sick man near the physician; a thing which implied
no mean imaginations concerning Him, but rather a suspicion of His divine dignity. And
he saith, “speak the word only.” And at the beginning he saith not even, “speak the word,”
but only describe his affliction: for neither did he, of great humility, expect that Christ would
straightway consent, and inquire for his house. Therefore, when he heard Him say, “I will
come and heal him,” then, not before he saith, “speak the word.” Nor yet did the suffering
confound him, but still under calamity he reasons coolly,1116not looking so much to the
health of the servant, as to the avoiding all appearance of doing anything irreverent.</p>

<pb n="319"/>
<p>And yet it was not he that pressed it, but Christ that offered it: nevertheless even so he
feared, lest perchance he should be thought to be going beyond his own deservings, and to
be drawing upon himself a thing above his strength.1117 Seest thou his wisdom? Mark the
folly of the Jews, in saying, “He was worthy for whom He should do the favor.”1118 For
when they should have taken refuge in the love of Jesus towards man, they rather allege this
man’s worthiness; and know not so much as on what ground to allege it. But not so he, but
he affirmed himself even in the utmost degree unworthy, not only of the benefit, but even
of receiving the Lord in his house. Wherefore even when he said, “My servant lieth sick,”
he did not add, “speak,” for fear lest he should be unworthy to obtain the gift; but he merely
made known his affliction. And when he saw Christ zealous in His turn, not even so did he
spring forward, but still continues to keep to the end his own proper measure.</p>
<p>And if any one should say, “wherefore did not Christ honor him in return?” we would
say this, that He did make return to him in honor, and that exceedingly: first by bringing
out his mind, which thing chiefly appeared by His not coming to his house; and in the
second place, by introducing him into His kingdom, and preferring him to the whole Jewish
nation. For because he made himself out unworthy even to receive Christ into his house,
he became worthy both of a kingdom, and of attaining unto those good things which Abraham
enjoyed.</p>
<p>“But wherefore,” one may say, “was not the leper commended, who showed forth things
greater than these?” For he did not so much as say, “speak the word,” but what was far more,
“be willing only,” which is what the prophet saith concerning the Father, “He hath done
whatsoever He pleased.”1119 But he also was commended. For when He said, “Offer the gift
that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them,”1120 He means nothing else but, “thou
shalt be an accuser of them, in that thou didst believe.” And besides, it was not the same for
one that was a Jew to believe, and for one from without that nation. For that the centurion
was not a Jew is evident, both from his being a centurion and from its being said, “I have
not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” And it was a very great thing for a man who was
out of the list of the Jewish people to admit so great a thought. For he did no less than imagine
to himself, as it seems to me, the armies in Heaven; or that the diseases and death, and
everything else, were so subject to Him, as his soldiers to himself.</p>
<p>Wherefore he said likewise, “For I also am a man set under authority;” that is, Thou art
God, and I man; I under authority, but Thou not under authority. If I therefore, being a
man, and under authority, can do so much; far more He, both as God, and as not under

<pb n="320"/>
authority. Thus with the strongest expression he desires to convince Him, that he saith this,
as one giving not a similar example, but one far exceeding. For if I (said he), being equal in
honor to them whom I command, and under authority, yet by reason of the trifling superiority
of my rank am able to do such great things; and no man contradicts me, but what I
command, that is done, though the injunctions be various (“for I say to this man, go, and
he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh”:1121) much more wilt Thou Thyself be able.</p>
<p>And some actually read the place in this way, “For if I, being a man,” and having inserted
a stop, they add, “having soldiers under authority under me.”</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how he signified that Christ is able both to overcome even
death as a slave, and to command it as its master. For in saying, “come, and he cometh,”
and “go, and he goeth;” he expresses this: “If Thou shouldest command his end not to come
upon him, it will not come.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how believing he was? For that which was afterwards to be manifest to all,
here is one who already hath made it evident; that He hath power both of death and of life,
and “leadeth down to the gates of hell, and bringeth up again.”1122 Nor was he speaking of
soldiers only, but also of slaves; which related to a more entire obedience.</p>
<p>5. But nevertheless, though having such great faith, he still accounted himself to be unworthy.
Christ however, signifying that he was worthy to have Him enter into his house,
did much greater things, marvelling at him, and proclaiming him, and giving more than he
had asked. For he came indeed seeking for his servant health of body, but went away, having
received a kingdom. Seest thou how the saying had been already fulfilled, “Seek ye the
kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.”1123 For, because he
evinced great faith, and lowliness of mind, He both gave him heaven, and added unto him
health.</p>
<p>And not by this alone did He honor him, but also by signifying upon whose casting out
he is brought in. For now from this time forth He proceeds to make known to all, that salvation
is by faith, not by works of the law. And this is why not to Jews only, but to Gentiles
also the gift so given shall be proffered, and to the latter rather than to the former. For “think
not,” saith He, “by any means, that so it hath come to pass in regard of this man alone; nay,
so it shall be in regard of the whole world. And this He said, prophesying of the Gentiles,
and suggesting to them good hopes. For in fact there were some following Him from Galilee
of the Gentiles. And this He said, on the one hand, not letting the Gentiles despair, on the
other, putting down the proud spirits of the Jews.</p>

<pb n="321"/>
<p>But that His saying might not affront1124the hearers, nor afford them any handle; He
neither brings forward prominently what He hath to say of the Gentiles, but upon occasion
taken from the centurion; nor doth He use nakedly the term, Gentiles: not saying, “many
of the Gentiles,” but, “many from east and west:”1125which was the language of one pointing
out the Gentiles, but did not so much affront the hearers, because His meaning was under
a shadow.</p>
<p>Neither in this way only doth He soften the apparent novelty of His doctrine, but also
by speaking of “Abraham’s bosom” instead of “the kingdom.” For neither was that term
familiar to them:1126moreover, the introduction of Abraham would be a sharper sting to
them. Wherefore John also spake nothing at first concerning hell, but, what was most apt
to grieve them, He saith, “Think not to say, we are children of Abraham.”1127</p>
<p>He is providing for another point also; not to seem in any sense opposed to the ancient
polity. For he that admires the patriarchs, and speaks of their bosom as an inheritance of
blessings, doth much more than sufficiently remove also this suspicion.</p>
<p>Let no man therefore suppose that the threat is one only, for both the punishment of
the one and the joy of the other is double: of the one, not only that they fell away, but that
they fell away from their own; of the other, not only that they attained, but that they attained
what they had no expectation of: and there is a third together with these, that the one received
what pertained to the other. And he calls them “children of the kingdom,” for whom the
kingdom had been prepared: which also more than all was apt to gall them; in that having
pointed to them as being in their bosom by His offer and promise, after all He puts them
out.</p>
<p>6. Then, because what He had said was mere affirmation, He confirms it by the miracle;
as indeed He shows the miracles in their turn, by the subsequent accomplishment of the
prediction. He accordingly, who disbelieves the health which the servant then received, let
him from the prophecy, which hath this day come to pass, believe that other also. For so
that prophecy again, even before the event, was made manifest to all by the sign which then
took place. To this end, you see, having first uttered that prediction, then and not before
He raised up the sick of the palsy; that He might make the future credible by the present,
and the less by the greater. Since for virtuous men to enjoy His good things, and for the
contrary sort to undergo His penalties, were nothing improbable, but a reasonable event,

and according to the tenor of laws: but to brace up the feeble, and to raise the dead, was
something beyond nature.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, unto this great and marvellous work the centurion too contributed
no little; which thing, we see, Christ also declared, saying, “Go thy way, and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee.” Seest thou how the health of the servant proclaimed
aloud both Christ’s power, and the faith of the centurion, and also became a pledge of the
future? Or rather it was all a proclamation of Christ’s power. For not only did He quite heal
the servant’s body, but the soul also of the centurion He did Himself bring over unto the
faith by His miracles.</p>
<p>And do thou look not to this only, that the one believed, and the other was healed, but
marvel how quickly also. For this too the evangelist declared, saying, “And his servant was
healed in the self-same hour:” even as of the leper also he said, “he was straightway cleansed.”
For not by healing, but by doing so both in a wonderful manner and in a moment of time,
did He display His power. Neither in this way only doth He profit us, but also by his constant
practice, in the manifestation of His miracles, of opening incidentally His discourses about
His kingdom, and of drawing all men towards it. For, those even whom He was threatening
to cast out, He threatened not in order to cast them out, but in order that through such fear,
He might draw them into it by His words. And if not even hereby were they profited, theirs
is the whole blame, as also of all who are in the like distemper.</p>
<p>For not at all among Jews only may one see this taking place, but also among them that
have believed. For Judas too was a child of the kingdom, and it was said to him with the
disciples, “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones;”1128yet he became a child of hell; whereas the
Ethiopian, barbarian as he was, and of them “from the east and west,” shall enjoy the crowns
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. This takes place among us also now. “For many,” saith
He, “that are first shall be last, and the last first.”1129 And this He saith, that neither the one
may grow languid, as unable to return; nor the others be confident, as standing fast. This
John also declared before from the beginning, when he said, “God is able of these stones to
raise up children unto Abraham.”1130 Thus, since it was so to come to pass, it is proclaimed
long before; that no one may be confounded at the strangeness of the event. But he indeed
speaks of it as a possible thing (for he was first); Christ on the other hand as what will surely
be, affording the proof of it from His works.</p>
<p>7. Let us not then be confident, who stand, but let us say to ourselves, “Let him that
thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall;”1131neither let us who are fallen despair, but let

<pb n="323"/>
us say to ourselves, “He that falleth, doth he not arise?”1132 For many even who have
mounted to the very summit of Heaven, and have shown forth all austerity, and had made
their abode in the deserts, nor saw any woman so much as in a dream; having become a
little remiss, have been tripped up, and have come unto the very gulf of wickedness. While
others again from thence have gone up to Heaven, and from the stage and orchestra have
passed over unto the discipline of angels, and have displayed so great virtue, as to drive away
devils, and to work many other such miracles. And of these examples both the Scriptures
are full, and our life is also full. Even whoremongers and effeminate persons stop the mouths
of the Manichæans, who say that wickedness is immoveable, enrolling themselves on the
devil’s side, and weakening the hands of them that would wish to be in earnest, and overturning
all our life.</p>
<p>For they who inculcate these things, not only injure men as to the future, but here also
turn all things upside down, for their own part at least. Because when will any regard virtue,
from among those that are living in wickedness, so long as he accounts his return that way,
and his change for the better, a thing impossible? For if now, when both laws exist, and
penalties are threatened, and there is common opinion to recall the ordinary sort, and hell
is looked for, and a kingdom promised, and wrong things reproached, and the good praised;
hardly do any choose the labors that are to be undergone for virtue’s sake: shouldest thou
take away all these things, what is there to hinder ruin and corruption universal?</p>
<p>Knowing therefore the devil’s craft, and that as well the lawgivers of the Gentiles as the
oracles of God, and the reasonings of nature, and the common opinion of all men, yea barbarians,
and Scythians, and Thracians, and generally all, are directly opposed both to these,
and to such as strive to enact the doctrines of fate: let us be sober, beloved, and bidding
farewell to all those, let us travel along the narrow way, being both confident and in fear: in
fear because of the precipices on either side, confident because of Jesus our guide. Let us
travel on, sober and wakeful. For though but for a little while one slumber, he is swept away
quickly.</p>
<p>8. For we are not more perfect than David, who by a little carelessness was hurled into
the very gulf of sin. Yet he arose again quickly. Look not then to his having sinned only, but
also to his having washed away his sin. For to this end He wrote that history, not that thou
shouldest behold him fallen, but admire him risen; to teach thee, when thou art fallen, how
thou shouldest arise. Thus, as physicians choose out the most grievous diseases, and write
them in their books, and teach their method of cure in similar cases; if so be men having
practised on the greater, may easily master the less; even so God likewise hath brought forward
the greatest of sins, that they also who offend in small things may find the cure of these
easy, by means of the other: since if those admitted of healing, much more the less.</p>
<note type="footnote">1132 Jer. viii. 4.</note>

<pb n="324"/>
<p>Let us look then to the manner both of the sickness, and of the speedy recovery of that
blessed man. What then was the manner of his sickness? He committed adultery and murder.
For I shrink not from proclaiming these things with a loud voice. Since if the Holy Ghost
thought it no shame to record1133all this history, much less ought we to draw any shade
over it. Wherefore I not only proclaim it, but I add another circumstance also. For in fact,
whosoever hide these things, they most of all men throw his virtue into the shade. And as
they that say nothing of the battle with Goliath deprive him of no small crowns, so also they
that hurry by this history. Doth not my saying seem a paradox? Nay, wait a little, and then
ye shall know that with reason have we said this. For to this end do I magnify the sin, and
make my statement stranger, that I may the more abundantly provide the medicines.</p>
<p>What is it then which I add? The man’s virtue; which makes the fault also greater. For
all things are not judged alike in all men. “For mighty” men (it is said) “shall be mightily
tormented:”1134and “He that knew his Lord’s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with
many stripes.”1135 So that more knowledge is a ground of more punishment. For this same
reason the priest, if he commit the same sin as those under government, shall not have the
same to endure, but things far more grievous.</p>
<p>Perhaps, seeing the charge against him amplified, ye tremble and fear, and marvel at
me, as though I were going down a precipice. But I am so confident on that righteous man’s
behalf, that I will proceed even farther; for the more I aggravate the charge, so much the
more shall I be able to show forth the praise of David.</p>
<p>“And what more than this,” you will say, “can be uttered?” Abundantly more. For as in
the case of Cain, what was done was not a murder only, but worse than even many murders;
for it was not a stranger, but a brother, whom he slew; and a brother who had not done but
suffered wrong; not after many murderers, but having first originated the horrid crime: so
here too that which was perpetrated was not murder only. For it was no ordinary man that
did it, but a prophet: and he slays not him that had done wrong, but him that had suffered
wrong; for indeed he had been mortally wronged, by the forcing away his wife: nevertheless
after that he added this also.</p>
<p>9. Perceive ye, how I have not spared that righteous one? how without any the least reserve
I have mentioned his offenses? But yet, so confident am I concerning his defense, that
after so great load as this of his sin, I would there were present both the Manichæans who
most deride all this, and they that are diseased in Marcion’s way,1136that I might fully stop

<pb n="325"/>
their mouths. For they indeed say “he committed murder and adultery;” but I say not this
only, but have also proved the murder to be twofold, first from him who suffered the wrong,
then from the quality of the person who offended. For it is not the same thing, for one to
whom the Spirit was vouchsafed, and on whom so great benefits had been conferred, and
who had been admitted to such freedom of speech, and at such a time of life, to venture on
crimes of that sort; as without all these, to commit this self-same thing. Nevertheless even
in this respect is that illustrious man most of all worthy of admiration, that when he had
fallen into the very pit of wickedness, he did not sink nor despair, nor cast himself down in
supineness, on receiving of the devil so fatal a wound; but quickly, or rather straightway,
and with great force, he gave a more fatal blow than he had received.</p>
<p>And the same thing occurred, as if in war and in battle some barbarian had struck his
spear into the heart of a chieftain, or shot an arrow into his liver, and had added to the
former wound a second more fatal than it, and he that had received these grievous blows,
when fallen, and wallowing in much blood all about him, were first to rise up quickly, then
to hurl a spear at him that wounded him, and exhibit him dead on the ground in a moment.
Even so in this case also, the greater thou declarest the wound, so much the more admirable
dost thou imply the soul of him that was wounded to be, that he had power after this
grievous wound both to rise up again, and to stand in the very forefront of the battle array,
and bear down him that had wounded him.</p>
<p>And how great a thing this is, they best know, whosoever are fallen into grievous sins.
For it is not so much a proof of a generous and vigorous soul to walk upright, and to run
all the way (for such a soul hath the good hope going along with it, to cheer and to rouse it,
to nerve and render it more zealous); as after those innumerable crowns, and so many
trophies, and victories, having undergone the utmost loss, to be able to resume the same
course. And that what I say may be made plain, I will endeavor to bring before you another
example, not at all inferior to the former.</p>
<p>For imagine, I pray thee, some pilot, when he had compassed seas without number, and
sailed over the whole ocean; after those many storms, and rocks and waves, to sink, having
with him a great freight, in the very mouth of the harbor, and hardly with his naked body
to escape this grievous shipwreck; how would he naturally feel towards the sea, and navigation,
and such labors? Will such a one then ever choose, unless he be of a very noble soul,
to see a beach, or a vessel, or a harbor? I trow not; but he will lie hiding his face, seeing night
all through the day, and shrinking from all things; and he will choose rather to live by begging,
than to put his hand to the same labors.</p>
<p>But not such was this blessed man; but though he had undergone such a shipwreck,
after those innumerable troubles and toils, he stayed not with his face covered, but launched
his vessel, and having spread his sails, and taken the rudder in hand, he applies himself to
the same labors, and hath made his wealth more abundant again. Now if to stand be so ad-

<pb n="326"/>
mirable, and not to lie down for ever after one has fallen; to rise up again, and to do such
deeds, what crowns would not this deserve?</p>
<p>And yet surely there were many things to drive him to despair; as first, the greatness of
his sins; secondly, that not at the beginning of life, when our hopes also are more abundant,
but near the end, these things befell him. For neither doth the merchant, who hath just gone
out of the harbor and been wrecked, grieve equally with him, who after very many traffickings
strikes on a rock. Thirdly, that when he had already obtained great wealth, he incurred this.
Yea, for by that time he had stored up no small merchandise: for instance, the deeds of his
early youth, when he was a shepherd; those about Goliath, when he set up the glorious
trophy; those pertaining to his self-command respecting Saul. Since he showed forth even
the evangelical long-suffering, in that he got his enemy ten thousand times into his hands,
and continually spared him; and chose rather to be an outcast from his country and from
liberty, and from life itself, than to slay him that was unjustly plotting against him. Likewise
after his coming to the kingdom, there were noble deeds of his to no small amount.</p>
<p>And besides what I have said, his credit also among the many, and his fall from glory
so bright, would cause no ordinary perplexity. For the purple did by no means so much
adorn him, as the stain of his sin disgraced him. And ye know of course what a great thing
it is for evil deeds to be exposed, and how great a soul is required in such an one, not to
despond after the censure of the multitude, and when he hath so many witnesses of his own
offenses.</p>
<p>Nevertheless all these darts that noble person drew out of his soul, and so shone forth
after this, so wiped out the stain, became so pure, that his offspring even after his death had
their sins mitigated by him: and that which was said of Abraham, we find God saying the
same of this man also; or rather, much more of the latter. For with respect to the patriarch
it is said, “I remembered my covenant with Abraham;”1137but here He saith not “the covenant,”
but how? “I will defend this city for my servant David’s sake.”1138 And besides, on
account of His favor towards him, He suffered not Solomon to fall from the kingdom, great
as the sin was which he had committed. And so great was the glory of the man, that Peter,
so many years after, in exhorting the Jews, spake on this wise: “Let me freely speak unto you
of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried.”1139 And Christ too, discoursing
with the Jews, signifies him after his sin to have had the Spirit vouchsafed to such a degree,
that he was counted worthy to prophesy again even concerning His Godhead; and thereby
stopping their mouths, He said, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand ?”1140 And much as with Moses, so it
<note type="footnote">1137 Exod. ii. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">1138 Isa. xxxvii. 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">1139 Acts ii. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1140 Matt. xxii. 43; Ps. cx. 1.</note>

<pb n="327"/>
fell out also with David. For as Miriam, even against Moses’ will, was punished by God for
insolence to her brother,1141because He greatly loved the holy man; even so this man, injur-
iously treated by his son, God did swiftly avenge, and that against his will.</p>
<p>These things then are sufficient, yea rather before all others these are sufficient to indicate
the man’s excellency. For when God pronounces His judgment, we ought to inquire no
further. But if ye would become particularly acquainted with His self command, ye may by
perusing his history after his sin, perceive his confidence towards God, his benevolence, his
growth in virtue, his strictness unto his last breath.</p>
<p>10. Having then these examples, let us be sober, and let us strive not to despond, and if
at any time we fall, not to lie prostrate. For not to cast you into slothfulness, did I speak of
the sins of David, but to work in you more fear. For if that righteous man through a little
remissness received such wounds, what shall we have to suffer, who are every day negligent?
Do not therefore look at his fall, and be remiss, but consider what great things he did even
after this, what great mournings, how much repentance he showed forth, adding his nights
to his days, pouring forth fountains of tears, washing his couch with his tears, withal clothing
himself in sackcloth.</p>
<p>Now if he needed so great a conversion, when will it be possible for us to be saved,
feeling insensible after so many sins? For he that hath many good deeds, would easily even
by this throw a shade over his sins; but he that is unarmed, wherever he may receive a dart,
receives a mortal wound.</p>
<p>In order therefore that this may not be so, let us arm ourselves with good works; and if
any offense have befallen us, let us wash it away: that we may be counted worthy, after
having lived the present life to the glory of God, to enjoy the life to come; unto which may
we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXVII.</head>
<p>Matt. VIII. 14.</p>
<p>“And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother laid and sick of a
fever:1142and He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and ministered
unto Him.”1143</p>
<p>But Mark adds also, “immediately,”1144meaning to declare the time as well; but this
evangelist hath set down only the miracle, without signifying besides the time. And whereas
the others say, that she that lay ill did also entreat Him, this too he hath passed over in silence.
But this comes not of any dissonance, but the one of brevity, the other of exact narrative.
But for what intent did He go into Peter’s house? As it seems to me, to take food. This at
least is declared when it is said,</p>
<p>“She arose and ministered unto Him.”1145</p>
<p>For He used to visit His disciples (as Matthew likewise, when He had called him), so
honoring them and making them more zealous.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, herein also Peter’s reverence towards Him. For though
he had his wife’s mother at home lying ill, and very sick of a fever, he drew Him not into
his house, but waited first for the teaching to be finished, then for all the others to be healed;
and then when He had come in, besought Him. Thus from the beginning was he instructed
to prefer the things of all others to his own.</p>
<p>Therefore neither doth he himself bring Him in, but He entered of His own accord
(after the centurion had said, “I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my
roof”1146): to show how much favor He bestowed on His disciple. And yet consider of what
sort were the houses of these fishermen; but for all that, He disdained not to enter into their
mean huts, teaching thee by all means to trample under foot human pride.</p>
<p>And sometimes He heals by words only, sometimes He even stretches forth His hand,
sometimes He doeth both these things, to bring into sight His way of healing. For it was not
His will always to work miracles in the more surpassing manner: it being needful for Him
to be concealed awhile, and especially as concerned His disciples; since they out of their
<note type="footnote">1142 [R.V., “lying sick of a fever.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">1143 A.V., “unto them.” [The Oxford edition has “rec. vers.” here. But the word “received” is now applied, in
matters of text, only to the editions of Stephens and Elzevir and the readings they contain. The reference is, of
course, to the authorized version, and that version in Matt. viii. 15 follows the received text.—R.]</note>

<pb n="329"/>
great delight would have proclaimed everything. And this was evident from the fact, that
even after coming to the mount, it was needful to charge them that they should tell no man.</p>
<p>Having therefore touched her body, He not only quenched the fever, but also gave her
back perfect health. Thus, the disease being an ordinary one, He displayed His power by
the manner of healing; a thing which no physician’s art could have wrought. For ye know
that even after the departing of fevers, the patients yet need much time to return to their
former health. But then all took place at once.</p>
<p>And not in this case only, but also in that of the sea. For neither there did He quiet the
winds only and the storm, but He also stayed at once the swelling of the waves; and this also
was a strange thing. For even if the tempest should cease, the waves continue to swell for a
long time.</p>
<p>But with Christ it was not so, but all at once was ended: and so it befell this woman also.
Wherefore also the evangelist, to declare this, said, “She arose and ministered unto
Him;”1147which was a sign both of Christ’s power, and of the disposition of the woman,
which she showed towards Christ.</p>
<p>And another thing together with these we may hence observe, that Christ grants the
healing of some to the faith even of others. Since in this case too, others besought Him, as
also in the instance of the centurion’s servant. And this grant He makes, when there is no
unbelief in him that is to be healed, but either through disease he cannot come unto Him,
or through ignorance imagines nothing great of Him, or because of His immature age.</p>
<p>2. “When the even was come, they brought unto Him many that were possessed with
devils: and He cast out the spirits from them with a word, and healed all that were sick: that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet Esaias, that He took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses.”1148</p>
<p>Seest thou the multitude, by this time growing in faith? For not even when the time
pressed could they endure to depart, nor did they account it unseasonable to bring their
sick to Him at eventide.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how great a multitude of persons healed the evangelists pass
quickly over, not mentioning one by one, and giving us an account of them, but in one word
traversing an unspeakable sea of miracles. Then lest the greatness of the wonder should
drive us again to unbelief, that even so great a people and their various diseases should be
delivered and healed by Him in one moment of time, He brings in the prophet also to bear
witness to what is going on: indicating the abundance of the proof we have, in every case,
out of the Scriptures; such, that from the miracles themselves we have no more; and He
saith, that Esaias also spake of these things; “He took our infirmities, and bare our sick-
<note type="footnote">1147 Matt. viii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1148 Matt. viii. 16, 17. [R.V. “our diseases.”]</note>

<pb n="330"/>
nesses.”1149 He said not, “He did them away,” but “He took and bare them;” which seems
to me to be spoken rather of sins, by the prophet, in harmony with John, where he saith,
“Behold the Lamb of God, that beareth the sin of the world.”1150</p>
<p>How then doth the evangelist here apply it to diseases? Either as rehearsing the passage
in the historical sense,1151or to show that most of our diseases arise from sins of the soul.
For if the sum of all, death itself, hath its root and foundation from sin, much more the
majority of our diseases also: since our very capability of suffering did itself originate there.</p>
<p>3. “Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave commandment to depart
unto the other side.”1152</p>
<p>Seest thou again His freedom from ostentation? in that as the others say, “He charged
the devils not to say it was He,”1153so this writer saith, He repels the multitudes from Him.
Now in so doing, He was at once both training us to be moderate,1154and at the same time
allaying the envy of the Jews, and teaching us to do nothing for display. For He was not, we
know, a healer to bodies only, but a curer also of the soul, and a teacher of self-restraint;
by both disclosing Himself, both by putting away their diseases, and by doing nought for
display. Because they indeed were cleaving unto Him, loving Him, and marvelling at Him,
and desiring to look upon Him. For who would depart from one who was doing such miracles?
Who would not long, were it only to see the face, and the mouth that was uttering
such words?</p>
<p>For not by any means in working wonders only was He wonderful, but even when
merely showing Himself, He was full of great grace; and to declare this the prophet said,
“Fair1155in beauty beyond the children of men.”1156 And if Esaias saith, “He hath no form
nor comeliness,”1157he affirms it either in comparison of the glory of His Godhead, which
surpasses all utterance and description; or as declaring what took place at His passion, and

the dishonor which He underwent at the season of the cross, and the mean estate which
throughout His life He exemplified in all respects.</p>
<p>Further: He did not first give “commandment to depart unto the other side,” nor until
He had healed them. For surely they could not have borne it. As therefore on the mountain
they not only continued with Him while exhorting them, but also when it was silence followed
Him; so here too, not in His miracles only did they wait on Him, but also when He had
ceased again, from His very countenance receiving no small benefit. For if Moses had his
face made glorious, and Stephen like that of an angel; consider thou our common Lord,
what manner of person it was likely He would appear at such a time.
Many now perchance have fallen into a passionate desire of seeing that form; but if we
are willing we shall behold one far better than that. For if we can pass through our present
life with Christian boldness,1158we shall receive Him in the clouds, meeting Him in an immortal
and incorruptible body.</p>
<p>But observe how He doth not simply drive them away, lest He should hurt them. For
He did not say, “withdraw,” but “gave commandment to depart to the other side,” giving
them to expect that He would surely come thither.</p>
<p>4. And the multitudes for their part evinced this great love, and were following with
much affection; but some one person, a slave of wealth, and possessed with much arrogance,
approaches Him, and saith,</p>
<p>“Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest.”1159
Seest thou how great his arrogance? For as not deigning to be numbered with the multitude,
and indicating that he is above the common sort, so he comes near. Because such is
the Jewish character; full of unseasonable confidence. So too another afterwards, when all
men were keeping silence, of his own accord springs up, and saith, “Which is the first
commandment?”1160</p>
<p>Yet nevertheless the Lord rebuked not his unseasonable confidence, teaching us to bear
even with such as these. Therefore He doth not openly convict them who are devising mischief,
but replies to their secret thought, leaving it to themselves only to know that they are
convicted, and doubly doing them good, first by showing that He knows what is in their
conscience, next by granting unto them concealment after this manifestation, and allowing
them to recover themselves again, if they will: which thing He doth in the case of this man
also.</p>

<pb n="332"/>
<p>For he, seeing the many signs, and many drawn after Him, thought to make a gain out
of such miracles; wherefore also he was forward to follow Him. And whence is this manifest?
From the answer which Christ makes, meeting not the question, as it stands verbally, but
the temper shown in its meaning. For, “What?” saith He, “dost thou look to gather wealth
by following me? Seest thou not then that I have not even a lodging, not even so much as
the birds have?”</p>
<p>For “the foxes,” saith He, “have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of Man hath not where to lay His head.”1161</p>
<p>Now these were not the words of one turning Himself away, but of one who while putting
to the proof his evil disposition, yet permitted him (if he were willing with such a prospect)
to follow Him. And to convince thee of his wickedness, when he had heard these things,
and had been proved, he did not say, “I am ready to follow Thee.”</p>
<p>5. And in many other places also Christ is clearly doing this; He doth not openly convict,
but by His answer He manifests the purpose of them that are coming unto Him. Thus to
him again that said, “Good Master,” and had thought by such flattery to gain His favor, according
to his purpose He made answer, saying, “Why callest thou me good? There is none
good but one, that is, God.”1162</p>
<p>And when they said unto Him, “Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren seek
Thee;”1163forasmuch as these were under the influence of some human infirmity, not desiring
to hear something profitable, but to make a display of their relationship to Him, and therein
to be vainglorious; hear what He saith: “Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?”</p>
<p>And again to His brethren themselves, saying unto Him, “Show thyself to the
world,”1164and wishing thence to feed their vainglory, He said, “Your time” (so He speaks)
“is always ready, but my time is not yet come.”</p>
<p>And in the opposite cases too He doth so; as in that of Nathanael, saying, “Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.”1165 And again, “Go and show John again those things
which ye do hear and see.”1166 For neither in this did He reply to the words, but to the intention
of him that sent them. And with the people again in like manner, He addresses His

discourse unto their conscience, saying, “What went ye out into the wilderness to see?”1167
That is because they were probably feeling about John, as though he had been a sort of easy
and wavering person; to correct this their suspicion, He saith, “What went ye out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?” or, “a man clothed with soft raiment?” by
both these figures declaring, that he was neither of himself a waverer, nor would be softened
by any luxury. Thus then in the present case also He makes His answer to their meaning.</p>
<p>And see how in this also He shows forth great moderation: in that He said not, “I have
it indeed, but despise it,” but “I have it not.” Seest thou what exact care goes along with His
condescension? Even as when He eats and drinks, when He seems to be acting in an opposite
way to John, this too He doeth for the sake of the Jews’ salvation, or rather for that of the
whole world, at once both stopping the mouths of the heretics,1168and desiring to win also
more abundantly those of that day to Himself.</p>
<p>6. But a certain other one, we read, said unto Him,</p>
<p>“Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.”1169</p>
<p>Didst thou mark the difference? how one impudently saith, “I will follow Thee whithersoever
Thou goest;” but this other, although asking a thing of sacred duty,1170saith, “Suffer
me.” Yet He suffered him not, but saith, “Let the dead bury their dead, but do thou follow
me.” For in every case He had regard to the intention. And wherefore did He not suffer
him? one may ask. Because, on the one hand, there were those that would fulfill that duty,
and the dead was not going to remain unburied; on the other, it was not fit for this man to
be taken away from the weightier matters. But by saying, “their own dead,” He implies that
this is not one of His dead. And that because he that was dead, was, at least as I suppose, of
the unbelievers.</p>
<p>Now if thou admire the young man, that for a matter so necessary he besought Jesus,
and did not go away of his own accord; much rather do thou admire him for staying also
when forbidden.</p>
<p>Was it not then, one may say, extreme ingratitude, not to be present at the burial of his
father? If indeed he did so out of negligence, it was ingratitude, but if in order not to interrupt
a more needful work, his departing would most surely have been of extreme inconsideration.
For Jesus forbad him, not as commanding to think lightly of the honor due to our parents,
but signifying that nothing ought to be to us more urgent than the things of Heaven, and
that we ought with all diligence to cleave to these, and not to put them off for ever so little,

though our engagements be exceeding indispensable and pressing. For what can be more
needful than to bury a father? what more easy? since it would not even consume any long
time.</p>
<p>But if one ought not to spend even as much time as is required for a father’s burial, nor
is it safe to be parted even so long from our spiritual concerns; consider what we deserve,
who all our time stand off from the things that pertain to Christ, and prefer things very ordinary
to such as are needful, and are remiss, when there is nothing to press on us?</p>
<p>And herein too we should admire the instructiveness1171of His teaching, that He nailed
him fast to His word, and with this freed him from those endless evils, such as lamentations,
and mournings, and the things that follow thereafter. For after the burial he must of necessity
proceed to inquire about the will, then about the distribution of the inheritance, and all the
other things that follow thereupon; and thus waves after waves coming in succession upon
him, would bear him away very far from the harbor of truth. For this cause He draws him,
and fastens him to Himself.</p>
<p>But if thou still marvellest, and art perplexed, that he was not permitted to be present
at his father’s burial; consider that many suffer not the sick, if it be a father that is dead, or
a mother, or a child, or any other of their kinsmen, to know it, nor to follow him to the
tomb; and we do not for this charge them with cruelty nor inhumanity: and very reasonably.
For, on the contrary, it were cruelty to bring out to the funeral solemnity men in such a
state.</p>
<p>But if to mourn and be afflicted in mind for them that are of our kindred is evil, much
more our being withdrawn from spiritual discourses. For this same cause He said elsewhere
also, “No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom
of Heaven.”1172 And surely it is far better to proclaim the kingdom, and draw back others
from death, than to bury the dead body, that is nothing advantaged thereby; and especially,
when there are some to fulfill all these duties.</p>
<p>7. Nothing else then do we learn hereby, but that we must not wantonly lose any, no
not the smallest time, though there be ten thousand things to press on us; but to set what is
spiritual before all, even the most indispensable matters, and to know both what is life, and
what is death. Since many even of them that seem to live are nothing better than dead men,
living as they do in wickedness; or rather these are worse than the dead; “For he that is dead,”
it is said, “is freed from sin,”1173but this man is a slave to sin. For tell me not of this, that he

is not eaten of worms, nor lies in a coffin, nor hath closed his eyes, nor is bound in graveclothes.
Nay, for these things he undergoes more grievously than the dead, no worms devouring
him, but the passions of his soul tearing him to pieces more fiercely than wild beasts.</p>
<p>And if his eyes be open, this too again is far worse than having closed them. For those
of the dead see no evil thing, but this man is gathering unto himself diseases without number,
while his eyes are open. And whereas the other lies in a coffin, unmoved by anything, this
one is buried in the tomb of his innumerable distempers.</p>
<p>But thou seest not his body in a state of decay. And what of that? Since before his body,
his soul is corrupted and destroyed, and undergoes greater rottenness. For the other stinketh
a few1174days, but this for the whole of his life exhales evil odors, having a mouth more foul
than sewers.</p>
<p>And so the one differs from the other, by just so much as this, that the dead indeed undergoes
that decay only which comes of nature, but this man together with that, brings in
also that rottenness which is from intemperance, devising each day unnumbered causes of
corruption.</p>
<p>But is he borne on horseback? And what of that? Why, so is the other on a couch. And
what is very hard, while the other is seen by no one in his dissolution and decay, but hath
his coffin for a veil, this man is going about everywhere with his evil savor, bearing about a
dead soul in his body as in a tomb.</p>
<p>And if one could but once see a man’s soul who is living in luxury and vice, thou
wouldest perceive that it is far better to lie bound in a grave than to be rivetted by the chains
of our sins; and to have a stone laid over thee, than that heavy cover1175of insensibility.
Wherefore above all things it behooves the friends of these dead men, seeing that they are
past feeling, to come near to Jesus in their behalf, as Mary then did in the case of Lazarus.
Though he “stinketh,” though he be “dead four days,” do not despair, but approach, and
remove the stone first. Yea, for then thou shalt see him lying as in a tomb, and bound in his
grave clothes.</p>
<p>And if ye will, let it be some one of them that are great and distinguished, whom we
bring before you. Nay, fear not, for I will state the example without a name: or rather, though
I should mention the name, not even so need there be any fear: for who ever fears a dead
man? seeing that whatever one may do, he continues dead, and the dead cannot injure the
living either little or much.</p>
<p>Let us then behold their head bound up. For indeed, when they are for ever drunken,
even as the dead by their many wrappers and grave-clothes, so are all their organs of sense
closed and bound up. And if thou wilt look at their hands too, thou shalt see these again

bound to their belly, like those of the dead, and fastened about not with grave-clothes, but
what is far more grievous, with the bands of covetousness: obtaining as they do no leave
from her to be stretched out for alms-giving, or for any other of such like good deeds; rather
she renders them more useless than those of the dead. Wouldest thou also see their feet
bound together? See them again fastened about with cares, and for this cause never able to
run unto the house of God.</p>
<p>Hast thou seen the dead? behold also the embalmer. Who then is the embalmer of these?
The devil, who carefully fastens them about, and suffers not the man any longer to appear
a man, but a dry stock. For where there is no eye, nor hands, nor feet, nor any other such
thing, how can such an one appear a man? Even so may we see their soul also swaddled up,
and rather an image1176than a soul.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as they are in a sort of senseless state, being turned to dead men, let us
in their behalf draw nigh unto Jesus, let us entreat Him to raise them up, let us take away
the stone, let us loosen the grave clothes. For if thou take away the stone, that is, their insensibility
to their own miseries, thou wilt quickly be able to bring them also out of the tomb;
and having brought them out, thou wilt more easily rid them of their bonds. Then shall
Christ know thee, when thou art risen, when unbound; then will He call thee even unto His
own supper.1177 As many therefore of you as are friends of Christ, as many as are disciples,
as many as love him that is gone, draw near unto Jesus, and pray. For even though his ill
savor abound and be ever so intense, nevertheless not even so should we, his friends, forsake
him, but so much the rather draw near; even as the sisters of Lazarus then did; neither should
we leave interceding, beseeching, entreating, until we have received him alive.</p>
<p>For if we thus order our own affairs, and those of our neighbors, we shall also attain
speedily unto the life to come; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love to man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. VIII. 23, 24.</p>
<p>“And when He was entered into a ship, His disciples followed Him. And, behold, there arose
a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves, but He
was asleep.”</p>
<p>Now Luke,1178to free himself from having the order of time required of him, saith thus,
“And it came to pass on a certain day that He went into a ship with His disciples;” and Mark
in like manner.1179 But this evangelist not so, but he maintains the order in this place also.
For they did not all of them write all things in this way. And these things I have mentioned
before, lest any one from the omission should suppose there was a discordance.</p>
<p>The multitudes then He sent on, but the disciples He took with Himself: for the others
mention this too. And He took them with Him, not for nought, nor at hazard, but in order
to make them spectators of the miracle that was to take place. For like a most excellent
trainer, He was anointing them with a view to both objects; as well to be undismayed in
dangers, as to be modest in honors. Thus, that they might not be high minded, because
having sent away the rest, He retained them, He suffers them to be tossed with the tempest;
at once correcting this, and disciplining them to bear trials nobly.</p>
<p>For great indeed were the former miracles too, but this contained also in it a kind of
discipline, and that no inconsiderable one, and was a sign akin to that of old.1180 For this
cause He takes the disciples only with Himself. For as, when there was a display of miracles,
He suffers the people also to be present; so when trial and terrors were rising up against
Him, then He takes with Him none but the champions of the whole world, whom He was
to discipline.</p>
<p>And while Matthew merely mentioned that “He was asleep,”1181 Luke saith that it was
“on a pillow;” signifying both His freedom from pride, and to teach us hereby a high degree
of austerity.1182</p>

<pb n="338"/>
<p>The tempest therefore being thoroughly excited, and the sea raging, “They awake Him,
saying, Lord, save us: we perish.”1183 But He rebuked them before He rebuked the sea. Because
as I said, for discipline these things were permitted, and they were a type of the
temptations that were to overtake them. Yea, for after these things again, He often suffered
them to fall into more grievous tempests of fortune,1184and bare long with them. Wherefore
Paul also said, “I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that we were pressed out of
measure beyond strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life;”1185and after this again,
“Who delivered us from so great deaths.” Signifying therefore hereby, that they ought to be
confident, though the waves rise high, and that He orders all things for good, He first of all
reproves them. For indeed their very alarm was a profitable occurrence, that the miracle
might appear greater, and their remembrance of the event be rendered lasting. Since when
anything strange is about to happen, there are prepared beforehand many things to cause
remembrance, lest after the miracle hath passed by, men should sink into forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Thus Moses also first is in fear of the serpent, and not merely in fear, but even with
much distress: and then he sees that strange thing come to pass.1186 So these too, having
first looked to perish, were then saved, that having confessed the danger, they might learn
the greatness of the miracle.</p>
<p>Therefore also He sleeps: for had He been awake when it happened, either they would
not have feared, or they would not have besought Him, or they would not so much as have
thought of His being able to do any such thing. Therefore He sleeps, to give occasion for
their timidity, and to make their perception of what was happening more distinct. For a
man looks not with the same eyes on what happens in the persons of others, as in his own.
Therefore since they had seen all benefitted, while themselves had enjoyed no benefit, and
were supine (for neither were they lame, nor had they any other such infirmity); and it was
meet they should enjoy His benefits by their own perception: He permits the storm, that by
their deliverance they might attain to a clearer perception of the benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore neither doth He this in the presence of the multitudes, that they might not
be condemned for little faith, but He has them apart, and corrects them, and before the
tempest of the waters He puts an end to the tempests of their soul, rebuking them, and
saying,</p>
<p>“Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith:” instructing them also, that men’s fear is wrought
not by the approach of the temptations, but by the weakness of their mind.</p>

<note type="footnote">1186 Exod. iv. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="339"/>
<p>But should any one say, that it was not fearfulness, or little faith, to come near and
awaken Him; I would say this, that that very thing was an especial sign of their wanting the
right opinion concerning Him. That is, His power to rebuke when awakened they knew,
but that He could do so even sleeping, they knew not as yet.</p>
<p>And why at all marvel that it was so now, when even after many other miracles their
impressions were still rather imperfect? wherefore also they are often rebuked; as when He
saith, “Are ye also yet without understanding?”1187 Marvel not then, if when the disciples
were in such imperfect dispositions, the multitudes had no exalted imagination of Him. For</p>
<p>“They marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the sea and the winds
obey Him?”1188</p>
<p>But Christ chode not with them for calling Him a man, but waited to teach them by His
signs, that their supposition was mistaken. But from what did they think Him a man? First
from His appearance, then from His sleeping, and His making use of a ship. So on this account
they were cast into perplexity, saying, “What manner of man is this?” since while the
sleep and the outward appearance showed man, the sea and the calm declared Him God.</p>
<p>For because Moses had once done some such thing, in this regard also doth He signify
His own superiority, and that the one works miracles as a slave, the other as Lord. Thus, He
put forth no rod, as Moses did, neither did He stretch forth His hands to Heaven, nor did
He need any prayer, but, as was meet for a master commanding His handmaid, or a creator
His creature, so did He quiet and curb it by word and command only; and all the surge was
straightway at an end, and not one trace of the disturbance remained. For this the evangelist
declared saying, “And there was a great calm.”1189 And that which had been spoken of the
Father as a great thing, this He showed forth again by His works. And what had been said
concerning Him? “He spake,” it saith, “and the stormy wind ceased.”1190 So here likewise,
He spake, and “there was a great calm.” And for this most of all did the multitudes marvel
at him; who would not have marvelled, had He done it in such manner as did Moses.</p>
<p>2. Now when He is departed from the sea, there follows another miracle yet more awful.
For men possessed with devils,1191like wicked runaways at sight of their master, said,</p>
<p>“What have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God? Art Thou come hither to
torment us before the time?”1192</p>

<pb n="340"/>
<p>For, because the multitudes called Him man, the devils came proclaiming His Godhead,
and they that heard not the sea swelling and subsiding, heard from the devils the same cry,
as it by its calm was loudly uttering.</p>
<p>Then, lest the thing might seem to come of flattery, according to their actual experience
they cry out and say, “Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?” With this view,
then, their enmity is avowed beforehand, that their entreaty may not incur suspicion. For
indeed they were invisibly receiving stripes, and the sea was not in such a storm as they;
galled, and inflamed, and suffering things intolerable from His mere presence. Accordingly,
no man daring to bring them to Him, Christ of Himself goes unto them.
And Matthew indeed relates that they said, “Art Thou come hither before the time to
torment us?” but the other evangelists have added, that they also entreated and adjured Him
not to cast them into the deep.1193 For they supposed that their punishment was now close
upon them, and feared, as even now about to fall into vengeance.</p>
<p>And though Luke and those who follow him1194say that it was one person, but this
evangelist two, this doth not exhibit any discrepancy at all. I grant if they had said, there
was only one, and no other, they would appear to disagree with Matthew; but if that spake
of the one, this of the two, the statement comes not of disagreement, but of a different
manner of narration. That is, I for my part think, Luke singled out the fiercest one of them
for his narrative, wherefore also in more tragical wise doth he report their miserable case;
as, for instance, that bursting his bonds and chains he used to wander about the wilderness.
And Mark saith, that he also cut himself with the stones.</p>
<p>And their words too are such as well betray their implacable and shameless nature. For,
saith he, “Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?” You see, that they had sinned,
they could not deny, but they demand not to suffer their punishment before the time. For,
since He had caught them in the act of perpetrating those horrors so incurable and lawless,
and deforming and punishing1195 His creature in every way; and they supposed that He,
for the excess of their crimes, would not await the time of their punishment: therefore they
besought and entreated Him: and they that endured not even bands of iron come bound,
and they that run about the mountains, are gone forth into the plain; and those who hinder
all others from passing, at sight of Him blocking up the way, stand still.</p>
<p>3. But what can be the reason that they love also to dwell in the tombs? They would fain
suggest to the multitude a pernicious opinion, as though the souls of the dead become
demons,1196which God forbid we should ever admit into our conception. “But what then

wilt thou say,” one may ask, “when many of the sorcerers take children and slay them, in
order to have the soul afterwards to assist them?” Why, whence is this evident? for of their
slaying them, indeed, many tell us, but as to the souls of the slain being with them, whence
knowest thou it, I pray thee? “The possessed themselves,” it is replied, “cry out, I am the
soul of such a one.” But this too is a kind of stage-play, and devilish deceit. For it is not the
spirit of the dead that cries out, but the evil spirit that feigns these things in order to deceive
the hearers. For if it were possible for a soul to enter into the substance of an evil spirit,
much more into its own body.</p>
<p>And besides, it stands not to reason that the injured soul should co-operate with the
wrong-doer, or that a man should be able to change an incorporeal power into another
substance. For if in bodies this were impossible, and one could not make a man’s body become
that of an ass; much more were this impossible in the invisible soul; neither could one
transform it into the substance of an evil spirit. So that these are the sayings of besotted old
wives, and spectres to frighten children.</p>
<p>Nor indeed is it possible for a soul, torn away from the body, to wander here any more.
For “the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God;”1197and if of the righteous, then those
children’s souls also; for neither are they wicked: and the souls too of sinners are straightway
led away hence. And it is evident from Lazarus and the rich man; and elsewhere too Christ
saith, “This day they require thy soul of thee.”1198 And it may not be that a soul, when it is
gone forth from the body, should wander here; nor is the reason hard to see. For if we, going
about on the earth which is familiar and well known to us, being encompassed with a body,
when we are journeying in a strange road, know not which way to go unless we have some
one to lead us; how should the soul, being rent away from the body, and having gone out
from all her accustomed region, know where to walk without one to show her the way?</p>
<p>And from many other things too one might perceive, that it is not possible for a disembodied
soul to remain here. For both Stephen saith, “Receive my spirit;”1199and Paul, “To
<note type="footnote">vi. 235, 6 (Savile). “Many of the simpler sort imagine that the souls of such as die violent deaths are turned into
demons, whereas the souls which really become such are theirs who are yet living in their sins, not by change
of substance, but by imitating their evil mind.…Why did the devil introduce this wicked doctrine? He tried to
undermine the glory of the martyrs. I mean, because they die violent deaths, he wishing to diffuse an evil impression
of them, did this. This, however, he could not do, but another very grievous result he did accomplish. He
induced, by these doctrines, the sorcerers that minister to him to butcher the bodies of many tender youths, in
the hope that they would become demons, and in return minister to them.” He proceeds to argue against the
superstition much as in the text here.</note>

depart and to be with Christ is far better;”1200and of the patriarch too the Scripture saith,
that “he was gathered unto his fathers, being cherished in a good old age.”1201 And as to
the proof, that neither can the souls of sinners continue here; hear the rich man making
much entreaty for this, and not obtaining it; since had it been at all possible, he would have
come, and have told what had come to pass there.1202 Whence it is evident that after their
departure hence our souls are led away into some place, having no more power of themselves
to come back again, but awaiting that dreadful day.</p>
<p>4. Now, should any one say, “And wherefore did Christ fulfill the devils’ request, suffering
them to depart into the herd of swine?” this would be our reply, that He did so, not as
yielding to them, but as providing for many objects thereby. One, to teach them that are
delivered from those wicked tyrants, how great the malice of their insidious enemies: another,
that all might learn, how not even against swine are they bold, except He allow them; a third,
that they would have treated those men more grievously than the swine, unless even in their
calamity they had enjoyed much of God’s providential care. For that they hate us more than
the brutes is surely evident to every man. So then they that spared not the swine, but in one
moment of time cast them all down the precipice, much more would they have done so to
the men whom they possessed, leading them towards the desert, and carrying them away,
unless even in their very tyranny the guardian care of God had abounded, to curb and check
the excess of their violence. Whence it is manifest that there is no one, who doth not enjoy
the benefit of God’s providence. And if not all alike, nor after one manner, this is itself a
very great instance of providence; in that according to each man’s profit, the work also of
providence is displayed.</p>
<p>And besides what hath been mentioned, there is another thing also, which we learn
from this; that His providence is not only over all in common, but also over each in particular;
which He also declared with respect to His disciples, saying, “But the very hairs of your
head are numbered.”1203 And from these demoniacs too, one may clearly perceive this; who
would have “been choked” long before, if they had not enjoyed the benefit of much tender
care from above.</p>
<p>For these reasons then He suffered them to depart into the herd of swine, and that they
also who dwelt in those places should learn His power. For where His name was great, He
did not greatly display Himself: but where no one knew Him, but they were still in an insensible
condition, He made His miracles to shine out, so as to bring them over to the knowledge
of His Godhead. For it is evident from the event that the inhabitants of that city were a sort

of senseless people; for when they ought to have adored and marvelled at His power, they
sent Him away, and “besought Him that He would depart out of their coasts.”1204</p>
<p>But for what intent did the devils destroy the swine? Everywhere they have labored to
drive men to dismay, and everywhere they rejoice in destruction. This, for instance, the
devil did with respect to Job, although in that case too God suffered it, but neither in that
case as complying with the devil, but willing to show His own servant the more glorious,
cutting off from the evil spirit all pretext for his shamelessness, and turning on his own head
what was done against the righteous man. Because now also the contrary of what they wished
came to pass. For the power of Christ was gloriously proclaimed, and the wickedness of the
demons, from which He delivered those possessed by them, was more plainly indicated;
and how they want power to touch even swine, without permission from the God of all.</p>
<p>And if any would take these things in a hidden sense,1205there is nothing to hinder. For
the history indeed is this, but we are to know assuredly, that the swinish sort of men are especially
liable to the operations of the demons. And as long as they are men that suffer such
things, they are often able yet to prevail; but if they are become altogether swine, they are
not only possessed, but are also cast down the precipice. And besides, lest any should suppose
what was done to be mere acting, instead of distinctly believing that the devils1206were gone
out; by the death of the swine this is rendered manifest.</p>
<p>And mark also His meekness together with His power. For when the inhabitants of that
country, after having received such benefits, were driving Him away, He resisted not, but
retired, and left those who had shown themselves unworthy of His teaching, having given
them for teachers them that had been freed from the demons, and the swine-herds, that
they might of them learn all that had happened; whilst Himself retiring leaves the fear vigorous
in them. For the greatness withal of the loss was spreading the fame of what had been
done, and the event penetrated their mind. And from many quarters were wafted sounds,
proclaiming the strangeness of the miracle; from the cured, and from the drowned, from
the owners of the swine, from the men that were feeding them.</p>
<p>5. These things any one may see happening now also, even many in the tombs possessed
of evil spirits, whom nothing restrains from their madness; not iron, nor chain, nor multitude
of men, nor advice, nor admonition, nor terror, nor threat, nor any other such thing.</p>
<p>For so when any man is dissolute, eager after all embraces,1207he differs not at all from
the demoniac, but goes about naked like him, clad indeed in garments, but deprived of the

true covering, and stripped of his proper glory; cutting himself not with stones, but with
sins more hurtful than many stones. Who then shall be able to bind such a one? Who, to
stay his unseemliness and frenzy, his way of never coming to himself, but forever haunting
the tombs? For such are the resorts of the harlots, full of much evil savor, of much rottenness.</p>
<p>And what of the covetous man? Is he not like this? For who will be able ever to bind
him? Are there not fears and daily threats, and admonitions, and counsels? Nay, all these
bonds he bursts asunder; and if any one come to set him free, he adjures him that he may
not be freed, accounting it the greatest torture not to be in torture: than which what can be
more wretched? For as to that evil spirit, even though he despised men, yet he yielded to
the command of Christ, and quickly sprang out of the man’s body; but this man yields not
even to His commandment. See at least how he daily hears Him saying, “Ye cannot serve
God and mammon,”1208and threatening hell, and the incurable torments, and obeys not:
not that He is stronger than Christ, but because against our will Christ corrects us not.1209
Therefore such men live as in desert places, though they be in the midst of cities. For who,
that hath reason, would choose to be with such men? I for my part would sooner consent
to dwell with ten thousand demoniacs, than with one diseased in this way.</p>
<p>And that I am not mistaken in saying this, is manifest from their respective feelings.
For these last account him an enemy that hath done them no wrong, and desire even to take
him for a slave when he is free, and encompass him with ten thousand evils; but the demoniacs
do no such thing, but toss their disease to and for within themselves. And while these
overturn many houses, and cause the name of God to be blasphemed, and are a pest to the
city and to the whole earth; they that are troubled by evil spirits, deserve rather our pity and
our tears. And the one for the more part act in insensibility, but the others are frantic while
they reason, keeping their orgies in the midst of cities, and maddened with some new kind
of madness. For what do all the demoniacs so bad, as what Judas dared to do, when he
showed forth that extremity of wickedness? And all too that imitate him, like fierce wild
beasts escaped from their cage, trouble their cities, no man restraining them. For these also
have bonds upon them on every side; such as the fears of the judges, the threatening of the
laws, the condemnation of the multitude, and other things more than these; yet bursting
asunder even these, they turn all things upside down. And should any one remove these altogether
from them, then would he know assuredly the demon that is in them to be far
fiercer, and more frantic than he who is just now gone forth.</p>
<p>But since this may not be, let us for the time suppose it for argument’s sake: and let us
take off from him all his chains, and then shall we clearly know his manifest madness. But
be not afraid of the monster, when we uncover it; for it is the representation in word, not

the thing in truth. Let there be then some man, darting fire from his eyes, black, having from
either shoulder serpents hanging down instead of hands; and let him have also a mouth,
with sharp swords set in it instead of teeth, and for a tongue a gushing fountain of poison
and some baneful drug; and a belly more consuming than any furnace, devouring all that
is cast unto it, and a sort of winged feet more vehement than any flame; and let his face be
made up of a dog and of a wolf; and let him utter nothing human, but something discordant,
and unpleasing, and terrible; and let him have also in his hands a firebrand. Perhaps what
we have said seems to you to be terrible, but we have not even yet fashioned him worthily;
for together with these things we must add others besides. I mean, that he is also to slay
them that meet with him, to devour them, to fasten upon their flesh.</p>
<p>Yet is the covetous man much more fierce even than this, assailing all like hell, swallowing
all up, going about a common enemy to the race of men. Why, he would have no man exist,
that he may possess all things. And he stops not even at this, but when in his longing he
shall have destroyed all men, he longs also to mar the substance of the earth, and to see it
all become gold; nay, not the earth only, but hills also, and woods, and fountains, and in a
word all things that appear.</p>
<p>And to convince you that not even yet have we set forth his madness, let there be no
man to accuse and frighten him, but take away the terror of the laws in supposition awhile,
and thou wilt see him snatching up a sword, laying violent hands on all, and sparing none;
neither friend, nor kinsman, nor brother, nor even his very parent. Nay rather, in this case
there is not even need of supposing, but let us ask him, if he is not for ever framing to himself
such imaginations, and if he does not in thought range among all men to destroy them; both
friends and kinsmen, and even his very parents. Nay rather there is no need even to ask,
because in truth all men know that they who are under the power of this disease are wearied
even of their father’s old age; and that which is sweet, and universally desirable, the having
children, they esteem grievous and unwelcome: many at least with this view have even paid
money to be childless, and have maimed their nature, not only by slaying their children
after birth, but by not suffering them even to be born at all.</p>
<p>6. Marvel not, therefore, if we have thus sketched the covetous man (for in truth he is
far worse than what we have said); but let us consider how we shall deliver him from the
demon. How then shall we deliver him? If he may be clearly made aware, that his love of
money stands very much in his way in respect of this very object, the gaining of money; for
they that wish to gain in little things undergo great losses; whence accordingly a proverb
hath been put forth to this same effect.1210 Many, for instance, on many occasions, wishing
to lend at large usury, and through the expectation of gain not having inquired about them

<pb n="346"/>
who receive their money, have together with the interest lost also all their capital. Others
again falling into dangers, and not willing to give up a little have together with the substance
lost their life too.</p>
<p>Again, when it has been in men’s power to purchase either gainful offices, or some
other such thing, by some trifling meanness they have lost all. For because they know not
how to sow, but have ever practised reaping, they of course continually fail of their harvest.
For no man can be always reaping, as neither can he be always gaining. Therefore since they
are not willing to spend, neither do they know how to gain. And should they have to take a
wife, the same thing again befalls them; for either they are deceived into taking a poor wife
for a rich one, or when they have brought home one that is rich, but full of faults without
number, here too they have incurred more loss than gain. For it is not superfluity but virtue,
that causes wealth. For what profit is there of her wealth, when she is expensive and dissolute,
and scatters all abroad more vehemently than any wind? What if she be unchaste, and bring
in numberless lovers? what if she be drunken? Will she not quickly make her husband the
poorest of men? But they do not only marry, but also buy at great risk, from their great
covetousness, laboring to find not good slaves, but cheap ones.</p>
<p>Consider then all these things (for the words concerning hell and the kingdom ye are
not yet able to hear), and bearing in mind the losses which ye have often undergone from
your love of money, in loans, and in purchases, and in marriages, and in offices of power,
and in all the rest; withdraw yourselves from doating on money.</p>
<p>For so shall ye be able to live the present life in security, and after a little advance to hear
also the words that treat on self-government, and see through and look upon the very Sun
of Righteousness, and to attain unto the good things promised by Him; unto which God
grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXIX.</head>
<p>Matt. IX. 1, 2.</p>
<p>“And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own city. And, behold, they
brought to Him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said
unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.”1211</p>
<p>By His own city here he means Capernaum. For that which gave Him birth was Bethlehem;
that which brought Him up, Nazareth; that which had Him continually inhabiting it,
Capernaum.</p>
<p>This paralytic, however, was different from that one who is set forth in John.1212 For
he lay at the pool, but this at Capernaum; and that man had his infirmity thirty and eight
years, but concerning this, no such thing is mentioned; and the other was in a state destitute
of protectors, but this had some to take care of him, who also took him up, and carried him.
And to this He saith, “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee,”1213but to that He saith, “Wilt thou
be made whole?”1214 And the other He healed on a sabbath day, but this not on a sabbath,
for else the Jews would have laid this also to His charge; and in the case of this man they
were silent, but in that of the other they were instant in persecuting him.</p>
<p>And this I have said, not without purpose, lest any one should think there is a discrepancy
from suspecting it to be one and the same paralytic.</p>
<p>But do thou, I pray thee, mark the humility and meekness of our Lord. For He had also
before this put away the multitudes from Him, and moreover when sent away by them at
Gadara, He withstood not, but retired, not however to any great distance.</p>
<p>And again He entered into the ship and passed over, when He might have gone over
afoot. For it was His will not to be always doing miracles, that He might not injure the
doctrine of His humanity.1215</p>
<p>Now Matthew indeed saith, that “they brought him,” but the others, that they also broke
up the roof, and let him down.1216 And they put the sick man before Christ, saying nothing,
but committing the whole to Him. For though in the beginning He Himself went about,
and did not require so much faith of them that came unto Him; yet in this case they both

<pb n="348"/>
approached Him, and had faith required on their part. For, “Seeing,” it is said, “their faith;”
that is, the faith of them that had let the man down. For He doth not on all occasions require
faith on the part of the sick only: as for instance, when they are insane, or in any other way,
through their disease, are out of their own control. Or rather, in this case the sick man too
had part in the faith; for he would not have suffered himself to be let down, unless he had
believed.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as they had evinced so great faith, He also evinces His own power, with
all authority absolving his sins, and signifying in all ways that He is equal in honor with
Him that begat Him. And mark; He implied it from the beginning, by His teaching, when
He taught them as one having authority; by the leper, when He said, “I will, be thou
clean,”1217by the centurion, when upon his saying, “Speak the word only, and my servant
shall be healed, He marvelled at him,”1218and celebrated him above all men; by the sea,
when He curbed it with a mere word; by the devils, when they acknowledged Him as their
judge, and He cast them out with great authority.</p>
<p>Here again in another and a greater way He constrains His very enemies to confess His
equality in honor, and by their own mouth He makes it manifest. For He, to signify His indifference
to honor (for there stood a great company of spectators shutting up the entrance,
wherefore also they let him down from above), did not straightway hasten to heal the visible
body, but He takes His occasion from them; and He healed first that which is invisible, the
soul, by forgiving his sins; which indeed saved the other, but brought no great glory to
Himself. They themselves rather, troubled by their malice, and wishing to assail Him, caused
even against their will what was done to be conspicuous. He, in fact, in His abundance of
counsel, made use of their envy for the manifestation of the miracle.</p>
<p>Upon their murmuring,1219then, and saying, “This man blasphemeth; who can forgive
sins but God only?”1220let us see what He saith. Did He indeed take away the suspicion?
And yet if He were not equal, He should have said, “Why fix upon me a notion which is not
convenient? I am far from this power.” But now hath He said none of these things, but quite
the contrary He hath both affirmed and ratified, as well by His own voice, as by the performance
of the miracle. Thus, it appearing that His saying certain things of Himself gave disgust
to his hearers, He affirms what He had to say concerning Himself by the others; and what
is truly marvellous, not by His friends only, but also by His enemies; for this is the excellency
of His wisdom. By His friends on the one hand, when He said, “I will, be thou clean,”1221and

when He said, “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel;”1222but by His enemies,
now. For because they had said, “No man can forgive sins but God only,” He subjoined,</p>
<p>“But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power to forgive sins upon the earth
(then saith He to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thine
house.”1223</p>
<p>And not here only, but also in another case again, when they were saying, “For a good
work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest
thyself God,”1224neither in that instance did He put down this opinion, but again confirmed
it, saying, “If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, though ye believe
not me, believe the works.”1225</p>
<p>2. In this case indeed He discloses also another sign, and that no small one, of His own
Godhead, and of His equality in honor with the Father. For whereas they said, “To unbind
sins pertains to God only,” He not only unbinds sins, but also before this He makes another
kind of display in a thing which pertained to God only; the publishing the secrets in the
heart. For neither had they uttered what they were thinking.</p>
<p>For “behold, certain of the scribes,” it saith, “said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore think ye evil in your
hearts?”1226</p>
<p>But that it belongs to God only to know men’s secrets, hear what saith the prophet,
“Thou most entirely alone1227knowest the hearts;”1228and again, “God trieth the hearts and
reins;1229” and Jeremiah too saith, “The heart is deep above all things, and it is man, and
who shall know him?”1230and, “Man shall look on the face, but God on the heart.”1231 And
by many things one may see, that to know what is in the mind belongs to God alone.</p>
<p>Implying therefore that He is God, equal to Him that begat Him; what things they were
reasoning in themselves (for through fear of the multitude, they durst not utter their mind),

this their opinion He unveils and makes manifest, evincing herein also His great gentleness.
1232</p>
<p>“For wherefore,” saith He, “think ye evil in your hearts?”1233</p>
<p>And yet if there were cause for displeasure, it was the sick man who should have been
displeased, as being altogether deceived, and should have said “One thing I came to have
healed, and amendest Thou another? Why, whence is it manifest that my sins are forgiven?”</p>
<p>But now he for his part utters no such word, but gives himself up to the power of the
healer; but these being curious and envious, plot against the good deeds of others. Wherefore
He rebukes them indeed, but with all gentleness. “Why, if ye disbelieve,” saith He, “what
went before, and account my saying a boast; behold I add to it also another, the uncovering
of your secrets; and after that again another.” What then is this? The giving tone to the body
of the paralyzed.</p>
<p>And whereas, when He spake unto the sick of the palsy, He spake without clearly
manifesting His own authority: for He said not, “I forgive thee thy sins,” but, “thy sins be
forgiven thee:” upon their constraining, He discloses His authority more clearly, saying,
“But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power1234on earth to forgive sins.”</p>
<p>Seest thou, how far He was from unwillingness to be thought equal to the Father? For
He said not at all, “The Son of Man hath need of another;” or, “He hath given Him authority,”
but, “He hath authority.” Neither doth He say it for love of honor, but “to convince you,”
so He speaks, “that I do not blaspheme in making myself equal with God.”</p>
<p>Thus everywhere His will is to offer proofs clear and indisputable; as when He saith,
“Go thy way, show thyself to the priest;”1235and when He points to Peter’s wife’s mother
ministering, and permits the swine to cast themselves down headlong. And in the same
manner here also; first, for a certain token of the forgiveness of his sins, He provides the
giving tone to his body: and of that again, his carrying his bed; to hinder the fact from being
thought a mere fancy. And He doeth not this, before He had asked them a question. “For
whether is easier,” saith He, “to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee? or to say, Take up thy bed,
and go unto thine house?”1236 Now what He saith is like this, “Which seems to you easier,
to bind up a disorganized1237body, or to undo1238the sins of a soul? It is quite manifest; to

bind up a body. For by how much a soul is better than a body, by so much is the doing away
sins a greater work than this; but because the one is unseen, the other in sight, I throw in
that, which although an inferior thing, is yet more open to sense; that the greater also and
the unseen may thereby receive its proof;” thus by His works anticipating even now the
revelation of what had been said by John, that “He taketh away the sins of the world.”</p>
<p>Well then, having raised him up, He sends him to his house; here again signifying His
unboastfulness,1239and that the event was not a mere imagination; for He makes the same
persons witnesses of his infirmity, and also of his health. For I indeed had desired, saith He,
through thy calamity to heal those also, that seem to be in health, but are diseased in mind;
but since they will not, depart thou home, to heal them that are there.</p>
<p>Seest thou how He indicates Him1240to be Creator both of souls and bodies? He heals
therefore the palsy in each of the two substances, and makes the invisible evident by that
which is in sight. But nevertheless they still creep upon the earth.</p>
<p>“For when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which” (it is said)
“had given such power unto men:”1241for the flesh was an offense unto them.1242 But He
did not rebuke them, but proceeds by His works to arouse them, and exalt their thoughts.
Since for the time it was no small thing for Him to be thought greater than all men, as having
come from God. For had they well established these things in their own minds, going on
orderly they would have known, that He was even the Son of God. But they did not retain
these things clearly, wherefore neither were they able to approach Him. For they said again,
“This man is not of God;”1243“how is this man of God?” And they were continually harping
on these things, putting them forward as cloaks for their own passions.</p>
<p>3. Which thing many now also do; and thinking to avenge God, fulfill their own passions,
when they ought to go about all with moderation. For even the God of all, having power to
launch His thunderbolt against them that blaspheme Him, makes the sun to rise, and sends
forth the showers, and affords them all other things in abundance; whom we ought to imitate,
and so to entreat, advise, admonish, with meekness, not angry, not making ourselves wild
beasts.</p>
<p>For no harm at all ensues unto God by their blasphemy, that thou shouldest be angered,
but he who blasphemed hath himself also received the wound. Wherefore groan, bewail,

for the calamity indeed deserves tears. And the wounded man, again,—noth ing can so heal
him as gentleness: gentleness, I say, which is mightier than any force.</p>
<p>See, for example, how He Himself, the insulted one, discourses with us, both in the Old
Testament, and in the New; in the one saying, “O my people, what have I done unto
thee?”1244in the other, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me.”1245 And Paul too bids, “In
meekness instruct those that oppose themselves.”1246 And Christ again, when His disciples
had come to Him, requiring fire to come down from heaven, strongly rebuked them, saying,
“Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.”1247</p>
<p>And here again He said not, “O accursed, and sorcerers as ye are; O ye envious, and
enemies of men’s salvation;” but, “Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?”</p>
<p>We must, you see, use gentleness to eradicate the disease. Since he who is become better
through the fear of man, will quickly return to wickedness again. For this cause He commanded
also the tares to be left, giving an appointed day of repentance. Yea, and many of
them in fact repented, and became good, who before were bad; as for instance, Paul, the
Publican, the Thief; for these being really tares turned into kindly wheat. Because, although
in the seeds this cannot be, yet in the human will it is both manageable and easy; for our
will is bound by no limits of nature, but hath freedom of choice for its privilege.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when thou seest an enemy of the truth, wait on him, take care of him, lead
him back into virtue, by showing forth an excellent life, by applying “speech that cannot be
condemned,”1248by bestowing attention and tender care, by trying every means of amendment,
in imitation of the best physicians. For neither do they cure in one manner only, but
when they see the wound not yield to the first remedy, they add another, and after that again
another; and now they use the knife, and now bind up. And do thou accordingly, having
become a physician of souls, put in practice every mode of cure according to Christ’s laws;
that thou mayest receive the reward both of saving thyself and of profiting others, doing all
to the glory of God, and so being glorified also thyself. “For them that glorify me,” saith He,
“I will glorify; and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.”1249</p>

<p>Matt. IX. 9.</p>
<p>“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, He saw a man sitting at the receipt of custom,1250named
Matthew; and He saith unto him, Follow me.”</p>
<p>For when He had performed the miracle, He did not remain, lest, being in sight, He
should kindle their jealousy the more; but He indulges them by retiring, and soothing their
passion. This then let us also do, not encountering them that are plotting against us; let us
rather soothe their wound, giving way and relaxing their vehemence.</p>
<p>But wherefore did He not call him together with Peter and John and the rest? As in their
case He had come at that time, when He knew the men would obey Him; so Matthew also
He then called when He was assured he would yield himself. And therefore Paul again He
took, as a fisher his prey, after the resurrection. Because He who is acquainted with the
hearts, and knows the secrets of each man’s mind, knew also when each of these would obey.
Therefore not at the beginning did He call him, when he was yet in rather a hardened state,
but after His countless miracles, and the great fame concerning Him, when He knew him
to have actually become more prepared for obedience.</p>
<p>And we have cause also to admire the self-denial1251of the evangelist, how he disguises
not his own former life, but adds even his name, when the others had concealed him under
another appellation.1252</p>
<p>But why did he say he was “sitting at the receipt of custom?” To indicate the power of
Him that called him, that it was not when he had left off or forsaken this wicked trade, but
from the midst of the evils He drew him up; much as He converted the blessed Paul also
when frantic and raging, and darting fire; which thing he himself makes a proof of the power
of Him that called him, saying to the Galatians, “Ye have heard of my conversation in time
past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God.”1253
And the fishermen too He called when they were in the midst of their business. But that
was a craft not indeed in bad report, but of men rather rudely bred, not mingling with others,
and endowed with great simplicity; whereas the pursuit now in question was one full of all
insolence and boldness, and a mode of gain whereof no fair account could be given, a
shameless traffic, a robbery under cloak of law: yet nevertheless He who uttered the call was
ashamed of none of these things.</p>

<p>And why talk I of His not being ashamed of a publican? since even with regard to a
harlot woman, so far from being ashamed to call her, He actually permitted her to kiss His
feet, and to moisten them with her tears.1254 Yea, for to this end He came, not to cure bodies
only, but to heal likewise the wickedness of the soul. Which He did also in the case of the
paralytic; and having shown clearly that He is able to forgive sins, then, not before, He comes
to him whom we are now speaking of; that they might no more be troubled at seeing a
publican chosen into the choir of the disciples. For He that hath power to undo all our offenses,
why marvel if He even make this man an apostle?</p>
<p>But as thou hast seen the power of Him that called, so consider also the obedience of
him that was called: how he neither resisted, nor disputing said, “What is this? Is it not indeed
a deceitful calling, wherewith He calls me, being such as I am?” nay; for this humility again
had been out of season: but he obeyed straightway, and did not even request to go home,
and to communicate with his relations concerning this matter; as neither indeed did the
fishermen; but as they left their net and their ship and their father, so did he his receipt of
custom and his gain, and followed, exhibiting a mind prepared for all things; and breaking
himself at once away from all worldly things, by his complete obedience he bare witness
that He who called him had chosen a good time.</p>
<p>And wherefore can it be, one may say, that he hath not told us of the others also, how
and in what manner they were called; but only of Peter and James, and John and Philip, and
nowhere of the others?1255</p>
<p>Because these more than others were in so strange and mean ways of life. For there is
nothing either worse than the publican’s business, or more ordinary than fishing. And that
Philip also was among the very ignoble, is manifest from his country. Therefore these especially
they proclaim to us, with their ways of life, to show that we ought to believe them in
the glorious parts of their histories also. For they who choose not to pass by any of the things
which are accounted reproachful, but are exact in publishing these more than the rest,
whether they relate to the Teacher or to the disciples; how can they be suspected in the parts
which claim reverence? more especially since many signs and miracles are passed over by
them, while the events of the cross, accounted to be reproaches, they utter with exact care
and loudly; and the disciples’ pursuits too, and their faults, and those of their Master’s ancestry
who were notorious for sins,1256they discover with a clear voice. Whence it is manifest
that they made much account of truth, and wrote nothing for favor, nor for display.</p>
<p>2. Having therefore called him, He also honored him with a very great honor by partaking
straightway of his table; for in this way He would both give him good hope for the future,
<note type="footnote">1254 Luke vii. 38.</note>
<note type="footnote">1255 It appears by this that St. Chrysostom did not consider Nathanael to be the same with St. Bartholomew.</note>
<note type="footnote">1256 Matt. iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="356"/>
and lead him on to a greater confidence.1257 For not in a long time, but at once, He healed
his vice. And not with him only doth He sit down to meat, but with many others also; although
this very thing was accounted a charge against Him, that He chased not away the
sinners. But neither do they conceal this point, what sort of blame is endeavored to be fixed
on His proceedings.</p>
<p>Now the publicans come together as to one of the same trade; for he, exulting1258in the
entrance of Christ, had called them all together. The fact is, Christ used to try every kind of
treatment; and not when discoursing only, nor when healing, nor when reproving His enemies,
but even at His morning meal, He would often correct such as were in a bad way;
hereby teaching us, that every season and every work may by possibility afford us profit.
And yet surely what was then set before them came of injustice and covetousness; but Christ
refused not to partake of it, because the ensuing gain was to be great: yea rather He becomes
partaker of the same roof and table with them that have committed such offenses. For such
is the quality of a physician; unless he endure the corruption of the sick, he frees them not
from their infirmity.</p>
<p>And yet undoubtedly He incurred hence an evil report: first by eating with him, then
in Matthew’s house, and thirdly, in company with many publicans. See at least how they
reproach Him with this. “Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners.”1259</p>
<p>Let them hear, as many as are striving to deck themselves with great honor for fasting,
and let them consider that our Lord was called “a man gluttonous and a winebibber,” and
He was not ashamed, but overlooked all these things, that he might accomplish what He
had set before him; which indeed was accordingly done. For the publican was actually converted,
and thus became a better man.</p>
<p>And to teach thee that this great thing was wrought by his partaking of the table with
Him, hear what Zacchæus saith, another publican. I mean, when he heard Christ saying,
“To-day, I must abide in thy house,” the delight gave him wings, and he saith, “The half of
my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation,
I restore him fourfold.”1260 And to him Jesus saith, “This day is salvation come to this
house.” So possible is it by all ways to give instruction.</p>
<p>But how is it, one may say, that Paul commands, “If any man that is called a brother be
a fornicator or covetous, with such an one no, not to eat?”1261 In the first place, it is not as

<pb n="357"/>
yet manifest, whether to teachers also he gives this charge, and not rather to brethren only.
Next, these were not yet of the number of the perfect,1262nor of those who had become
brethren. And besides, Paul commands, even with respect to them that had become brethren,
then to shrink from them, when they continue as they were, but these had now ceased, and
were converted.</p>
<p>3. But none of these things shamed the Pharisees, but they accuse Him to His disciples,
saying,</p>
<p>“Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?”1263
And when the disciples seem to be doing wrong, they intercede with Him, saying, “Behold
thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-day;”1264but here to them
they discredit Him. All which was the part of men dealing craftily, and wishing to separate
from the Master the choir of the disciples. What then saith Infinite Wisdom?</p>
<p>“They that be whole need not a physician,” saith He, “but they that are sick.”1265</p>
<p>See how He turned their reasoning to the opposite conclusion. That is, while they made
it a charge against Him that He was in company with these men: He on the contrary saith,
that His not being with them would be unworthy of Him, and of His love of man; and that
to amend such persons is not only blameless, but excellent, and necessary, and deserving
of all sorts of praise.</p>
<p>After this, that He might not seem to put them that were bidden to shame, by saying,
“they that are sick;” see how He makes up for it again, by reproving the others, and saying,</p>
<p>“Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.”1266</p>
<p>Now this He said, to upbraid them with their ignorance of the Scriptures. Wherefore
also He orders His discourse more sharply, not Himself in anger, far from it; but so as that
the publicans might not be in utter perplexity.</p>
<p>And yet of course He might say, “Did ye not mark, how I remitted the sins of the sick
of the palsy, how I braced up his body?” But He saith no such thing, but argues with them
first from men’s common reasonings, and then from the Scriptures. For having said, “They
that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;” and having covertly indicated
that He Himself was the Physician; after that He said, “Go ye and learn what that meaneth,
I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” Thus doth Paul also: when he had first established his
reasoning by illustrations from common things, and had said, “Who feedeth a flock, and
eateth not of the milk thereof?”1267then he brings in the Scriptures also, saying, “It is written

in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn;”1268and again,
“Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.”
1269</p>
<p>But to His disciples not so, but He puts them in mind of His signs, saying on this wise,
“Do ye not yet remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took
up?”1270 Not so however with these, but He reminds them of our common infirmity, and
signifies them at any rate to be of the number of the infirm; who did not so much as know
the Scriptures, but making light of the rest of virtue, laid all the stress on their sacrifices;
which thing He is also earnestly intimating unto them, when He sets down in brief what
had been affirmed by all the prophets,1271saying, “Learn ye what that meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The fact is, He is signifying hereby that not He was transgressing the law, but they; as
if He had said, “Wherefore accuse me? Because I bring sinners to amendment? Why then
ye must accuse the Father also for this.” Much as He said also elsewhere, establishing this
point: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work:”1272so here again, “Go ye and learn what
that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” “For as this is His will, saith Christ, so
also mine.” Seest thou how the one is superfluous, the other necessary? For neither did He
say, “I will have mercy, and sacrifice,” but, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” That is,
the one thing He allowed, the other He cast out; and proved that what they blamed, so far
from being forbidden, was even ordained by the law, and more so than sacrifice; and He
brings in the Old Testament, speaking words and ordaining laws in harmony with Himself.</p>
<p>Having then reproved them, both by common illustrations and by the Scriptures, He
adds again,</p>
<p>“I am not come to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance.”1273</p>
<p>And this He saith unto them in irony; as when He said, “Behold, Adam is become as
one of us;”1274and again, “If I were hungry, I would not tell thee.”1275 For that no man on
earth was righteous, Paul declared, saying, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory
of God.”1276 And by this too the others were comforted, I mean, the guests. “Why, I am so

far,” saith He, “from loathing sinners, that even for their sakes only am I come.” Then, lest
He should make them more careless, He staid not at the word “sinners,” but added, “unto
repentance.” “For I am not come that they should continue sinners, but that they should
alter, and amend.”</p>
<p>4. He then having stopped their mouths every way, as well from the Scriptures as from
the natural consequence of things; and they having nothing to say, proved as they were obnoxious
to the charges which they had brought against Him, and adversaries of the law and
the Old Testament; they leave Him, and again transfer their accusation to the disciples.</p>
<p>And Luke indeed affirms that the Pharisees said it, but this evangelist, that it was the
disciples of John;1277but it is likely that both said it. That is, they being, as might be expected,
in utter perplexity, take the other sort with them; as they did afterwards with the Herodians
likewise. Since in truth John’s disciples were always disposed to be jealous of Him, and
reasoned against Him: being then only humbled, when first John abode in the prison. They
came at least then, “and told Jesus;”1278but afterwards they returned to their former envy.</p>
<p>Now what say they? “Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?”1279</p>
<p>This is the disease, which Christ long before was eradicating, in the words, “When thou
fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;”1280foreknowing the evils that spring therefrom.
But yet He doth not rebuke even these, nor say, “O ye vainglorious and over-busy;” but He
discourses to them with all gentleness, saying, “The children of the bride-chamber cannot
fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them.”1281 Thus, when others were to be spoken for,
the publicans I mean, to soothe their wounded soul, He was more severe in His reproof of
their revilers; but when they were deriding Himself and His disciples, He makes His reply
with all gentleness.</p>
<p>Now their meaning is like this; “Granted,” say they, “Thou doest this as a physician;
why do Thy disciples also leave fasting, and cleave to such tables?” Then, to make the accusation
heavier, they put themselves first, and then the Pharisees; wishing by the comparison
to aggravate the charge. For indeed “both we,” it is said, “and the Pharisees, fast oft.” And
in truth they did fast, the one having learnt it from John, the other from the law; even as
also the Pharisee said, “I fast twice in the week.”1282</p>
<p>What then saith Jesus? “Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
is with them.” Before, He called Himself a physician, but here a bridegroom; by these names
<note type="footnote">1277 Comp. Matt. ix. 14; Luke v. 33, u+0026c., and Mark ii. 18, c. </note>

revealing His unspeakable mysteries. Yet of course He might have told them, more sharply,
“These things depend not on you, that you should make such laws. For of what use is fasting,
when the mind is full of wickedness; when ye blame others, when ye condemn them, bearing
about beams in your eyes, and do all for display? Nay, before all this ye ought to have cast
out vainglory, to be proficients in all the other duties, in charity, meekness, brotherly love.”
However, nothing of this kind doth He say, but with all gentleness, “The children of the
bridechamber cannot fast, so long as the bridegroom is with them;” recalling to their mind
John’s words, when he said, “He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom, but the friend of
the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s
voice.”1283</p>
<p>Now His meaning is like this: The present time is of joy and gladness, therefore do not
bring in the things which are melancholy. For fasting is a melancholy thing, not in its own
nature, but to them that are yet in rather a feeble state; for to those at least that are willing
to practise self-command, the observance is exceedingly pleasant and desirable. For as when
the body is in health, the spirits are high,1284so when the soul is well conditioned, the
pleasure is greater. But according to their previous impression He saith this. So also Isaiah,
1285discoursing of it, calls it “an affliction of the soul;” and Moses too in like manner.</p>
<p>Not however by this only doth He stop their mouths, but by another topic also, saying,</p>
<p>“Days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they
fast.”1286</p>
<p>For hereby He signifies, that what they did was not of gluttony, but pertained to some
marvellous dispensation. And at the same time He lays beforehand the foundation of what
He was to say touching His passion, in His controversies with others instructing His disciples,
and training them now to be versed in the things which are deemed sorrowful. Because for
themselves already to have this said to them, would have been grievous and galling, since
we know that afterwards, being uttered, it troubled them;1287but spoken to others, it would
become rather less intolerable to them.</p>
<p>It being also natural for them to pride themselves on John’s calamity, He from this

<p>5. Then what He had done before, this He doth here again. I mean, that as He, when
they were attempting to prove Him blameable for eating with sinners, proved to them on
the contrary, that His proceeding was not only no blame, but an absolute praise to Him: so
here too, when they wanted to show of Him, that He knows not how to manage His disciples,
He signifies that such language was the part of men not knowing how to manage their inferences,
1288but finding fault at random.</p>
<p>“For no man,” saith He, “putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment.”1289</p>
<p>He is again establishing His argument by illustrations from common life. And what He
saith is like this, “The disciples have not yet become strong, but still need much condescension.
They have not yet been renewed by the Spirit, and on persons in that state one ought
not to lay any burden of injunctions.”</p>
<p>And these things He said, setting laws and rules for His own disciples, that when they
should have to receive as disciples those of all sorts that should come from the whole world,
they might deal with them very gently.</p>
<p>“Neither do men put new wine into old bottles.”1290</p>
<p>Seest thou His illustrations, how like the Old Testament? the garment? the wine skins?
For Jeremiah too calls the people “a girdle,” and makes mention again of “bottles” and of
“wine.”1291 Thus, the discourse being about gluttony and a table, He takes His illustrations
from the same.</p>

are making a beautiful portrait? Well then, do not thou prove inferior to these. For if these,
in drawing the likeness of a body, used such great diligence, how much more were it meet
for us, in fashioning a soul, to use every contrivance. For if thou shouldest fashion well the
form of this soul, thou wilt not see the countenance of the body looking unseemly, nor lips
stained, nor a mouth like a bear’s mouth dyed with blood, nor eyebrows blackened as with

For all these things are smut, and cinders, and dust, and signals of extreme deformity.</p>
<p>But stay: I have been led on unobserving, I know not how, into these expressions; and
while admonishing another to teach with gentleness, I have been myself hurried
away1293into wrath. Let us return therefore again unto the more gentle way of admonition,
and let us bear with all the faults of our wives, that we may succeed in doing what we would.
Seest thou not how we bear with the cries of children, when we would wean them from the
breast, how we endure all for this object only, that we may persuade them to despise their
former food? Thus let us do in this case also, let us bear with all the rest, that we may accomplish
this. For when this hath been amended, thou wilt see the other too proceeding in due
order, and thou wilt come again unto the ornaments of gold, and in the same way wilt
reason concerning them likewise, and thus by little and little bringing thy wife unto the right
rule, thou wilt be a beautiful painter, a faithful servant, an excellent husbandman.</p>
<p>Together with these things remind her also of the women of old, of Sarah, of Rebecca,
both of the fair and of them that were not so, and point out how all equally practised modesty.
For even Leah, the wife of the patriarch, not being fair, was not constrained to devise any
such thing, but although she were uncomely, and not very much beloved by her husband,
she neither devised any such thing, nor marred her countenance, but continued to preserve
the lineaments thereof undisfigured, and this though brought up by Gentiles.1294</p>
<p>But thou that art a believing woman, thou that hast Christ for thine head, art thou
bringing in upon us a satanic art? And dost thou not call to mind the water that dashed over
thy countenance, the sacrifice that adorns thy lips, the blood that hath reddened thy tongue?
For if thou wouldest consider all these things, though thou wert fond of dress to the ten
thousandth degree, thou wilt not venture nor endure to put upon thee that dust and those
cinders. Learn that thou hast been joined unto Christ, and refrain from this unseemliness.
For neither is He delighted with these colorings, but He seeks after another beauty, of which
He is in an exceeding degree a lover, I mean, that in the soul. This the prophet likewise hath
charged thee to cherish, and hath said, “So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty.”1295</p>
<p>Let us not therefore be curious in making ourselves unseemly. For neither is any one
of God’s works imperfect, nor doth it need to be set right by thee. For not even if to an image
of the emperor, after it was set up, any one were to seek to add his own work, would the attempt
be safe, but he will incur extreme danger. Well then, man works and thou addest not;
but doth God work, and dost thou amend it? And dost thou not consider the fire of hell?

Dost thou not consider the destitution of thy soul? For on this account it is neglected, because
all thy care is wasted on the flesh.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of the soul? For to the very flesh everything falls out contrary to
what ye have sought. Consider it. Dost thou wish to appear beautiful? This shows thee uncomely.
Dost thou wish to please thy husband? This rather grieves him; and causes not him
only, but strangers also, to become thine accusers. Wouldest thou appear young? This will
quickly bring thee to old age. Wouldest thou wish to array thyself honorably? This makes
thee to be ashamed. For such an one is ashamed not only before those of her own rank, but
even those of her maids who are in her secret, and those of her servants who know; and,
above all, before herself.</p>
<p>But why need I say these things? For that which is more grievous than all I have now
omitted, namely, that thou dost offend God; thou underminest modesty, kindlest the flame
of jealousy, emulatest the harlot women at their brothel.</p>

the craft of the devil; and letting go this adorning, or rather disfiguring, cultivate that beauty

husbands; that ye may attain both unto present glory, and unto that which is to come. To
which God grant that we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXI.</head>
<p>Matt. IX. 18.</p>
<p>“While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came in1296a ruler, and worshipped
Him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and
she shall live.”</p>
<p>The deed overtook the words; so that the mouths of the Pharisees were the more stopped.
For both he that came was a ruler of the synagogue, and his affliction terrible. For the young
damsel was both his only child, and twelve years old, the very flower of her age; on which
account especially He raised her up again, and that immediately.</p>
<p>And if Luke say that men came, saying, “Trouble not the Master, for she is dead;”1297we
will say this, that the expression, “she is even now dead,” was that of one conjecturing from
the time of his journeying, or exaggerating his affliction. For it is an usual thing with persons
in need to heighten their own evils by their report, and to say something more than is really
true, the more to attract those whom they are beseeching.</p>
<p>But see his dullness: how he requires of Christ two things, both His actual presence, and
the laying on of His hand: and this by the way is a sign that he had left her still breathing.
This Naaman also, that Syrian, required of the prophet. “For I thought,” saith he, “he will
surely come out, and will lay on his hand.”1298 For in truth they who are more or less dull
of temper, require sight and sensible things.</p>
<p>And whereas Mark1299saith, He took the three disciples, and so doth Luke;1300our
evangelist merely saith, “the disciples.” Wherefore then did He not take with Him Matthew,
though he had but just come unto Him? To bring him to a more earnest longing, and because
he was yet rather in an imperfect state. For to this intent doth He honor those, that these
may grow such as those are. But for him it sufficed for the present, to see what befell the
woman with the issue of blood, and to be honored by His table, and by His partaking of his
salt.</p>
<p>And when He had risen up many followed Him, as for a great miracle, both on account
of the person who had come, and because the more part being of a grosser disposition were
seeking not so much the care of the soul, as the healing of the body; and they flowed together,
some urged by their own afflictions, some hastening to behold how other men’s were cured:

however, there were as yet but few in the habit of coming principally for the sake of His
words and doctrine. Nevertheless, He did not suffer them to enter into the house, but His
disciples only; and not even all of these, everywhere instructing us to repel the applause of
the multitude.</p>
<p>2. “And, behold,” it is said, “a woman that had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind
Him, and touched the hem of His garment. For she said within herself, If I may but
touch His garment, I shall be whole.”1301</p>
<p>Wherefore did she not approach Him boldly? She was ashamed on account of her affliction,
accounting herself to be unclean. For if the menstruous woman was judged not to be
clean, much more would she have the same thought, who was afflicted with such a disease;
since in fact that complaint was under the law accounted a great uncleanness.1302 Therefore
she lies hidden, and conceals herself. For neither had she as yet the proper and correct
opinion concerning Him: else she would not have thought to be concealed. And this is the
first woman that came unto Him in public, having heard of course that He heals women
also, and that He is on His way to the little daughter that was dead.</p>
<p>And she durst not invite Him to her house, although she was wealthy;1303nay, neither
did she approach publicly, but secretly with faith she touched His garments. For she did not
doubt, nor say in herself, “Shall I indeed be delivered from the disease? shall I indeed fail of
deliverance?” But confident of her health, she so approached Him. “For she said,” we read,
“in herself, If I may only touch His garment, I shall be whole.” Yea, for she saw out of what
manner of house He was come, that of the publicans, and who they were that followed Him,
sinners and publicans; and all these things made her to be of good hope.</p>
<p>What then doth Christ? He suffers her not to be hid, but brings her into the midst, and
makes her manifest for many purposes.
It is true indeed that some of the senseless ones say, “He does this for love of glory. For
why,” say they, “did He not suffer her to be hid?” What sayest thou, unholy, yea, all unholy
one? He that enjoins silence, He that passes by miracles innumerable, is He in love with
glory?</p>
<p>For what intent then doth He bring her forward? In the first place He puts an end to
the woman’s fear, lest being pricked by her conscience, as having stolen the gift, she should

<note type="footnote">1302 Levit. xv. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">1303 Eusebius, E. H., viii. 18, mentions a tradition that she belonged to Cæsarea Philippi, otherwise called
Paneas, and that certain brazen statues of a man holding out his hand and a woman kneeling, which were there
in his time, were set up at her expense, that being her native place. He adds, that a certain plant which grew by
the Saviour’s statue, when it came to touch the hem of His garment, stopped growing and that it was endowed
with virtue to cure all manner of diseases.</note>

<pb n="366"/>
abide in agony. In the second place, He sets her right, in respect of her thinking to be hid.
Thirdly, He exhibits her faith to all, so as to provoke the rest also to emulation; and His
staying of the fountains of her blood was no greater sign than He affords in signifying His
knowledge of all things. Moreover the ruler of the synagogue, who was on the point of
thorough unbelief, and so of utter ruin, He corrects by the woman. Since both they that
came said, “Trouble not the Master, for the damsel is dead;” and those in the house laughed
Him to scorn, when He said, “She sleepeth;” and it was likely that the father too should have
experienced some such feeling. Therefore to correct this weakness beforehand, He brings
forward the simple woman. For as to that ruler being quite of the grosser sort, hear what
He saith unto him: “Fear not, do thou believe only, and she shall be made whole.”1304</p>
<p>Thus He waited also on purpose for death to come on, and that then He should arrive;
in order that the proof of the resurrection might be distinct. With this view He both walks
more leisurely, and discourses more with the woman; that He might give time for the
damsel to die, and for those to come, who told of it, and said, “Trouble not the Master.”1305
This again surely the evangelist obscurely signifies, when he saith, “While He yet spake,
there came from the house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.”
For His will was that her death should be believed, that her resurrection might not be suspected.
And this He doth in every instance. So also in the case of Lazarus, He waited a first
and a second and a third day.1306</p>
<p>On account then of all these things He brings her forward, and saith, “Daughter, be of
good cheer,”1307even as He had said also to the paralyzed person, “Son, be of good cheer.”
Because in truth the woman was exceedingly alarmed; therefore He saith, “be of good cheer,”
and He calls her “daughter;” for her faith had made her a daughter. After that comes also
her praise: “Thy faith hath made thee whole.”</p>
<p>But Luke tells us also other things more than these concerning the woman. Thus, when
she had approached Him, saith he, and had received her health, Christ did not immediately
call her, but first He saith, “Which is he that touched me?” Then when Peter and they that
were with Him said, Master, the multitude throng Thee, and press Thee, and sayest Thou,
who touched me?”1308(which was a very sure sign both that He was encompassed with real
flesh, and that He trampled on all vainglory, for they did not follow Him at all afar off, but
thronged Him on every side); He for His part continued to say, “Somebody hath touched
me, for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me;”1309answering after a grosser manner ac-

cording to the impression of His hearers. But these things He said, that He might also induce
her of herself to make confession. For on this account neither did He immediately convict
her, in order that having signified that He knows all things clearly, He might induce her of
her own accord to publish all, and work upon her to proclaim herself what had been done,
and that He might not incur suspicion by saying it.</p>
<p>Seest thou the woman superior to the ruler of the synagogue? She detained Him not,
she took no hold of Him, but touched Him only with the end of her fingers, and though she
came later, she first went away healed. And he indeed was bringing the Physician altogether
to his house, but for her a mere touch suffered. For though she was bound by her affliction,
yet her faith had given her wings. And mark how He comforts her, saying, “Thy faith hath
saved thee.” Now surely, had He drawn her forward for display, He would not have added
this; but He saith this, partly teaching the ruler of the synagogue to believe, partly proclaiming
the woman’s praise, and affording her by these words delight and advantage equal to her
bodily health.</p>
<p>For that He did this as minded to glorify her, and to amend others, and not to show
Himself glorious, is manifest from hence; that He indeed would have been equally an object
of admiration even without this (for the miracles were pouring around Him faster than the
snow-flakes, and He both had done and was to do far greater things than these): but the
woman, had this not happened, would have gone away hid, deprived of those great praises.
For this cause He brought her forward, and proclaimed her praise, and cast out her fear,
(for “she came,” it is said, “trembling”1310); and He caused her to be of good courage, and
together with health of body, He gave her also other provisions for her journey, in that He
said, “Go in peace.”1311</p>
<p>3. “And when He came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people
making a noise, He saith unto them, Give place, for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And
they laughed Him to scorn.”1312</p>
<p>Noble tokens, surely, these, of the rulers of synagogues; in the moment of her death
pipes and cymbals raising a dirge! What then doth Christ? All the rest He cast out, but the
parents He brought in; to leave no room for saying that He healed her in any other way.
And before her resurrection too, He raises her in His word; saying, “The maid is not dead,
but sleepeth.” And in many instances besides He doeth this. As then on the sea He expels
tumult from the mind of the by-standers, at the same time both signifying that it is easy for
Him to raise the dead (which same thing He did with respect to Lazarus also, saying, “Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth1313;” and also teaching us not to fear death; for that it is not death,

but is henceforth become a sleep. Thus, since He Himself was to die, He doth in the persons
of others prepare His disciples beforehand to be of good courage, and to bear the end meekly.
Since in truth, when He had come, death was from that time forward a sleep.
But yet they laughed Him to scorn: He however was not indignant at being disbelieved
by those for whom He was a little afterwards to work miracles; neither did He rebuke their
laughter, in order that both it and the pipes, and the cymbals, and all the other things, might
be a sure proof of her death. For since for the most part, after the miracles are done, men
disbelieve, He takes them beforehand by their own answers; which was done in the case
both of Lazarus and of Moses. For to Moses first He saith, “What is that in thine hand?”1314in
order that when he saw it become a serpent, He should not forget that it was a rod before,
but being reminded of his own saying, might be amazed at what was done. And with regard
to Lazarus He saith, “Where have ye laid him?”1315that they who had said, “Come and see,”
and “he stinketh, for he hath been dead four days,” might no longer be able to disbelieve
His having raised a dead man.</p>
<p>Seeing then the cymbals and the multitude, He put them all out, and in the presence of
the parents works the miracle; not introducing another soul, but recalling the same that had
gone out, and awakening her as it were out of a sleep.</p>
<p>And He holds her by the hand, assuring the beholders; so as by that sight to make a way
for the belief of her resurrection. For whereas the father said, “Lay thy hand upon her;”1316
He on His part doth somewhat more, for He lays no hand on her, but rather takes hold of
her, and raises her, implying that to Him all things are ready. And He not only raises her
up, but also commands to give her meat, that the event might not seem to be an illusion.
And He doth not give it Himself, but commands them; as also with regard to Lazarus He
said, “Loose him, and let him go,”1317and afterwards makes him partaker of His table.1318
For so is He wont always to establish both points, making out with all completeness the
demonstration alike of the death and of the resurrection.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, not her resurrection only, but also His commanding “to
tell no man;” and by all learn thou this especially, His freedom from haughtiness and
vainglory. And withal learn this other thing also, that He cast them that were beating
themselves out of the house, and declared them unworthy of such a sight; and do not thou
go out with the minstrels, but remain with Peter, and John, and James.</p>

<p>For if He cast them out then, much more now. For then it was not yet manifest that
death was become a sleep, but now this is clearer than the very sun itself. But is it that He
hath not raised thy daughter now? But surely He will raise her, and with more abundant
glory. For that damsel, when she had risen, died again; but thy child, if she rise again, abides
thenceforth in immortal being.</p>
<p>4. Let no man therefore beat himself any more, nor wail, neither disparage Christ’s
achievement. For indeed He overcame death. Why then dost thou wail for nought? The
thing is become a sleep. Why lament and weep? Why, even if Greeks1319did this, they should
be laughed to scorn; but when the believer behaves himself unseemly in these things, what
plea hath he? What excuse will there be for them that are guilty of such folly, and this, after
so long a time, and so clear proof of the resurrection?</p>
<p>But thou, as though laboring to add to the charge against thee, dost also bring us in
heathen women singing dirges, to kindle thy feelings, and to stir up the furnace thoroughly:
and thou hearkenest not to Paul, saying, “What concord hath Christ with Belial? or what
part hath he that believeth with an infidel?”1320</p>
<p>And while the children of heathens, who know nothing of resurrection, do yet find
words of consolation, saying, “Bear it manfully, for it is not possible to undo what hath taken
place, nor to amend it by lamentations;” art not thou, who hearest sayings wiser and better
than these, ashamed to behave thyself more unseemly than they? For we say not at all, “Bear
it manfully, because it is not possible to undo what hath taken place,” but, “bear it manfully,
because he will surely rise again;” the child sleeps and is not dead; he is at rest and hath not
perished. For resurrection will be his final lot, and eternal life, and immortality, and an angel’s
portion. Hearest thou not the Psalm that saith, “Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the
Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee?”1321 God calleth it “bountiful dealing,” and dost thou
make lamentation?</p>
<p>And what more couldest thou have done, if thou wert a foe and an enemy of the dead?
Why, if there must be mourning, it is the devil that ought to mourn. He may beat himself,
he may wail, at our journeying to greater blessings. This lamentation becomes his wickedness,
not thee, who art going to be crowned and to rest. Yea, for death is a fair haven. Consider,
at any rate, with how many evils our present life is filled; reflect how often thou thyself hast
cursed our present life. For indeed things go on to worse, and from the very beginning thou
wert involved in no small condemnation. For, saith He, “In sorrow thou shalt bring forth

children;” and, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread;”1322and, “In the world ye
shall have tribulation.”1323</p>
<p>But of our state there, no such word at all is spoken, but all the contrary; that “grief and
sorrow and sighing have fled away.”1324 And that “men shall come from the east and from
the west, and shall recline in the bosoms of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.”1325 And that
the region there is a spiritual bride-chamber, and bright lamps, and a translation to Heaven.</p>
<p>5. Why then disgrace the departed? Why dispose the rest to fear and tremble at death?
Why cause many to accuse God, as though He had done very dreadful things? Or rather,
why after this invite poor persons, and entreat priests to pray?1326“In order,” saith he, “that
the dead may depart into rest; that he may find the Judge propitious.” For these things then
art thou mourning and wailing? Thou art therefore fighting and warring with thyself: exciting
a storm against thyself on account of his having entered into harbor.</p>
<p>“But what can I do?” saith he: “such a thing is nature.” The blame is not nature’s, neither
doth it belong to the necessary consequence of the thing; but it is we that are turning all
things upside down, are overcome with softness, are giving up our proper nobility, and are
making the unbelievers worse. For how shall we reason with another concerning immortality?
how shall we persuade the heathen, when we fear death, and shudder at it more than he?
Many, for instance, among the Greeks1327although they knew nothing of course about immortality,
have crowned themselves at the decrease of their children, and appeared in white
garments, that they might reap the present glory; but thou not even for the future glory’s
sake ceasest thy woman’s behavior and wailing.</p>
<p>But hast thou no heirs, nor any to succeed to thy goods? And which wouldest thou
rather, that he should be heir of thy possessions, or of Heaven? And which didst thou desire,
that he should succeed to the things that perish, which he must have let go soon after, or to
things that remain, and are immoveable? Thou hadst him not for heir, but God had him

nothing to hinder. For if barbarians burn the goods of the departed together with them,
much more were it a righteous thing for thee to send away with the dead what things he
hath: not to be turned to ashes, like those, but to invest him with more glory; and that if he
departed a sinner, it may do away his sins;1328but if righteous, that it may become an increase
of reward and recompense.</p>
<p>But dost thou long to see him? Then live the same life with him, and thou wilt soon
obtain that sacred vision.</p>
<p>And herewith consider this also, that though thou shouldest not hearken to us, thou
wilt certainly yield to time. But no reward then for thee; for the consolation comes of the
number of the days. Whereas if thou art willing now to command thyself, thou wilt gain
two very great points: first, thou wilt deliver thyself from the intervening ills, next, thou wilt
be crowned with the brighter crown from God. For indeed neither almsgiving nor anything
else is nearly so great as bearing affliction meekly.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, that even the Son of God died: and He indeed for thee, but thou for thyself.
And when He said, “If it be possible, let the cup pass from me,”1329and suffered pain, and
was in agony, nevertheless He shunned not the end, but underwent it, and that with its
whole course of exceeding woe.1330 That is, He did by no means simply endure death, but
the most shameful death; and before His death, stripes; and before His stripes, upbraidings,
and jeers, and revilings; instructing thee to bear all manfully. And though He died, and put
off His body, He resumed it again in greater glory, herein also holding out to thee good
hopes. If these things be not a fable, lament not. If thou account these things to be sure,
weep not; but if thou dost weep, how wilt thou be able to persuade the Greek that thou believest?</p>
<p>6. But even so doth the event still appear intolerable to thee? Well then, for this very
cause it is not meet to lament for him, for he is delivered from many such calamities. Grudge
not therefore against him, neither envy him: for to ask death for yourself because of his
premature end, and to lament for him that he did not live to endure many such things, is
rather the part of one grudging and envying.</p>
<p>And think not of this, that he will no more return home: but that thyself also art a little
while after to go to him. Regard not this, that he returns here no more, but that neither do
these things that are seen remain such as they are, but these too are being transformed. Yea,
<note type="footnote">1328 Not that St. Chrysostom imagined that anything could be done to change the relative condition of those
who have died in the favor or displeasure of God: see e.g., Hom. XXXVI. p. 506, ed. Field. Indeed, the same is
implied in the words which immediately follow. “Dost thou long to see him? Then live the same life with him,”

for heaven, and earth, and sea, and all, are being put together afresh,1331and then shalt thou
recover thy child in greater glory.</p>
<p>And if indeed he departed a sinner, his wickedness is stayed; for certainly, had God
known that he was being converted, He would not have snatched him away before his repentance:
but if he ended his life righteous, he now possesses all good in safety. Whence it
is manifest that thy tears are not of kindly affection, but of unreasoning passion. For if thou
lovedst the departed, thou shouldest rejoice and be glad that he is delivered from the present
waves.</p>
<p>For what is there more, I pray thee? What is there fresh and new? Do we not see the
same things daily revolving? Day and night, night and day, winter and summer, summer
and winter, and nothing more. And these indeed are ever the same; but our evils are fresh,
and newer. Wouldest thou then have him every day drawing up more of these things, and
abiding here, and sickening, and mourning, and in fear and trembling, and enduring some
of the ills of life, dreading others lest he some time endure them? Since assuredly thou canst
not say this, that one sailing over this great sea might possibly be free from despondency
and cares, and from all other such things.</p>
<p>And withal take this also into account, that thou didst not bring him forth immortal;
and that if he had not died now, he must have endured it soon after. But is it that thou hadst
not thy fill of him? But thou wilt of a certainty enjoy him there. But longest thou to see him
here also? And what is there to hinder thee? For thou art permitted even here, if thou be
watchful; for the hope of the things to come is clearer than sight.</p>
<p>But thou, if he were in some king’s court wouldest not ever seek to see him, so long as
thou heardest of his good report: and seeing him departed to the things that are far better,
art thou faint-hearted about a little time; and that, when thou hast in his place one to dwell
with thee?</p>
<p>But hast thou no husband? yet hast thou a consolation, even the Father of the orphans,
and Judge of the widows. Hear even Paul pronouncing this widowhood blessed, and saying,
“Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in the Lord.”1332 Because such an
one will appear more approved, evincing as she doth greater patience. Mourn not therefore
for that which is thy crown, that for which thou demandest a reward.</p>
<p>Since thou hast also restored His deposit, if thou hast exhibited the very thing entrusted
to thee. Be not in care any more, having laid up the possession in an inviolable treasurehouse.</p>

<p>But if thou wouldest really learn, both what is our present being, and what our life to
come; and that the one is a spider’s web and a shadow, but the things there, all of them,
immoveable and immortal; thou wouldest not after that want other arguments. For whereas
now thy child is delivered from all change; if he were here, perhaps he might continue good,
perhaps not so. Seest thou not how many openly cast off1333their own children? how many
are constrained to keep them at home, although worse than the open outcasts?</p>
<p>Let us make account of all these things and practise self-command; for so shall we at
once show regard to the deceased, and enjoy much praise from men, and receive from God
the great rewards of patience, and attain unto the good things eternal; unto which may we

<head>Homily XXXII.</head>
<p>Matt. IX. 27-30.</p>
<p>“And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed Him, crying, and saying, Thou Son
of David, have mercy on us.1334And when He was come into the house, the blind men
came to Him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say
unto Him, Yea, Lord. Then touched He their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
it1335unto you. And their eyes were opened.”</p>
<p>Wherefore can it be that He puts them off,1336and they crying out? Here again teaching
us utterly to repel the glory that cometh from the multitude. For because the house was
near, He leads them thither to heal them in private. And this is evident from the fact, that
He charged them moreover to tell no man.</p>
<p>But this is no light charge against the Jews; when these men, though their eyes were
struck out, receive the faith by hearing alone, but they beholding the miracles, and having
their sight to witness what was happening, do all just contrary. And see their earnestness
also, both by their cry, and by their prayer itself. For they did not merely approach Him,
but with loud cries, and alleging nought else but “mercy.”</p>
<p>And they called Him “Son of David,” because the name was thought to be honorable.
In many passages, for instance, did the prophets1337likewise so call the kings, whom they
wished to honor, and to declare great.</p>
<p>And having brought them into the house, He puts to them a further question. For in
many cases He made a point of healing on entreaty, lest any should suppose Him to be
rushing1338upon these miracles through vainglory: and not on this account alone, but to
indicate also that they deserve healing, and that no one should say, “If it was of mere mercy
that He saved, all men ought to be saved.” For even His love to man hath a kind of proportion;
depending on the faith of them that are healed. But not for these causes only doth He require
faith of them, but forasmuch as they called Him “Son of David,” He to lead them up to what
is higher, and to teach them to entertain the imaginations they ought of Himself, saith,
“Believe ye that I am able to do this?” He did not say, “Believe ye that I am able to entreat
my Father, that I am able to pray” but, “that I am able to do this?”</p>

<pb n="375"/>
<p>What then is their word? “Yea, Lord.” They call Him no more Son of David, but soar
higher, and acknowledge His dominion.</p>
<p>And then at last He for His part lays His hand upon them, saying, “According to your
faith be it unto you.” And this He doth to confirm their faith, and to show that they are
participators in the good work, and to witness that their words were not words of flattery.
For neither did He say, “Let your eyes be opened,” but, “According to your faith be it unto
you;” which He saith to many of them that came unto Him; before the healing of their
bodies, hastening to proclaim the faith in their soul; so as both to make them more approved,
and to render others more serious.</p>
<p>Thus with respect to the sick of the palsy also; for there too before giving nerve to the
body, He raises up the fallen soul, saying, “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven
thee.”1339 And the young damsel too, when He had raised her up, He detained, and by the
food taught her her Benefactor; and in the case of the centurion also He did in like manner,
leaving the whole to his faith; and as to His disciples again, when delivering them from the
storm on the sea, He delivered them first from their want of faith. Just so likewise in this
case: He knew indeed, even before their cry, the secrets of their mind; but that He might
lead on others also to the same earnestness, He makes them known to the rest as well, by
the result of their cure proclaiming their hidden faith.</p>
<p>Then after their cure He commands them to tell no man; neither doth He merely command
them, but with much strictness.</p>
<p>“For Jesus,” it is said, “straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. But they,
when they were departed, spread abroad His fame in all that country.”1340</p>
<p>They however did not endure this, but became preachers, and evangelists; and when
bidden to hide what had been done, they endured it not.</p>
<p>And if in another place we find Him saying, “Go thy way, and declare the glory of
God,”1341that is not contrary to this, but even highly in agreement herewith. For He instructs
us to say nothing ourselves, concerning ourselves, but even to forbid them that would eulogise
us: but if the glory be referred to God, then not only not to forbid, but to command men to
do this.</p>
<p>2. “And as they went out,” it is said, “behold, they brought unto Him a dumb man possessed
with a devil.”1342</p>
<p>For the affliction was not natural, but the device of the evil spirit; wherefore also he
needs others to bring him. For he could neither make entreaty himself, being speechless,

<pb n="376"/>
nor supplicate others, when the evil spirit had bound his tongue, and together with his
tongue had fettered his soul.</p>
<p>For this cause neither doth He require faith of him, but straightway heals the disease.</p>
<p>“For when the devil was cast out,” it saith, “the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled,</p>
<p>saying, It was never so seen in Israel.”1343</p>
<p>Now this especially vexed the Pharisees, that they preferred Him to all, not only that
then were, but that had ever been. And they preferred Him, not for His healing, but for His
doing it easily and quickly, and to diseases innumerable and incurable.</p>
<p>And thus the multitude; but the Pharisees quite contrariwise; not only disparaging the
works, but saying things contradictory to themselves, and not ashamed. Such a thing is
wickedness. For what say they?</p>
<p>“He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.”1344</p>
<p>What can be more foolish than this? For in the first place, as He also saith further on,
it is impossible that a devil should cast out a devil, for that being is wont to repair what be-
longs to himself, not to pull it down. But He did not cast out devils only, but also cleansed
lepers, and raised the dead, and curbed the sea, and remitted sins, and preached the kingdom,
and brought men unto the Father; things which a demon would never either choose, or at
any time be able to effect. For the devils bring men to idols, and withdraw them from God,
and persuade them to disbelieve the life to come. The devil doth not bestow kindness when
he is insulted; forasmuch as even when not insulted, he harms those that court and honor
him.</p>
<p>But He doeth the contrary. For after these their insults and revilings,</p>
<p>3. “He went about,” it is said, “all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues,
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease.”1345</p>
<p>And so far from punishing them for their insensibility, He did not even simply rebuke
them; at once both evincing His meekness, and so refuting the calumny; and at the same
time minded also by the signs which followed to exhibit His proof more completely: and
then to adduce also the refutation by words. He went about therefore both in cities, and in
countries, and in their synagogues; instructing us to requite our calumniators, not with fresh
calumnies, but with greater benefits. Since, if not for man’s sake, but God’s, thou doest good
to thy fellow-servants; whatsoever they may do, leave not thou off doing them good, that
thy reward may be greater; since he surely, who upon their calumny leaves off his doing

good, signifies that for their praise’ sake, not for God’s sake, he applies himself to that kind
of virtue.</p>
<p>For this cause Christ, to teach us that of mere goodness He had entered on this, so far
from waiting for the sick to come to Him, of Himself hastened unto them, bearing them
two of the greatest blessings; one, the gospel of the kingdom; another, the perfect cure of all
their diseases. And not a city did He overlook, not a village did He hasten by, but visited
every place.</p>
<p>4. And not even at this doth He stop, but He exhibits also another instance of His forethought.
That is,</p>
<p>“When He saw,” it is said, “the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them,
because they were troubled,1346and scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then
saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few, pray ye
therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.”1347</p>
<p>See again His freedom from vainglory. That He may not draw all men unto Himself,
He sends out His disciples.</p>
<p>And not with this view only, but that He might also teach them, after practising in
Palestine, as in a sort of training-school, to strip themselves for their conflicts with the world.
For this purpose then He makes the exercises even more serious than the actual conflicts,
so far as pertained to their own virtue; that they might more easily engage in the struggles
that were to ensue; as it were a sort of tender nestlings whom He was at length leading out
to fly. And for the present He makes them physicians of bodies, dispensing to them afterwards
the cure of the soul, which is the principal thing.</p>
<p>And mark how He points out the facility and necessity of the thing. For what saith He?
“The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.” That is, “not to the sowing,” saith
He, “but to the reaping do I send you.” Which in John He expressed by, “Other men labored,
and ye are entered into their labors.”1348</p>
<p>And these things he said, at once repressing their pride, and preparing them to be of
good courage, and signifying that the greater part of the labor came first.</p>
<p>And contemplate Him here too beginning from love to man, not with any requital. “For
He had compassion, because they were troubled and scattered abroad as sheep having no
shepherd.” This is His charge against the rulers of the Jews, that being shepherds they acted
the part of wolves. For so far from amending the multitude, they even marred their progress.

<pb n="378"/>
For instance, when they were marvelling and saying, “It was never so seen in Israel:” these
were affirming the contrary, “He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.”1349</p>
<p>But of what laborers doth He speak here? Of the twelve disciples. What then? whereas
He had said, “But the laborers are few,” did He add to their number? By no means, but He
sent them out alone. Wherefore then did He say, “Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that He
would1350send forth laborers into His harvest;” and made no addition to their number?
Because though they were but twelve, He made them many from that time forward, not by
adding to their number, but by giving them power.</p>
<p>Then to signify how great the gift is, He saith, “Pray ye the Lord of the harvest;” and
indirectly declares it to be His own prerogative. For after having said, “Pray ye the Lord of
the harvest;” when they had not made any entreaty nor prayer, He Himself at once ordains
them, reminding them also of the sayings of John,1351of the threshing floor, and of the
Person winnowing, and of the chaff, and of the wheat. Whence it is evident that Himself is
the husbandman, Himself the Lord of the harvest, Himself the master and owner of the
prophets. For if He sent them to reap, clearly it was not to reap what belongs to another,
but what Himself had sown by the prophets.</p>
<p>But not in this way only was He indirectly encouraging them, in calling their ministry
a harvest; but also by making them able for the ministry.</p>
<p>“And when He had called unto Him,” it saith, “His twelve disciples, He gave them power
against1352unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness, and all
manner of disease.”1353</p>
<p>Still the Spirit was not yet given. For “there was not yet,” it saith, “a Spirit, because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.”1354 How then did they cast out the spirits? By His command,
by His authority.</p>
<p>And mark, I pray thee, also, how well timed was the mission. For not at the beginning
did He send them; but when they had enjoyed sufficiently the advantage of following Him,
and had seen a dead person raised, and the sea rebuked, and devils expelled, and a paralytic
new-strung, and sins remitted, and a leper cleansed, and had received a sufficient proof of
His power, both by deeds and words, then He sends them forth: and not to dangerous acts,

<pb n="379"/>
for as yet there was no danger in Palestine, but they had only to stand against evil speakings.
However, even of this He forewarns them, I mean of their perils; preparing them even before
the time, and making them feel as in conflict by His continual predictions of that sort.</p>
<p>5. Then, since He had mentioned to us two pairs of apostles, that of Peter, and that of
John, and after those had pointed out the calling of Matthew, but had said nothing to us
either of the calling or of the name of the other apostles; here of necessity He sets down the
list of them, and their number, and makes known their names, saying thus:</p>
<p>“Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; first, Simon, who is called Peter.”1355</p>
<p>Because there was also another Simon, the Canaanite; and there was Judas Iscariot, and
Judas the brother of James; and James the son of Alphæus, and James the son of Zebedee.</p>
<p>Now Mark doth also put them according to their dignity; for after the two leaders, He
then numbers Andrew; but our evangelist not so, but without distinction; or rather He sets
before himself even Thomas who came far short of him.</p>
<p>But let us look at the list of them from the beginning.</p>
<p>“First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother.”</p>
<p>Even this is no small praise. For the one he named from his virtue, the other from his
high kindred, which was in conformity to his disposition.</p>
<p>Then, “James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He arranges them not according to their dignity. For to me John seems
to be greater, not only than the others, but even than his brother.</p>
<p>After this, when he had said, “Philip, and Bartholomew,” he added, “Thomas, and
Matthew the Publican.”1356</p>
<p>But Luke not so, but in the opposite order, and he puts him before Thomas.</p>
<p>Next, “James the son of Alphæus.” For there was, as I have already said, the son of
Zebedee also. Then after having mentioned “Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus,”
1357and “Simon” Zelotes, whom he calls also “the Canaanite,” he comes to the traitor.
And not as a sort of enemy or foe, but as one writing a history, so hath he described him.
He saith not, “the unholy, the all unholy one,” but hath named him from his city, “Judas
Iscariot.” Because there was also another Judas, “Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus,”
who, Luke saith, was the brother of James, saying, “Judas the brother of James.”1358 Therefore
to distinguish him from this man, it saith, “Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.”1359 And

he is not ashamed to say, “who also betrayed Him.” So far were they from ever disguising
aught even of those things that seem to be matters of reproach.</p>
<p>And first of all, and leader of the choir,1360is the “unlearned, the ignorant man.”1361</p>
<p>But let us see whither, and to whom, He sends them.</p>
<p>“These twelve,” it is said, “Jesus sent forth.”1362</p>
<p>What manner of men were these? The fishermen, the publicans: for indeed four were
fishermen and two publicans, Matthew and James, and one was even a traitor. And what
saith He to them? He presently charges them, saying,</p>
<p>“Go not into the way1363of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”1364</p>
<p>“For think not at all,” saith He, “because they insult me, and call me demoniac, that I
hate them and turn away from them. Nay, as I sought earnestly to amend them in the first
place, so keeping you away from all the rest, to them do I send you as teachers and physicians.
And I not only forbid you to preach to others before these, but I do not suffer you so much
as to touch upon the road that leads thither, nor to enter into such a city.” Because the
Samaritans too are in a state of enmity with the Jews. And yet it was an easier thing to deal
with them, for they were much more favorably disposed to the faith; but the case of these
was more difficult. But for all this, He sends them on the harder task, indicating his guardian
care of them, and stopping the mouths of the Jews, and preparing the way for the teaching
of the apostles, that people might not hereafter blame them for “entering in to men uncircumcised,”
1365and think they had a just cause for shunning and abhorring them. And he
calls them “lost,” not “stray,” “sheep,” in every way contriving how to excuse them, and
winning their mind to himself.</p>
<p>6. “And as ye go,” saith He, “preach, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”1366</p>
<p>Seest thou the greatness of their ministry? Seest thou the dignity of apostles? Of nothing
that is the object of sense are they commanded to speak, nor such as Moses spake of, and
the prophets before them, but of some new and strange things. For while the former preached
no such things, but earth, and the good things in the earth, these preached the kingdom of
Heaven, and whatever is there.</p>

<p>And not from this circumstance only were these the greater, but also from their obedience:
in that they shrink not, nor are they backward, like those of old;1367but, warned as
they are of perils, and wars, and of those insupportable evils, they receive with great obedience
His injunctions, as being heralds of a kingdom.</p>
<p>“And what marvel,” saith one, “if having nothing to preach that is dismal or grievous,
they readily obeyed?” What sayest thou? nothing grievous enjoined them? Dost thou not
hear of the prisons, the executions, the civil wars, the hatred of all men? all which, He said
a little while after, they must undergo. True, as to other men, He sent them to be procurers
and heralds of innumerable blessings: but for themselves, He said and proclaimed beforehand,
that they were to suffer terrible and incurable ills.</p>
<p>After this, to make them trustworthy,1368 He saith,</p>
<p>“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,1369cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”</p>
<p>See how He provides for their conduct, and that no less than for their miracles, implying
that the miracles without this are nothing. Thus He both quells their pride by saying, “Freely
ye have received, freely give;” and takes order for their being clear of covetousness. Moreover,
lest it should be thought their own work,1370and they be lifted up by the signs that were
wrought, He saith, “freely ye have received.” “Ye bestow no favor on them that receive you,
for not for a price did ye receive these things, nor after toil: for the grace is mine. In like
manner therefore give ye to them also, for there is no finding a price worthy of them.”</p>
<p>7. After this plucking up immediately the root of the evils,1371 He saith,</p>
<p>“Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey,
neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a staff.”1372</p>
<p>He said not, “take them not with you,” but, “even if you can obtain them from another,
flee the evil disease.” And you see that hereby He was answering many good pur poses; first
setting His disciples above suspicion; secondly, freeing them from all care, so that they might
give all their leisure to the word; thirdly, teaching them His own power. Of this accordingly
He quite speaks out to them afterwards, “Lacked ye anything, when I sent you naked and
unshod?”1373</p>

<p>He did not at once say, “Provide not,” but when He had said, “Cleanse the lepers, cast
out devils,” then He said, “Provide nothing; freely ye have received, freely give;” by His way
of ordering things consulting at once for their interest, their credit, and their ability.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one may say, that the rest may not be unaccountable, but “not to have
a scrip for the journey, neither two coats, nor a staff, nor shoes,” why did He enjoin this?
Being minded to train them up unto all perfection; since even further back, He had suffered
them not to take thought so much as for the next day. For even to the whole world He was
to send them out as teachers. Therefore of men He makes them even angels (so to speak);
releasing them from all worldly care, so that they should be possessed with one care alone,
that of their teaching; or rather even from that He releases them, saying, “Take no thought
how or what ye shall speak.”1374</p>
<p>And thus, what seems to be very grievous and galling, this He shows to be especially
light and easy for them. For nothing makes men so cheerful as being freed from anxiety and
care; and especially when it is granted them, being so freed, to lack nothing, God being
present, and becoming to them instead of all things.</p>
<p>Next, lest they should say, “whence then are we to obtain our necessary food?” He saith
not unto them, “Ye have heard that I have told you before, ‘Behold the fowls of the
air;’”1375(for they were not yet able to realise1376this commandment in their actions); but
He added what came far short of this, saying, “For the workman is worthy of his
meat;”1377declaring that they must be nourished by their disciples, that neither they might
be high minded towards those whom they were teaching, as though giving all and receiving
nothing at their hands; nor these again break away, as being despised by their teachers.</p>
<p>After this, that they may not say, “Dost thou then command us to live by begging?” and
be ashamed of this, He signifies the thing to be a debt, both by calling them “workmen,”
and by terming what was given, “hire.”1378 For “think not,” saith He, “because the labor is
in words, that the benefit conferred by you is small; nay, for the thing hath much toil; and
whatsoever they that are taught may give, it is not a free gift which they bestow, but a recompence
which they render: “for the workman is worthy of his meat.” But this He said, not as
declaring so much to be the worth of the apostles’ labors, far from it; God forbid: but as
both making it a law for them to seek nothing more, and as convincing the givers, that what
they do is not an act of liberality, but a debt.</p>

<p>8. “And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy: and
there abide till ye go thence.”1379</p>
<p>That is, “it follows not,” saith He, “from my saying, ‘The workman is worthy of his
meat,’ that I have opened to you all men’s doors: but herein also do I require you to use
much circumspection. For this will profit you both in respect of your credit, and for your
very maintenance. For if he is worthy, he will surely give you food; more especially when
ye ask nothing beyond mere necessaries.”</p>
<p>And He not only requires them to seek out worthy persons, but also not to change house
for house, whereby they would neither vex him that is receiving them, nor themselves get
the character of gluttony and self-indulgence.1380 For this He declared by saying, “There
abide till ye go thence.” And this one may perceive from the other evangelists also.1381</p>
<p>Seest thou how He made them honorable by this also, and those that received them
careful; by signifying that they rather are the gainers, both in honor, and in respect of advantage?
Then pursuing again the same subject, He saith,</p>
<p>“And when ye come into an house, salute it. And if the house be worthy, let your peace
come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.”1382
Seest thou how far He declines not to carry His injunctions? And very fitly. For as
champions of godliness, and preachers to the whole world, was He training them. And in
that regard disposing them to practise moderation, and making them objects of love, He
saith,</p>
<p>“And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that
house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.”1383</p>
<p>That is, “do not,” saith He, “because ye are teachers, therefore wait to be saluted by
others, but be first in showing that respect.” Then, implying that this is not a mere salutation,
but a blessing, He saith, “If the house be worthy, it shall come upon it,” but if it deal insolently,
its first punishment will be, not to have the benefit of your peace; and the second, that it
shall suffer the doom of Sodom.” “And what,” it will be said, “is their punishment to us?”
Ye will have the houses of such as are worthy.</p>

<p>But what means, “Shake off the dust of your feet?” It is either to signify their having received
nothing of them, or to be a witness to them of the long journey, which they had
travelled for their sake.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how He doth not even yet give the whole to them. For neither
doth He as yet bestow upon them foreknowledge, so as to learn who is worthy, and who is
not so; but He bids them inquire, and await the trial. How then did He Himself abide with
a publican? Because he was become worthy by his conversion.</p>
<p>And mark, I pray thee, how when He had stripped them of all, He gave them all, by
suffering them to abide in the houses of those who became disciples, and to enter therein,
having nothing. For thus both themselves were freed from anxiety, and they would convince
the others, that for their salvation only are they come; first by bringing in nothing with them,
then by requiring no more of them than necessaries, lastly, by not entering all their houses
without distinction.</p>
<p>Since not by the signs only did He desire them to appear illustrious, but even before the
signs, by their own virtue. For nothing so much characterizes strictness of life,1384as to be
free from superfluities, and so far as may be, from wants. This even the false apostles knew.
Wherefore Paul also said, “That wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.”1385</p>
<p>But if when we are in a strange country, and are going unto persons unknown to us, we
must seek nothing more than our food for the day, much more when abiding at home.</p>
<p>9. These things let us not hear only, but also imitate. For not of the apostles alone are
they said, but also of the saints afterwards. Let us therefore become worthy to entertain
them. For according to the disposition of the entertainers this peace both comes and flies
away again. For not only on the courageous speaking of them that teach, but also on the
worthiness of them that receive, doth this effect follow.</p>
<p>Neither let us account it a small loss, not to enjoy such peace. For this peace the
prophet also from of old proclaims, saying, “How beautiful are the feet of them that bring
good tidings of peace.”1386 Then to explain the value thereof he added, “That bring good
tidings of good things.”</p>
<p>This peace Christ also declared to be great, when He said, “Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you.”1387 And we should do all things, so as to enjoy it, both at home and
in church. For in the very church too the presiding minister gives peace.1388 And this which

we speak of is a type of that. And you should receive it with all alacrity, in heart1389before
the actual communion.1390 For if not to impart it after the communion1391be disgusting,
how much more disgusting to repel from you him that pronounces it!</p>
<p>For thee the presbyter sits, for thee the teacher stands, laboring and toiling. What plea
then wilt thou have, for not affording him so much welcome as to listen to Him? For indeed
the church is the common home of all, and when ye have first occupied it, we enter in,
strictly observing the type which they exhibited. For this cause we also pronounce “peace”
in common to all, directly as we enter, according to that law.</p>
<p>Let no one therefore be careless, no one inattentive,1392when the priests have entered
in and are teaching; for there is really no small punishment appointed for this. Yea, and I
for one would rather enter into any of your houses ten thousand times, and find myself
baffled, than not be heard when I speak here. This latter is to me harder to bear than the
other, by how much this house is of greater dignity; our great possessions being verily laid
up here, here all the hopes we have. For what is here, that is not great and awful? Thus both
this table is far more precious and delightful than the other,1393and this candlestick than
the candlestick there. And this they know, as many as have put away diseases by anointing
themselves with oil1394in faith and in due season. And this coffer too is far better and more
<note type="footnote">given peace to all; and the priests, when about to consecrate, first make this prayer for you, and so begin the
blessing: and the deacon also, when he bids you pray, joins this with the rest as matter of your prayer, that you
should ask for the angel of peace, and that all the things set before you should be for your peace: also in dismissing
you from this assembly, this is what he implores for you, saying, ‘Depart in peace.’ And in a word, we may not
say or do any thing without this peace.” See also Bingham, 14, 4, 6; 4, 14; 15, 3, 1, 2; and the authors quoted by
him, especially St. Chrysostom in various places: from which it is evident that “the table” here means the holy
table, and that his argument is, “We should receive our brethren’s salutations as home and elsewhere with a
brotherly mind, that we may be fit to impart to him the kiss of peace in the holy mysteries: the one is a type of,
and a preparation for, the other: as was the salutation here enjoined to the apostles. Especially ought we to be
ready and attentive at the many salutations which the ministers offer to us in the earlier part of the service, that
we may lose none of the benefit of that mysterious salutation which we know will come in the end and most
awful part of it.”</note>

indispensable than that other chest; for it hath not clothes but alms shut up in it; even though
they be few that own them. Here too is a couch better than that other; for the repose of the
divine Scriptures is more delightful than any couch.</p>
<p>And had we attained to excellence in respect of concord, then had we no other home
beside this. And that there is nothing over-burdensome in this saying, the “three thousand,”
1395bear witness, and the “five thousand,”1396who had but one home, one table, one
soul; for “the multitude of them that believed,” we read, “were of one heart and of one
soul.”1397 But since we fall far short of their virtue, and dwell scattered in our several homes,
let us at least, when we meet here, be earnest in so doing. Because though in all other things
we be destitute and poor, yet in these we are rich. Wherefore here at least receive us with
love when we come in unto you. And when I say, “Peace be unto you,”1398and ye say, “And
with thy spirit,” say it not with the voice only, but also with the mind; not in mouth, but in
understanding also. But if, while here thou sayest, “Peace also to thy spirit,” out of doors
thou art mine enemy, spitting at and calumniating me, and secretly aspersing me with innumerable
reproaches; what manner of peace is this?</p>
<p>For I indeed, though thou speak evil of me ten thousand times, give thee that peace with
a pure heart, with sincerity of purpose, and I can say nothing evil at any time of thee; for I
have a father’s bowels. And if I rebuke thee at any time, I do it out of concern for thee. But
as for thee, by thy secret carping at me, and not receiving me in the Lord’s house, I fear lest
thou shouldest in return add to my despondency; not for thine insulting me, not for thy
casting me out, but for thy rejecting our peace, and drawing down upon thyself that grievous
punishment.</p>
<p>For though I shake not off the dust, though I turn not away, what is threatened remains
unchanged. For I indeed oftentimes pronounce peace to you, and will not cease from continually
speaking it; and if, besides your insults, ye receive me not, even then I shake not off
the dust; not that I am disobedient to our Lord, but that I vehemently burn for you. And
besides, I have suffered nothing at all for you; I have neither come a long journey, nor with

that garb and that voluntary poverty am I come (therefore we first blame ourselves), nor
without shoes and a second coat; and perhaps this is why ye also fail of your part. However,
this is not a sufficient plea for you; but while our condemnation is greater, to you it imparts
no excuse.</p>
<p>10. Then the houses were churches, but now the church is become a house. Then one
might say nothing worldly in a house, now one may say nothing spiritual in a church, but
even here ye bring in the business from the market place, and while God is discoursing, ye
leave off listening in silence to His sayings, and bring in the contrary things, and make discord.
And I would it were your own affairs, but now the things which are nothing to you,
those ye both speak and hear.</p>
<p>For this I lament, and will not cease lamenting. For I have no power to quit this house,
but here we must needs remain until we depart from this present life. “Receive
us”1399therefore, as Paul commanded. For his language in that place related not to a meal,
but to the temper and mind. This we also seek of you, even love, that fervent and genuine
affection. But if ye endure not even this, at least love yourselves, and lay aside your present
remissness. This is sufficient for our consolation, if we see you approving yourselves, and
becoming better men. So will I also myself show forth increased love, even “though the more
abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.”1400</p>
<p>For indeed there are many things to bind us together. One table is set before all, one
Father begat us, we are all the issue of the same throes, the same drink hath been given to
all; or rather not only the same drink, but also to drink out of one cup. For our Father desiring
to lead us to a kindly affection, hath devised this also, that we should drink out of one cup;
a thing which belongs to intense love.</p>
<p>But “there is no comparison between the apostles and us.” I confess it too, and would
never deny it. For I say not, to themselves, but not even to their shadows are we comparable.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, let your part be done. This will have no tendency to disgrace you but
rather to profit you the more. For when even to unworthy persons ye show so much love
and obedience, then shall ye receive the greater reward.</p>
<p>For neither are they our own words which we speak, since ye have no teacher at all on
earth; but what we have received, that we also give, and in giving we seek for nothing else
from you, but to be loved only. And if we be unworthy even of this, yet by our loving you
we shall quickly be worthy. Although we are commanded to love not them only that love
us, but even our enemies. Who then is so hardhearted, who so savage, that after having re-

ceived such a law, he should abhor and hate even them that love him, full as he may be of
innumerable evils?</p>
<p>We have partaken of a spiritual table, let us be partakers also of spiritual love. For if
robbers, on partaking of salt, forget their character; what excuse shall we have, who are
continually partaking of the Lord’s body, and do not imitate even their gentleness? And yet
to many, not one table only, but even to be of one city, hath sufficed for friendship; but we,
when we have the same city, and the same house, and table, and way, and door, and root,
and life, and head, and the same shepherd, and king, and teacher, and judge, and maker,
and father, and to whom all things are common; what indulgence can we deserve, if we be
divided one from another?</p>
<p>11. But the miracles, perhaps, are what ye seek after, such as they wrought when they
entered in; the lepers cleansed, the devils driven out, and the dead raised? Nay, but this is
the great indication of your high birth, and of your love, that ye should believe God without
pledges. And in fact this, and one other thing, were the reasons why God made miracles to
cease. I mean, that if when miracles are not performed, they that plume themselves on other
advantages,—for instance, either on the word of wisdom, or on show of piety,—grow vainglorious,
are puffed up, are separated one from another; did miracles also take place, how
could there but be violent rendings? And that what I say is not mere conjecture, the Corinthians
bear witness, who from this cause were divided into many parties.</p>
<p>Do not thou therefore seek signs, but the soul’s health. Seek not to see one dead man
raised; nay, for thou hast learnt that the whole world is arising. Seek not to see a blind man
healed, but behold all now restored unto that better and more profitable sight; and do thou
too learn to look chastely, and amend thine eye.</p>
<p>For in truth, if we all lived as we ought, workers of miracles would not be admired so
much as we by the children of the heathen. For as to the signs, they often carry with them
either a notion of mere fancy, or another evil suspicion, although ours be not such. But a
pure life cannot admit of any such reproach; yea, all men’s mouths are stopped by the acquisition
of virtue.</p>
<p>Let virtue then be our study: for abundant are her riches, and great the wonder wrought
in her. She bestows the true freedom, and causes the same to be discerned even in slavery,
not releasing from slavery, but while men continue slaves, exhibiting them more honorable
than freemen; which is much more than giving them freedom: not making the poor man
rich, but while he continues poor, exhibiting him wealthier than the rich.</p>
<p>But if thou wouldest work miracles also, be rid of transgressions, and thou hast quite
accomplished it. Yea, for sin is a great demon, beloved; and if thou exterminate this, thou
hast wrought a greater thing than they who drive out ten thousand demons. Do thou listen
to Paul, how he speaks, and prefers virtue to miracles. “But covet earnestly,” saith he, “the

<pb n="389"/>
best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way.”1401 And when he was to declare
this “way,” he spoke not of raising the dead, not of cleansing of lepers, not of any other such
thing; but in place of all these he set charity. Hearken also unto Christ, saying, “Rejoice not
that the demons obey you, but that your names are written in Heaven.”1402 And again before
this, “Many will say to me in that day, Have we not prophesied in Thy name, and cast out
devils, and done many mighty works, and then I will profess unto them, I know you not.”1403
And when He was about to be crucified, He called His disciples, and said unto them, “By
this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,” not “if ye cast out devils,” but “if ye have
love one to another.”1404 And again, “Hereby shall all men know that Thou hast sent me;”
not “if these men raise the dead,” but, “if they be one.”1405</p>
<p>For, as to miracles, they oftentimes, while they profited another, have injured him who
had the power, by lifting him up to pride and vainglory, or haply in some other way: but in
our works there is no place for any such suspicion, but they profit both such as follow them,
and many others.</p>
<p>These then let us perform with much diligence. For if thou change from inhumanity to
almsgiving, thou hast stretched forth the hand that was withered. If thou withdraw from
theatres and go to the church, thou hast cured the lame foot. If thou draw back thine eyes
from an harlot, and from beauty not thine own, thou hast opened them when they were
blind. If instead of satanical songs, thou hast learnt spiritual psalms, being dumb, thou hast
spoken.</p>
<p>These are the greatest miracles, these the wonderful signs. If we go on working these
signs, we shall both ourselves be a great and admirable sort of persons through these, and
shall win over all the wicked unto virtue, and shall enjoy the life to come; unto which may
we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

them from all worldly things, and enfranchising them from all temporal care: He
speaks in what follows of the evils also that were to befall them; not only those that were to
happen soon after, but those too that were to be in long course of time; from the first, even
long beforehand, preparing them for the war against the devil. Yea, and many advantages
were hence secured; and first, that they learnt the power of His foreknowledge; secondly,
that no one should suspect, that through weakness of their Master came these evils upon
them; thirdly, that such as undergo these things should not be dismayed by their falling out
unexpectedly, and against hope; fourthly, that they might not at the very time of the cross
be troubled on hearing these things. For indeed, they were just so affected at that time; when
also He upbraided them, saying, “Because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
filled your hearts; and none of you asketh me, whither goest Thou?”1406 And yet He had
said nothing as yet touching Himself, as that He should be bound, and scourged, and put
to death, that He might not hereby also confound their minds; but for the present He announces
before what should happen to themselves.</p>
<p>Then, that they might learn that this system of war is new, and the manner of the array
unwonted; as He sends them bare, and with one coat, and unshod, and without staff, and
without girdle or scrip, and bids them be maintained by such as receive them; so neither
here did He stay His speech, but to signify His unspeakable power, He saith, “Even thus
setting out, exhibit the gentleness of “sheep,” and this, though ye are to go unto “wolves;”
and not simply unto wolves, but “into the midst of wolves.”</p>
<p>And He bids them have not only gentleness as sheep, but also the harmlessness of the
dove. “For thus shall I best show forth my might, when sheep get the better of wolves, and
<note type="footnote">1406 John xvi. 6, 5.</note>

<pb n="391"/>
being in the midst of wolves, and receiving a thousand bites, so far from being consumed,
do even work a change on them a thing far greater and more marvellous than killing them,
to alter their spirit, and to reform their mind; and this, being only twelve, while the whole
world is filled with the wolves.”</p>
<p>Let us then be ashamed, who do the contrary, who set like wolves upon our enemies.
For so long as we are sheep, we conquer: though ten thousand wolves prowl around, we
overcome and prevail. But if we become wolves, we are worsted, for the help of our Shepherd
departs from us: for He feeds not wolves, but sheep: and He forsakes thee, and retires, for
neither dost thou allow His might to be shown. Because, as He accounts the whole triumph
His own, if thou being ill used, show forth gentleness; so if thou follow it up and give blows,
thou obscurest His victory.</p>
<p>2. But do thou consider, I pray thee, who they are that hear these injunctions, so hard
and laborious: the timid and ignorant; the unlettered and uninstructed; such as are in every
respect obscure, who have never been trained up in the Gentile laws, who do not readily
present themselves in the public places; the fishermen, the publicans, men full of innumerable
deficiencies. For if these things were enough to confound even the lofty and great, how were
they not enough to cast down and dismay them that were in all respects untried, and had
never entertained any noble imagination? But they did not cast them down.</p>
<p>“And very naturally,” some one may perhaps say; “because He gave them power to
cleanse lepers, to drive out devils.” I would answer as follows: Nay, this very thing was
enough especially to perplex them, that for all their raising the dead, they were to undergo
these intolerable evils, both judgments, and executions, and the wars which all would wage
on them, and the common hatred of the world; and that such terrors await them, while
themselves are working miracles.</p>
<p>3. What then is their consolation for all these things? The power of Him that sends
them. Wherefore also He puts this before all, saying, “Behold, I send you.” This suffices for
your encouragement, this for confidence, and fearing none of your assailants.</p>
<p>Seest thou authority? seest thou prerogative? seest thou invincible might? Now His
meaning is like this: “Be not troubled” (so He speaks), “that sending you among wolves, I
command you to be like sheep and like doves. For I might indeed have done the contrary,
and have suffered you to undergo nothing terrible, nor as sheep to be exposed to wolves; I
might have rendered you more formidable than lions; but it is expedient that so it should
be. This makes you also more glorious; this proclaims also my power.”</p>
<p>This He said also unto Paul: “My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.”1407“It is I, now mark it, who have caused you so to be.” For in saying,
<note type="footnote">1407 2 Cor. xii. 9.</note>

<pb n="392"/>
“I send you forth as sheep,” He intimates this. “Do not therefore despond, for I know, I
know certainly, that in this way more than any other ye will be invincible to all.”</p>
<p>After this, that they may contribute something on their own part also, and that all might
not seem to be of His grace, nor they supposed to be crowned at random, and vainly, He
saith, “Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” “But what,” it might be said,
“will our wisdom avail in so great dangers? nay, how shall we be able to have wisdom at all,
when so many waves are drenching us all over? For let a sheep be ever so wise, when it is in
the midst of wolves, and so many wolves, what will it be able to do? Let the dove be ever so
harmless, what will it profit, when so many hawks are assailing it?” In the brutes indeed,
not at all: but in you as much as possible.</p>
<p>But let us see what manner of wisdom He here requires. That of the serpent, He saith.
For even as that animal gives up everything, and if its very body must be cut off, doth not
very earnestly defend it, so that it may save its head; in like manner do thou also, saith He,
give up every thing but the faith; though goods, body, life itself, must be yielded. For that is
the head and the root; and if that be preserved, though thou lose all, thou wilt recover all
with so much the more splendor.1408</p>
<p>On this account then He neither commanded to be merely a simple and single-hearted
sort of person, nor merely wise; but hath mixed up both these, so that they may become
virtue; taking in the wisdom of the serpent that we may not be wounded in our vitals; and
the harmlessness of the dove, that we may not retaliate on our wrongdoers, nor avenge
ourselves on them that lay snares; since wisdom again is useless, except this be added. Now
what, I ask, could be more strict than these injunctions? Why, was it not enough to suffer
wrong? Nay, saith He, but I do not permit thee so much as to be indignant. For this is “the
dove.” As though one should cast a reed into fire, and command it not to be burnt by the
fire, but to quench it.</p>
<p>However, let us not be troubled; nay, for these things have come to pass, and have had
an accomplishment, and have been shown in very deed, and men became wise as serpents,
and harmless as doves; not being of another nature, but of the same with us.</p>
<p>Let not then any one account His injunctions impracticable. For He beyond all others
knows the nature of things; He knows that fierceness is not quenched by fierceness, but by
gentleness. And if in men’s actual deeds too thou wouldest see this result, read the book of
the Acts of the Apostles, and thou wilt see how often, when the people of the Jews had risen
up against them and were sharpening their teeth, these men, imitating the dove, and answering
with suitable meekness, did away with their wrath, quenched their madness, broke their
impetuosity. As when they said, “Did not we straitly command you, that ye should not speak
in this name?”1409although able to work any number of miracles, they neither said nor did
<note type="footnote">1408 περιφανεα .</note>
<note type="footnote">1409 Acts v. 28.</note>

<pb n="393"/>
anything harsh, but answered for themselves with all meekness, saying, “Whether it be right
to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.”1410</p>
<p>Hast thou seen the harmlessness of the dove? Behold the wisdom of the serpent. “For
we cannot but speak the things, which we know and have heard.”1411 Seest thou how we
must be perfect on all points, so as neither to be abased by dangers, nor provoked by anger?</p>
<p>4. Therefore He said also,1412</p>
<p>“Beware of men, for they shall deliver you up to councils, and they shall scourge you in
their synagogues: and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a
testimony to them and the Gentiles.”</p>
<p>Thus again is He preparing them to be vigilant, in every case assigning to them the
sufferance of wrong, and permitting the infliction of it to others; to teach thee that the victory
is in suffering evil, and that His glorious trophies are thereby set up. For He said not at all,
“Fight ye also, and resist them that would vex you,” but only, “Ye shall suffer the utmost
ills.”</p>
<p>O how great is the power of Him that speaks! How great the self-command of them that
hear! For indeed we have great cause to marvel, how they did not straightway dart away
from Him on hearing these things, apt as they were to be startled at every sound, and such
as had never gone further than that lake, around which they used to fish; and how they did
not reflect, and say to themselves, “And whither after all this are we to flee? The courts of
justice against us, the kings against us, the governors, the synagogues of the Jews, the nations
of the Gentiles, the rulers, and the ruled.” (For hereby He not only forewarned them of
Palestine, and the ills therein, but discovered also the wars throughout the world, saying,
“Ye shall be brought before kings and governors;” signifying that to the Gentiles also He
was afterwards to send them as heralds.) “Thou hast made the world our enemy, Thou hast
armed against us all them that dwell on the earth, peoples, tyrants, kings.”</p>
<p>And what follows again is much more fearful, since men are to become on our account
murderers of brothers, of children, of fathers.</p>
<p>“For the brother,” saith He, “shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the
child; and children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.”1413</p>
<p>“How, then,” one might say, “will the rest of men believe, when they see on our account,
children slain by their fathers, and brethren by brethren, and all things filled with abominations?”
What? will not men, as though we were destructive demons, will they not, as though
we were devoted, and pests of the world, drive us out from every quarter, seeing the earth

<pb n="394"/>
filled with blood of kinsmen, and with so many murderers? Surely fair is the peace (is it
not?) which we are to bring into men’s houses and give them, while we are filling those
houses with so many slaughters. Why, had we been some great number of us, instead of
twelve; had we been, instead of “unlearned and ignorant,” wise, and skilled in rhetoric, and
mighty in speech; nay more, had we been even kings, and in possession of armies and
abundance of wealth; how could we have persuaded any, while kindling up civil wars, yea,
and other wars far worse than they? Why, though we were to despise our own safety, which
of all other men will give heed to us?”</p>
<p>But none of these things did they either think or say, neither did they require any account
of His injunctions, but simply yielded and obeyed. And this came not from their own virtue
only, but also of the wisdom of their Teacher. For see how to each of the fearful things He
annexed an encouragement; as in the case of such as received them not, He said, “It shall
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for
that city;” so here again, when He had said, “Ye shall be brought before governors and kings,”
He added, “for my sake, for a testimony to them, and the Gentiles.” And this is no small
consolation, that they are suffering these things both for Christ, and for the Gentiles’ conviction.
Thus God, though no one regard, is found to be everywhere doing His own works.
Now these things were a comfort to them, not that they desired the punishment of other
men, but that they might have ground of confidence, as sure to have Him everywhere present
with them, who had both foretold and foreknown these things; and because not as wicked
men, and as pests, were they to suffer all this.</p>
<p>And together with these, He adds another, and that no small consolation for them,
saying,</p>
<p>“But when they deliver you up, take no thought1414how or what ye shall speak, for it
shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit
of your Father that speaketh in you.”1415</p>
<p>For lest they should say, “How shall we be able to persuade men, when such things are
taking place?” He bids them be confident as to their defense also. And elsewhere indeed He
saith, “I will give you a mouth and wisdom;”1416but here, “It is the Spirit of your Father that
speaketh in you,” advancing them unto the dignity of the prophets. Therefore, when He
had spoken of the power that was given, then He added also the terrors, the murders, and
the slaughters.</p>

<p>“For the brother shall deliver up the brother,” saith He, “to death, and the father the
child, and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to
death.”1417</p>
<p>And not even at this did He stop, but added also what was greatly more fearful, and
enough to shiver a rock to pieces: “And ye shall be hated of all men.” And here again the
consolation is at the doors, for, “For my name’s sake,” saith He, “ye shall suffer these things.”</p>
<p>And with this again another, “But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.”1418
And these things in another point of view likewise were sufficient to rouse up their
spirits; since at any rate the power of their gospel was to blaze up so high, as that nature
should be despised, and kindred rejected, and the Word preferred to all, chasing all mightily
away. For if no tyranny of nature is strong enough to withstand your sayings, but it is dissolved
and trodden under foot, what else shall be able to get the better of you? Not, however,
that your life will be in security, because these things shall be; but rather ye will have for
your common enemies and foes them that dwell in the whole world.</p>
<p>5. Where now is Plato? Where Pythagoras? Where the long chain1419of the Stoics? For
the first, after having enjoyed great honor, was so practically refuted, as even to be sold out
of the country,1420and to succeed in none of his objects, no, not go much as in respect of
one tyrant: yea, he betrayed his disciples, and ended his life miserably. And the Cynics, mere
pollutions as they were, have all passed by like a dream and a shadow. And yet assuredly no
such thing ever befell them, but rather they were accounted glorious for their heathen
philosophy, and the Athenians made a public monument of the epistles of Plato, sent them
by Dion; and they passed all their time at ease, and abounded in wealth not a little. Thus,
for instance, Aristippus was used to purchase costly harlots; and another made a will, leaving
no common inheritance; and another, when his disciples had laid themselves down like a
bridge, walked on them; and he of Sinope, they say, even behaved himself unseemly in the
market place.</p>
<p>Yea, these are their honorable things. But there is no such thing here, but a strict temperance,
and a perfect decency, and a war against the whole world in behalf of truth and
godliness, and to be slain every day, and not until hereafter their glorious trophies.</p>
<p>But there are some also, one may say, skilled in war amongst them; as Themistocles,
Pericles. But these things too are children’s toys, compared with the acts of the fishermen.
For what canst thou say? That he persuaded the Athenians to embark in their ships, when

<pb n="396"/>
Xerxes was marching upon Greece? Why in this case, when it is not Xerxes marching, but
the devil with the whole world, and his evil spirits innumerable assailing these twelve men,
not at one crisis only, but throughout their whole life, they prevailed and vanquished; and
what was truly marvellous, not by slaying their adversaries, but by converting and reforming
them.</p>
<p>For this especially you should observe throughout, that they slew not, nor destroyed
such as were plotting against them, but having found them as bad as devils, they made them
rivals of angels, enfranchising human nature from this evil tyranny, while as to those execrable
demons that were confounding all things, they drave them out of the midst of markets, and
houses, or rather even from the very wilderness. And to this the choirs of the monks bear
witness, whom they have planted everywhere, clearing out not the habitable only, but even
the uninhabitable land. And what is yet more marvellous, they did not this in fair conflict,
but in the enduring of evil they accomplished it all. Since men actually had them in the
midst, twelve unlearned persons, binding, scourging, dragging them about, and were not
able to stop their mouths; but as it is impossible to bind the sunbeam, so also their tongue.
And the reason was, “it was not they” themselves “that spake,” but the power of the Spirit.
Thus for instance did Paul overcome Agrippa, and Nero, who surpassed all men in
wickedness. “For the Lord,” saith he, “stood with me, and strengthened me, and delivered
me out of the mouth of the lion.”1421</p>
<p>But do thou also admire them, how when it was said to them, “Take no thought,” they
yet believed, and accepted it, and none of the terrors amazed them. And if thou say, He gave
them encouragement enough, by saying, “It shall be the Spirit of your Father that shall
speak;” even for this am I most amazed at them, that they doubted not, nor sought deliverance
from their perils; and this, when not for two or three years were they to suffer these things,
but all their life long. For the saying, “He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved,”
is an intimation of this.</p>
<p>For His will is, that not His part only should be contributed, but that the good deeds
should be also done of them. Mark, for instance, how from the first, part is His, part His
disciples’. Thus, to do miracles is His, but to provide nothing is theirs. Again, to open all
men’s houses, was of the grace from above; but to require no more than was needful, of
their own self-denial. “For the workman is worthy of his hire.” Their bestowing peace was
of the gift of God, their inquiring for the worthy, and not entering in without distinction
unto all, of their own self command. Again, to punish such as received them not was His,
but to retire with gentleness from them, without reviling or insulting them, was of the
apostles’ meekness. To give the Spirit, and cause them not to take thought, was of Him that
sent them, but to become like sheep and doves, and to bear all things nobly, was of their
<note type="footnote">1421 2 Tim. iv. 17.</note>

<pb n="397"/>
calmness and prudence. To be hated and not to despond, and to endure, was their own; to
save them that endured, was of Him who sent them.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He said, “He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.” That
is, because the more part are wont at the beginning indeed to be vehement, but afterwards
to faint, therefore saith He, “I require the end.” For what is the use of seeds, flourishing indeed
at first, but a little after fading away? Therefore it is continued patience that He requires of
them. I mean, lest any say, He wrought the whole Himself, and it was no wonder that they
should prove such, suffering as they did nothing intolerable; therefore He saith unto them,
“There is need also of patience on your part. For though I should rescue you from the first
dangers, I am reserving you for others more grievous, and after these again others will succeed;
and ye shall not cease to have snares laid for you, so long as ye have breath.” For this
He intimated in saying, “But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.”</p>
<p>For this cause then, though He said, “Take no thought what ye shall speak;” yet elsewhere
He saith, “Be ready to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you.”1422 That is, as long as the contest is among friends, He commands us also to take
thought; but when there is a terrible tribunal, and frantic assemblies, and terrors on all sides,
He bestows the influence from Himself, that they may take courage and speak out, and not
be discouraged, nor betray the righteous cause.</p>
<p>For in truth it was a very great thing, for a man occupied about lakes, and skins, and
receipt of custom, when tyrants were on their thrones, and satraps, and guards standing by
them, and the swords drawn, and all standing on their side; to enter in alone, bound, hanging
down his head, and yet be able to open his mouth. For indeed they allowed them neither
speech nor defense with respect to their doctrines, but set about torturing them to death,
as common pests of the world. For “They,” it is said, “that have turned the world upside
down, are come hither also;” and again, “They preach things contrary to the decrees of
Cæsar, saying that Jesus Christ is king.”1423 And everywhere the courts of justice were preoccupied
by such suspicions, and much influence from above was needed, for their showing
both the truth of the doctrine they preached, and that they are not violating the common
laws; so that they should neither, while earnest to speak of the doctrine, fall under suspicion
of overturning the laws; nor again, while earnest to show that they were not overturning
the common government, corrupt the perfection of their doctrines: all which thou wilt see
accomplished with all due consideration, both in Peter and in Paul, and in all the rest. Yea,
and as rebels and innovators, and revolutionists, they were accused all over the world; yet
nevertheless they both repelled this impression, and invested themselves with the contrary,
all men celebrating them as saviors, and guardians, and benefactors. And all this they achieved
<note type="footnote">1422 1 Peter iii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1423 Acts xvii. 6, 7.</note>

<pb n="398"/>
by their much patience. Wherefore also Paul said, “I die daily;”1424and he continued to
“stand in jeopardy” unto the end.</p>
<p>6. What then must we deserve, having such high patterns, and in peace giving way to
effeminacy, and remissness? With none to make war (it is too evident) we are slain; we faint
when no man pursues, in peace we are required to be saved, and even for this we are not
sufficient. And they indeed, when the world was on fire, and the pile was being kindled over
the whole earth, entering, snatched from within, out of the midst of the flame, such as were
burning; but thou art not able so much as to preserve thyself.</p>
<p>What confidence then will there be for us? What favor? There are no stripes, no prisons,
no rulers, no synagogues, nor aught else of that kind to set upon us; yea, quite on the contrary
we rule and prevail. For both kings are godly, and there are many honors for Christians,
and precedences, and distinctions, and immunities, and not even so do we prevail. And
whereas they being daily led to execution, both teachers and disciples, and bearing innumerable
stripes, and continual brandings, were in greater luxury than such as abide in Paradise;
we who have endured no such thing, not even in a dream, are softer than any wax. “But
they,” it will be said, “wrought miracles.” Did this then keep them from the scourge? did it
free them from persecution? Nay, for this is the strange thing, that they suffered such things
often even at the hands of them whom they benefited, and not even so were they confounded,
receiving only evil for good. But thou if thou bestow on any one any little benefit, and then
be requited with anything unpleasant, art confounded, art troubled, and repentest of that
which thou hast done.</p>
<p>If now it should happen, as I pray it may not happen nor at any time fall out, that there
be a war against churches, and a persecution, imagine how great will be the ridicule, how
sore the reproaches. And very naturally; for when no one exercises himself in the wrestling
school, how shall he be distinguished in the contests? What champion, not being used to
the trainer, will be able, when summoned by the Olympic contests, to show forth anything
great and noble against his antagonist? Ought we not every day to wrestle and fight and
run? See ye not them that are called Pentathli, when they have no antagonists, how they fill
a sack with much sand, and hanging it up try their full strength thereupon? And they that
are still younger, practise the fight against their enemies upon the persons of their companions.
These do thou also emulate, and practise the wrestlings of self denial. For indeed there
are many that provoke to anger, and incite to lust, and kindle a great flame. Stand therefore
against thy passions, bear nobly the mental pangs, that thou mayest endure also those of
the body.</p>

<p>7. For so the blessed Job, if he had not exercised himself well before his conflicts, would
not have shone so brightly in the same. Unless he had practised freedom from all despondency,
he would have uttered some rash word, when his children died. But as it was he stood
against all the assaults, against ruin of fortune, and destruction of so great affluence: against
loss of children, against his wife’s commiseration, against plagues in body, against reproaches
of friends, against revilings of servants.</p>
<p>And if thou wouldest see his ways of exercise also, hear him saying, how he used to
despise wealth: “If I did but rejoice,” saith he, “because my wealth was great: if I set gold up
for a heap, if I put my trust in a precious stone.”1425 Therefore neither was he confounded
at their being taken away, since he desired them not when present.</p>
<p>Hear how he also managed what related to his children, not giving way to undue softness,
as we do, but requiring of them all circumspection. For he who offered sacrifice even for
their secret sins, imagine how strict a judge he was of such as were manifest.1426</p>
<p>And if thou wouldest also hear of his strivings after continence, hearken to him when
he saith, “I made a covenant with mine eyes, that I should not think upon a maid.”1427 For
this cause his wife did not break his spirit, for he loved her even before this, not however
immoderately, but as is due to a wife.</p>
<p>Wherefore I am led even to marvel, whence it came into the devil’s thought to stir up
the contest, knowing as he did of his previous training. Whence then did it occur to him?
The monster is wicked, and never despairs: and this turns out to us a very great condemnation
that he indeed never gives up the hope of our destruction, but we despair of our own salvation.</p>
<p>But for bodily mutilation and indignity, mark how he practised himself. Why, inasmuch
as he himself had never undergone any such thing, but had continued to live in wealth and
luxury, and in all other splendor, he used to divine other men’s calamities, one by one. And
this he declared, when he said, “For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me; and
that which I was afraid of is come unto me.”1428 And again, “But I wept for every helpless
man, and groaned when I saw a man in distress.”1429</p>
<p>So because of this, nothing of what happened confounded him, none of those great and
intolerable ills. For I bid thee not look at the ruin of his substance, nor at the loss of his
children, nor at that incurable plague, nor at his wife’s device against him; but at those things
which are far more grievous than these.</p>

<p>“And what,” saith one, “did Job suffer more grievous than these? for from his history
there is nothing more than these for us to learn.” Because we are asleep, we do not learn,
since he surely that is anxious, and searches well for the pearl, will know of many more
particulars than these. For the more grievous, and apt to infuse greater perplexity, were
different.</p>
<p>And first, his knowing nothing certain about the kingdom of heaven, and the resurrection;
which indeed he also spoke of, lamenting. “For I shall not live alway, that I should
suffer long.”1430 Next, his being conscious to himself of many good works. Thirdly, his being
conscious of no evil thing. Fourthly, his supposing that at God’s hands he was undergoing
it; or if at the devil’s, this again was enough to offend him. Fifthly, his hearing his friends
accusing him of wickedness, “For thou hast not been scourged,” say they, “according to
what thy sins deserve.”1431 Sixthly, his seeing such as lived in wickedness prospering, and
exulting over him. Seventhly, not having any other to whom he might look as even having
ever suffered such things.</p>
<p>8. And if thou wouldest learn how great these things are, consider our present state. For
if now, when we are looking for a kingdom, and hoping for a resurrection, and for the unutterable
blessings, and are conscious to ourselves of countless evil deeds, and when we have
so many examples, and are partakers of so high a philosophy; should any persons lose a
little gold, and this often, after having taken it by violence, they deem life not to be lived in,
having no wife to lay sore on them, nor bereaved of children, nor reproached by friends,
nor insulted by servants, but rather having many to comfort them, some by words, some
by deeds; of how noble crowns must not he be worthy, who seeing what he had gotten together
by honest labor, snatched away from him for nought and at random, and after all
that, undergoing temptations without number, like sleet, yet throughout all abides unmoved,
and offers to the Lord his due thanksgiving for it all?</p>
<p>Why, though no one had spoken any of the other taunts, yet his wife’s words alone were
sufficient utterly to shake a very rock. Look, for example, at her craft. No mention of money,
none of camels, and flocks, and herds, (for she was conscious of her husband’s self command
with regard to these), but of what was harder to bear than all these, I mean, their children;
and she deepens the tragedy, and adds to it her own influence.</p>
<p>Now if when men were in wealth, and suffering no distress, in many things and oft have
women prevailed on them: imagine how courageous was that soul, which repulsed her, assaulting
him with such powerful weapons, and which trod under foot the two most tyrannical
passions, desire and pity. And yet many having conquered desire, have yielded to pity.
That noble Joseph, for instance, held in subjection the most tyrannical of pleasures, and
<note type="footnote">1430 Job vii. 16, LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">1431 Job xi. 6.</note>

<pb n="401"/>
repulsed that strange woman, plying him as she did with innumerable devices; but his tears
he contained not, but when he saw his brethren that had wronged him, he was all on fire
with that passion, and quickly cast off the mask, and discovered the part he had been playing.
1432 But when first of all she is his wife, and when her words are piteous, and the moment
favorable for her, as well as his wounds and his stripes, and those countless waves of
calamities; how can one otherwise than rightly pronounce the soul impassive to so great a
storm to be firmer than any adamant?</p>
<p>Allow me freely to say, that the very apostles, if not inferior to this blessed man, are at
least not greater than he was. For they indeed were comforted by the suffering for Christ;
and this medicine was so sufficient daily to relieve them, that the Lord puts it everywhere,
saying, “for me, for my sake,” and, “If they call me, the master of the house, Beelzebub.”1433
But he was destitute of this encouragement, and of that from miracles, and of that from
grace; for neither had he so great power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>And what is yet greater, nourished in much delicacy, not from amongst fishermen, and
publicans, and such as lived frugally, but after enjoyment of so much honor, he suffered all
that he did suffer. And what seemed hardest to bear in the case of the apostles, this same he
also underwent, being hated of friends, of servants, of enemies, of them who had received
kindness of him: and the sacred anchor, the harbor without waves, namely, that which was
said to the apostles, “for my sake,” of this he had no sight.</p>
<p>I admire again the three children, for that they dared the furnace, that they stood up
against a tyrant. But hear what they say, “We serve not thy Gods, nor worship the image
which thou hast set up.”1434 A thing which was the greatest encouragement to them, to
know of a certainty that for God they are suffering all whatsoever they suffer. But this man
knew not that it was all conflicts, and a wrestling; for had he known it, he would not have
felt what was happening. At any rate, when he heard, “Thinkest thou that I have uttered to
thee mine oracles for nought, or that thou mightest be proved righteous?”1435consider how
straightway, at a bare word, he breathed again, how he made himself of no account, how he
accounted himself not so much as to have suffered what he had suffered, thus saying, “Why
do I plead any more, being admonished and reproved of the Lord, hearing such things, I
being nothing?”1436 And again, “I have heard of Thee before, as far as hearing of the ear;
but now mine eye hath seen Thee; wherefore I have made myself vile, and have melted away;
and I accounted myself earth and ashes.”1437</p>

<head>Homily XXXIV.</head>
<p>Matt. X. 23.</p>
<p>“But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into the other; for verily I say unto you, ye
shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come.”</p>
<p>Having spoken of those fearful and horrible things, enough to melt very adamant, which
after His cross, and resurrection, and assumption, were to befall them, He directs again His
discourse to what was of more tranquil character, allowing those whom He is training to
recover breath, and affording them full security. For He did not at all command them, when
persecuted, to close with the enemy, but to fly. That is, it being so far but a beginning, and
a prelude, He gave His discourse a very condescending turn. For not now of the ensuing
persecutions is He speaking, but of those before the cross and the passion. And this He
showed by saying, “Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be
come.” That is, lest they should say, “What then, if when persecuted we flee, and there again
they overtake us, and drive us out?”—to destroy this fear, He saith, “Ye shall not have gone
round Palestine first, but I will straightway come upon you.”</p>
<p>And see how here again He doeth not away with the terrors, but stands by them in their
perils. For He said not, “I will snatch you out, and will put an end to the persecutions;” but
what? “Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come.” Yea,
for it sufficed for their consolation, simply to see Him.</p>
<p>But do thou observe, I pray thee, how He doth not on every occasion leave all to grace,
but requires something also to be contributed on their part. “For if ye fear,” saith He, “flee,”
for this He signified by saying, “flee ye,” and “fear not.”1438 And He did not command them
to flee at first, but when persecuted to withdraw; neither is it a great distance that He allows
them, but so much as to go about the cities of Israel.</p>
<p>Then again, He trains them for another branch of self-command; first, casting out all
care for their food: secondly, all fear of their perils; and now, that of calumny. Since from
that first anxiety He freed them, by saying, “The workman is worthy of his hire,”1439and by
signifying that many would receive them; and from their distress about their dangers, by
saying, “Take no thought how or what ye shall speak,” and, “He that endureth unto the end,
the same shall be saved.”1440</p>
<p>But since withal it was likely that they should also bring upon themselves an evil report,
which to many seems harder to bear than all; see whence He comforts them even in this
<note type="footnote">1438 Matt. x. 26.</note>

<pb n="404"/>
case, deriving the encouragement from Himself, and from all that had been said touching
Himself; to which nothing else was equal. For as He said in that other place, “Ye shall be
hated of all men,” and added, “for my name’s sake,” so also here.</p>
<p>And in another way He mitigates it, joining a fresh topic to that former. What kind of
one then is it?</p>
<p>“The disciple,” saith He, “is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is
enough for the disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have
called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His
household? Fear them not therefore.”1441</p>
<p>See how He discovers Himself to be the Lord and God and Creator of all things. What
then? Is there not any disciple above his Master, or servant above his Lord?1442 So long as
he is a disciple, and a servant, he is not, by the nature of that honor. For tell me not here of
the rare instances, but take the principle from the majority. And He saith not, “How much
more His servants,” but “them of His household,” to show how very near He felt them to
be to Him.1443 And elsewhere too He said, “Henceforth I call you not servants; ye are my
friends.”1444 And He said not, If they have insulted the Master of the house, and calumniated
Him; but states also the very form of the insult, that they “called Him Beelzebub.”</p>
<p>Then He gives also another consolation, not inferior to this: for this indeed is the greatest;
but because for them who were not yet living strictly, there was need also of another, such
as might have special power to refresh them, He states it likewise. And the saying seems
indeed in form to be an universal proposition, nevertheless not of all matters, but of those
in hand only, is it spoken. For what saith He?</p>
<p>“There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; nor hid, that shall not be
known.”1445 Now what He saith is like this. It is indeed sufficient for your encouragement,
that I also shared with you in the same reproach; I who am your Master and Lord. But if it
still grieve you to hear these words, consider this other thing too, that even from this suspicion
ye will soon be released. For why do ye grieve? At their calling you sorcerers and deceivers?
But wait a little, and all men will address you as saviors, and benefactors of the world. Yea,
for time discovers all things that are concealed, it will both refute their false accusation, and
make manifest your virtue. For when the event shows you saviors, and benefactors, and
examples of all virtue, men will not give heed to their words, but to the real state of the case;
and they will appear false accusers, and liars, and slanderers, but ye brighter than the sun,

length of time revealing and proclaiming you, and uttering a voice clearer than a trumpet,
and making all men witnesses of your virtue. Let not therefore what is now said humble
you, but let the hope of the good things to come raise you up. For it cannot be, that what
relates to you should be hid.</p>
<p>2. Then, having rid them of all distress, and fears, and anxiety, and set them above men’s
reproaches, then, and not till then, He seasonably discourses to them also of boldness in
their preaching.</p>
<p>For, “What I tell you,” saith He, “in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye have
heard in the ear, that preach ye1446upon the housetops.”1447</p>
<p>Yet it was not at all darkness, when He was saying these things; neither was He dis
coursing unto them in the ear; but He used a strong figure, thus speaking. That is, because
He was conversing with them alone, and in a small corner of Palestine, therefore He said,
“in darkness,” and “in the ear;” contrasting the boldness of speech, which He was hereafter
to confer on them, with the tone of the conversation which was then going on. “For not to
one, or two, or three cities, but to the whole world ye shall preach,” saith He, “traversing
land and sea, the inhabited country, and the desert; to princes alike and tribes, to philosophers
and orators, saying all with open face,1448and with all boldness of speech.” Therefore, He
said, “On the house tops,” and, “In the light,” without any shrinking, and with all freedom.</p>
<p>And wherefore said He not only, “Preach on the housetops,” and “Speak in the light,”
but added also, “What I tell you in darkness,” and “What ye hear in the ear”? It was to raise
up their spirits. As therefore when He said, “He that believeth on me, the works that I do
shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do;”1449even so here too, to signify
that He will do it all by them, and more than by Himself, He inserted this. For “the beginning
indeed,” saith He, “I have given, and the prelude; but the greater part it is my will to effect
through you.” Now this is the language of one not commanding only, but also declaring
beforehand what was to be, and encouraging them with His sayings, and implying that they
should prevail over all, and quietly also removing1450again their distress at the evil report.
For as this doctrine, after lying hid for a while, shall overspread all things, so also the evil
suspicion of the Jews shall quickly perish.</p>
<p>Then, because He had lifted them up on high, He again gives warning of the perils also,
adding wings to their mind, and exalting them high above all. For what saith He? “Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.”1451 Seest thou how He set them

<pb n="406"/>
far above all things, persuading them to despise not anxiety only and calumny, dangers and
plots, but even that which is esteemed of all things most terrible, death? And not death alone,
but by violence too? And He said not, “ye shall be slain,” but with the dignity that became
Him, He set this before them, saying, “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able
to kill the soul; but rather fear Him1452which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell;”
bringing round the argument, as He ever doth, to its opposite. For what? is your fear, saith
He, of death? and are ye therefore slow to preach? Nay for this very cause I bid you preach,
that ye fear death: for this shall deliver you from that which is really death. What though
they shall slay you? yet over the better part they shall not prevail, though they strive ten
thousand ways. Therefore He said not, “Who do not kill the soul,” but, who “are not able
to kill.” For wish it as they may, they shall not prevail. Wherefore, if thou fear punishment,
fear that, the more grievous by far.</p>
<p>Seest thou how again He doth not promise them deliverance from death, but permits
them to die, granting them more than if He had not allowed them to suffer it? Because deliverance
from death is not near so great as persuading men to despise death. You see now,
He doth not push them into dangers, but sets them above dangers, and in a short sentence
fixes in their mind the doctrines that relate to the immortality of the soul, and having in
two or three words implanted a saving doctrine, He comforts them also by other considerations.</p>
<p>Thus, lest they should think, when killed and butchered, that as men forsaken they
suffered this, He introduces again the argument of God’s providence, saying on this wise:
“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall into a
snare1453without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”1454“For
what is viler than they?” saith He; “nevertheless, not even these shall be taken without God’s
knowledge.” For He means not this, “by His operation they fall,” for this were unworthy of
God; but, “nothing that is done is hid from Him.” If then He is not ignorant of anything
that befalls us, and loves us more truly than a father, and so loves us, as to have numbered
our very hairs; we ought not to be afraid. And this He said, not that God numbers our hairs,
but that He might indicate His perfect knowledge, and His great providence over them. If
therefore He both knows all the things that are done, and is able to save you, and willing;
whatever ye may have to suffer, think not that as persons forsaken ye suffer. For neither is

it His will to deliver you from the terrors, but to persuade you to despise them, since this
is, more than anything, deliverance from the terrors.</p>
<p>3. “Fear ye not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.”1455 Seest thou that
the fear had already prevailed over them? Yea, for He knew the secrets of the heart; therefore
He added, “Fear them not therefore;” for even should they prevail, it will be over the inferior
part, I mean, the body; which though they should not kill, nature will surely take with her
and depart. So that not even this depends on them, but men have it from nature. And if
thou fear this, much more shouldest thou fear what is greater, and dread “Him who is able
to destroy both soul and body in hell.” And He saith not openly now, that it is Himself,
“Who is able to destroy both soul and body,” but where He before declared Himself to be
judge, He made it manifest.</p>
<p>But now the contrary takes place: Him, namely, who is able to destroy the soul, that is,
to punish it, we fear not, but those who slay the body, we shudder at. Yet surely while He
together with the soul punishes the body also, they cannot even chasten the body, much less
the soul: and though they chasten it ever so severely, yet in that way they rather make it
more glorious.</p>
<p>Seest thou how He signifies the conflicts to be easy? Because in truth, death did exceedingly
agitate their souls, inspiring terror for a time, for that it had not as yet been made easy
to overcome, neither had they that were to despise it partaken of the grace of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Having, you see, cast out the fear and distress that was agitating their soul; by what follows
He also encourages them again, casting out fear by fear; and not by fear only, but also
by the hope of great prizes; and He threatens with much authority, in both ways urging
them to speak boldly for the truth; and saith further,</p>
<p>“Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him1456will I also confess before
my Father which is in Heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also
deny before my Father which is in Heaven.”1457</p>
<p>Thus not from the good things only, but also from the opposites, doth He urge them;
and He concludes with the dismal part.</p>
<p>And mark His exact care; He said not “me,” but “in me,” implying that not by a power
of his own, but by the help of grace from above, the confessor makes his confession. But of
him that denies, He said not, “in me,” but “me;” for he having become destitute of the gift,
his denial ensues.</p>

<pb n="408"/>
<p>“Why then is he blamed,” one may say, “if being forsaken, he denies?” Because the being
forsaken is the fault of the forsaken person himself.</p>
<p>But why is He not satisfied with the faith in the mind, but requires also the confession
with the mouth? To train us up to boldness in speech, and a more abundant love and determination,
and to raise us on high. Wherefore also He addresses Himself to all. Nor doth
He at all apply this to the disciples only in person, for not them, but their disciples too, He
is now rendering noble hearted. Because he that hath learnt this lesson will not only teach
with boldness, but will likewise suffer all things easily, and with ready mind. This at any rate
brought over many to the apostles, even their belief in this word. Because both in the punishment
the infliction is heavier, and in the good things the recompense greater. I mean,
whereas he that doeth right hath the advantage in time,1458and the delay of the penalty is
counted for gain by the sinner: He hath introduced an equivalent, or rather a much greater
advantage, the increase of the recompenses. “Hast thou the advantage,” saith He, “by having
first confessed me here? I also will have the advantage of thee, by giving thee greater things,
and unspeakably greater; for I will confess thee there.” Seest thou that both the good things
and the evil things are there to be dispensed? Why then hasten and hurry thyself? and why
seek thy rewards here, thou who art “saved by hope?”1459 Wherefore, whether thou hast
done anything good, and not received its recompense here, be not troubled (for with increase,
in the time to come, the reward thereof awaits thee): or whether thou hast done any evil,
and not paid the penalty, be not easy; for there will vengeance receive thee, if thou turn not
and amend.</p>
<p>But if thou believe it not, from the things here form thy conjecture about things to come
also. Why, if in the season of the conflicts they that confess are so glorious, imagine what
they will be in the season of the crowns. If the enemies here applaud, how shall that tenderest
of all fathers fail to admire and proclaim thee? Yea, then shall we have both our gifts for the
good, and our punishments for the evil. So that such as deny shall suffer harm, both here
and there; here living with an evil conscience, though they were never to die, they shall be
surely dead; and there, undergoing the last penalty: but the other sort will profit both here
and there, both here making a gain of their death, and in this way becoming more glorious
than the living, and there enjoying those unspeakable blessings.</p>
<p>God then is in no wise prompt to punish only, but also to confer benefits; and for this
last more than for the first. But why hath He put the reward once only, the punishment
twice? He knows that this would be more apt to correct us. For this cause when He had said,
<note type="footnote">1458 τ χρν πλεονεκτε, “he is beforehand with his rewarder:” his sufferings, and the sinner’s enjoyment, come
respectively first.</note>
<note type="footnote">1459 Rom. viii. 24. [“Saved in hope” or “for hope” expresses better, and agrees with the argument in the
Homily.—R.]</note>

<pb n="409"/>
“Fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell,” He saith again, “Him will I
also deny.” So doth Paul also, continually making mention of hell.</p>
<p>Thus we see that He, having by all ways trained on His scholar (both by opening
Heaven to him, and by setting before him that fearful judgment-seat, and by pointing to
the amphitheatre of angels, and how in the midst of them the crowns shall be proclaimed,
which thing would thenceforth prepare the way for the word of godliness to be very easily
received); in what follows, lest they grow timid and the word be hindered, He bids them be
prepared even for slaughter itself; to make them aware that such as continue in their error,
will have to suffer (among other things) for plotting against them.</p>
<p>4. Let us therefore despise death, although the time be not come that requires it of us;
for indeed it will translate us to a far better life. “But the body decays.” Why, on this account
most especially we ought to rejoice, because death decays, and mortality perishes, not the
substance of the body. For neither, shouldest thou see a statue being cast, wouldest thou
call the process destruction, but an improved formation. Just so do thou reason also concerning
the body, and do not bewail. Then it were right to bewail, had it remained in its
chastisement.</p>
<p>“But,” saith one, “this ought to take place without the decay of our bodies; they should
continue entire.” And what would this have advantaged either the living or the departed?
How long are ye lovers of the body? How long are ye rivetted to the earth and gaping after
shadows? Why, what good would this have done? or rather, what harm would it not have
done? For did our bodies not decay, in the first place the greatest of all evils, pride, would
have continued with many. For if even while this is going on, and worms gushing out, many
have earnestly sought to be gods; what would not have been the result did the body continue?</p>
<p>In the second place, it would not be believed to be of earth; for if, its end witnessing this,
some yet doubt; what would they not have suspected if they did not see this? Thirdly, the
bodies would have been excessively loved; and most men would have become more carnal
and gross; and if even now some cleave to men’s tombs and coffins, after that themselves
have perished, what would they not have done, if they had even their image preserved?
Fourthly, they would not have earnestly desired the things to come. Fifthly, they that say
the world is eternal, would have been more confirmed, and would have denied God as
Creator. Sixthly, they would not have known the excellence of the soul, and how great a
thing is the presence of a soul in a body. Seventhly, many of them that lose their relations
would have left their cities, and have dwelt in the tombs, and have become frantic, conversing
continually with their own dead. For if even now men form to themselves images, since they
cannot keep the body (for neither is it possible, but whether they will or no it glides and
hurries from them), and are rivetted to the planks of wood; what monstrous thing would
they not then have devised? To my thinking, the generality would have even built temples
for such bodies, and they that are skilled in such sorceries would have persuaded evil spirits

<pb n="410"/>
to speak through them; since at least even now, they that venture on the arts of necromancy
attempt many things more out of the way than these. And how many idolatries would not
have arisen from hence? when men even after the dust and ashes, are yet eager in those
practices.</p>
<p>God therefore, to take away all our extravagances, and to teach us to stand off from all
earthly things, destroys the bodies before our eyes. For even he that is enamored of bodies,
and is greatly affected at the sight of a beautiful damsel, if he will not learn by discourse the
deformity of that substance, shall know it by the very sight. Yea, many of the like age with
her whom he loves, and oftentimes also fairer, being dead, after the first or second day, have
emitted an ill savor, and foul matter, and decay with worms. Imagine then what sort of
beauty thou lovest, and what sort of elegance has power so to disturb thee. But if bodies did
not decay, this would not be well known: but as evil spirits run unto men’s graves, so also
many of our lovers, continually sitting by the tombs, would have received evil spirits in their
soul, and would quickly have perished in this grievous madness.</p>
<p>But as it is, together with all other things this also comforts the soul, that the form is
not seen: it brings men to forgetfulness of their affliction. Indeed, if this were not so, there
would be no tombs at all, but thou wouldest see our cities having corpses instead of statues,
each man desiring to look upon his own dead. And much confusion would arise hence, and
none of the ordinary sort would attend to his soul, nor would give room to the doctrine of
immortality to enter in: and many other things too, more shocking than these, would have
resulted, which even to speak of were unseemly. Wherefore it decays presently, that thou
mightest see unveiled the beauty of the soul. For if she be the procurer of all that beauty and
life, much more excellent must she herself be. And if she preserve that which is so deformed
and unsightly, much more herself.</p>
<p>5. For it is not the body wherein the beauty lies, but the expression,1460and the bloom
which is shed over its substance by the soul. Now then, I bid thee love that which makes the
body also to appear such as it is. And why speak I of death? Nay even in life itself, I would
have thee mark how all is hers that is beautiful. For whether she be pleased, she showers
roses over the cheeks; or whether she be pained, she takes that beauty, and involves it all in
a dark robe. And if she be continually in mirth, the body improves in condition; if in grief,
she renders the same thinner and weaker than a spider’s web; if in wrath, she hath made it
again abominable and foul; if she show the eye calm, great is the beauty that she bestows; if
she express envy, very pale and livid is the hue she sheds over us; if love, abundant the
gracefulness she at once confers. Thus in fact many women, not being beautiful in feature,
have derived much grace from the soul; others again of brilliant bloom, by having an ungracious
soul, have marred their beauty. Consider how a face that is pale grows red, and by the
<note type="footnote">1460 διπλασι, “the moulding of it by the informing soul.”</note>

<pb n="411"/>
variation of color produces great delight, when there is need of shame and blushing. As, on
the other hand, if it be shameless, it makes the countenance more unpleasing than any
monster.</p>
<p>For nothing is fairer, nothing sweeter than a beauteous soul. For while as to bodies, the
longing is with pain, in the case of souls the pleasure is pure and calm. Why then let go the
king, and be wild about the herald? Why leave the philosopher, and gape after his interpreter?
Hast thou seen a beautiful eye? acquaint thyself with that which is within; and if that be not
beautiful, despise this likewise. For surely, didst thou see an ill-favored woman wearing a
beautiful mask, she would make no impression on thee: just as on the other hand, neither
wouldest thou suffer one fair and beautiful to be disguised by the mask, but wouldest take
it away, as choosing to see her beauty unveiled.</p>
<p>This then I bid thee do in regard of the soul also, and acquaint thyself with it first; for
this is clad with the body instead of a mask; wherefore also that abides such as it is; but the
other, though it be mishapen, may quickly become beautiful. Though it have an eye that is
unsightly, and harsh, and fierce, it may become beautiful, mild, calm, sweet-tempered,
gentle.</p>
<p>This beauty therefore let us seek, this countenance let us adorn; that God also may “have
pleasure in our beauty,”1461and impart to us of His everlasting blessings, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. X. 34.</p>
<p>“Think not that I am come1462to send peace on earth; I am not come1463to send peace, but a
sword.”</p>
<p>Again, He sets forth the things that are more painful, and that with great aggravation:
and the objection they were sure to meet Him with, He prevents them by stating. I mean,
lest hearing this, they should say, “For, this then art Thou come, to destroy both us, and
them that obey us, and to fill the earth with war?” He first saith Himself, “I am not come to
send peace on earth.”</p>
<p>How then did He enjoin them to pronounce peace on entering into each house? And
again, how did the angels say, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace”?1464 And
how came all the prophets too to publish it for good tidings? Because this more than anything
is peace, when the diseased is cut off, when the mutinous is removed. For thus it is possible
for Heaven to be united to earth. Since the physician too in this way preserves the rest of
the body, when he amputates the incurable part; and the general, when he has brought to
a separation them that were agreed in mischief. Thus it came to pass also in the case of that
famous tower; for their evil peace1465was ended by their good discord, and peace made
thereby. Thus Paul also divided them that were conspiring against him.1466 And in Naboth’s
case that agreement was at the same time more grievous than any war.1467 For concord is
not in every case a good thing, since even robbers agree together.</p>
<p>The war is not then the effect of His purpose, but of their temper. For His will indeed
was that all should agree in the word of godliness; but because they fell to dissension, war
arises. Yet He spake not so; but what saith He? “I am not come to send peace;” comforting
them. As if He said, For think not that ye are to blame for these things; it is I who order
them so, because men are so disposed. Be not ye therefore confounded, as though the events
happened against expectation. To this end am I come, to send war among men; for this is
my will. Be not ye therefore troubled, when the earth is at war, as though it were subject to
some hostile device. For when the worse part is rent away, then after that Heaven is knit
unto the better.</p>

<p>And these things He saith, as strengthening them against the evil suspicion of the multitude.</p>
<p>And He said not “war,” but what was more grievous than it, “a sword.” And if there be
somewhat painful in these expressions, and of an alarming emphasis, marvel not. For, it
being His will to train their ears by the severity of His words, lest in their difficult circumstances
they should start aside, He fashioned His discourse accordingly; lest any one should
say it was by flattery He persuaded them, and by concealing the hardships; therefore even
to those things which merited to be otherwise expressed, He gave by His words the more
galling and painful turn. For it is better to see persons’ gentleness in things, than in words.</p>
<p>2. Wherefore neither with this was He satisfied, but unfolds also the very nature of the
war, signifying it to be far more grievous even than a civil war; and He saith, “I am come to
set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”1468</p>
<p>For not friends only, saith He, nor fellow citizens, but even kinsmen shall stand against
one another, and nature shall be divided against herself. “For I am come,” saith He, “to set
a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and a daughterin-
law against her mother-in-law.” That is, not merely among those of the same household
is the war, but among those that are dearest, and extremely near to each other. And this
more than anything signifies His power, that hearing these things, they both accepted Him,
and set about persuading all others.</p>
<p>Yet was it not He that did this: of course not: but the wickedness of the other sort: nevertheless
He saith it is His own doing. For such is the custom of the Scripture. Yea, and
elsewhere also He saith, “God hath given them eyes that they should not see:”1469and here
He speaks in this way, in order that having, as I said before, exercised themselves in these
words, they might not be confounded on suffering reproaches and insults.</p>
<p>But if any think these things intolerable, let them be reminded of an ancient history.
For in times of old also this came to pass, which thing especially shows the old covenant to
be akin to the new, and Him who is here speaking, the same with the giver of those commands.
I mean that in the case of the Jews also, when each had slain his neighbor, then He
laid aside His anger against them; both when they made the calf, and when they were joined
to Baal Peor.1470 Where then are they that say, “That God is evil, and this good?” For behold
He hath filled the world with blood, shed by kinsmen. Nevertheless even this we affirm to
be a work of great love towards man.</p>

<pb n="414"/>
<p>Therefore, you see, implying that it was He who approved those other acts also, He
makes mention also of a prophecy, which if not spoken for this end, yet involves the same
meaning. And what is this?</p>
<p>“A man’s foes shall be they of his own household.”1471</p>
<p>For indeed among the Jews also something of the kind took place. That is, there were
prophets, and false prophets, and the people was divided, and families were in dissension;
and some believed the one, and some the other. Wherefore the prophet admonishes, saying,
“Trust ye not in friends, have not hope in guides; yea, even of her that lieth in thy bosom
beware, in respect of communicating aught to her:” and, “A man’s enemies are the men that
are in his own house.”1472</p>
<p>And this He said, preparing him that should receive the word to be above all. For to die
is not evil, but to die an evil death. On this account He said moreover, “I am come to cast
fire upon the earth.”1473 And this He said, to declare the vehemence and warmth of the love
which He required. For, because He loved us very much, so He will likewise be loved of us.
And these sayings would strengthen1474the persons present also, and lift them higher. “For
if those others,” saith He, “are to despise kinsmen, and children, and parents, imagine what
manner of men ye their teachers ought to be. Since neither will the hardships stop with you,
but will also pass on to the rest. For since I am come bringing great blessings, I demand also
great obedience, and purpose of heart.”</p>
<p>3. “He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that
loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not his cross
and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.”1475</p>
<p>Seest thou a teacher’s dignity? Seest thou, how He signifies himself a true Son of Him
that begat Him, commanding us to let go all things beneath, and to take in preference the
love of Him?</p>
<p>“And why speak I,” saith He, “of friends and kinsmen? Even if it be thine own life which
thou preferrest to my love, thy place is far from my disciples.” What then? Are not these
things contrary to the Old Testament? Far from it, rather they are very much in harmony
therewith. For there too He commands not only to hate the worshippers of idols, but even
to stone them; and in Deuteronomy again, admiring these, He saith, “Who said unto his
father, and to his mother, I have not seen thee; neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
and his own sons he disowned: he kept Thy oracles.”1476 And if Paul gives many directions

touching parents, commanding us to obey them in all things, marvel not; for in those things
only doth he mean us to obey, as many as do not hinder godliness.1477 For indeed it is a
sacred duty to render them all other honors: but when they demand more than is due, one
ought not to obey. For this reason Luke saith, “If any man come to me, and hate not his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
also, he cannot be my disciple;”1478not commanding simply to hate them, since this were
even quite contrary to the law; but “when one desires to be loved more than I am, hate him
in this respect. For this ruins both the beloved himself, and the lover.” And these things He
said, both to render the children more determined, and to make the fathers more gentle,
that would hinder them. For when they saw He had such strength and power as to sever
their children from them, they, as attempting things impossible, would even desist.
Wherefore also He leaves the fathers, and addresses His discourse to the children, instructing
the former not to make the attempt, as attempting things impracticable.</p>
<p>Then lest they should be indignant, or count it hard, see which way He makes His argument
tend: in that having said, “Who hateth not father and mother,” He adds, “and his own
life.” For why dost thou speak to me of parents, saith He, and brothers, and sisters, and wife?
Nothing is nearer than the life to any man: yet if thou hate not this also, thou must bear in
all things the opposite of his lot who loveth me.</p>
<p>And not even simply to hate it was His command, but so as to expose it to war, and to
battles, and to slaughters, and blood. “For he that beareth not his cross, and cometh after
me, cannot be my disciple.”1479 Thus He said not merely that we must stand against death,
but also against a violent death; and not violent only, but ignominious too.</p>
<p>And He discourses nothing as yet of His own passion, that when they had been for a
time instructed in these things, they might more easily receive His word concerning it. Is
there not, therefore, cause for amazement, how on their hearing these things, their soul did
not wing its way from the body, the hardships being everywhere at hand, and the good
things in expectation? How then did it not flee away? Great was both the power of the
speaker, and the love of the hearers. Wherefore though hearing things far more intolera
ble and galling than those great men, Moses and Jeremiah, they continued to obey, and to
say nothing against it.</p>
<p>“He that findeth his life,” saith He, “shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake,
shall find it.”1480 Seest thou how great the damage to such as love it unduly? how great the
gain to them that hate it? I mean, because the injunctions were disagreeable, when He was

bidding them set themselves against parents, and children, and nature, and kindred, and
the world, and their very soul, He sets forth the profit also, being very great. Thus, “These
things,” saith He, “so far from harming, will very greatly profit; and their opposites will injure;”
urging them, as He ever doth, by the very things which they desire. For why art thou
willing to despise thy life?1481 Because thou lovest it? Then for that very reason despise it,
and so thou wilt advantage it in the highest degree, and do the part of one that loves it.</p>
<p>And mark an instance of unspeakable consideration. For not in respect of our parents
only doth He practise this reasoning, nor of our children, but with regard to our life, which
is nearer than all; that the other point may thenceforth become unquestionable, and they
may learn that they will in this way profit those of their kindred likewise, as much as may
be; since so it is in the case even of our life, which is more essential to us than all.</p>
<p>4. Now these things were enough to recommend men to receive them, their appointed
healers. Yea, who would choose but receive with all readiness them that were so noble, such
true heroes, and as lions running about the earth, and despising all that pertained to themselves,
so that others might be saved? Yet nevertheless He proffers also another reward, indicating
that He is caring here for the entertainers more than for the guests.</p>
<p>And the first honor He confers is by saying,</p>
<p>“He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent
me.”1482</p>
<p>With this, what may compare? that one should receive the Father and the Son! But He
holds out herewith another reward also.</p>
<p>“ He,” saith He, “that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a
prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man,
shall receive a righteous man’s reward.”1483</p>
<p>And as before He threatens punishment to such as do not receive them, here He defines
also a certain refreshment1484for the good. And to teach thee His greater care for them, He
said not simply, “He that receiveth a prophet,” or “He that receiveth a righteous man,” but
subjoined, “in the name of a prophet,” and, “in the name of a righteous man;” that is, if not
for any worldly preferment, nor for any other temporal thing, he receive him, but because
he is either a prophet or a righteous man, he shall receive a prophet’s reward, and a righteous
man’s reward; such as it were meet for him to have, that hath received a prophet, or a

righteous man; or, such as that other is himself to receive. Which kind of thing Paul also
said: “That your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may
be a supply for your want.”1485</p>
<p>Then, lest any one should allege poverty, He saith,</p>
<p>“Or whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only
in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.”1486</p>
<p>“Though a cup of cold water be thy gift, on which there is nothing laid out, even of this
shall a reward be stored up for thee. For I do all things for the sake of you the receivers.”</p>
<p>Seest thou what mighty persuasions He used, and how He opened to them the houses
of the whole world? Yea, He signified that men are their debtors: first, by saying, “The
workman is worthy of his hire;” secondly, by sending them forth having nothing; thirdly,
by giving them up to wars and fightings in behalf of them that receive them; fourthly, by
committing to them miracles also; fifthly, in that He did by their lips introduce peace, the
cause of all blessings, into the houses of such as receive them; sixthly, by threatening things
more grievous than Sodom to such as receive them not: seventhly, by signifying that as many
as welcome them are receiving both Himself and the Father; eighthly, by promising both a
prophet’s and a righteous man’s reward: ninthly, by undertaking that the recompenses shall
be great, even for a cup of cold water. Now each one of these things, even by itself, were
enough to attract them. For who, tell me, when a leader of armies wounded in innumerable
places, and dyed in blood, came in sight, returning after many trophies from war and conflict,
would not receive him, throwing open every door in his house?</p>
<p>5. But who now is like this? one may say. Therefore He added, “In the name of a disciple,
and of a prophet, and of a righteous man;” to instruct thee that not for the worthiness of
the visitor, but for the purpose of him that gives welcome, is His reward appointed. For
though here He speak of prophets, and righteous men, and disciples, yet elsewhere He bids
men receive the veriest outcasts, and punishes such as fail to do so. For, “Inasmuch as ye
did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me;”1487and the converse again He affirms
with respect to the same persons.</p>
<p>Since though he may be doing no such great work, he is a man, inhabiting the same
world with thee, beholding the same sun having the same soul, the same Lord, a partaker
with thee of the same mysteries, called to the same heaven with thee; having a strong claim,
his poverty, and his want of necessary food. But now they that waken thee with flutes and
pipes in the winter season, and disturb thee without purpose or fruit, depart from thee re-

ceiving many gifts.1488 And they that carry about swallows,1489and smut themselves
over,1490and abuse every one, receive a reward for this their conjuration. But if there come
to thee a poor man wanting bread, there is no end of revilings, and reproaches, and charges
of idleness, and upbraidings, and insults, and jeers; and thou considerest not with thyself,
that thou too art idle, and yet God giveth thee His gifts. For tell me not this, that thou too
art doing somewhat, but point me out this rather, if it be anything really needful that thou
doest, and art busy about. But if thou tellest one of money-getting, and of traffic, and of the
care and increase of thy goods, I also would say unto thee, Not these, but alms, and prayers,
and the protection of the injured, and all such things, are truly works, with respect to which
we live in thorough idleness. Yet God never told us, “Because thou art idle, I light not up
the sun for thee; because thou doest nothing of real consequence, I quench the moon, I
paralyze the womb of the earth, I restrain the lakes, the fountains, the rivers, I blot out the
atmosphere: I withhold the annual rains:” but He gives us all abundantly. And to some that
are not merely idle, but even doing evil, He freely gives the benefit of these things.</p>
<p>When therefore thou seest a poor man, and sayest, “It stops my breath that this fellow,
young as he is and healthy, having nothing, would fain be fed in idleness; he is surely some
slave and runaway, and hath deserted his proper master:” I bid thee speak these same words
to thyself; or rather, permit him freely to speak them unto thee, and he will say with more
justice, “It stops my breath that thou, being healthy, art idle, and practisest none of the things
which God hath commanded, but having run away from the commandments of thy Lord,
goest about dwelling in wickedness, as in a strange land, in drunkenness, in surfeiting, in
theft, in extortion, in subverting other men’s houses.” And thou indeed imputest idleness,

but I evil works; in thy plotting, in thy swearing, in thy lying, in thy spoiling, in thy doing
innumerable such things.</p>
<p>And this I say, not as making a law in favor of idleness, far from it; but rather very
earnestly wishing all to be employed; for sloth is the teacher of all wickedness: but I beseech
you not to be unmerciful, nor cruel. Since Paul also, having made infinite complaints, and
said, “If any will not work, neither let him eat,” stopped not at this, but added, “But ye, be
not weary in well doing.”1491“Nay, but these things are contradictory. For if thou hast
commanded for them not to eat, how exhortest thou us to give?” I do so, saith He, for I have
also commanded to avoid them, and “to have no company with them;” and again I said,
“Count them not as enemies, but admonish them;”1492not making contradictory laws, but
such as are quite in unison with each other. Because, if thou art prompt to mercy, both he,
the poor man, will soon be rid of his idleness, and thou of thy cruelty.</p>
<p>“But he hath many lies and inventions,” you reply. Well, hence again is he pitiable, for
that he hath fallen into such distress, as to be hardened even in such doings. But we, so far
from pitying, add even those cruel words, “Hast thou not received once and again?” so we
talk. What then? because he was once fed, hath he no need to be fed again? Why dost thou
not make these laws for thine own belly also, and say to it likewise, Thou wert filled yesterday,
and the day before, seek it not now? But while thou fillest that beyond measure, even to
bursting,1493from him thou turnest away, when he asks but what is moderate; whereas thou
oughtest therefore to pity him, because he is constrained to come to thee every day. Yea, if
nought else incline thee to him, thou shouldest pity him because of this; for by the constraint
of his poverty he is forced on these things, and doeth them. And thou dost not pity him,
because, being so spoken to, he feels no shame: the reason being, that his want is too strong
for him.</p>
<p>Nay, thou instead of pitying, dost even make a show of him; and whereas God hath
commanded to give secretly, thou standest exposing publicly him that hath accosted thee,
and upbraiding him, for what ought to move thy pity. Why, if thou art not minded to give,
to what end add reproach, and bruise that weary and wretched soul? He came as into a
harbor, seeking help at thine hands; why stir up waves, and make the storm more grievous?
Why dost thou condemn him of meanness? What? had he thought to hear such things,
would he have come to thee? Or if he actually came foreseeing this, good cause therefore
both to pity him, and to shudder at thine own cruelty, that not even so, when thou seest an
inexorable necessity laid upon him, dost thou become more gentle, nor judgest him to have
a sufficient excuse for his importunity in the dread of hunger, but accusest him of impudence:

and yet hast thou often thyself practised greater impudence, yea in respect of grievous
matters. For while here the very impudence brings with it ground of pardon, we, often doing
things punishable, brazen it out: and when we ought to bear all that in mind, and be humble,
we even trample on those miserable men, and when they ask medicines, we add to their
wounds. I say, if thou wilt not give, yet why dost thou strike? If thou wilt not be bounteous,
yet why be insolent?</p>
<p>“But he submits not to be put off in any other way.” Well then, as that wise man commanded,
1494so do. “Answer him peaceable words with meekness.” For not of his own accord,
surely, is he so very importunate. For there is not, there cannot be, any man desiring to be
put to shame for its own sake. How much soever any may contend, I cannot yield ever to
be convinced that a man who was living in plenty would choose to beg.</p>
<p>6. Let no man then beguile us with arguments. But although Paul saith, “If any will not
work, neither let him eat,”1495to them he saith it; but to us he saith not this, but, on the
contrary, “Be not weary in well doing.”1496 Even thus do we at home; when any two are
striving with each other, we take each apart, and give them the opposite advice. This did
God also, and Moses. For while to God he said, “If thou wilt forgive them their sin, forgive
it; else blot me out also;”1497them on the contrary he commanded to slay one another, and
all that pertained to them. Yet these things are contrary; nevertheless, both looked to one
end.</p>
<p>Again, God said to Moses in the hearing of the Jews, “Let me alone, that I may consume
the people,”1498(for though they were not present when God was saying this, yet they were
to hear it afterwards): but privately He gives him directions of the opposite tenor. And this,
Moses upon constraint revealed afterwards, thus saying, “What? did I conceive them, that
thou sayest to me, Carry them, as a nurse would carry the sucking child in her bosom?”1499</p>
<p>These things are done also in houses, and often a father while he blames the tutor in
private for having used his child reproachfully, saying, “Be not rough, nor hard,” to the
youth speaks in the contrary way, “Though thou be reproached unjustly, bear it;” out of
those opposites making up some one wholesome result. Thus also Paul said to such as are
in health and beg, “If any man will not work, neither let him eat,” that he may urge them
into employment: but to such as can show mercy, “Ye, for your part, be not weary in well
doing:” that he may lead them to give alms.</p>

<p>So also, when he was admonishing those of the Gentiles, in his Epistle to the Romans,
not to be highminded against the Jews, he brought forward also the wild olive, and he seems
to be saying one thing to these, another to those.1500</p>
<p>Let us not therefore fall away into cruelty, but let us listen to Paul, saying, “Be not weary
in well doing;” let us listen to the Lord, who saith, “Give to every man that asketh of
thee,”1501and, “Be ye merciful as your Father.”1502 And though He hath spoken of many
things, He hath nowhere used this expression, but with regard to our deeds of mercy only.
For nothing so equals us with God, as doing good.</p>
<p>“But nothing is more shameless,” saith one, “than a poor man.” Why, I pray thee? Because
he runs up, and cries out after thee? Wilt thou then let me point out, how we are more importunate
than they, and very shameless? Remember, I say, now at the season of the fast,
how often, when thy table was spread at eventide, and thou hadst called thy ministering
servant; on his moving rather leisurely,1503thou hast overset everything, kicking, insulting,
reviling, merely about a little delay; although fully assured, that if not immediately, yet a
little after thou shalt enjoy thy victuals. Upon which thou dost not call thyself impudent,
changed as thou art into a wild beast for nothing; but the poor man, alarmed and trembling
about his greater interests (for not about delay, but about famine, is all his fear), him dost
thou call audacious, and shameless, and impudent, and all the most opprobrious names?
Nay, how is this anything but extreme impudence.</p>
<p>But these things we do not consider: therefore we account such men troublesome: since
if we at all searched into our own doings, and compared them with theirs, we should not
have thought them intolerable.</p>
<p>Be not then a severe judge. Why, if thou wert clear of all sins, not even then would the
law of God permit thee to be strict in searching out other men’s sins. And if the Pharisee
perished on this account, what defense are we to find? If He suffer not such as have done
well to be bitter in searching out other men’s doings, much less them that have offended.</p>
<p>7. Let us not then be savage, nor cruel, not without natural feeling, not implacable, not
worse than wild beasts. For I know many to have gone even so far in brutishness, as for a
little trouble to slight famishing persons, and to say these words: “I have no servant now
with me; we are far from home; there is no money-changer that I know.” Oh cruelty! Didst
thou promise the greater, and dost thou not fulfill the less? To save thy walking a little way,
doth he perish with hunger? Oh insolence! Oh pride! Why, if it were ten furlongs to be
walked, oughtest thou to be backward? Doth it not even come into thy mind that so thy re-

ward is made greater? For whereas, when thou givest, thou receivest reward for the gift only:
when thou thyself also goest, for this again is appointed thee a recompense.</p>
<p>Yea, the patriarch himself we admire for this, that in his own person he ran to the herd,
and snatched up the calf,1504and that, when he had three hundred and eighteen servants
born in his house.1505 But now some are filled with so much pride, as to do these things by
servants, and not to be ashamed. “But dost thou require me to do these things myself?” one
may say. “How then shall I not seem to be vainglorious?” Nay, but as it is, thou art led by
another kind of vainglory to do this, being ashamed to be seen talking with a poor man.</p>
<p>But I am in no respect strict about this; only give, whether by thyself or by another thou
art minded to do so; and do not accuse, do not smite, do not revile. For medicines, not
wounds, doth he need who comes unto thee; mercy, not a sword. For tell me, if any one
who had been smitten with a stone, and had received a wound in his head, were to let go all
others, and run unto thy knees, drenched in his blood; wouldest thou indeed smite him with
another stone, and add unto him another wound? I, for my part, think not; but even as it
was, thou wouldest endeavor to cure it. Why then doest thou the contrary with respect to
the poor? Knowest thou not how much power a word hath, both to raise up, and to cast
down? “For a word,” it is said, “is better than a gift.”1506</p>
<p>Dost thou not consider that thou art thrusting the sword into thyself, and art receiving
a more grievous wound, when he, being reviled, silently withdraws, with groans and many
tears? Since indeed of God he is sent unto thee. Consider then, in insulting him, upon whom
thou art causing the insult to pass; when God indeed sends him unto thee, and commands
thee to give, but thou, so far from giving, dost even insult him on his coming.</p>
<p>And if thou art not aware how exceedingly amiss this is, look at it as among men, and
then thou wilt fully know the greatness of the sin. As thus: if a servant of thine had been
commanded by thee to go to another servant, who had money of thine, to receive it, and
were to come back not only with empty hands, but also with despiteful usage; what wouldest
thou not do to him that had wrought the insult? What penalty wouldest thou not exact, as
though, after this, it were thyself that had been ill used?</p>
<p>This reckoning do thou make in regard of God also; for truly it is He that sends the
poor to us, and of His we give, if indeed we do give. But if, besides not giving, we also send
them away insulted, consider how many bolts, how many thunders, that which we are doing
deserves.</p>
<p>Duly considering then all these things, let us both bridle our tongue, and put away inhumanity,
and let us stretch forth the hand to give alms, and not with money only, but with

words also, let us relieve such as are in need; that we may both escape the punishment for

<p>Matt. XI. 1.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding His twelve disciples, He
departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.”</p>
<p>That is, after He had sent them, He proceeded to withdraw Himself, to give them room
and opportunity to do what He had enjoined. For while He was present and healing, no one
would be willing to approach them.</p>
<p>“Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Jesus,1507he sent two of1508his
disciples, and asked Him, saying, Art thou He that should come,1509or do we look for another?”</p>
<p>But Luke saith, they also told John of the miracles, and then he sent them.1511 However,
this contains no matter of difficulty, but of consideration only; for this, among other things,
indicates their jealousy towards Him.</p>
<p>But what follows is completely among the controverted points. Of what nature then is
this? Their saying, “Art Thou He that should come, or do we look for another?” That is, he
that knew Him before His miracles, he that had learned it of the Spirit, he that heard it of
the Father, he who had proclaimed Him before all men; doth he now send to learn of Him,
whether it be Himself or no? And if yet thou didst not know that it is surely He, how thinkest
thou thyself credible, affirming as thou dost concerning things, whereof thou art ignorant?
For he that is to bear witness to others, must be first worthy of credit himself. Didst thou
not say, “I am not meet to loose the latchet of His shoe?”1512 Didst thou not say, “I knew
Him not, but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit descending and resting upon Him, the same is He which baptizeth
with the Holy Ghost?”1513 Didst thou not see the Spirit in form of a dove? didst thou not
hear the voice? Didst thou not utterly forbid Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized of
Thee?”1514 Didst thou not say even to thy disciples, “He must increase, I must decrease?”1515

Didst thou not teach all the people, that “He should baptize them with the Holy Ghost and
with fire?”1516and that He “is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world?”1517
Didst thou not before His signs and miracles proclaim all these things? How then now, when
He hath been made manifest to all, and the fame of Him hath gone out everywhere, and
dead men have been raised, and devils driven away, and a display made of so great miracles,
dost thou after this send to learn of Him?</p>
<p>What then is the fact? Were all these sayings a kind of fraud: a stage play and fables?
Nay, who that hath any understanding would say so? I say not, John, who leaped in the
womb, who before his own birth proclaimed Him, the citizen of the wilderness, the exhibitor
of the conversation of angels; but even though he were one of the common sort, and of
them that are utterly outcast, he would not have hesitated, after so many testimonies, both
on his own part and on the part of others.</p>
<p>Whence it is evident, that neither did he send as being himself in doubt, nor did he ask
in ignorance. Since no one surely could say this, that though he knew it fully, yet on account
of his prison he was become rather timid: for neither was he looking to be delivered therefrom,
nor if he did look for it, would he have betrayed his duty to God, armed as he was
against various kinds of death. For unless he had been prepared for this, he would not have
evinced so great courage towards a whole people, practised in shedding blood of prophets;
nor would he have rebuked that savage tyrant with so much boldness in the midst of the
city and the forum, severely chiding him, as though he were a little child, in hearing of all
men. And even if he were grown more timid, how was he not ashamed before his own disciples,
in whose presence he had so often borne witness unto Him, but asked his question
by them, which he should have done by others? And yet surely he knew full well, that they
too were jealous of Christ, and desired to find some handle against Him. And how could
he but be abashed before the Jewish people, in whose presence he had proclaimed such high
things? Or what advantage accrued to him thereby, towards deliverance from his bonds?
For not for Christ’s sake had he been cast into prison, nor for having proclaimed His power,
but for his own rebuke touching the unlawful marriage. And what child so silly, what person
so frantic, but that so he would have put on himself their character?1518</p>
<p>2. What then is it which he is bringing about? For that it belongs not to John to have
doubt hereupon, no nor to any ordinary person, nor even to one extremely foolish and
frenzied; so much is evident from what we have said. And now we have only to add the
solution.</p>

<pb n="426"/>
<p>For what intent then did he send to ask? John’s disciples were starting aside from Jesus,
and this surely any one may see, and they had always a jealous feeling towards Him. And it
is plain, from what they said to their master: “He that was with thee,” it is said, “beyond
Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come unto
Him.”1519 And again, “There arose a question between John’s disciples and the Jews about
purifying.”1520 And again they came unto Him, and said, “Why do we and the Pharisees
fast oft, but Thy disciples fast not?”1521 For as yet they knew not who Christ was, but imagining
Jesus to be a mere man, but John greater than after the manner of man, were vexed
at seeing the former held in estimation, but the latter, as he had said, now ceasing. And this
hindered them from coming unto Him, their jealousy quite blocking up the access. Now so
long as John was with them, he was exhorting them continually and instructing them, and
not even so did he persuade them; but when he was now on the point of dying, he uses the
more diligence: fearing as he did lest he might leave a foundation for bad doctrine, and they
continue broken off from Christ. For as he was diligent even at first to bring to Christ all
that pertained to himself; so on his failing to persuade them, now towards his end he does
but exert the more zeal.</p>
<p>Now if he had said, “Go ye away unto Him, He is better than I,” he would not have
persuaded them, minded as they were not easily to be separated from him, but rather he
would have been thought to say it out of modesty, and they would have been the more rivetted
to him; or if he had held his peace, then again nothing was gained. What then doth
he? He waits to hear from them that Christ is working miracles, and not even so doth he
admonish them, nor doth he send all, but some two (whom he perhaps knew to be more
teachable than the rest); that the inquiry might be made without suspicion, in order that
from His acts they might learn the difference between Jesus and himself. And he saith, Go
ye, and say, “Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another?”1522</p>
<p>But Christ knowing the purpose of John, did not say, I am He; for this would again have
offended the hearers, although this was what it naturally followed for Him to say, but He
leaves them to learn it from His acts. For it saith, “when these were come to Him, then “He
cured many.”1523 And yet what congruity was there, that being asked, “Art thou He,” He
should say nothing to that, but should presently cure them that were sick; unless it had been

<pb n="427"/>
His mind to establish this which I have mentioned? Because they of course would account
the testimony of His deeds surer, and more above suspicion than that of His words.</p>
<p>Knowing therefore, as being God, the mind with which John had sent them, He
straightway cured blind, lame, and many others; not to teach him (for how should He him
that was convinced), but these that were doubting: and having healed them, He saith,</p>
<p>“Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see; the blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are
raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached unto them.”1524 And he added, “And
blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me;”1525implying that He knows even their
unuttered thoughts. For if He had said, “I am He,” both this would have offended them, as
I have already said; and they would have thought, even if they had not spoken, much as the
Jews said to Him, “Thou bearest record of Thyself.”1526 Wherefore He saith not this Himself,
but leaves them to learn all from the miracles, freeing what He taught from suspicion, and
making it plainer. Wherefore also He covertly added His reproof of them. That is, because
they were “offended in Him,” He by setting forth their case and leaving it to their own
conscience alone, and by calling no witness of this His accusation, but only themselves that
knew it all, did thus also draw them the more unto Himself, in saying, Blessed is he, whosoever
shall not be offended in me.” For indeed His secret meaning was of them when He said
this.</p>
<p>3. But in order to our making the truth more evident to you by the comparison of the
several statements, producing not only our own sayings, but also what is stated by others;
we must needs add some account of them.</p>
<p>What then do some affirm? That this which we have stated was not the cause, but that
John was in ignorance, yet not in ignorance of all; but that He was the Christ, he knew, but
whether He was also to die for mankind, he knew not, therefore he said, “Art Thou He that
should come?” that is, He that is to descend into hell.1527 But this is not tenable; for neither
of this was John ignorant. This at least he proclaimed even before all the others, and bare
record of this first, “Behold,” saith he, “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world.”1528 Now he called Him a lamb, as proclaiming the cross, and again in saying, “That
taketh away the sin of the world,” he declared this same thing. For not otherwise than by
the cross did He effect this; as Paul likewise said: “And the handwriting which was contrary

to us, even it He took out of the way, nailing it to His cross.”1529 And his saying too, “He
shall baptize you with the Spirit,”1530is that of one who was foretelling the events after the
resurrection.</p>
<p>Well: that He was to rise again, he knew, say they, and that He was to give the Holy
Ghost; but that He should likewise be crucified, he knew not. How then was He to rise again,
who had not suffered, nor been crucified? And how was this man greater than a prophet,
who knew not even what the prophets knew? For that he was greater than a prophet, even
Christ Himself bare record,1531but that the prophets knew of the passion is surely plain to
every one. For so Isaiah saith, “He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearer is dumb.”1532 And before this testimony also he saith, “There shall be a root of
Jesse, and He that shall rise again to rule the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust.”1533
Then speaking of His passion, and of the ensuing glory, he added, “And His rest shall be
honor.” And this prophet foretold not only that He should be crucified, but also with whom.
“For,” saith he, “He was numbered with the transgressors.”1534 And not this only, but that
He should not even plead for Himself; “For this man,” he saith, “openeth not His mouth:”
and that He should be unjustly condemned; “For in His humiliation,” saith he, “His judgment
was taken away.”1535 And before this again, David both saith this, and describes the judgment
hall. “Why,” saith he, “do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings
of the earth stand up, and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord, and against His
anointed.”1536 And elsewhere he mentions also the image of the cross, saying on this wise,
“They pierced my hand and my feet,”1537and those things which the soldiers were emboldened
to do, he adds with all exactness, “For they parted my garments,” saith he, “among
them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.”1538 And elsewhere again he saith, that they
also offered Him vinegar; “For they gave me,” saith He, “gall for my meat, and for my thirst
they made me drink vinegar.”1539</p>

<pb n="429"/>
<p>So then the prophets, so many years before, speak of the hall of judgment, and of the
condemnation, and of them that were crucified with Him, and of the division of the garments,
and of the lot cast upon them, and of many more things besides (for indeed it is unnecessary
to allege all now, lest we make our discourse long): and was this man, greater than
them all, ignorant of all these things? Nay, how should this be reasonable?</p>
<p>And why did he not say, “Art thou He that should come to hell,”1540but simply, “He
that should come?” Although this were far more absurd than the others, I mean their saying,
“he therefore said these things, that he might preach there also after his departure.” To
whom it were seasonable to say, “Brethren, be not children in understanding, howbeit in
malice be ye children.”1541 For the present life indeed is the season for right conversation,
but after death is judgment and punishment. “For in hell,” it is said, “who will confess unto
thee?”1542</p>
<p>How then were “the gates of brass burst, and the bars of iron broken in sunder”?1543
By His body; for then first was a body shown, immortal, and destroying the tyranny of death.
And besides, this indicates the destruction of the might of death, not the loosing of the sins
of those who had died before His coming. And if this were not so, but He have delivered all
that were before Him from hell,1544how saith He, “It shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrah?”1545 For this saying supposes that those are also to be punished;
more mildly indeed, yet still that they are to be punished. And yet they did also suffer here
the most extreme punishment, nevertheless not even this will deliver them. And if it is so
with them, much more with such as have suffered nothing.</p>
<p>“What then?” one may say, “were they wronged, who lived before His coming?” By no
means, for men might then be saved, even though they had not confessed Christ. For this
was not required of them, but not to worship idols, and to know the true God. “For the Lord
thy God,” it is said, “is one Lord.”1546 Therefore the Maccabees were admired, because for
the observance of the law they suffered what they did suffer; and the three children, and
many others too amongst the Jews, having shown forth a very virtuous life, and having
maintained the standard of this their knowledge, had nothing more required of them. For
then it was sufficient for salvation, as I have said already, to know God only; but now it is
so no more, but there is need also of the knowledge of Christ. Therefore He said, “If I had

<pb n="430"/>
not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for their
sin.”1547</p>
<p>So likewise with regard to the rule of practice. Then murder was the destruction of him
that committed it, but now even to be angry. And then to commit adultery, and to lie with
another man’s wife, brought punishment, but now even to look with unchaste eyes. For as
the knowledge, so also the rule of life is now made stricter. So that there was no need of a
forerunner there.</p>
<p>And besides, if unbelievers are after death to be saved on their believing, no man shall
ever perish. For all will then repent and adore. And in proof that this is true, hear Paul saying,
“Every tongue shall confess, and every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in
earth, and things under the earth.”1548 And, “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death.”1549 But there is no advantage in that submission, for it comes not of a rightly disposed
choice, but of the necessity of things, as one may say, thenceforth taking place.</p>
<p>Let us not then any more bring in such old wives’ doctrines, and Jewish fables. Hear at
least what Paul saith touching these things. “For as many as have sinned without law, shall
also perish without law;”1550where his discourse is of those who lived in the time before the
law; and, “As many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law,”1551speaking of
all after Moses. And, “That the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness,
and unrighteousness of men,”1552and, “indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish
upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.”1553 And
yet countless were the evils which the Gentiles have suffered in this world, and this is declared
alike by the histories of the heathens, and by the Scriptures that are in our hands. For who
could recount the tragic calamities of the Babylonians, or those of the Egyptians? But in
proof that they who, not having known Christ before His coming in the flesh, yet refrained
from idolatry and worshipped God only, and showed forth an excellent life, shall enjoy all
the blessings; hear what is said: “But glory, and honor, and peace to every one that worketh
good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.” Seest thou that for their good deeds there are
many rewards, and chastisements again, and penalties for such as have done the contrary?</p>
<p>4. Where now, tell me, are the utter unbelievers in hell? Why, if those before Christ’s
coming, who had not so much as heard the name of hell,1554nor of a resurrection, and were

punished here, shall suffer punishment there also; how much more we that have been nurtured
in so many lessons of strict virtue?1555</p>
<p>And how is it reasonable, asks one, that they that have never heard of hell,1556should
fall into hell? For they will say, “If thou hadst threatened hell, we should have feared more,
and have been sobered.” To be sure; (is it not so?) at our rate of living now, who hear daily
the sayings about hell, and give no heed at all.</p>
<p>And besides, there is this also to be said; that he who is not restrained by the judgments
in sight, much less will he be restrained by those others. For the less reasonable sort, and
those of a grosser disposition, are wont to be sobered rather by things which are at hand,
and straightway to happen, than by such as will come to pass a long time after. “But over
us,” one may say, “a greater fear is suspended, and herein were they wronged.” By no means.
For first, there are not the same measures1557set to us as to them, but much greater for us.
Now they that have undertaken greater labors, ought to enjoy greater help. And it is no little
help, that our fear has been increased. And if we have an advantage over them in knowing
things to come, they have an advantage over us in that the severe punishments are presently
laid upon them.</p>
<p>But there is something else, which the multitude say with respect to this also. For “where,”
say they, “is God’s justice, when any one for sinning here, is punished both here and there?”
Would ye then I should put you in mind of your own sayings, that ye may no longer give
us trouble, but furnish the solution from within yourselves. I have heard many of our people,
if haply they were told of a murderer cut off in a court of justice, how they had indignation,
and talked in this way: “This unholy and accursed wretch, having perpetrated thirty murders,
or even many more, hath himself undergone one death only; and where is the justice of it?”
So that ye yourselves confess, that one death is not sufficient for punishment; how give ye
then an opposite sentence now. Because not others but yourselves are the objects of your
judgment: so great a hindrance is self-love to our perceiving what is just. Because of this,
when we are judging others, we search out all things with strictness, but when we are sitting
in judgment on ourselves, we are blinded. Since if we were to search into these things in our
own case too, as we do with regard to other men, we should give an uncorrupt sentence.
For we also have sins, deserving not two or three, but ten thousand deaths. And to pass over
all the rest, let us recollect ourselves, as many of us as partake unworthily of the mysteries;
such men being guilty of the body and blood of Christ. Wherefore, when thou art talking
of the murderer, take account of thyself also. For he indeed hath murdered a man, but thou

art under the guilt of slaying the Lord; and he, not having partaken of mysteries, but we,
while enjoying the benefit of the sacred table.</p>
<p>And what are they that bite and devour their brethren, and pour out such abundance
of venom? What is he that robs the poor of their food? For if he who imparts not of his own,
is such as I have said, much more he that takes the things of others.1558 How many robbers
do the covetous surpass in wickedness! how many murderers and robbers of tombs, the rapacious!
and how many after spoiling men are desirous even of their blood!</p>
<p>“Nay,” saith he, “God forbid.” Now thou sayest, God forbid. When thou hast an enemy,
then say, God forbid, and call to mind what hath been said, and show forth a life full of great
strictness; lest the portion of Sodom await us also, lest we suffer the lot of Gomorrha, lest
we undergo the ills of the Tyrians and Sidonians; or rather, lest we offend Christ, which
were a thing more grievous and more to be feared than all.</p>
<p>For though to many hell1559seem to be a fearful thing, yet I for my part will not cease
continually to say, that this is more grievous and fearful than any hell; and you I entreat to
be of the same mind. For so shall we both be delivered from hell, and enjoy the glory that
is bestowed of Christ; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XXXVII.</head>
<p>Matt. X. 7, 8, 9.</p>
<p>“And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went
ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for
to see? A man clothed in soft raiment; behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’
houses. But what went ye out for to see? A prophet?1560yea, I say unto you, and more than
a prophet.”</p>
<p>For the matter indeed of John’s disciples had been ordered well, and they were gone
away assured by the miracles which had just been performed; but there was need after that
of remedy as regarded the people. For although they could not suspect anything of the kind
of their own master, the common people might from the inquiry of John’s disciples form
many strange suspicions, not knowing the mind with which he sent his disciples. And it
was natural for them to reason with themselves, and say, “He that bore such abundant witness,
hath he now changed his persuasion, and doth he doubt whether this or another be
He that should come? Can it be, that in dissension with Jesus he saith this? that the prison
hath made him more timid? that his former words were spoken vainly, and at random?” It
being then natural for them to suspect many such things, see how He corrects their weakness,
and removes these their suspicions. For “as they departed, He began to say to the multitudes.”
Why, “as they departed?” That He might not seem to be flattering the man.</p>
<p>And in correcting the people, He doth not publish their suspicion, but adds only the
solution of the thoughts that were mentally disturbing them: signifying that He knew the
secrets of all men. For He saith not, as unto the Jews, “Wherefore think ye evil?”1561 Because
if they had it in their minds, not of wickedness did they so reason, but of ignorance on the
points that had been spoken of. Wherefore neither doth He discourse unto them in the way
of rebuke, but merely sets right their understanding, and defends John, and signifies that
he is not fallen away from his former opinion, neither is he changed, not being at all a man
easily swayed and fickle, but steadfast and sure, and far from being such as to betray the
things committed unto him.</p>
<p>And in establishing this, He employs not at first his own sentence, but their former
testimony, pointing out how they bare record of his firmness, not by their words only, but
also by their deeds.</p>
<note type="footnote">1560 [R.V. text, “But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet?” In the margin the received reading is given.

<pb n="434"/>
<p>Wherefore He saith, “What went ye out into the wilderness to see?” as though He had
said, Wherefore did ye leave your cities, and your houses, and come together all of you into
the wilderness? To see a pitiful and flexible kind of person? Nay, this were out of all reason,
this is not what is indicated by that earnestness, and the concourse of all men unto the wilderness.
So much people and so many cities would not have poured themselves out with so
great zeal towards the wilderness and the river Jordan at that time, had ye not expected to
see some great and marvellous one, one firmer than any rock. Yea, it was not “a reed” surely,
that “ye went out to see shaken by the wind:” for the flexible and such as are lightly brought
round, and now say one thing, now another, and stand firm in nothing, are most like that.</p>
<p>And see how He omits all wickedness, and mentions this, which then especially
haunted1562them; and removes the suspicion of lightness.</p>
<p>“But what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear
soft clothing are in kings’ houses.”1563
Now His meaning is like this: He was not of himself a waverer; and this ye yourselves
showed by your earnestness. Much less could any one say this, that he was indeed firm, but
having made himself a slave to luxury, he afterwards became languid. For among men, some
are such as they are of themselves, others become so; for instance, one man is passionate by
nature, and another from having fallen into a long illness gets this infirmity. Again, some
men are flexible and fickle by nature, while others become so by being slaves to luxury, and
by living effeminately. “But John,” saith He, “neither was such a character by nature, for
neither was it a reed that ye went out to see; nor by giving himself to luxury did he lose the
advantage he possessed.” For that he did not make himself a slave to luxury, his garb shows,
and the wilderness, and the prison. Since, had he been minded to wear soft raiment, he
would not have lived in the wilderness, nor in the prison, but in the king’s courts: it being
in his power, merely by keeping silence, to have enjoyed honor without limit. For since
Herod so reverenced him, even when he had rebuked him, and was in chains, much more
would he have courted him, had he held his peace. You see, he had indeed given proof of
his firmness and fortitude; and how could he justly incur suspicions of that kind?</p>
<p>2. When therefore as well by the place, as by his garments, and by their concourse unto
Him, He had delineated his character, He proceeds to bring in the prophet. For having said,
“Why went ye out? To see a prophet? Yea I say unto you, and more than a prophet;”1564
He goes on, “For this is he of whom it is written,1565 Behold, I send my messenger before
Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee.”1566 Having before set down the testi-

mony of the Jews, He then applies that of the prophets; or rather, He puts in the first place
the sentence of the Jews, which must have been a very strong demonstration, the witness
being borne by his enemies; secondly, the man’s life; thirdly, His own judgment; fourthly,
the prophet; by all means stopping their mouths.</p>
<p>Then lest they should say, “But what if at that time indeed he were such an one, but now
is changed?” He added also what follows; his garments, his prison, and together with these
the prophecy.</p>
<p>Then having said, that he is greater than a prophet, He signifies also in what he is
greater. And in what is he greater? In being near Him that was come. For, “I send,” saith
He, “my messenger before Thy face;” that is, nigh Thee. For as with kings, they who ride
near the chariot, these are more illustrious than the rest, just so John also appears in his
course near the advent itself. See how He signified John’s excellency by this also; and not
even here doth He stop, but adds afterwards His own suffrage as well, saying, “Verily I say
unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not arisen a greater than John
the Baptist.”1567</p>
<p>Now what He said is like this: “woman hath not borne a greater than this man.” And
His very sentence is indeed sufficient; but if thou art minded to learn from facts also, consider
his table, his manner of life, the height of his soul.1568 For he so lived as though he were in
heaven: and having got above the necessities of nature, he travelled as it were a new way,
spending all his time in hymns and prayers, and holding intercourse with none among men,
but with God alone continually. For he did not so much as see any of his fellow-servants,
neither was he seen by any one of them; he fed not on milk, he enjoyed not the comfort of
bed, or roof, or market, or any other of the things of men; and yet he was at once mild and
earnest. Hear, for example, how considerately he reasons with his own disciples, courageously
with the people of the Jews, how openly with the king. For this cause He said also, “There
hath not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the Baptist.”</p>
<p>3. But lest the exceeding greatness of His praises should produce a sort of extravagant
feeling, the Jews honoring John above Christ; mark how He corrects this also. For as the
things which edified His own disciples did harm to the multitudes, they supposing Him an
easy kind of person; so again the remedies employed for the multitudes might have proved
more mischievous, they deriving from Christ’s words a more reverential opinion of John
than of Himself.</p>
<p>Wherefore this also, in an unsuspected way, He corrects by saying, “He that is less,1569in
the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.” Less in age, and according to the opinion of the

multitude, since they even called Him “a gluttonous man and a winebibber;”1570and, “Is
not this the carpenter’s son?”1571and on every occasion they used to make light of Him.</p>
<p>“What then?” it may be said, “is it by comparison that He is greater than John?” Far
from it. For neither when John saith, “He is mightier than I,”1572doth he say it as comparing
them; nor Paul, when remembering Moses he writes, “For this man was counted worthy of
more glory than Moses,”1573doth he so write by way of comparison; and He Himself too,
in saying, “Behold, a greater than Solomon is here,”1574speaks not as making a comparison.</p>
<p>Or if we should even grant that this was said by Him in the way of comparison, this was
done in condescension,1575because of the weakness of the hearers. For the men really had
their gaze very much fixed upon John; and then he was rendered the more illustrious both
by his imprisonment, and by his plainness of speech to the king; and it was a great point for
the present, that even so much should be received among the multitude. And so too, the
Old Testament uses in the same way to correct the souls of the erring, by putting together
in a way of comparison things that cannot be compared; as when it saith, “Among the gods
there is none like unto Thee, O Lord:”1576and again, “There is no god like our God.”1577</p>
<p>Now some affirm, that Christ said this of the apostles, others again, of angels.1578 Thus,
when any have turned aside from the truth, they are wont to wander many ways. For what
sort of connexion hath it, to speak either of angels or of apostles? And besides, if He were

lowest angel serving God in Heaven is greater than any, even the first of men who as yet dwells on earth.” St.
Jerome, in loco. “Finally, it is so utterly impossible that there should be any comparison between John and the
Son of God, that the former is of less esteem even than the angels. Thus, on the one hand, inasmuch as He had
called him an angel” (Mal. iii. 1), “He is of course set above men; on the other, because he had declared him
chief among those born of women, He therefore added, For he who is lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he: that you might know he could not compare with the angels.” St. Ambr. on St. Luke, vii. 27; St. Aug.

speaking of the apostles, what hindered his bringing them forward by name? whereas, when
He is speaking of Himself, He naturally conceals His person, because of the still prevailing
suspicion, and that He may not seem to say anything great of Himself; yea, and we often
find Him doing so.</p>
<p>But what is, “In the kingdom of heaven?” Among spiritual beings, and all them that are
in heaven.</p>
<p>And moreover His saying, “There hath not risen among them that are born of women
a greater than John,” suited one contrasting John with Himself, and thus tacitly excepting
Himself. For though He too were born of a woman, yet not as John, for He was not a mere
man, neither was He born in like manner as a man, but by a strange and wondrous kind of
birth.</p>
<p>4. “And from the days of John the Baptist,” saith He, “until now, the kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”1579</p>
<p>And what sort of connexion may this have with what was said before? Much, assuredly,
and in full accordance therewith. Yea, by this topic also He proceeds to urge and press them
into the faith of Himself; and at the same time likewise, He is speaking in agreement with
what had been before said by John. “For if all things are fulfilled even down to John, I am
“He that should come.”</p>
<p>“For all the prophets,” saith He, “and the law prophesied until John.”1580</p>
<p>For the prophets would not have ceased, unless I were come. Expect therefore nothing
further, neither wait for any one else. For that I am He is manifest both from the prophets
ceasing, and from those that every day “take by force” the faith that is in me. For so manifest
is it and certain, that many even take it by force. Why, who hath so taken it? tell me. All who
approach it with earnestness of mind.</p>
<p>Then He states also another infallible sign, saying, “If ye will receive it, he is Elias, which
was for to come.” For “I will send you,” it is said, “Elias the Tishbite, who shall turn the heart
of the father to the children.”1581 This man then is Elias, if ye attend exactly, saith He. For
“I will send,” saith He, “my messenger before Thy face.”1582</p>
<p>And well hath He said, “If ye will receive it,” to show the absence of force. For I do not
constrain, saith He. And this He said, as requiring a candid mind, and showing that John
is Elias, and Elias John. For both of them received one ministry, and both of them became
forerunners. Wherefore neither did He simply say, “This is Elias,” but, “If ye are willing to

<pb n="438"/>
receive it, this is he,” that is, if with a candid mind ye give heed to what is going on. And He
did not stop even at this, but to the words, “This is Elias, which was for to come,” He added,
to show that understanding is needed, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”1583</p>
<p>Now He used so many dark sayings, to stir them up to inquiry. And if not even so were
they awakened, much more, had all been plain and clear. For this surely no man could say,
that they dared not ask Him, and that He was difficult of approach. For they that were asking
him questions, and tempting Him about common matters, and whose mouths were stopped
a thousand times, yet they did not withdraw from Him; how should they but have inquired
of Him, and besought Him touching the indispensable things, had they indeed been desirous
to learn? For if concerning the matters of the law they asked, “Which is the first commandment,”
and all such questions, although there was of course no need of His telling them that;
how should they but ask the meaning of what He Himself said, for which also He was bound
to give account in His answers? And especially when it was He Himself that was encouraging
and drawing them on to do this. For by saying, “The violent take it by force,” He stirs them
up to earnestness of mind; and by saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” He doth
just the same thing.</p>
<p>5. “But whereunto shall I liken this generation?” saith He, “It is like unto children sitting
in the market place, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.”1584 This again seems to be unconnected
with what came before, but it is the most natural consequence thereof. Yea, He still keeps
to the same point, the showing that John is acting in harmony with Himself, although the
results were opposite; as indeed with respect to his inquiry also. And He implies that there
was nothing that ought to have been done for their salvation, and was omitted; which thing
the prophet1585saith of the vineyard; “What ought I to have done to this vineyard, and have
not done it? For whereunto,” saith He, “shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children
sitting in the market, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced, we have
mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking,
and they say, He hath a devil.1586 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say,
Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.”1587</p>
<p>Now what He saith is like this: We have come each of us an opposite way, I and John;
and we have done just as if it were some hunters with a wild beast that was hard to catch,

and which might by two ways fall into the toils; as if each of the two were to cut it off his
several way, and drive it, taking his stand opposite to the other; so that it must needs fall
into one of the two snares. Mark, for instance, the whole race of man, how it is astonished
at the wonder of men’s fasting, and at this hard and self-denying life. For this reason it had
been so ordered, that John should be thus brought up from his earliest youth, so that hereby
(among other things) his sayings might obtain credit.</p>
<p>But wherefore, it may be asked, did not He Himself choose that way? In the first place
He did also Himself proceed by it, when He fasted the forty days, and went about teaching,
and not having where to lay His head. Nevertheless He did also in another mode accomplish
this same object, and provide for the advantage thence accruing. For to be testified of by
him that came this way was the same thing, or even a much greater thing than to have come
this way Himself.</p>
<p>And besides, John indeed exhibited no more than his life and conversation; for “John,”
it is said, “did no sign,”1588but He Himself had the testimony also from signs and from
miracles. Leaving therefore John to be illustrious by his fasting, He Himself came the opposite
way, both coming unto publicans’ tables, and eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Let us ask the Jews then, “Is fasting a good thing, and to be admired? you should then
have obeyed John, and received him, and believed his sayings. For so would those sayings
have led you towards Jesus. Is fasting, on the other hand, a thing grievous, and burdensome?
then should you have obeyed Jesus, and have believed in Him that came the opposite way.
Thus, either way, ye would have found yourselves in the kingdom.” But, like an intractable
wild beast, they were speaking evil of both. The fault is not then theirs who were not believed,
but they are to be blamed who did not believe. For no man would ever choose to speak evil
of opposite things, any more than he would on the other hand commend them. I mean thus:
he that approves the cheerful and free character, will not approve him that is sad and grave;
he that commends the man of a sad countenance will not commend the cheerful man. For
it is a thing impossible to give your vote both ways at once. Therefore also He saith, “We
have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;” that is, “I have exhibited the freer kind of
life, and ye obeyed not:” and, “We have mourned, and ye have not lamented;” that is, “John
followed the rugged and grave life, and ye took no heed.” And He saith not, “he this, I that,”
but the purpose of both being one, although their modes of life were opposite, for this cause
He speaks of their doings as common. Yea, for even their coming by opposite ways arose
out of a most exact accordance, such as continued looking to one and the same end. What
sort of excuse then can ye have after all this?</p>
<note type="footnote">1588 John x. 41.</note>

<pb n="440"/>
<p>Wherefore He subjoined, “And wisdom is justified of her children;”1589that is, though
ye be not persuaded, yet with me after this ye cannot find fault. As the prophet saith
touching the Father, “That Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings.”1590 For God, though
He should effect nothing more by His care over us, fulfills all His part, so as to leave to them
that will be shameless not so much as a shadow of excuse for uncandid doubt.</p>
<p>And if the similitudes be mean, and of an ill sound, marvel not, for He was discoursing
with a view to the weakness of His hearers. Since Ezekiel too mentions many similitudes
like them, and unworthy of God’s majesty.1591 But this too especially becomes His tender
care.</p>
<p>And mark them, how in another respect also they are carried about into contradictory
opinions. For whereas they had said of John, “he hath a devil,”1592they stopped not at this,
but said the very same again concerning Him,1593taking as He did the opposite course; thus
were they forever carried about into conflicting opinions.</p>
<p>But Luke herewith sets down also another and a heavier charge against them, saying,
“For the publicans justified God, having received the baptism of John.”1594</p>
<p>6. Then He proceeds to upbraid the cities now that wisdom hath been justified; now
that He hath shown all to be fully performed. That is, having failed to persuade them, He
now doth but lament over them; which is more than terrifying. For He had exhibited both
His teaching by His words, and His wonder-working power by His signs. But forasmuch as
they abode in their own unbelief, He now does but upbraid.</p>
<p>For “then,” it is said, “began Jesus to upbraid the cities, wherein most of His mighty
works were done, because they repented not; saying, Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto
thee, Bethsaida!”1595</p>
<p>Then, to show thee that they are not such by nature, He states also the name of the city
out of which proceeded five apostles. For both Philip, and those two pairs of the chief
apostles, were from thence.1596</p>
<p>“For if,” saith He, “the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be

more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum,
which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell,1597for if the mighty
works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until
this day. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
judgment, than for thee.”1598</p>
<p>And He adds not Sodom with the others for nought, but to aggravate the charge against
them. Yea, for it is a very great proof of wickedness, when not only of them that now are,
but even of all those that ever were wicked, none are found so bad as they.</p>
<p>Thus elsewhere also He makes a comparison, condemning them by the Ninevites, and
by the Queen of the south; there, however, it was by them that did right, here, even by them
that sinned; a thing far more grievous. With this law of condemnation, Ezekiel too was acquainted:
wherefore also he said to Jerusalem, “Thou hast justified thy sisters in all thy
sins.”1599 Thus everywhere is He wont to linger in the Old Testament, as in a favored place.
And not even at this doth He stay His speech, but makes their fears yet more intense, by
saying, that they should suffer things more grievous than Sodomites and Tyrians, so as by
every means to gather them in, both by bewailing, and by alarming them.</p>
<p>7. To these same things let us also listen: since not for the unbelievers only, but for us
also, hath He appointed a punishment more grievous than that of the Sodomites, if we will
not receive the strangers that come in unto us; I mean, when He commanded to shake off
the very dust: and very fitly. For as to the Sodomites, although they committed a great
transgression, yet it was before the law and grace; but we, after so much care shown towards
us, of what indulgence should we be worthy, showing so much inhospitality, and shutting
our doors against them that are in need, and before our doors our ears? or rather not against
the poor only, but against the apostles themselves? For therefore we do it to the poor, because
we do it to the very apostles. For whereas Paul is read, and thou attendest not; whereas John
preaches, and thou hearest not: when wilt thou receive a poor man, who wilt not receive an
apostle?</p>
<p>In order then that both our houses may be continually open to the one, and our ears to
the others, let us purge away the filth from the ears of our soul. For as filth and mud close
up the ears of our flesh, so do the harlot’s songs, and worldly news, and debts, and the
business of usury and loans, close up the ear of the mind, worse than any filth; nay rather,
they do not close it up only, but also make it unclean. And they are putting dung in your
ears, who tell you of these things. And that which the barbarian threatened, saying, “Ye shall

eat your own dung,” and what follows;1600this do these men also make you undergo, not
in word, but in deeds; or rather, somewhat even much worse. For truly those songs are more
loathsome even than all this; and what is yet worse, so far from feeling annoyance when ye
hear them, ye rather laugh, when ye ought to abominate them and fly.</p>
<p>But if they be not abominable, go down unto the stage, imitate that which thou praisest;
or rather, do thou merely take a walk with him that is exciting that laugh. Nay, thou couldest
not bear it. Why then bestow on him so great honor? Yea, while the laws that are enacted
by the Gentiles would have them to be dishonored, thou receivest them with thy whole city,
like ambassadors and generals, and dost convoke all men, to receive dung in their ears. And
thy servant, if he say anything filthy in thy hearing, will receive stripes in abundance; and
be it a son, a wife, whoever it may, that doth as I have said, thou callest the act an affront;
but if worthless fellows, that deserve the scourge, should invite thee to hear the filthy words,
not only art thou not indignant, thou dost even rejoice and applaud. And what could be
equal to this folly?</p>
<p>But dost thou thyself never utter these base words? Why what is the profit? or rather,
this very fact, whence is it manifest? For if thou didst not utter these things, neither wouldest
thou at all laugh at hearing them, nor wouldest thou run with such zeal to the voice that
makes thee ashamed.</p>
<p>For tell me, art thou pleased at hearing men blaspheme? Dost thou not rather shudder,
and stop thine ears? Surely I think thou dost. Why so? Because thou blasphemest not thyself.
Just so do thou act with respect to filthy talking also; and if thou wouldest show us clearly,
that thou hast no pleasure in filthy speaking, endure not so much as to hear them. For when
wilt thou be able to become good, bred up as thou art with such sounds in thine ears? When
wilt thou venture to undergo such labors as chastity requires, now that thou art falling
gradually away through this laughter, these songs, and filthy words? Yea, it is a great thing
for a soul that keeps itself pure from all this, to be able to become grave and chaste; how
much more for one that is nourished up in such hearings? Know ye not, that we are of the
two more inclined to evil? While then we make it even an art, and a business, when shall
we escape that furnace?</p>
<p>8. Heardest thou not what Paul saith, “Rejoice in the Lord?”1601 He said not, “in the
devil.” When then wilt thou be able to hear Paul? when, to gain a sense of thy wrong actions?
drunken as thou art, ever and incessantly, with the spectacle I was speaking of. For thy
having come here is nothing wonderful nor great; or rather it is wonderful. For here thou
<note type="footnote">1600 Isa. xxxvi. 12.</note>

<pb n="443"/>
comest any how, and so as just to satisfy a scruple,1602but there with diligence and speed,
and great readiness. And it is evident from what thou bringest home, on returning thence.</p>
<p>For even all the mire that is there poured out for you, by the speeches, by the songs, by
the laughter, ye collect and take every man to his home, or rather not to his home only, but
every man even into his own mind.</p>
<p>And from things not worthy of abhorrence thou turnest away; while others which are
to be abhorred, so far from hating, thou dost even court. Many, for instance, on coming
back from tombs, are used to wash themselves, but on returning from theatres they have
never groaned, nor poured forth any fountains of tears; yet surely the dead man is no unclean
thing, whereas sin induces such a blot, that not even with ten thousand fountains could one
purge it away, but with tears only, and with confessions. But no one hath any sense of this
blot. Thus because we fear not what we ought, therefore we shrink from what we ought not.</p>
<p>And what again is the applause? what the tumult, and the satanical cries, and the devilish
gestures? For first one, being a young man, wears his hair long behind, and changing his
nature into that of a woman, is striving both in aspect, and in gesture, and in garments, and
generally in all ways, to pass into the likeness of a tender damsel.1603 Then another who is
grown old, in the opposite way to this, having his hair shaven, and with his loins girt about,
his shame cut off before his hair, stands ready to be smitten with the rod, prepared both to
say and do anything. The women again, their heads uncovered, stand without a blush, discoursing
with a whole people, so complete is their practice in shamelessness; and thus pour
forth all effrontery and impurity into the souls of their hearers. And their one study is, to
pluck up all chastity from the foundations, to disgrace our nature, to satiate the desire of
the wicked demon. Yea, and there are both foul sayings, and gestures yet fouler; and the
dressing of the hair tends that way, and the gait, and apparel, and voice, and flexure of the
limbs; and there are turnings of the eyes, and flutes, and pipes, and dramas, and plots; and
all things, in short, full of the most extreme impurity. When then wilt thou be sober again,
I pray thee, now that the devil is pouring out for thee so much of the strong wine of
whoredom, mingling so many cups of unchastity? For indeed both adulteries and stolen

marriages are there, and there are women playing the harlot, men prostituting, youths corrupting
themselves: all there is iniquity to the full, all sorcery, all shame. Wherefore they
that sit by should not laugh at these things, but weep and groan bitterly.</p>
<p>“What then? Are we to shut up the stage?” it will be said, “and are all things to be turned
upside down at thy word?” Nay, but as it is, all things are turned upside down. For whence
are they, tell me, that plot against our marriages? Is it not from this theatre? Whence are
they that dig through into chambers? Is it not from that stage? Comes it not of this, when
husbands are insupportable to their wives? of this, when the wives are contemptible to their
husbands? of this, that the more part are adulterers? So that the subverter of all things is he
that goes to the theatre; it is he that brings in a grievous tyranny. “Nay,” thou wilt say, “this
is appointed by the good order of the laws.” Why, to tear away men’s wives, and to insult
young boys, and to overthrow houses, is proper to those who have seized on citadels.1604“And
what adulterer,” wilt thou say, “hath been made such by these spectacles?” Nay, who hath
not been made an adulterer? And if one might but mention them now by name, I could
point out how many husbands those harlots have severed from their wives, how many they
have taken captive, drawing some even from the marriage bed itself, not suffering others so
much as to live at all in marriage.</p>
<p>“What then? I pray thee, are we to overthrow all the laws?” Nay, but it is overthrowing
lawlessness, if we do away with these spectacles. For hence are they that make havoc in our
cities; hence, for example, are seditions and tumults. For they that are maintained by the
dancers, and who sell their own voice to the belly, whose work it is to shout, and to practise
everything that is monstrous, these especially are the men that stir up the populace, that
make the tumults in our cities. For youth, when it hath joined hands with idleness, and is
brought up in so great evils, becomes fiercer than any wild beast. The necromancers too, I
pray thee, whence are they? Is it not from hence, that in order to excite the people who are
idling without object, and make the dancing men have the benefit of much and loud applause,
and fortify the harlot women against the chaste, they proceed so far in sorcery, as not even
to shrink from disturbing the bones of the dead? Comes it not hence, when men are forced
to spend without limit on that wicked choir of the devil? And lasciviousness, whence is that,
and its innumerable mischiefs? Thou seest, it is thou who art subverting our life, by drawing
men to these things, while I am recruiting it by putting them down.</p>
<p>“Let us then pull down the stage,” say they. Would that it were possible to pull it down;
or rather, if ye be willing, as far as regards us, it is pulled down, and digged up. Nevertheless,
I enjoin no such thing. Standing as these places are, I bid you make them of no effect; which
thing were a greater praise than pulling them down.</p>

<p>9. Imitate at least the barbarians, if no one else; for they verily are altogether clean from
seeking such sights. What excuse then can we have after all this, we, the citizens of Heaven,
and partners in the choirs of the cherubim, and in fellowship with the angels, making
ourselves in this respect worse even than the barbarians, and this, when innumerable other
pleasures, better than these, are within our reach?</p>
<p>Why, if thou desirest that thy soul may find delight, go to pleasure grounds, to a river
flowing by, and to lakes, take notice of gardens, listen to grasshoppers as they sing, be continually
by the coffins of martyrs, where is health of body and benefit of soul, and no hurt,
no remorse after the pleasure, as there is here.</p>
<p>Thou hast a wife, thou hast children; what is equal to this pleasure? Thou hast a house,
thou hast friends, these are the true delights: besides their purity, great is the advantage they
bestow. For what, I pray thee, is sweeter than children? what sweeter than a wife, to him
that will be chaste in mind?</p>
<p>To this purpose, we are told, that the barbarians uttered on some occasion a saying full
of wise severity. I mean, that having heard of these wicked spectacles, and the unseasonable
delight of them; “why the Romans,” say they, “have devised these pleasures, as though they
had not wives and children;” implying that nothing is sweeter than children and wife, if
thou art willing to live honestly.</p>
<p>“What then,” one may say, “if I point to some, who are nothing hurt by their pastime
in that place?” In the first place, even this is a hurt, to spend one’s time without object or
fruit, and to become an offense to others. For even if thou shouldest not be hurt, thou makest
some other more eager herein. And how canst thou but be thyself hurt, giving occasion to
what goes on? Yea, both the fortune-teller, and the prostitute boy, and the harlot woman,
and all those choirs of the devil, cast upon thy head the blame of their proceedings. For as
surely as, if there were no spectators, there would be none to follow these employments; so,
since there are, they too have their share of the fire due to such deeds. So that even if in
chastity thou wert quite unhurt (a thing impossible), yet for others’ ruin thou wilt render a
grievous account; both the spectators’, and that of those who assemble them.</p>
<p>And in chastity too thou wouldest profit more, didst thou refrain from going thither.
For if even now thou art chaste, thou wouldest have become chaster by avoiding such sights.
Let us not then delight in useless argument, nor devise unprofitable apologies: there being
but one apology, to flee from the Babylonian furnace, to keep far from the Egyptian harlot,
though one must escape her hands naked.1605</p>
<p>For so shall we both enjoy much delight, our conscience not accusing us, and we shall
live this present life with chastity, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and

<p>Matt. XI. 25, 26.</p>
<p>“At that time Jesus answered and said, I make acknowledgment unto Thee,1606O Father, Lord
of Heaven and earth; because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight.”1607</p>
<p>Seest thou, how many ways He leads them on to the faith? First,1608by His praises of
John. For by pointing to him as a great and marvellous one, He proved likewise all his sayings
credible, whereby he used to draw them on to the knowledge of Him. Secondly,1609by saying,
“The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force;” for this is the
language of one who is pressing and urging them. Thirdly,1610by signifying that the number
of the prophets was finished; for this too manifested Himself to be the person that was announced
beforehand by them. Fourthly,1611by pointing out that whatsoever things should
be done by him, were all accomplished; at which time also He made mention of the parable
of the children. Fifthly, by His upbraiding them that had not believed, and by His alarming
and threatening them greatly.1612 Sixthly, by His giving thanks for them that believed. For
the expression, “I make acknowledgment to Thee,” here is, “I thank Thee.” “I thank Thee,”
He saith, “because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.”</p>
<p>What then? doth He rejoice in destruction, and in the others not having received this
knowledge? By no means; but this is a most excellent way of His to save men, His not forcing
them that utterly reject, and are not willing to receive His sayings; that, since they were not
bettered by His call, but fell back, and despised it, His casting them out might cause them
to fall into a longing for these things. And so likewise the attentive would grow more earnest.</p>
<p>And while His being revealed to these was fit matter of joy, His concealment from those
was no more of joy but of tears. Thus at any rate He acts, where He weeps for the city. Not
therefore because of this doth He rejoice, but because what wise men knew not, was known

to these. As when Paul saith, “I thank God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye obeyed from
the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered unto you.”1613 You see, neither doth
Paul therefore rejoice, because they were “servants of sin,” but because being such, they had
been so highly favored.</p>
<p>Now by the “wise,” here, He means the Scribes, and the Pharisees. And these things He
saith, to make the disciples more earnest, and to show what had been vouchsafed to the
fishermen, when all those others had missed of it. And in calling them “wise,” He means
not the true and commendable wisdom, but this which they seemed to have through natural
shrewdness. Wherefore neither did He say, “thou hast revealed it to fools,” but “to babes;”
to unsophisticated, that is, to simple-minded men; and He implies that so far from their
missing these privileges contrary to their desert, it was just what might be expected. And
He instructs us throughout, to be free from pride, and to follow after simplicity. For this
cause Paul also expressed it with more exceeding earnestness, writing on this wise: “If any
man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
wise.”1614 For thus is God’s grace manifested.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He give thanks to the Father, although of course it was Himself who
wrought this? As He prays and intercedes with God, showing His great love towards us, in
the same way doth He this too: for this also is of much love. And He signifies, that not from
Him only had they fallen away, but also from the Father. Thus, what He said, speaking to
His disciples, “Cast not the holy things unto dogs,”1615this He Himself anticipated them in
performing.</p>
<p>Moreover He signifies hereby both His own principal1616will, and that of the Father;
His own, I say, by His giving thanks and rejoicing at what had taken place; His Father’s, by
intimating that neither had He done this upon entreaty, but of Himself upon His own will;
“For so,” saith He, “it seemed good in Thy sight:” that is, “so it pleased Thee.”</p>

had offered.”</note>

<pb n="449"/>
<p>And wherefore was it hidden from them? Hear Paul, saying, that “Seeking to establish
their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of
God.”1617</p>
<p>Consider now how it was likely the disciples should1618be affected, hearing this; that
what wise men knew not, these knew, and knew it continuing babes, and knew it by God’s
revelation. But Luke saith, that “at the very hour,” when the seventy came telling Him about
the devils, then He “rejoiced” and spake these things,1619which, besides increasing their
diligence, would also dispose them to be modest. That is, since it was natural for them to
pride themselves on their driving away devils, on this among other grounds He refrains
them; that it was a revelation, whatever had been done, no diligence on their part. Wherefore
also the scribes, and the wise men, thinking to be intelligent for themselves, fell away through
their own vanity. Well then, if for this cause it was hidden from them, “do you also,” saith
He, “fear, and continue babes.” For this caused you to have the benefit of the revelation, as
indeed on the other hand the contrary made them be deprived of it. For by no means, when
He saith, “Thou hast hid,” doth He mean that it is all God’s doing: but as when Paul saith,
“He gave them over to a reprobate mind,”1620and, “He hath blinded their minds,”1621it is
not meant to bring Him in as the doer of it, but those who gave the occasion: so here also
He uses the expression, “Thou hast hid.”</p>
<p>For since He had said, “I thank1622 Thee, because Thou hast hid them, and hast revealed
them unto babes;” to hinder thy supposing that as being Himself deprived of this power,
and unable to effect it, so He offers thanks, He saith,</p>
<p>“All things are delivered unto me of my Father.”1623 And to them that are rejoicing,
because the devils obey them, “Nay, why marvel,” saith He,1624“that devils yield to you? All
things are mine; “All things are delivered unto me.”</p>
<p>But when thou hearest, “they are delivered,” do not surmise anything human. For He
uses this expression, to prevent thine imagining two unoriginate Gods. Since, that He was
at the same time both begotten, and Lord of all, He declares in many ways, and in other
places also.</p>

<p>2. Then He saith what is even greater than this, lifting up thy mind; “And no man
knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, but the Son.” Which
seems indeed to the ignorant unconnected with what went before, but hath full accordance
therewith. As thus: having said, “All things are delivered unto me of my Father,” He adds,
“And what marvel,” so He speaks, “if I be Lord of all? I who have also another greater privilege,
the knowing the Father, and being of the same substance.” Yea, for this too He covertly
signifies by His being the only one who so knew Him. For this is His meaning, when He
saith, “No man knoweth the Father but the Son.”</p>
<p>And see at what time He saith this. When they by His works had received the certain
proof of His might, not only seeing Him work miracles, but endowed also in His name with
so great powers. Then, since He had said, “Thou hast revealed them unto babes,” He signifies
this also to pertain to Himself; for “neither knoweth any man the Father,” saith He, “save
the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is willing1625to reveal Him;1626not “to whomsoever
He may be enjoined,” “to whomsoever He may be commanded.” But if He reveals Him,
then Himself too. This however He let pass as acknowledged, but the other He hath set
down. And everywhere He affirms this; as when He saith, “No man cometh unto the Father,
but by me.”1627</p>
<p>And thereby he establishes another point also, His being in harmony and of one mind
with Him. “Why,” saith He, “I am so far from fighting and warring with Him, that no one
can even come to Him but by me.” For because this most offended them, His seeming to
be a rival God, He by all means doth away with this; and interested Himself about this not
less earnestly, but even more so, than about His miracles.</p>
<p>But when He saith, “Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,” He means not
this, that all men were ignorant of Him, but that with the knowledge wherewith He knows1628
Him, no man is acquainted with Him; which may be said of the Son too.1629 For it was not
of some God unknown, and revealed to no man, that He was so speaking, as Marcion
saith;1630but it is the perfection of knowledge that He is here intimating, since neither do

we know the Son as He should be known; and this very thing, to add no more, Paul was
declaring, when he said, “We know in part, and we prophesy in part.”1631</p>
<p>3. Next, having brought them by His words to an earnest desire, and having signified
His unspeakable power, He after that invites them, saying, “Come unto me, all ye that labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”1632 Not this or that person, but all that are in
anxiety, in sorrows, in sins. Come, not that I may call you to account, but that I may do
away your sins; come, not that I want your honor, but that I want your salvation. “For I,”
saith He, “will give you rest.” He said not, “I will save you,” only; but what was much more,
“I will place you in all security.”</p>
<p>“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye
shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”1633 Thus, “be
not afraid,” saith He, “hearing of a yoke, for it is easy: fear not, because I said, “a burden,”
for it is light.”</p>
<p>And how said He before, “The gate is narrow and the way strait?”1634 Whilst thou art
careless, whilst thou art supine; whereas, if thou duly perform His words, the burden will
be light; wherefore also He hath now called it so.</p>
<p>But how are they duly performed? If thou art become lowly, and meek, and gentle. For
this virtue is the mother of all strictness of life. Wherefore also, when beginning those divine
laws, with this He began.1635 And here again He doeth the very same, and exceeding great
is the reward He appoints. “For not to another only dost thou become serviceable; but thyself
also above all thou refreshest,” saith He. “For ye shall find rest unto your souls.”</p>
<p>Even before the things to come, He gives thee here thy recompense, and bestows the
prize already, making the saying acceptable, both hereby, and by setting Himself forward
as an example. For, “Of what art thou afraid?” saith He, “lest thou shouldest be a loser by
thy low estate? Look to me, and to all that is mine; learn of me, and then shalt thou know
distinctly how great thy blessing.” Seest thou how in all ways He is leading them to humility?
By His own doings: “Learn of me, for I am meek.” By what themselves are to gain; for, “Ye
shall find,” saith He,” rest unto your souls.” By what He bestows on them; for, “I too will
refresh you,” saith He. By rendering it light; “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
So likewise doth Paul, saying, “For the present light affliction, which is but for a moment,
worketh a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”1636</p>

<p>And how, some one may say, is the burden light, when He saith, “Except one hate
father and mother;” and, “Whosoever taketh not up his cross, and followeth after me, is not
worthy of me:” and, “Whosoever forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple:”
1637when He commands even to give up our very life?1638 Let Paul teach thee, saying,
“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?1639” And that, “The sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.”1640 Let
those teach thee, who return from the council of the Jews after plenty of stripes, and “rejoice
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.”1641 And if thou art
still afraid and tremblest at hearing of the yoke and the burden, the fear comes not of the
nature of the thing, but of thy remissness; since if thou art prepared, and in earnest, all will
be easy to thee and light. Since for this cause Christ also, to signify that we too must needs
labor ourselves, did not mention the gracious things only, and then hold His peace, nor the
painful things only, but set down both. Thus He both spake of “a yoke,” and called it “easy;”
both named a burden, and added that it was “light;” that thou shouldest neither flee from
them as toilsome, nor despise them as over easy.</p>
<p>But if even after all this, virtue seem to thee an irksome thing, consider that vice is more
irksome. And this very thing He was intimating, in that He said not first, “Take my yoke
upon you,” but before that, “Come, ye that labor and are heavy laden;” implying that sin
too hath labor, and a burden that is heavy and hard to bear. For He said not only, “Ye that
labor,” but also, “that are heavy laden.” This the prophet too was speaking of, when in that
description of her nature, “As an heavy burden they weighed heavy upon me.”1642 And
Zacharias too, describing her, saith she is “A talent of lead.”1643</p>
<p>And this moreover experience itself proves. For nothing so weighs upon the soul, and
presses it down, as consciousness of sin; nothing so much gives it wings, and raises it on
high, as the attainment of righteousness and virtue.</p>
<p>And mark it: what is more grievous, I pray thee, than to have no possessions? to turn
the cheek, and when smitten not to smite again? to die by a violent death? Yet nevertheless,
if we practise self-command, all these things are light and easy, and pleasurable.</p>

<p>But be not disturbed; rather let us take up each of these, and inquire about it accurately;
and if ye will, that first which many count most painful. Which then of the two, tell me, is
grievous and burdensome, to be in care for one belly, or to be anxious about ten thousand?
To be clothed with one outer garment, and seek for nothing more; or having many in one’s
house, to bemoan one’s self every day and night in fear, in trembling, about the preservation
of them, grieved, and ready to choke about the loss of them; lest one should be moth-eaten,
lest a servant purloin and go off with them?</p>
<p>4. But whatever I may say, my speech will present no such proof as the actual trial.
Wherefore I would there were present here with us some one of those who have attained
unto that summit of self-restraint, and then you would know assuredly the delight thereof;
and that none of those that are enamored of voluntary poverty would accept wealth, though
ten thousand were to offer it.</p>
<p>But would these, say you, ever consent to become poor, and to cast away the anxieties
which they have? And what of that? This is but a proof of their madness and grievous disease,
not of anything very pleasurable in the thing. And this even themselves would testify to us,
who are daily lamenting over these their anxieties, and accounting their life to be not worth
living. But not so those others; rather they laugh, leap for joy, and the wearers of the diadem
do not so glory, as they do in their poverty.</p>
<p>Again, to turn the cheek is, to him that gives heed, a less grievous thing than to smite
another; for from this the contest hath beginning, in that termination: and whereas by the
former thou hast kindled the other’s pile too, by the latter thou hast quenched even thine
own flames. But that not to be burnt is a pleasanter thing than to be burnt, is surely plain
to every man. And if this hold in regard of bodies, much more in a soul.</p>
<p>And whether is lighter, to contend, or to be crowned? to fight, or to have the prize? and
to endure waves, or to run into harbor? Therefore also, to die is better than to live. For the
one withdraws us from waves and dangers, while the other adds unto them, and makes a
man subject to numberless plots and distresses, which have made life not worth living in
thine account.</p>
<p>And if thou disbelievest our sayings, hearken to them that have seen the countenances
of the martyrs in the time of their conflicts, how when scourged and flayed, they were exceeding
joyful and glad, and when exposed upon hot irons, rejoiced, and were glad of heart,
more than such as lie upon a bed of roses. Wherefore Paul also said, when he was at the
point of departing hence, and closing his life by a violent death, “I joy, and rejoice with you
all; for the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.”1644 Seest thou with what exceeding
strength of language he invites the whole world to partake in his gladness? So great a good
<note type="footnote">1644 Phil. ii. 17, 18. [R.V., “and in the same manner also,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="454"/>
did he know his departure hence to be, so desirable, and lovely, and worthy of prayer, that
formidable thing, death.</p>
<p>5. But that virtue’s yoke is sweet and light, is manifest many other ways also; but to
conclude, if you please, let us look also at the burdens of sin. Let us then bring forward the
covetous, the retailers and second-hand dealers in shameless bargains. What now could be
a heavier burden than such transactions? how many sorrows, how many anxieties, how
many disappointments, how many dangers, how many plots and wars, daily spring up from
these gains? how many troubles and disturbances? For as one can never see the sea without
waves, so neither such a soul without anxiety, and despondency, and fear, and disturbance;
yea, the second overtakes the first, and again others come up, and when these are not yet
ceased, others come to a head.</p>
<p>Or wouldest thou see the souls of the revilers, and of the passionate? Why, what is worse
than this torture? what, than the wounds they have within? what, than the furnace that is
continually burning, and the flame that is never quenched?</p>
<p>Or of the sensual, and of such as cleave unto this present life? Why, what more grievous
than this bondage? They live the life of Cain, dwelling in continual trembling and fear at
every death that happens; the kinsmen of the dead mourn not so much, as these do for their
own end.</p>
<p>What again fuller of turmoil, and more frantic, than such as are puffed up with pride?
“For learn,” saith He, “of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.” Because long-suffering is the mother of all good things.</p>
<p>Fear thou not therefore, neither start away from the yoke that lightens thee of all these
things, but put thyself under it with all forwardness, and then thou shalt know well the
pleasure thereof. For it doth not at all bruise thy neck, but is put on thee for good order’s
sake only, and to persuade thee to walk seemly, and to lead thee unto the royal road, and to
deliver thee from the precipices on either side, and to make thee walk with ease in the narrow
way.</p>
<p>Since then so great are its benefits, so great its security, so great its gladness, let us with
all our soul, with all our diligence, draw this yoke; that we may both here “find rest unto
our souls,” and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XII. 1.</p>
<p>“At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn; and His disciples were a
hungered, and began to pluck the1645ears of corn, and to eat.”</p>
<p>But Luke saith, “On a double Sabbath.”1646 Now what is a double Sabbath? When the
cessation from toil is twofold, both that of the regular Sabbath, and that of another feast
coming upon it. For they call every cessation from toil, a sabbath.</p>
<p>But why could He have led them away from it, who foreknew all, unless it had been His
will that the Sabbath should be broken? It was His will indeed, but not simply so; wherefore
He never breaks it without a cause, but giving reasonable excuses: that He might at once
bring the law to an end, and not startle them. But there are occasions on which He even repeals
it directly, and not with circumstance: as when He anoints with the clay the eyes of
the blind man;1647as when He saith, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”1648 And
He doth so, by this to glorify His own Father, by the other to soothe the infirmity of the
Jews. At which last He is laboring here, putting forward as a plea the necessity of nature;
although in the case of acknowledged sins, that could not of course ever be an excuse. For
neither may the murderer make his anger a plea, nor the adulterer allege his lust, no, nor
any other excuse; but here, by mentioning their hunger, He freed them from all blame.</p>
<p>But do thou, I pray thee, admire the disciples, how entirely they control themselves, and
make no account of the things of the body, but esteem the table of the flesh a secondary
thing, and though they have to struggle with continual hunger, do not even so withdraw
themselves. For except hunger had sorely constrained them, they would not have done so
much as this.</p>
<p>What then do the Pharisees? “When they saw it,” it is said, “they said unto Him, Behold,
Thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day.”1649</p>
<p>Now here indeed with no great vehemence (yet surely that would have been consistent
in them),—nevertheless they are not vehemently provoked, but simply find fault. But when
He stretched out the withered hand and healed it,1650then they were so infuriated, as even

to consult together about slaying and destroying Him. For where nothing great and noble
is done, they are calm; but where they see any made whole, they are savage, and fret themselves,
and none so intolerable as they are: such enemies are they of the salvation of men.</p>
<p>How then doth Jesus defend His disciples? “Have ye not read,” saith He, “what David
did in the temple,1651when he was an hungered, himself and all they that were with him?
how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show-bread, which was not lawful
for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?”1652</p>
<p>Thus, whereas in pleading for His disciples, He brings forward David; for Himself, it is
the Father.1653</p>
<p>And observe His reproving manner: “Have ye not read what David did?” For great indeed
was that prophet’s glory, so that Peter also afterwards pleading with the Jews, spake on this
wise, “Let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried.”
1654</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He not call him by the name of his rank, either on this occasion or
afterwards? Perhaps because He derived His race from him.</p>
<p>Now had they been a candid sort of persons, He would have turned His discourse to
the disciples’ suffering from hunger; but abominable as they were and inhuman, He rather
rehearses unto them a history.</p>
<p>But Mark saith, “In the days of Abiathar the High Priest:”1655not stating what was con
trary to the history, but implying that he had two names; and adds that “he gave unto
him,”1656indicating that herein also David had much to say for himself, since even the very
priest suffered him; and not only suffered, but even ministered unto him. For tell me not
that David was a prophet, for not even so was it lawful, but the privilege was the priests’:
wherefore also He added, “but for the priests only.” For though he were ten thousand times
a prophet, yet was he not a priest; and though he were himself a prophet, yet not so they
that were with him; since to them too we know that he gave.</p>
<p>“What then,” it might be said, “were they all one with David?” Why talk to me of dignity,
where there seems to be a transgression of the law, even though it be the constraint of nature?

Yea, and in this way too He hath the more entirely acquitted them of the charges, in that he
who is greater is found to have done the same.</p>
<p>“And what is this to the question,” one may say; “for it was not surely the Sabbath, that
he transgressed?” Thou tellest me of that which is greater, and which especially shows the
wisdom of Christ, that letting go the Sabbath, He brings another example greater than the
Sabbath. For it is by no means the same, to break in upon a day, and to touch that holy table,
which it was not lawful for any man to touch. Since the Sabbath indeed hath been violated,
and that often; nay rather it is continually being violated, both by circumcision, and by many
other works; and at Jericho1657too one may see the same to have happened; but this happened
then only. So that He more than obtains the victory. How then did no man blame David,
although there was yet another ground of charge heavier than this, that of the priests’ murder,
which had its origin from this? But He states it not, as applying himself to the present subject
only.</p>
<p>2. Afterwards again He refutes it in another way also. For as at first He brought in
David, by the dignity of the person quelling their pride; so when He had stopped their
mouths, and had put down their boasting, then He adds also the more appropriate refutation.
And of what sort is this? “Know ye not, that in the temple the priests profane the Sabbath,
and are blameless?”1658 For in that other instance indeed, saith He, the emergency made
the relaxation, but here is the relaxation even without emergency. He did not however at
once thus refute them but first by way of permission, afterwards as insisting upon his argument.
Because it was meet to draw the stronger inference last, although the former argument
also had of course its proper weight.</p>
<p>For tell me not, that it is not freeing one’s self from blame, to bring forward another
who is committing the same sin. For when the doer incurs no blame, the act on which he
hath ventured becomes a rule for others to plead.</p>
<p>Nevertheless He was not satisfied with this, but subjoins also what is more decisive,
saying that the deed is no sin at all; and this more than anything was the sign of a glorious
victory, to point to the law repealing itself, and in two ways doing so, first by the place, then
by the Sabbath; or rather even in three ways, in that both the work is twofold1659that is done,
and with it goes also another thing, its being done by the priests; and what is yet more, that
it is not even brought as a charge. “For they,” saith He, “are blameless.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how many points He hath stated? the place; for He saith, “In the temple;”
the persons, for they are “the priests;” the time, for He saith, “the Sabbath;” the act itself, for
“they profane;” (He not having said, “they break,” but what is more grievous, “they profane;”)

that they not only escape punishment, but are even free from blame, “for they,” saith He,
“are blameless.”</p>
<p>Do not ye therefore account this, He saith, like the former instance. For that indeed was
done both but once, and not by a priest, and was of necessity; wherefore also they were deserving
of excuse; but this last is both done every Sabbath, and by priests, and in the temple,
and according to the law. And therefore again not by favor, but in a legal way, they are acquitted
of the charges. For not at all as blaming them did I so speak, saith He, nor yet as
freeing them from blame in the way of indulgence, but according to the principle of justice.</p>
<p>And He seems indeed to be defending them, but it is His disciples whom He is clearing
of the alleged faults. For when He saith, “those are blameless,” He means, “much more are
these.”</p>
<p>“But they are not priests.” Nay, they are greater than priests. For the Lord of the temple
Himself is here: the truth, not the type. Wherefore He said also,</p>
<p>“But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.”1660</p>
<p>Nevertheless, great as the sayings were which they heard, they made no reply, for the
salvation of men was not their object.</p>
<p>Then, because to the hearers it would seem harsh, He quickly draws a veil over it, giving
His discourse, as before, a lenient turn, yet even so expressing Himself with a rebuke. “But
if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have1661mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not
have condemned the guiltless.”1662</p>
<p>Seest thou how again He inclines His speech to lenity, yet again shows them to be out
of the reach of lenity? “For ye would not have condemned,” saith He, “the guiltless.” Before
indeed He inferred the same from what is said of the priests, in the words, “they are guiltless;”
but here He states it on His own authority; or rather, this too is out of the law, for He was
quoting a prophetic saying.1663</p>
<p>3. After this He mentions another reason likewise; “For the Son of man,” saith He, “is
Lord of the Sabbath day;”1664speaking it of Himself. But Mark relates Him to have said this
of our common nature also; for He said, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath.”1665</p>

<p>Wherefore then was he punished that was gathering the sticks?1666 Because if the laws
were to be despised even at the beginning, of course they would scarcely be observed afterwards.</p>
<p>For indeed the Sabbath did at the first confer many and great benefits; for instance, it
made them gentle towards those of their household, and humane; it taught them God’s
providence and the creation, as Ezekiel saith;1667it trained them by degrees to abstain from
wickedness, and disposed them to regard the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>For because they could not have borne it,1668if when He was giving the law for the
Sabbath, He had said, “Do your good works on the Sabbath, but do not the works which
are evil,” therefore He restrained them from all alike for, “Ye must do nothing at all,” saith
He: and not even so were they kept in order. But He Himself, in the very act of giving the
law of the Sabbath, did even therein darkly signify that He will have them refrain from the
evil works only, by the saying, “Ye must do no work, except what shall be done for your
life.”1669 And in the temple too all went on, and with more diligence and double toil.1670
Thus even by the very shadow He was secretly opening unto them the truth.</p>
<p>Did Christ then, it will be said, repeal a thing so highly profitable? Far from it; nay, He
greatly enhanced it. For it was time for them to be trained in all things by the higher rules,
and it was unnecessary that his hands should be bound, who was freed from wickedness,
winged for all good works; or that men should hereby learn that God made all things; or
that they should so be made gentle, who are called to imitate God’s own love to mankind
(for He saith, “Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly Father”);1671or that they should make one
day a festival, who are commanded to keep a feast all their life long; (“For let us keep the
feast,” it is said, “not with old leaven, neither with leaven of malice and wickedness; but with
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth”);1672as neither need they stand by an ark and a
golden altar, who have the very Lord of all for their inmate, and in all things hold communion
with Him; by prayer, and by oblation, and by scriptures, and by almsgiving, and by having
Him within them. Lo now, why is any Sabbath required, by him who is always keeping the
feast, whose conversation is in Heaven?</p>
<p>4. Let us keep the feast then continually, and do no evil thing; for this is a feast: and let

bound in the mire, working at those bricks, and gathering stubble, and being beaten. Yea,
for now too the devil bids us make bricks, as Pharaoh did then. For what else is gold, than
mire? and what else is silver, than stubble? Like stubble, at least, it kindles the flame of desire;
like mire, so doth gold defile him that possesses it.</p>
<p>Wherefore He sent us, not Moses from the wilderness, but His Son from Heaven. If
then, after He is come, thou abide in Egypt, thou wilt suffer with the Egyptians: but if leaving
that land thou go up with the spiritual Israel, thou shalt see all the miracles.</p>
<p>Yet not even this suffices for salvation. For we must not only be delivered out of Egypt,
but we must also enter into the promise. Since the Jews too, as Paul saith, both went through
the Red Sea,1673and ate manna, and drank spiritual drink, but nevertheless they all perished.</p>
<p>Lest then the same befall us also, let us not be slow, neither draw back; but when thou
hearest wicked spies even now bringing up an evil report against the strait and narrow way,
and uttering the same kind of talk as those spies of old, let not the multitude, but Joshua,
be our pattern, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh; and do not thou give up, until thou have
attained the promise, and entered into the Heavens.</p>
<p>Neither account the journey to be difficult. “For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled
to God, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved.”1674“But this way,” it will
be said, “is strait and narrow.” Well, but the former, through which thou hast come, is not
strait and narrow only, but even impassable, and full of savage wild beasts. And as there was
no passing through the Red Sea, unless that miracle had been wrought, so neither could we,
abiding in our former life, have gone up into Heaven, but only by baptism intervening. Now
if the impossible hath become possible, much more will the difficult be easy.</p>
<p>“But that,” it will be said, “was of grace only.” Why, for this reason especially thou hast
just cause to take courage. For if, where it was grace alone, He wrought with you; will He
not much more be your aid, where ye also show forth laborious works? If He saved thee,
doing nothing, will He not much more help thee, working?</p>
<p>Above1675indeed I was saying, that from the impossibilities thou oughtest to take
courage about the difficulties also; but now I add this, that if we are vigilant, these will not
be so much as difficult. For mark it: death is trodden under foot, the devil hath fallen, the
law of sin is extinguished, the grace of the Spirit is given, life is contracted into a small space,
the heavy burdens are abridged.</p>

<p>And to convince thee hereof by the actual results, see how many have overshot the injunctions
of Christ; and art thou afraid of that which is just their measure? What plea then
wilt thou have, when others are leaping beyond the bounds, and thou thyself too slothful
for what is enacted?</p>
<p>Thus, thee we admonish to give alms of such things as thou hast, but another hath even
stripped himself of all his possessions: thee we require to live chastely with thy wife, but
another hath not so much as entered into marriage: and thee we entreat not to be envious,
but another we find giving up even his own life for charity: thee again we entreat to be lenient
in judgments, and not severe to them that sin, but another, even when smitten, hath turned
the other cheek also.</p>
<p>What then shall we say, I pray thee? What excuse shall we make, not doing even these
things, when others go so far beyond us? And they would not have gone beyond us, had not
the thing been very easy. For which pines away, he who envies other men’s blessings, or he
who takes pleasure with them, and rejoices? Which eyes all things with suspicion and continual
trembling, the chaste man, or the adulterer? Which is cheered by good hopes, he that
spoils by violence, or he that shows mercy, and imparts of his own to the needy?</p>
<p>Let us then bear in mind these things, and not be torpid in our career for virtue’s sake;
but having stripped ourselves with all readiness for these glorious wrestlings, let us labor
for a little while, that we may win the perpetual and imperishable crowns; unto which may
we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XL.</head>
<p>Matt. XII. 9, 10.</p>
<p>“And when He was departed thence, He went into their synagogue: and, behold, a man which
had his hand withered.”</p>
<p>Again He heals on a Sabbath day, vindicating what had been done by His disciples. And
the other evangelists indeed say, that He “set” the man “in the midst,” and asked them, “If
it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath days.”1676</p>
<p>See the tender bowels of the Lord. “He set him in the midst,” that by the sight He might
subdue them; that overcome by the spectacle they might cast away their wickedness, and
out of a kind of shame towards the man, cease from their savage ways. But they, ungentle
and inhuman, choose rather to hurt the fame of Christ, than to see this person made whole:
in both ways betraying their wickedness; by their warring against Christ, and by their doing
so with such contentiousness, as even to treat with despite His mercies to other men.</p>
<p>And while the other evangelists say, He asked the question, this one saith, it was asked
of Him. “And they asked Him,” so it stands, “saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?
that they might accuse Him.”1677 And it is likely that both took place. For being unholy
wretches, and well assured that He would doubtless proceed to the healing, they hastened
to take Him beforehand with their question, thinking in this way to hinder Him. And this
is why they asked, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?” not for information, but that
“they might accuse Him.” Yet surely the work was enough, if it were really their wish to accuse
Him; but they desired to find a handle in His words too, preparing for themselves beforehand
an abundance of arguments.</p>
<p>But He in His love towards man doth this also: He answers them, teaching His own
meekness, and turning it all back upon them; and points out their inhumanity. And He
“setteth” the man “in the midst;” not in fear of them, but endeavoring to profit them, and
move them to pity.</p>
<p>But when not even so did He prevail with them, then was He grieved, it is said, and
wroth with them for the hardness of their heart, and He saith,</p>
<p>“What man is there among you that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on
the Sabbath days, will he not lay hold of it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better
than a sheep?1678 Wherefore it is lawful to do well1679on the Sabbath days.”1680</p>
<note type="footnote">1676 See Mark iii. 3, 4, and Luke vi. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="463"/>
<p>Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of accusing him again of transgression,
He convicts them by this example. And do thou mark, I pray thee, how variously and suitably
in each case, He introduces His pleas for the breaking of the sabbath. Thus, first, in the case
of the blind man,1681 He doth not so much as defend Himself to them, when He made the
clay: and yet then also were they blaming Him; but the manner of the creation was enough
to indicate the Lord and Owner1682of the law. Next, in the case of the paralytic, when he
carried his bed, and they were finding fault,1683 He defends Himself, now as God, and now
as man; as man, when He saith, “If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
law should not be broken;” (and He said not “that a man should be profited”); “are ye angry
at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?”1684 As God again,
when He saith, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”1685</p>
<p>But when blamed for His disciples, He said, “Have ye not read what David did, when
he was an hungered, himself and they that were with him, how he entered into the house
of God, and did eat the show-bread?”1686 He brings forward the priests also.</p>
<p>And here again; “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil?1687 Which
of you shall have one sheep?” For He knew their love of wealth, that they were all taken up
with it, rather than with love of mankind. And indeed the other evangelist saith,1688that He
also looked about upon them when asking these questions, that by His very eye He might
win them over; but not even so did they become better.</p>
<p>And yet here He speaks only; whereas elsewhere in many cases He heals by laying on
of hands also. But nevertheless none of these things made them meek; rather, while the man
was healed, they by his health became worse.</p>
<p>For His desire indeed was to cure them before him, and He tried innumerable ways of
healing, both by what He did in their presence, and by what He said: but since their malady
after all was incurable, He proceeded to the work. “Then saith He to the man, Stretch forth
thine hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, like as the other.”1689</p>
<p>2. What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and take counsel together to slay Him.
For “the Pharisees,” saith the Scripture, “went out and held a council against Him, how they

might destroy Him.”1690 They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So
great an evil is envy. For not against strangers only, but even against our own, is it ever
warring. And Mark saith, they took this counsel with the Herodians.1691</p>
<p>What then doth the gentle and meek One? He withdrew, on being aware of it. “But
when Jesus knew their devices,1692 He withdrew Himself,” it is said, “from them.”1693 Where
now are they who say, miracles ought to be done? Nay, by these things He signified, that
the uncandid soul is not even thereby persuaded; and He made it plain that His disciples
too were blamed by them without cause. This however we should observe, that they grow
fierce especially at the benefits done to their neighbors; and when they see any one delivered
either from disease or from wickedness, then is the time for them to find fault, and become
wild beasts. Thus did they calumniate Him, both when He was about to save the harlot, and
when He was eating with publicans, and now again, when they saw the hand restored.</p>
<p>But do thou observe, I pray thee, how He neither desists from His tender care over the
infirm, and yet allays their envy. “And great multitudes1694followed Him, and He healed
them all; and He charged them that were healed, that they should make Him known to no
man.”1695 Because, while the multitudes everywhere both admire and follow Him, they
desist not from their wickedness.</p>
<p>Then, lest thou shouldest be confounded at what is going on, and at their strange frenzy,
He introduces the prophet also, foretelling all this. For so great was the accuracy of the
prophets, that they omit not even these things, but foretell His very journeyings, and changes
of place, and the intent with which He acted therein; that thou mightest learn, how they
spake all by the Spirit. For if the secrets of men cannot by any art be known, much more
were it impossible to learn Christ’s purpose, except the Spirit revealed it.1696</p>
<p>What then saith the prophet? Nay, it is subjoined: “That it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved,
in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment
to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry,1697neither shall any man hear His voice in the
streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He
send forth judgment unto victory. And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.”1698</p>

<pb n="465"/>
<p>The prophet celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable power, and opens to the
Gentiles “a great door and effectual;” he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the Jews,
and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For “behold,” saith He, “my servant, whom I
have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” Now if He chose Him, not as
an adversary doth Christ set aside the law, nor as being an enemy of the lawgiver, but as
having the same mind with Him, and the same objects.</p>
<p>Then proclaiming His meekness, he saith, “He shall not strive nor cry.” For His desire
indeed was to heal in their presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this
did He contend.</p>
<p>And intimating both His might, and their weakness, he saith, “A bruised reed shall He
not break.” For indeed it was easy to break them all to pieces like a reed, and not a reed
merely, but one already bruised.</p>
<p>“And smoking flax shall He not quench.” Here he sets forth both their anger that is
kindled, and His might that is able to put down their anger, and to quench it with all ease;
whereby His great mildness is signified.</p>
<p>What then? Shall these things always be? And will He endure them perpetually, forming
such frantic plots against Him? Far from it; but when He hath performed His part, then
shall He execute the other purposes also. For this He declared by saying “Till He send forth
judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the Gentiles trust.” As Paul likewise saith,
“Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.”1699</p>
<p>But what is, “when He sends forth judgment unto victory?” When He hath fulfilled all
His own part, then, we are told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and
that a perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy is gloriously
set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have prevailed, and He hath left them
no plea of contradiction, however shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness, “judgment.”</p>
<p>But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to the punishment of unbelievers only,
but He will also win to Himself the whole world. Wherefore He added, “And in His name
shall the Gentiles trust.”</p>
<p>Then, to inform thee that this too is according to the purpose of the Father, in the beginning
the prophet had assured us of this likewise, together with what had gone before;
saying, “My well-beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” For of the well-beloved it is
quite evident that He did these things also according to the mind of the beloved.1700</p>

<p>3. “Then they brought unto Him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb, and He
healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.”1701</p>
<p>O wickedness of the evil spirit! he had barred up both entrances, whereby that person
should have believed, as well sight as hearing; nevertheless, both did Christ open.</p>
<p>“And all the people were amazed, saying, Is not this the Son of David?1702 But the
Pharisees said, This fellow doth1703 not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the
devils.”1704</p>
<p>And yet what great thing had been said? Nevertheless, not even this did they endure:
to such a degree, as I have already remarked, are they ever stung by the good works done
to their neighbors, and nothing grieves them so much as the salvation of men. And yet He
had actually retired, and had given room for their passion to subside; but the evil was again
rekindled, because a benefit was again conferred; and the evil spirit was not so indignant as
they. For he indeed departed from the body, and gave place and fled away, uttering no sound;
but these were endeavoring now to slay, now to defame Him. That is, their first aim not
succeeding, they would fain hurt His good name.</p>
<p>Such a thing is envy, than which no worse evil can exist. For the adulterer indeed enjoys
some pleasure, such as it is, and in a short time accomplishes his proper sin; but the envious
man punishes himself, and takes vengeance upon himself more than on the person whom
he envies, and never ceases from his sin, but is continually engaged in the commission
thereof. For as a sow in mire, and evil spirits in our hurt, so also doth he delight in his
neighbor’s ills; and if anything painful take place, then is he refreshed, and takes breath;
accounting the calamities of others his own joys, and the blessings of others his own ills;
and he considers not what pleasure may accrue to himself, but what pain to his neighbor.
These men therefore were it not meet to stone and beat to death, like mad dogs, like destroying
demons, like the very furies?</p>
<p>For as beetles feed on dung, so do these men on the calamities of others, being a sort of
common foes and enemies of our nature. And whereas the rest of mankind pity even a brute
when it is killed, dost thou, on seeing a man receive benefits, become like a wild beast,
tremble, and turn pale? Why, what can be worse than this madness? Therefore, you see,
whoremongers and publicans were able to enter into the kingdom, but the envious, being
within it, went out: For “the children of the kingdom,” it is said, “shall be cast out.”1705 And
<note type="footnote">1701 Matt. xii. 22. [“Then was brought” (A. V. and R. V.), but the other form occurs in the Homily. R. V. omits

<pb n="467"/>
the former, once freed from their present wickedness, attained to things which they never
looked for, while these latter lost even the good things which they had; and very reasonably.
For this turns a man into a devil, this renders one a savage demon. Thus did the first murder
arise; thus was nature forgotten; thus the earth defiled; thus afterwards did it open its mouth,
to receive yet living, and utterly destroy, Dathan, and Korah, and Abiram, and all that
multitude.1706</p>
<p>4. But to declaim against envy, one may say, is easy; but we ought to consider also how
men are to be freed from the disease. How then are we to be rid of this wickedness? If we
bear in mind, that as he who hath committed fornication cannot lawfully enter the church,
so neither he that envies; nay, and much less the latter than the former. For as things are, it
is accounted even an indifferent thing; wherefore also it is little thought of; but if its real
badness be made evident, we should easily refrain from it.</p>
<p>Weep then, and groan; lament, and entreat God. Learn to feel and to repent for it, as
for a grievous sin. And if thou be of this mind, thou wilt quickly be rid of the disease.</p>
<p>And who knows not, one may say, that envy is an evil thing? No one indeed is ignorant
of it: yet they have not the same estimation of this passion as of adultery and fornication.
When, at least, did any one condemn himself bitterly for having envied? when did he entreat
God concerning this pest, that He would be merciful to him? No man at any time: but if he
shall fast and give a little money to a poor man, though he be envious to the thousandth
degree, he counts himself to have done nothing horrid, held as he is in subjection by the
most accursed passion of all. Whence, for example, did Cain become such as he was? Whence
Esau? Whence the children of Laban? Whence the sons of Jacob? Whence Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram, with their company? Whence Miriam? Whence Aaron? Whence the devil
himself?</p>
<p>Herewith consider this also; that thou injurest not him whom thou enviest, but into
thyself thou art thrusting the sword. For wherein did Cain injure Abel? Did he not even
against his own will send him the more quickly into the kingdom? but himself he pierced
through with innumerable evils. Wherein did Esau harm Jacob? Did not Jacob grow wealthy,
and enjoy unnumbered blessings; while he himself both became an outcast from his father’s
house, and wandered in a strange land, after that plot of his?1707 And wherein did Jacob’s
sons again make Joseph the worse, and this, though they proceeded even unto blood? had
not they to endure famine, and encounter peril to the utmost, whereas he became king of
all Egypt? For the more thou enviest, the more dost thou become a procurer of greater
blessing to the object of thine envy. For there is a God who beholds these things; and when
<note type="footnote">1706 Numb. xvi.</note>
<note type="footnote">1707 Gen. xxvii. 41.</note>

<pb n="468"/>
He sees him injured, that doeth no injury, him He exalts the more, and so makes him glorious,
but thee He punishes.</p>
<p>For if them that exult over their enemies, He suffer not to go unpunished (“For rejoice
not,” it is said, “when thine enemies fall, lest at any time the Lord see it, and it displease
Him”1708); much more such as envy those who have done no wrong.</p>
<p>Let us then extirpate the many-headed wild beast. For in truth many are the kinds of
envy. Thus, if he that loves one that is a friend to him hath no more than the publican,1709
where shall he stand who hates him that doeth him no wrong? and how shall he escape
hell,1710 becoming worse than the heathens? Wherefore also I do exceedingly grieve, that
we who are commanded to copy the angels, or rather the Lord of the angels, emulate the
devil. For indeed there is much envy, even in the church; and more among us, than among
those under authority. Wherefore we must even discourse unto ourselves.</p>
<p>5. Tell me then, why dost thou envy thy neighbor? Because thou seest him reaping
honor, and words of good report? Then dost thou not bear in mind how much evil honors
bring on the unguarded? lifting them up to pride, to vainglory, to arrogance, to contemptuousness;
making them more careless? and besides these evils, they wither also lightly away.
For the most grievous thing is this, that the evils arising therefrom abide immortal, but the
pleasure at the moment of its appearing, is flown away. For these things then dost thou
envy? tell me.</p>
<p>“But he hath great influence with the Ruler, and leads and drives all things which way
he will, and inflicts pain on them that offend him, and benefits his flatterers, and hath much
power.” These are the sayings of secular persons, and of men that are riveted to the earth.
For the spiritual man nothing shall be able to hurt.</p>
<p>For what serious harm shall he do to him? vote him out of his office? And what of that?
For if it be justly done, he is even profited; for nothing so provokes God, as for one to hold
the priest’s office unworthily. But if unjustly, the blame again falls on the other, not on him;
for he who hath suffered anything unjustly, and borne it nobly, obtains in this way the
greater confidence towards God.</p>
<p>Let us not then aim at this, how we may be in places of power, and honor, and authority,
but that we may live in virtue and self denial. For indeed places of authority persuade men
to do many things which are not approved of God; and great vigor of soul is needed, in
order to use authority aright. For as he that is deprived thereof, practises self restraint,
whether with or against his will, so he that enjoys it is in some such condition, as if any one
living with a graceful and beautiful damsel were to receive rules never to look upon her
<note type="footnote">1708 Prov. xxiv. 17, 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">1709 Matt. v. 46.</note>
<note type="footnote">1710 [γέενναν.]</note>

<pb n="469"/>
unchastely. For authority is that kind of thing. Wherefore many, even against their will,
hath it induced to show insolence; it awakens wrath, and removes the bridle from the tongue,
and tears off the door of the lips; fanning the soul as with a wind, and sinking the bark in
the lowest depth of evils. Him then who is in so great danger dost thou admire, and sayest
thou he is to be envied? Nay, how great madness is here! Consider, at any rate (besides what
we have mentioned), how many enemies and accusers, and how many flatterers this person
hath besieging him. Are these then, I pray thee, reasons for calling a man happy? Nay, who
can say so?</p>
<p>“But the people,” you say, “hold high account of him.” And what is this? For the people
surely is not God, to whom he is to render account: so that in naming the people, thou art
speaking of nothing else than of other breakers, and rocks, and shoals, and sunken ridges.
For to be in favor with the people, the more it makes a man illustrious, the greater the
dangers, the cares, the despondencies it brings with it. For such an one has no power at all
to take breath or stand still, having so severe a master. And why say I, “stand still and take
breath”? Though such an one have never so many good works, hardly doth he enter into
the kingdom. For nothing is so wont to overthrow1711men, as the honor which comes of
the multitude, making them cowardly, ignoble, flatterers, hypocrites.</p>
<p>Why, for instance, did the Pharisees say that Christ was possessed? Was it not because
they were greedy of the honor of the multitude?</p>
<p>And whence did the multitude pass the right judgment on Him? Was it not because
this disease had no hold on them? For nothing, nothing so much tends to make men lawless
and foolish, as gaping after the honor of the multitude. Nothing makes them glorious and
immoveable, like despising the same.</p>
<p>Wherefore also great vigor of soul is needed for him who is to hold out against such an
impulse, and so violent a blast. For as when things are prosperous, he prefers himself to all,
so when he undergoes the contrary, he would fain bury himself alive: and this is to him both
hell, and the kingdom, when he hath come to be overwhelmed by this passion.</p>
<p>Is all this then, I pray thee, matter of envyings, and not rather of lamentations and tears?
Every one surely can see. But thou doest the same, in envying one in that kind of credit, as
if a person, seeing another bound and scourged and torn by innumerable wild beasts, were
to envy him his wounds and stripes. For in fact, as many men as the multitude comprises,
so many bonds also, so many tyrants hath he: and, what is yet more grievous, each of these
hath a different mind: and they all judge whatever comes into their heads concerning him
that is a slave to them, without examining into anything; but whatever is the decision of this
or that person, this they also confirm.</p>
<note type="footnote">1711 ἐκτραχηλιζειν .</note>

<pb n="470"/>
<p>What manner of waves then, what tempest so grievous as this? Yea, such a one is both
puffed up in a moment by the pleasure, and is under water again easily, being ever in fluctuation,
in tranquillity never. Thus, before the time of the assembly, and of the contests in
speaking, he is possessed with anxiety and fear; but after the assembly he is either dead with
despondency, or rejoices on the contrary without measure; a worse thing than sorrow. For
that pleasure is not a less evil than sorrow is plain from the effect it has on the soul; how
light it makes it, and unsteady, and fluttering.</p>
<p>And this one may see even from those of former times. When, for instance, was David
to be admired; when he rejoiced, or when he was in anguish? When, the people of the Jews?
groaning and calling upon God, or exulting in the wilderness, and worshipping the calf?
Wherefore Solomon too, who best of all men knew what pleasure is, saith, “It is better to
go to the house of mourning, than to the house of laughter.”1712 Wherefore Christ also
blesses the one, saying, “Blessed are they that mourn,”1713but the other sort He bewails,
saying, “Woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall weep.”1714 And very fitly. For in delight the
soul is more relaxed and effeminate, but in mourning it is braced up, and grows sober, and
is delivered from the whole swarm of passions, and becomes higher and stronger.</p>
<p>Knowing then all these things, let us shun the glory that comes from the multitude, and
the pleasure that springs therefrom, that we may win the real and everlasting glory; unto
which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLI.</head>
<p>Matt. XII. 25, 26.</p>
<p>“And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself
shall be brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not
stand: and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom
stand?”</p>
<p>Even before now they had accused Him of this, that “by Beelzebub He casteth out the
devils.”1715 But whereas then He did not rebuke them, allowing them both to know His
power by His more numerous miracles, and by His teaching to learn His majesty: now, since
they continued saying the same, He proceeds also to rebuke them, showing His Godhead
by this first, that He made their secrets public; and secondly, by the very act of casting out
the devils with ease.</p>
<p>And indeed the accusation too was very shameless. Because, as I have said, envy seeks
not what to say, but only that it may say somewhat. Yet for all that, not even so did Christ
despise them, but defends Himself with the forbearance proper to Him, teaching us to be
meek to our enemies; and though they say such things, as we are neither conscious of, nor
have they any the least probability, not to be disturbed, nor troubled, but with all long suffering
to render them an account. This then He did most especially on that very occasion,
affording the strongest proof, that the things were false that were said by them. For neither
was it a demoniac’s part to exhibit so much meekness; it was not a demoniac’s part to know
men’s secrets.</p>
<p>For, in truth, both because of the exceeding impudence of such a suspicion, and because
of the fear of the multitude, they durst not publicly make these charges, but were turning
them in their mind. But He, to show them that He knew all that likewise, doth not set down
the accusation, nor doth He expose their wickedness; but the refutation He adds, leaving it
to the conscience of them that had said it to convict them. For on one thing only was He
bent, to do good to them that were sinning, not to expose them.</p>
<p>Yet surely, if He had been minded to extend his speech in length, and to make them ridiculous,
and withal to have exacted of them also the most extreme penalty, there was
nothing to hinder Him. Nevertheless He put aside all these things, and looked to one object
only, not to render them more contentious, but more candid, and so to dispose them better
toward amendment.</p>
<p>How then doth He plead with them? Not by allegation out of the Scriptures (for they
would not so much as attend, but were sure rather to distort their meaning), but by the
<note type="footnote">1715 Matt. ix. 34. [“Demons,” and so throughout.—R.]</note>

<pb n="472"/>
events of ordinary life. For “every kingdom,” saith He, “divided against itself shall not stand;
and a city and a house, if it be divided, is soon dissolved.”1716</p>
<p>For the wars from without are not so ruinous as the civil ones. Yea, and this is the case
in bodies too; it is the case even in all things; but for this time He takes His illustration from
those that are more publicly known.</p>
<p>And yet, what is there more powerful on earth than a kingdom? Nothing, but nevertheless
it perishes if in dissension. And if in that case one throw the blame on the great burden of
the affairs thereof, as breaking down by its own weight; what wouldest thou say of a city?
and what of a house? Thus, whether it be a small thing, or a great, if at dissension with itself,
it perishes. If then I, having a devil, do by him cast out the devils, there is dissension and
fighting among devils, and they take their stand one against another. But if they stand one
against another, their strength is wasted and destroyed. “For if Satan cast out Satan” (and
He said not “the devils,” implying their great unanimity one with another), “he is then divided
against himself;” so He speaks. But if he be divided, he is become weaker, and is ruined; and
if he be ruined, how can he cast out another?</p>
<p>Seest thou how great the absurdity of the accusation, how great the folly, the inconsistency?
Since it is not for the same persons to say first, that He stands, and casts out devils,
and then to say, that He stands by that, which it was likely would be the cause of His undoing.</p>
<p>2. This then being the first refutation, the next after it is that which relates to the disciples.
For not always in one way only, but also in a second and third, He solves their objections,
being minded most abundantly to silence their shamelessness. Which sort of thing He did
also with respect to the Sabbath, bringing forward David, the priests, the testimony that
saith, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice,” the cause of the Sabbath, for which it was ordained;
“for the Sabbath,” saith He,” was for man.”1717 This then He doth in the present
case also: where after the first He proceeds to a second refutation, plainer than the former.</p>
<p>“For if I,” saith He, “by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them
out?”1718</p>
<p>See here too His gentleness. For He said not, “my disciples,” nor, “the apostles,” but
“your sons;” to the end that if indeed they were minded to return to the same nobleness1719with
them, they might derive hence a powerful spring that way; but if they were
uncandid, and continued in the same course, they might not thenceforth be able to allege
any plea, though ever so shameless.</p>

<pb n="473"/>
<p>But what He saith is like this, “By whom do the apostles cast them out?” For in fact they
were doing so already, because they had received authority from Him, and these men brought
no charge against them; their quarrel not being with the acts, but with the person only. As
then it was His will to show that their sayings arose only from their envy against Him, He
brings forward the apostles; thus: If I so cast them out, much more those, who have received
their authority from me. Nevertheless, no such thing have ye said to them. How then bring
ye these charges against me, the author of their doings, while acquitting them of the accusations?
This, however, will not free you from your punishment, rather it will condemn you
the more. Therefore also He added, “They shall be your judges.” For when persons from
among you, and having been practised in these things, both believe me and obey, it is most
clear that they will also condemn those who are against me both in deed and word.</p>
<p>“But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come unto
you.”1720</p>
<p>What means “the Kingdom”? “My coming.” See how again He conciliates and soothes
them, and draws them to the knowledge of Himself, and signifies that they are warring with
their own good, and contentious against their own salvation. “For whereas ye ought to rejoice,”
saith He, “and leap for joy, that One is come bestowing those great and unutterable
blessings, hymned of old by the prophets, and that the time of your prosperity is at hand;
ye do the contrary; so far from receiving the blessings, you do even speak ill of them, and
frame accusations that have no real being.”</p>
<p>Now Matthew indeed saith, “If I by the Spirit of God cast out”; but Luke, “If I by the
finger of God cast out the devils:”1721implying that to cast out devils is a work of the greatest
power, and not of any ordinary grace. And He means indeed that from these things they
should infer and say, If this be so, then the Son of God is come. This, however, He saith not,
but in a reserved way, and so as not to be galling to them, He darkly intimates it by saying,
“Then the kingdom of God is come unto you.”</p>
<p>Seest thou exceeding wisdom? By the very things which they were blaming, He showed
His presence shining forth.</p>
<p>Then, to conciliate them, He said not simply, “The Kingdom is come,” but, “unto
you,”1722as though He had said, To you the good things are come; wherefore then feel displeased
at your proper blessings? why war against your own salvation? This is that time,
which the prophets long ago foretold: this, the sign of that advent which was celebrated by
them, even these things being wrought by divine power. For the fact indeed, that they are
wrought, yourselves know; but that they are wrought by divine power, the deeds themselves

<pb n="474"/>
cry out. Yea, and it is impossible that Satan should be stronger now; rather he must of absolute
necessity be weak. But it cannot be, that he who is weak should, as though he were strong,
cast out the strong devil.</p>
<p>Now thus speaking He signified the power of charity, and the weakness of separation
and contentiousness. Wherefore He was Himself also continually charging His disciples,
on every occasion, concerning charity, and teaching them that the devil, to subvert it, leaves
nothing undone.</p>
<p>3. Having then uttered His second refutation, He adds also a third, thus saying:</p>
<p>“How can one enter into the strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first
bind the strong man, and then spoil his goods?”1723</p>
<p>For that Satan cannot possibly cast out Satan is evident from what hath been said; but
that neither in any other way is it possible to cast him out, except one first get the better of
him, this too is acknowledged by all.</p>
<p>What then is established hereby? The former statement, with more abundant evidence.
“Why, I am so far,” saith He, “from using the devil as an ally, that I make war upon him,
and bind him; and an infallible proof thereof is the plundering of his goods.” See how the
contrary is proved, of what they were attempting to establish. For whereas they wished to
show, that not by His own power doth He cast out devils, He shows that not only the devils,
but even their very chief leader is held by Him bound with all authority; and that over him,
before them, did He prevail by His own power. And this is evident from the things that are
done. For if he be the prince, and they subjects, how, except he were worsted, and made to
bow down, could they have been spoiled?</p>
<p>And here His saying seems to me to be a prophecy likewise. For not only, I suppose,
are the evil spirits the goods of the devil, but also the men that are doing his works. Therefore
to declare that He doth not only cast out devils, but also will drive away all error from the
world, and will put down his sorceries, and make all his arts useless, He said these things.</p>
<p>And He said not, He will take away, but “He will spoil,” to express what is done with
authority. But He calls him “strong,” not because he is so by nature, God forbid, but declaring
his former tyranny, which arose from our remissness.</p>
<p>4. “He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad.”1724</p>
<p>Behold also a fourth refutation. For what is my desire? saith He. To bring men to God,
to teach virtue, to proclaim the kingdom. What, that of the devil, and the evil spirits? The
contrary to these. How then should he that gathers not with me, nor is at all with me, be
likely to co-operate with me? And why do I say co-operate? Nay, on the contrary, his desire
<note type="footnote">1723 Matt. xii. 29. [The R.V and A.V. follow a different reading in the last clause.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1724 Matt. xii. 30.</note>

<pb n="475"/>
is rather to scatter abroad my goods. He then who is so far from cooperating that he even
scatters abroad, how should he have exhibited such unanimity with me, as with me to cast
out the devils?</p>
<p>Now it is a natural surmise that He said this not of the devil only, but Himself also of
Himself, as being for His part against the devil, and scattering abroad his goods. And how,
one may say, is he that is not with me against me? By this very fact, of his not gathering. But
if this be true, much more he that is against him. For if he that doth not co-operate is an
enemy, much more he that wages war.</p>
<p>But all these things He saith, to indicate His enmity against the devil, how great and
unspeakable it is. For tell me, if thou must go to war with any one, he that is not willing to
fight on thy side, by this very fact is he not against thee? And if elsewhere He saith, “He that
is not against you is for you,”1725it is not contrary to this. For here He signified one actually
against them, but there He points to one who in part is on their side: “For they cast out
devils,” it is said “in Thy name.”1726</p>
<p>But to me He seems here to be hinting also at the Jews, setting them on the devil’s side.
For they too were against Him, and were scattering what He gathered. As to the fact that
He was hinting at them also, He declared it by speaking thus,</p>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you, that all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
men.”1727</p>
<p>5. Thus having defended Himself, and refuted their objection, and proved the vanity of
their shameless dealings, He proceeds to alarm them. For this too is no small part of advice
and correction, not only to plead and persuade, but to threaten also; which He doth in many
passages, when making laws and giving counsel.</p>
<p>And though the saying seem to have much obscurity, yet if we attend, its solution will
prove easy.</p>
<p>First then it were well to listen to the very words: “All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
them. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but
whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come.”1728</p>
<p>What now is it that He affirms? Many things have ye spoken against me; that I am a
deceiver, an adversary of God. These things I forgive you on your repentance, and exact no

<pb n="476"/>
penalty of you; but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven, no, not to those who
repent. And how can this be right? For even this was forgiven upon repentance. Many at
least of those who said these words believed afterward, and all was forgiven them. What is
it then that He saith? That this sin is above all things unpardonable. Why so? Because
Himself indeed they knew not, who He might be, but of the Spirit they received ample experience.
For the prophets also by the Spirit said whatever they said; and indeed all in the
Old Testament had a very high notion of Him.</p>
<p>What He saith, then, is this: Be it so: ye are offended at me, because of the flesh with
which I am encompassed: can ye say of the Spirit also, We know it not? And therefore is
your blasphemy unpardonable, and both here and hereafter shall ye suffer punishment. For
many indeed have been punished here only (as he who had committed fornication,1729as
they who partook unworthily of the mysteries,1730amongst the Corinthians); but ye, both
here and hereafter.</p>
<p>Now as to your blasphemies against me, before the cross, I forgive them: and the daring
crime too of the cross itself; neither shall ye be condemned for your unbelief alone. (For
neither had they, that believed before the cross, perfect faith. And on many occasions He
even charges them to make Him known to no man before the Passion; and on the cross He
said that this sin was forgiven them.) But as to your words touching the Spirit, they will have
no excuse. For in proof that He is speaking of what was said of Him before the crucifixion,
He added, “Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him;
but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost,” there is no more forgiveness. Wherefore?
Because this is known to you; and the truths are notorious which you harden yourselves
against. For though ye say that ye know not me; yet of this surely ye are not ignorant, that
to cast out devils, and to do cures, is a work of the Holy Ghost. It is not then I only whom
ye are insulting, but the Holy Ghost also. Wherefore your punishment can be averted by no
prayers, neither here nor there.</p>
<p>For so of men, some are punished both here, and there, some here only, some there
only, others neither here nor there. Here and there, as these very men (for both here did
they pay a penalty, when they suffered those incurable ills at the taking of their city, and
there shall they undergo a very grievous one), as the inhabitants of Sodom; as many others.
There only, as the rich man who endured the flames,1731and had not at his command so
much as a drop of water. Here, as he that had committed fornication amongst the Corinthians.
Neither here nor there, as the apostles, as the prophets, as the blessed Job; for their
sufferings were not surely in the way of punishment, but as contests and wrestlings.</p>

<pb n="477"/>
<p>Let us labor, therefore, to be of the same part with these: or if not with these, at least
with them that wash away their sins here. For fearful indeed is that other judgment, and
inexorable the vengeance, and incurable the punishment.</p>
<p>6. But if thou desire not to be punished even here, pass judgment on thyself, exact thine
own penalty. Listen to Paul, when he saith, “If we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged.”1732 If thou do this, proceeding in order thou shalt even arrive at a crown.</p>
<p>But how are we to exact our own penalty? one may ask. Lament, groan bitterly, humble,
afflict thyself, call to remembrance thy sins in their particulars. This thing is no small torture
to a man’s soul. If any man hath been in a state of contrition, he knows that the soul is
punished by this more than anything. If any hath been living in remembrance of sins, he
knows the anguish thence arising. Therefore doth God appoint righteousness as a reward
for such repentance, saying, “Be thou first to tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.”1733
For it is not, it is not indeed, a small step towards amendment, to lay together all our sins,
and to be continually revolving and reckoning them up with their particulars. For he that
is doing this will be so heart-broken, as not to think himself worthy so much as to live; and
he that thinks thus, will be tenderer than any wax. For tell me not of acts of fornication only,
nor of adulteries, nor of these things that are manifest, and acknowledged amongst all men:
but lay together also thy secret crafts, and thy false accusations, and thine evil speakings,
and thy vain gloryings, and thine envy, and all such things. For neither will these bring a
trifling punishment. For the reviler too shall fall into hell; and the drunkard hath no part in
the kingdom; and he that lovest not his neighbor so offends God, as to find no help even in
his own martyrdom; and he that neglects his own hath denied the faith, and he who overlooks
the poor is sent into the fire.</p>
<p>Account not then these things to be little, but put all together, and write them as in a
book. For if thou write them down, God blots them out; even as on the other hand, if thou
omit writing them, God both inscribes them, and exacts their penalty. It were then far better
for them to be written by us, and blotted out above, than on the contrary, when we have
forgotten them, for God to bring them before our eyes in that day.</p>
<p>Therefore that this may not be so, let us reckon up all with strictness, and we shall find
ourselves answerable for much. For who is clear from covetousness? Nay, tell me not of the
quantity, but since even in a small amount we shall pay the same penalty, consider this and
repent. Who is rid of all insolence? Yet this casts into hell. Who hath not secretly spoken
evil of his neighbor? Yet this deprives one of the Kingdom.1734 Who hath not been selfwilled?
Yet this man is more unclean than all. Who hath not looked with unchaste eyes?

<note type="footnote">1734 [This clause is wanting in three mss.—R.]</note>

<pb n="478"/>
Yet this is a complete adulterer. Who hath not been “angry with his brother without a cause”?
Yet such an one is “in danger of the council.” Who hath not sworn? Yet this thing is of the
evil one. Who hath not forsworn himself? but this man is something more than of the evil
one. Who hath not served mammon? but this man is fallen away from the genuine service
of Christ.</p>
<p>I have also other things greater than these to mention: but even these are enough, and
able, if a man be not made of stone, nor utterly past feeling, to bring him to compunction.
For if each one of them casts into hell, what will they not bring to pass when all are met together?</p>
<p>How then can one be saved? it may be asked. By application of the countervailing remedies:
alms, prayers, compunction, repentance, humility, a contrite heart, contempt of possessions.
For God hath marked out for us innumerable ways of salvation, if we be willing
to attend. Let us then attend, and let us every way cleanse out our wounds, showing mercy,
remitting our anger against them that have displeased us, giving thanks for all things to
God, fasting according to our power, praying sincerely, “making unto ourselves friends of
the mammon of unrighteousness.”1735 For so shall we be able to obtain pardon for our offenses,
and to win the promised good things; whereof may we all be counted worthy, by the
grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XII. 33.</p>
<p>“Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit
corrupt; for the tree is known by his fruit.”</p>
<p>Again in another way He shames them, and is not content with His former refutations.
But this He doth, not freeing Himself from accusations, (for what went before was quite
enough), but as wishing to amend them.</p>
<p>Now His meaning is like this: none of you hath either found fault about the persons
healed, as not being healed; nor hath said, that it is an evil thing to deliver one from a devil.
For though they had been ever so shameless, they could not have said this.</p>
<p>Since therefore they brought no charge against the works, but were defaming the Doer
of them, He signifies that this accusation is against both the common modes of reasoning,
and the congruity of the circumstances. A thing of aggravated shamelessness, not only to
interpret maliciously, but also to make up such charges as are contrary to men’s common
notions.</p>
<p>And see how free He is from contentiousness. For He said not, “Make the tree good,
forasmuch as the fruit also is good;” but, most entirely stopping their mouths, and exhibiting
His own considerateness, and their insolence, He saith, Even if ye are minded to find fault
with my works, I forbid it not at all, only bring not inconsistent and contradictory charges.
For thus were they sure to be most clearly detected, persisting against what was too palpable.
Wherefore to no purpose is your maliciousness, saith He, and your self-contradictory
statements. Because in truth the distinction of the tree is shown by the fruit, not the fruit
by the tree; but ye do the contrary. For what if the tree be the origin of the fruit; yet it is the
fruit that makes the tree to be known. And it were consistent, either in blaming us to find
fault with our works too, or praising these, to set us who do them free from these charges.
But now ye do the contrary; for having no fault to find with the works, which is the fruit,
ye pass the opposite judgment upon the tree, calling me a demoniac; which is utter insanity.</p>
<p>Yea, and what He had said before,1736this He establishes now also; that a good tree
cannot bring forth evil fruit, nor again can the converse be. So that their charges were against
all consistency and nature.</p>
<p>Then since He is arguing not for Himself, but for the Spirit, He hath dealt out His reproof
even as a torrent, saying, “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
things?”1737</p>
<note type="footnote">1736 Matt. vii. 16–18.</note>
<note type="footnote">1737 Matt. xii. 34.</note>

<pb n="480"/>
<p>Now this is at once to accuse, and to give demonstration of His own sayings from their
case. For behold, saith He, ye being evil trees, cannot bring forth good fruit. I do not then
marvel at your talking thus: for ye were both ill nurtured, being of wicked ancestors, and ye
have acquired a bad mind.</p>
<p>And see how carefully, and without any hold for exception, He hath expressed His accusations:
in that He said not, “How can ye speak good things, being a generation of vipers?
(for this latter is nothing to the former): but, “How can ye, being evil, speak good things?”</p>
<p>But He called them “broods of vipers,” because they prided themselves on their forefathers.
To signify therefore that they had no advantage thereby, He both casts them out from
their relationship to Abraham, and assigns them forefathers of kindred disposition, having
stripped them of that ground of illustriousness.</p>
<p>“For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” Here again He indicates
His Godhead, which knew their secrets: and that not for words only, but also for wicked
thoughts, they shall suffer punishment; and that He knows it all, as God. And He saith, that
it is possible even for men to know these things; for this is a natural consequence, that when
wickedness is overflowing within, its words should be poured forth through the lips. So that
when thou hearest a man speak wicked words, do not suppose only so much wickedness to
be in him as the words display, but conjecture the fountain to be much more abundant; for
that which is spoken outwardly, is the superabundance of that which is within.</p>
<p>See how vehemently He reprehends them. For if what they had said is so evil, and is of
the very mind of the devil, consider the root and well-spring of their words, how far that
must reach. And this is naturally the case; for while the tongue through shame often pours
not forth all its wickedness at once, the heart having no human witness, fearlessly gives birth
to whatever evils it will; for of God it hath not much regard.1738 Since then men’s sayings
come to examination and are set before all, but the heart is concealed; therefore the evils of
the former grow less, while those of the latter increase. But when that within is multiplied,
all that hath been awhile hidden comes forth with a violent gushing. And as persons
vomiting strive at first to keep down the humors that force their way out, but, when they
are overcome, cast forth much abomination; so do they that devise evil things, and speak
ill of their neighbors.</p>
<p>“A good man out of his good treasure,” saith He, “bringeth forth good things, and an
evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.”1739</p>
<p>For think not by any means, saith He, that it is so in respect of wickedness only, for in
goodness also the same occurs: for there too the virtue within is more than the words without.
By which He signified, that both they were to be accounted more wicked than their words
<note type="footnote">1738 [ο πολ λγο ατ, “it takes not much account.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1739 Matt. xii. 35. [R.V, “The good man…the evil man,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="481"/>
indicated, and Himself more perfectly good than His sayings declared. And He calls it “a
treasure,” indicating its abundance.</p>
<p>Then again He fences them in with great terror. For think not at all, saith He, that the
thing stops at this, that is, at the condemnation of the multitude; nay, for all that do wickedly
in such things shall suffer the utmost punishment. And He said not, “ye,” partly in order to
instruct our whole race, partly to make His saying the less burdensome.</p>
<p>“But I say unto you,” this is His word, “that every idle word that men shall speak, they
shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”1740</p>
<p>And that is idle, which is not according to the fact, which is false, which hath in it unjust
accusation; and some say, that which is vain also, for instance, provoking inordinate laughter,
or what is filthy, and immodest, and coarse.</p>
<p>“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”1741</p>
<p>Seest thou how far the tribunal is from invidiousness? how favorable the account required?
For not upon what another hath said of thee, but from what thou hast thyself spoken,
will the Judge give His sentence; which is of all things the very fairest: since surely with thee
it rests, either to speak, or not to speak.</p>
<p>2. Wherefore not those that are slandered, but the slanderers, have need to be anxious
and to tremble. For the former are not constrained to answer for themselves touching the
evil things which are said of them, but the latter will, for the evil they have spoken; and over
these impends the whole danger. So that the persons censured should be without anxiety,
not being to give account of the evil that others have said; but the censurers have cause to
be in anxiety, and to tremble, as being themselves to be dragged before the judgment-seat
in that behalf. For this is indeed a diabolical snare, and a sin having in it no pleasure, but
harm only. Yea, and such an one is laying up an evil treasure in his soul. And if he that hath
an evil humor in him doth himself first reap the fruits of the malady, much more he that is
treasuring up in himself what is more bitter than any bile, I mean, wickedness, will suffer
the utmost evils, gathering unto himself a grievous disease. And it is evident from the things
that He vomits out. For if they pain others so much, far more the soul that gives them birth.</p>
<p>Thus the plotter destroys himself first; just as he that treads1742on fire burns up himself,
and he that smites adamant spites himself, and he that kicks against the pricks draws blood
from himself. For somewhat of this kind is he that knows how to suffer wrong, and to bear

<note type="footnote">1741 Matt. xii. 37.</note>
<note type="footnote">1742 πατν. Bened. from mss. ἀνπτων, “he that kindles:” which seems to agree with the tenor of the sentence

as the original form.—R.]</note>

<pb n="482"/>
it manfully; he is adamant, and the pricks, and fire; but he that hath used himself to do
wrong is feebler than any clay.</p>
<p>Not therefore to suffer wrong is evil, but to do it, and not to know how to bear being
wronged. For instance, how great wrongs did David endure! How great wrongs1743did Saul
commit! Which then was the stronger and happier? which the more wretched and miserable?
was it not he that did wrong? And mark it. Saul had promised, if David should slay the
Philistine, to take him for his son-in law, and to give him his daughter with great favor. He
slew the Philistine; the other broke his engagements, and so far from bestowing her, did
even go about to slay him. Which then became the more glorious? Was not the one choking
with despair and the evil demon, while the other shone brighter than the sun with his
trophies, and his loyalty to God? Again, before the choir of the women, was not the one
suffocated with envy, while the other enduring all in silence, won all men, and bound them
unto himself? And when he had even gotten him into his hands, and spared him, which
again was happy? and which wretched? which was the weaker? which the more powerful?
Was it not this man, who did not avenge himself even justly? And very naturally. For the
one had armed soldiers, but the other, righteousness, that is more mighty than ten thousand
armies, for his ally and helper. And for this reason, though unjustly conspired against, he
endured not to slay him even justly. For he knew by what had taken place before, that not
to do evil, but to suffer evil, this is what makes men more powerful. So it is with bodies also,
so also with trees.</p>
<p>And what did Jacob? Was he not injured by Laban, and suffered evil? Which then was
the stronger? he that had gotten the other into his hands, and durst not touch him, but was
afraid and trembling;1744or he whom we see without arms and soldiers proving more terrible
to him than innumerable kings?</p>
<p>But that I may give you another demonstration of what I have said, greater than this,
let us again in the instance of David himself try the reasoning on the opposite side. For this
man who being injured was so strong, afterwards upon committing an injury became on
the contrary the weaker party. At least, when he had wronged Uriah, his position was changed
again, and the weakness passed to the wrong doer, and the might to the injured; for he being
dead laid waste the other’s house. And the one being a king, and alive, could do nothing,
but the other, being but a soldier, and slain, turned upside down all that pertained to his
adversary.</p>
<p>Would ye that in another way also I should make what I say plainer? Let us look into
their case, who avenge themselves even justly. For as to the wrong doers, that they are the
most worthless of all men, warring against their own soul; this is surely plain to every one.</p>
<note type="footnote">1743 [Oxford Version: “things;” probably a misprint, the Greek being the same as before.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1744 Gen. xxxi. 29.</note>

<pb n="483"/>
<p>But who avenged himself justly, yet kindled innumerable ills, and pierced himself through
with many calamities and sorrows? The captain of David’s host. For he both stirred up a
grievous war, and suffered unnumbered evils; not one whereof would have happened, had
he but known how to command himself.1745</p>
<p>Let us flee therefore from this sin, and neither in words nor deeds do our neighbors
wrong. For He said not, If thou slander, and summon a court of justice, but simply, If thou
speak evil, though within thyself, even so shalt thou suffer the utmost punishment. Though
it be true which thou hast said, though thou have spoken upon conviction, even so shall
vengeance come upon thee. For not according to what the other hath done, but according
to what thou hast spoken, will God pass sentence; “for by thy words thou shalt be condemned,”
saith He. Art thou not told that the Pharisee also spake the truth, and affirmed
what was manifest to all men, without discovering what was hidden? Nevertheless, he paid
the utmost penalty.</p>
<p>But if we ought not to accuse men of things which are acknowledged, much less of those
which are disputed; nay, for the offender hath a judge. Do not now, I warn thee, seize upon
the privilege of the Only Begotten. For Him is the throne of judgment reserved.</p>
<p>3. Wouldest thou however be a judge? Thou hast a court of judgment which hath great
profit, and bears no blame. Make consideration, as judge, to sit down upon thy conscience,
and bring before it all thy transgressions, search out the sins of thy soul, and exact with
strictness the account thereof, and say, “wherefore didst thou dare to do this and that?” And
if she shun these, and be searching into other men’s matters, say to her, “Not about these
am I judging thee, not for these art thou come here to plead. For what, if such a one be a
wicked man? Thou, why didst thou commit this and that offense? Answer for thyself, not
to accuse; look to thine own matters, do not those of others.” And be thou continually urging
her to this anxious trial. Then, if she have nothing to say, but shrink back, wear her out with
the scourge, like some restless and unchaste handmaid. And this tribunal do thou cause to
sit every day, and picture the river of fire, the venomous worm, the rest of the torments.</p>
<p>And permit her not to be with the devil any more, nor bear with her shameless sayings,
“he comes to me, he plots against me, he tempts me;” but tell her, “If thou wert not willing,
all that would be to no purpose.” And if she say again, “I am entangled with a body, I am
clothed with flesh, I dwell in the world, I abide on earth;” tell her, “All these are excuses and
pretexts. For such an one too was encompassed with flesh, and such another dwelling in
the world, and abiding on earth, is approved; and thou thyself too, when thou doest well,
doest it encompassed with flesh.” And if she be pained at hearing this, take not off thine
hand; for she will not die, if thou smite her, but thou wilt save her from death. And if she
say again, “Such an one provoked me,” tell her, “But it is in thy power not to be provoked;
<note type="footnote">1745 See 2 Samuel iii. 23–30, and xx. 9, 10; 1 Kings ii. 5, 6.</note>

<pb n="484"/>
often at least thou hast restrained thine anger.” And if she say, “The beauty of such a woman
moved me;” tell her, “Yet wast thou able to have mastered thyself.” Bring forward those that
have got the better, bring forward the first woman, who said, “The serpent beguiled
me,”1746and yet was not acquitted of the blame.</p>
<p>And when thou art searching out these things, let no man be present, let no man disturb
thee; but as the judges sit under curtains to judge, so do thou too, instead of curtains, seek
a time and place of quiet. And when after thy supper thou art risen up, and art about to lie
down, then hold this thy judgment; this is the time convenient for thee, and the place, thy
bed, and thy chamber. This the prophet likewise commanded, saying, “For the things which
ye say in your hearts, be ye moved to compunction upon your beds.”1747 And for small offenses
require great satisfaction, that unto the great thou mayest never even approach. If
thou do this every day, thou wilt with confidence stand at that fearful judgment-seat.</p>
<p>In this way Paul became clean; therefore also he said, “For if we judged ourselves, we
should not be judged.”1748 Thus did Job cleanse his sons.1749 For he that offered sacrifices
for secret sins, much more did he require an account of such as were manifest.</p>
<p>4. But we do not so, but altogether the contrary. For as soon as we are laid down to rest,
we rather think over all our worldly matters; and some introduce unclean thoughts, some
usuries, and contracts, and temporal cares.</p>
<p>And if we have a daughter, a virgin, we watch her strictly; but that which is more precious
to us than a daughter, our soul, her we suffer to play the harlot and defile herself, introducing
to her innumerable wicked thoughts. And whether it be the love of covetousness, or that of
luxury, or that of fair persons, or that of wrath, or be it what you will else that is minded to
come in, we throw open the doors, and attract and invite it, and help it to defile our soul at
its leisure. And what can be more barbarous than this, to overlook our soul that is more
precious than all, abused by so many adulterers, and so long companying with them, even
until they are sated? which will never be. So it is, therefore, that when sleep overtakes us,
then only do they depart from her; or rather not even then, for our dreams and imaginations
furnish her with the same images. Whence also, when day is come, the soul stored with such
images often falls away to the actual performance of those fancies.</p>
<p>And thou, while into the apple of thine eye thou sufferest not so much as a grain of dust
to enter, dost thou pass unnoticed thy soul, gathering to itself a heap of so great evils? When
shall we then be able to clear out this filth, which we are daily laying up within us? when to
cut up the thorns? when to sow the seed? Knowest thou not that henceforth the time of

harvest is at hand? But we have not yet so much as ploughed our fields. If then the husbandman
should come and find fault, what shall we say? and what answer shall we make? That
no man gave us the seed? Nay, this is sown daily. That no man, then, hath cut up the thorns?
Nay, every day we are sharpening the sickle. But do the necessary engagements of life distract
thee? And why hast thou not crucified thyself to the world? For if he that repays that only,
which is given him, is wicked, because he did not double it; he that hath wasted even this,
what will be said to him? If that person was bound, and cast out where is gnashing of teeth,
what shall we have to suffer, who, when numberless motives are drawing us toward virtue,
shrink back and are unwilling?</p>
<p>For what is there, that hath not enough in it to persuade thee? Seest thou not the vileness
of the world, the uncertainty of life, the toil, the sweat, for things present? What? is it the
case that virtue must be toiled for, but may vice be had without toil? If then both in the one
and in the other there is toil, why didst thou not choose this, which hath so great profit?</p>
<p>Or rather, there are some parts of virtue, which are free even from toil. For what kind
of toil is it, not to calumniate, not to lie, not to swear, to lay aside our anger against our
neighbor? Nay, on the contrary, to do these things is toilsome, and brings much anxiety.</p>
<p>What plea then shall we have, what excuse, not doing right even in these matters? For
hereby it is plain, that out of remissness and sloth the more toilsome duties also altogether
escape us.</p>
<p>All these things let us consider; let us flee vice, let us choose virtue, that we may attain
both unto the good things that are present, and unto those that are to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLIII.</head>
<p>Matt. XII. 38, 39.</p>
<p>“Then certain of the Scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Master, we would see a sign
from Thee. But He answered and said,1750An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after
a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonas.”</p>
<p>Could then anything be more foolish than these men (not more impious only), who
after so many miracles, as though none had been wrought, say, “We would see a sign from
Thee?” With what intent then did they so speak? That they might lay hold of Him again.
For since by His words He had stopped their mouths, once and twice and often, and had
checked their shameless tongue, they come to His works again. At which also the evangelist
marvelling again, said,</p>
<p>“Then certain of the scribes answered Him, asking a sign.”</p>
<p>“Then,” when? When they ought to be stooping before Him, to admire, to be amazed
and give way, “then” they desist not from their wickedness.</p>
<p>And see their words too, teeming with flattery and dissimulation. For they thought to
draw Him towards them in that way. And now they insult, now they flatter Him; now calling
Him a demoniac, now again “Master,” both out of an evil mind, how contrary soever the
words they speak.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He rebukes them severely. And when they were questioning Him roughly
and insulting Him, He reasoned with them gently; when they were flattering; reproachfully,
and with great severity; implying that He is superior to either passion, and is neither at the
one time moved to anger, nor at the other softened by flattery. And see His reproach, that
it is not merely hard words, but contains a demonstration of their wickedness. For what
saith He?</p>
<p>“An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign.” Now what He saith is to this
effect: What marvel if ye behave so to me who have been hitherto unknown to you when
even to the Father, of whom ye have had so much experience, ye have done the very same?
forsaking Him, ye have run unto the devils, drawing to yourselves wicked lovers. With this
Ezekiel too was continually upbraiding them.1751</p>
<p>Now by these sayings He signified Himself to be of one accord with His Father, and
them to be doing nothing new; He was also unfolding their secrets, how with hypocrisy and
as enemies they were making their demand. Therefore He called them “an evil generation,”
<note type="footnote">1750 [“Unto them” is omitted in the Greek text here, against all our New Testament codices.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1751 See Ezek. xvi. 23, etc.</note>

<pb n="487"/>
because they have been always ungrateful towards their benefactors; because upon favors
they become worse, which belongs to extreme wickedness.</p>
<p>And He called it “adulterous,” declaring both their former and their present unbelief;
whereby He implies Himself again to be equal to the Father, if at least the not believing Him
makes it “adulterous.”</p>
<p>2. Then, after His reproach, what saith He? “There shall no sign be given to it, but the
sign of Jonas the prophet.” Now is He striking the first note of the doctrine of His resurrection,
and confirming it by the type.</p>
<p>What then? one may say; was no sign given it? None was given to it on asking. For not
to bring in them did He work His signs (for He knew them to be hardened), but in order
to amend others. Either then this may be said, or that they were not to receive such a sign
as that was. For a sign did befall them, when by their own punishment they learnt His power.
Here then He speaks as threatening, and with this very meaning obscurely conveyed: as if
He said, innumerable benefits have I showed forth, none of these hath drawn you to me,
neither were ye willing to adore my power. Ye shall know therefore my might by the contrary
tokens, when ye shall see your city cast down to the ground, the walls also dismantled, the
temple become a ruin; when ye shall be cast out both from your former citizenship and
freedom, and shall again go about everywhere, houseless and in exile. (For all these things
came to pass after the cross.) These things therefore shall be to you for great signs. And indeed
it is an exceeding great sign, that their ills remain unchanged; that although ten thousand
have attempted it, no one hath been able to reverse1752the judgment once gone forth against
them.</p>
<p>All this however He saith not, but leaves it to after time to make it clear to them, but
for the present He is making trial of1753the doctrine of His resurrection, which they were
to come to know by the things which they should afterwards suffer.</p>
<p>“For as Jonas,” saith He, “was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall
the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.”1754 Thus, He said
not indeed openly that He should rise again, since they would have even laughed Him to
scorn, but He intimated it in such manner, that they might believe Him to have foreknown
it. For as to their being aware of it, they say to Pilate, “That deceiver said,” these are their
words, “while He was yet alive, After three days I will rise again;”1755and yet we know His
disciples were ignorant of this; even as they had been beforehand more void of understanding
than these: wherefore also these became self-condemned.</p>

<note type="footnote">1755 Matt. xxvii. 63. [The citation is not exact: at the close a different verb, in a different tense, is given.—R.]</note>

<pb n="488"/>
<p>But see how exactly He expresses it, even though in a dark saying. For He said not, “In
the earth,” but, “In the heart of the earth;” that He might designate His very sepulchre, and
that no one might suspect a mere semblance.1756 And for this intent too did He allow three
days, that the fact of His death might be believed. For not by the cross only doth He make
it certain, and by the sight of all men, but also by the time of those days. For to the resurrection
indeed all succeeding time was to bear witness; but the cross, unless it had at the time
many signs bearing witness to it, would have been disbelieved; and with this disbelief would
have gone utter disbelief of the resurrection also. Therefore He calls it also a sign. But had
He not been crucified, the sign would not have been given. For this cause too He brings
forward the type, that the truth may be believed. For tell me, was Jonah in the whale’s belly
a mere appearance? Nay, thou canst not say so. Therefore neither was Christ in the heart
of the earth such. For surely the type is not in truth, and the truth in mere appearance. For
this cause we every where show forth His death, both in the mysteries, and in baptism, and
in all the rest. Therefore Paul also cries with a clear voice, “God forbid that I should glory,
save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”1757</p>
<p>Whence it is clear, that they who are diseased in Marcion’s way are children of the
devil, blotting out these truths, to avoid the annulling whereof Christ did so many things,
while to have them annulled the devil took such manifold pains: I mean, His cross and His
passion.</p>
<p>3. Therefore He said elsewhere also, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up:”1758and, “The days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from
them:1759and here, “There shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet:” declaring
both that He should die1760and “the ox that knoweth his owner, and the ass that
remembereth his crib.”1761 Even so here too, when He had by a comparison set forth their
perverseness, He speaks afterwards of their punishment also.</p>
<p>What then can the saying mean? As the possessed, saith He, when delivered from that
infirmity, should they be at all remiss, draw upon themselves their delusion more grievous
than ever: even so is it with you. For before also ye were possessed by a devil, when ye were
worshipping idols, and were slaying your sons to the devils, exhibiting great madness; nevertheless
I forsook you not, but cast out that devil by the prophets; and again in my own

person I am come, willing to cleanse you more entirely. Since then you will not attend, but
have wrecked yourselves in greater wickedness (for to kill prophets was a crime not nearly
so great and grievous as to slay Him); therefore your sufferings will be more grievous than
the former, those at Babylon, I mean, and in Egypt, and under the first Antiochus. Because
what things befell them in the time of Vespasian and Titus, were very far more grievous
than those. Wherefore also He said, “There shall be great tribulation, such as never was,
neither shall be.”1762 But not this only doth the illustration declare, but that they should be
also utterly destitute of all virtue, and more assailable by the power of the devils, than at that
time. For then even although they sinned, yet were there also among them such as acted
uprightly, and God’s providence was present with them, and the grace of the Spirit, tending,
correcting, fulfilling all its part; but now of this guardianship too they shall be utterly de-
prived; so He tells them; so that there is now both a greater scarcity of virtue, and a more
intense affliction, and a more tyrannical operation of the devils.</p>
<p>Ye know accordingly even in our generation, when he who surpassed all in impiety, I
mean Julian, was transported with his fury, how they ranged themselves with the heathens,
how they courted their party. So that, even if they seem to be in some small degree chastened
now, the fear of the emperors makes them quiet; since, if it were not for that, far worse than
the former had been their daring. For in all their other evil works they surpass their predecessors;
sorceries, magic arts, impurities, they exhibit in great excess. And amongst the rest,
moreover, strong as is the curb which holds them down, they have often made seditions,
and risen up against kings, which has resulted in their being pierced through with the worst
of evils.</p>
<p>Where now are they that seek after signs? Let them hear that a considerate mind is
needed, and if this be wanting, signs are of no profit. See, for instance, how the Ninevites
without signs believed, while these, after so many miracles, grew worse, and made themselves
an habitation of innumerable devils, and brought on themselves ten thousand calamities;
and very naturally. For when a man, being once delivered from his ills, fails to be corrected,
he will suffer far worse than before. Yea, therefore He said, “he finds no rest,” to indicate,
that positively and of necessity such an one will be overtaken by the ambush of the devils.
Since surely by these two things he ought to have been sobered, by his former sufferings,
and by his deliverance; or rather a third thing also is added, the threat of having still worse
to endure. But yet by none of these were they made better.</p>
<p>5. All this might be seasonably said, not of them only, but of us also, when after having
been enlightened,1763and delivered from our former ills, we again cleave unto the same
wickedness, for more grievous also thenceforth will be the punishment of our subsequent
<note type="footnote">1762 Matt. xxiv. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">1763 Heb. vi. 4.</note>

<pb n="490"/>
sins. Therefore to the sick of the palsy also Christ said, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin
no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee;”1764and this to a man who was thirty-eight
years in his infirmity. And what, one might ask, was he to suffer worse than this? Something
far worse, and more intolerable. For far be it from us, that we should endure as much as we
are capable of enduring. For God is at no loss for inflictions. For according to the greatness
of His mercy, so also is His wrath.</p>
<p>With this He charges Jerusalem also by Ezekiel. “I saw thee,” saith He, “polluted in
blood; and I washed thee, and anointed thee; and thou hadst renown for thy beauty; and
thou pouredst out thy fornications,” saith He, “on those who dwell near thee,”1765wherefore
also the more grievous are His threatenings to thee when thou sinnest.</p>
<p>But from hence infer not thy punishment only, but also the boundless longsuffering of
God. How often at least have we put our hands to the same evil deeds, and yet He suffers
long! But let us not be sanguine, but fear; since Pharaoh too, had he been taught by the first
plague, would not have experienced the later ones; he would not afterwards have been
drowned, his host and all together.</p>
<p>And this I say, because I know many, who like Pharaoh are even now saying, “I know
not God,”1766and making those that are in their power cleave to the clay and to the bricks.
How many, though God bids them assauge their “threatening,”1767cannot bear so much as
to relax the toil!</p>
<p>“But we have no Red Sea now, to pass through afterwards.” But we have a sea of fire, a
sea not like that, either in kind or in size, but far greater and fiercer, having its waves of fire,
of some strange and horrible fire. A great abyss is there, of most intolerable flame. Since
everywhere fire may be seen roving quickly round, like some savage wild beast. And if here
this sensible and material fire leaped like a wild beast out of the furnace, and sprang upon
those who were sitting without,1768what will not that other fire do to such as have fallen
into it?</p>
<p>Concerning that day, hear the prophets, saying, “The day of the Lord is incurable, full
of anger and wrath.”1769 For there will be none to stand by, none to rescue, nowhere the
face of Christ, so mild and calm. But as those who work in the mines are delivered over to
certain cruel men, and see none of their friends, but those only that are set over them; so
will it be then also: or rather not so, but even far more grievous. For here it is possible to go

unto the king, and entreat, and free the condemned person: but there, no longer; for He
permits it not, but they continue in the scorching torment,1770and in so great anguish, as
it is not possible for words to tell. For if, when any are in flames here, no speech can describe
their sharp pangs, much less theirs, who suffer it in that place: since here indeed all is over
in a brief point of time, but in that place there is burning indeed, but what is burnt is not
consumed.</p>
<p>What then shall we do there? For to my self also do I say these things.</p>
<p>6. “But if thou,” saith one, “who art our teacher, speakest so of thyself, I care no more;
for what wonder, should I be punished?” Nay, I entreat, let no man seek this consolation;
for this is no refreshment at all. For tell me; was not the devil an incorporeal power? Was
he not superior to men? Yet he fell away. Is there any one who will derive consolation from
being punished along with him? By no means. What of all who were in Egypt? did they not
see those also punished who were in high places, and every house in mourning? Were they
then hereby refreshed, and comforted? No surely; and it is manifest by what they did afterwards,
as men tortured by some kind of fire, rising up together against the king, and compelling
him to cast out the people of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Yea, and very unmeaning is this saying, to suppose that it gives comfort to be punished
with all men, to say, “As all, so I too.” For why should I speak of hell? Think, I pray you, of
those that are seized with gout, how, when they are racked by sharp pain, though you show
them ten thousand suffering worse, they do not so much as take it into their mind. For the
intensity of their anguish allows not their reason any leisure for thinking of others, and so
finding consolation. Let us not then feed ourselves with these cold hopes. For to receive
consolation from the ills of our neighbors, takes place in ordinary sufferings; but when the
torment is excessive, and all our inward parts full of tempest, and the soul is now come to
be unable so much as to know itself, whence shall it derive consolation? So that all these
sayings are an absurdity, and fables of foolish children. For this, of which thou speakest,
takes place in dejection, and in moderate dejection, when we are told, “the same thing hath
befallen such an one;” but sometimes not even in dejection: now if in that case it hath no
strength, much less in the anguish and burden unspeakable, which “the gnashing of teeth”
indicates.</p>
<p>And I know that I am galling you, and giving you pain by these words; but what can I
do? For I would fain not speak thus, but be conscious of virtue both in myself, and in all of
you; but since we are in sins, the more part of us, who will grant me ability to pain you indeed,
and to penetrate the understanding of them that hear me? Then might I so be at rest. But
now I fear lest any despise my sayings, and their punishments become the greater for their
indifferent way of hearing. Since, when a master utters a threat, should one of the fellow-
<note type="footnote">1770 ἀποτηγανιζμενοι.</note>

<pb n="492"/>
servants hear and make light of his menace, not without punishment would he hasten by
him, provoked as he is, but rather it would be a ground for increasing his chastisement.
Wherefore I entreat you, let us pierce our own hearts, when we hear His sayings regarding
hell. For nothing is more delightful than this discourse, by how much nothing is more bitter
than the reality. But how delightful to be told of hell? one may ask. Because it were so far
from delight to fall into hell, which result, our words that appear so galling, keep off. And
before this they furnish another pleasure: in that they brace up our souls, and make us more
reverent, and elevate the mind, and give wings to the thoughts, and cast out the desires that
so mischievously beset us; and the thing becomes a cure.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore, to proceed, together with the punishment let me speak also of the shame.
For as the Jews shall then be condemned by the Ninevites, so we too by many that seem
beneath us now.</p>
<p>Let us imagine then how great the mockery, how great the condemnation; let us imagine,
and cast some foundation at length, some door of repentance.</p>
<p>To myself I say these things, to myself first I give this advice, and let no one be angry,
as though he were condemned. Let us enter upon the narrow way. How long shall it be
luxury? how long sloth? Have we not had enough of indolence, mirth, procrastination? Will
it not be the same over again, feasting, and surfeiting, and expense, and wealth, and acquisitions,
and buildings? And what is the end? Death. What is the end? Ashes, and dust, and
coffins, and worms.</p>
<p>Let us show forth then a new kind of life. Let us make earth, heaven; let us hereby show
the Greeks, of how great blessings they are deprived. For when they behold in us good
conversation, they will look upon the very face of the kingdom of Heaven. Yea, when they
see us gentle, pure from wrath, from evil desire, from envy, from covetousness, rightly fulfilling
all our other duties, they will say, “If the Christians are become angels here, what will
they be after their departure hence? if where they are strangers they shine so bright, how
great will they become when they shall have won their native land!” Thus they too will be
reformed, and the word of godliness “will have free course,”1771not less than in the apostles’
times. For if they, being twelve, converted entire cities and countries; were we all to become
teachers by our careful conduct, imagine how high our cause will be exalted. For not even
a dead man raised so powerfully attracts the Greek, as a person practising self-denial. At
that indeed he will be amazed, but by this he will be profited. That is done, and is past away;
but this abides, and is constant culture to his soul.</p>
<p>Let us take heed therefore to ourselves, that we may gain them also. I say nothing burdensome.
I say not, do not marry. I say not, forsake cities, and withdraw thyself from public
affairs; but being engaged in them, show virtue. Yea, and such as are busy in the midst of
<note type="footnote">1771 2 Thess. iii. 1.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
cities, I would fain have more approved than such as have occupied the mountains.
Wherefore? Because great is the profit thence arising. “For no man lighteth a candle, and
setteth it under the bushel.”1772 Therefore I would that all the candles were set upon the
candlestick, that the light might wax great.</p>
<p>Let us kindle then His fire; let us cause them that are sitting in darkness to be delivered
from their error. And tell me not, “I have a wife, and children belonging to me, and am
master of a household, and cannot duly practise all this.” For though thou hadst none of
these, yet if thou be careless, all is lost; though thou art encompassed with all these, yet if
thou be earnest, thou shalt attain unto virtue. For there is but one thing that is wanted, the
preparation of a generous mind; and neither age, nor poverty, nor wealth, nor reverse of
fortune, nor anything else, will be able to impede thee. Since in fact both old and young,
and men having wives, and bringing up children, and working at crafts, and serving as soldiers,
have duly performed all that is enjoined. For so Daniel was young, and Joseph a slave,
and Aquila wrought at a craft, and the woman who sold purple was over a workshop, and
another was the keeper of a prison, and another a centurion, as Cornelius; and another in
ill health, as Timothy; and another a runaway, as Onesimus; but nothing proved an hindrance
to any of these, but all were approved, both men and women, both young and old, both
slaves and free, both soldiers and people.</p>
<p>Let us not then make vain pretexts, but let us provide a thoroughly good mind, and
whatsoever we may be, we shall surely attain to virtue, and arrive at the good things to come;
by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XII. 46-49.</p>
<p>“While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring
to speak with Him. Then one said unto Him, Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand
without, desiring to speak with Thee. But He answered and said unto him that told Him,
Who is my mother, and1773my brethren? And He stretched forth His hand towards His
disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren.”</p>
<p>That which I was lately saying, that when virtue is wanting all things are vain, this is
now also pointed out very abundantly. For I indeed was saying, that age and nature, and to
dwell in the wilderness, and all such things, are alike unprofitable, where there is not a good
mind; but to-day we learn in addition another thing, that even to have borne Christ in the
womb, and to have brought forth that marvellous birth, hath no profit, if there be not virtue.</p>
<p>And this is hence especially manifest. “For while He yet talked to the people,” it is said,
“one told Him, Thy mother and Thy brethren seek Thee. But He saith, who is my mother,
and who are my brethren?”</p>
<p>And this He said, not as being ashamed of His mother, nor denying her that bare Him;
for if He had been ashamed of her, He would not have passed through that womb; but as
declaring that she hath no advantage from this, unless she do all that is required to be done.
For in fact that which she had essayed to do, was of superfluous vanity; in that she wanted
to show the people that she hath power and authority over her Son, imagining not as yet
anything great concerning Him; whence also her unseasonable approach. See at all events
both her self-confidence1774and theirs.1775 Since when they ought to have gone in, and

<note type="footnote">1775 “It seems to me that the person bringing the message was not simply doing so on occasion given, but
was laying a snare for our Saviour, to see whether he would prefer flesh and blood to His spiritual task. Our
Lord therefore did not think scorn to come out, as disavowing mother and brethren, but He speaks as answering
one who was laying a snare for Him.…Not, as Marcion and Manichæus say, did He deny His mother, that we
should esteem Him born of a phantom, but He preferred the apostles to His kindred.” St. Jer. in loc. “Some
pestilent heretics would maintain from this passage, that our Lord had no mother, and do not perceive that it
follows, on comparison of an other text” (St. Matt. xxiii. 9), “that neither have His disciples fathers. Because, as
He said Himself, “Who is my mother?” so He taught them, saying, “Call no man your father on earth.” St. Aug.
in Ps. ix. sec. 31. [He speaks] “not as defrauding His mother of her due honor, but indicates for what kind of
maternity the Virgin is pronounced to be blessed. For if he who hears the Word of God and keeps it is His
brother, and sister, and mother, and Christ’s mother had both these, evidently this was the maternity in respect</note>

listened with the multitude; or if they were not so minded, to have waited for His bringing
His discourse to an end, and then to have come near; they call Him out, and do this before
all, evincing a superfluous vanity, and wishing to make it appear, that with much authority
they enjoin Him. And this too the evangelist shows that he is blaming, for with this very
allusion did he thus express himself, “While He yet talked to the people;” as if he should
say, What? was there no other opportunity? Why, was it not possible to speak with Him in
private?</p>
<p>And what was it they wished to say? For if it were touching the doctrines of the truth,
they ought to have propounded these things publicly, and stated them before all, that the
rest also might have the benefit: but if about other matters that concerned themselves, they
ought not to have been so urgent. For if He suffered not the burial of a father, lest the attendance
on Him should be interrupted, much less ought they to have stopped His discourse to
the people, for things that were of no importance. Whence it is clear, that nothing but
vainglory led them to do this; which John too declares, by saying, “Neither did His brethren
believe on Him;”1776and some sayings too of theirs he reports, full of great folly; telling us
that they were for dragging Him to Jerusalem, for no other purpose, but that they themselves
might reap glory from His miracles. “For if thou do these things,” it is said, “show Thyself
to the world. For there is no man that doeth anything in secret, and seeketh himself to be
manifest;”1777when also He Himself rebuked them, attributing it to their carnal mind. That
is, because the Jews were reproaching Him, and saying, “Is not this the carpenter’s son,
whose father and mother we know? and His brethren, are not they with us?”1778they, willing
to throw off the disparagement caused by His birth, were calling Him to the display of His
miracles.</p>
<p>For this cause He quite repels them, being minded to heal their infirmity; since surely,
had it been His will to deny His mother, He would have denied her then, when the Jews
were reproaching Him. But as it is, we see that He takes so great care of her, as even at the
very cross to commit her to the disciple whom He loved most of all, and to give him a great
charge concerning her.</p>
<note type="footnote">of which His mother was to be blessed. For to hear the Word of God and keep it belongs to a pure soul, looking
altogether towards God. And since it was no ordinary woman whom God selected to become the mother of
Christ, but her who in virtues held a place higher than all women, therefore Christ also willed His mother to be
called blessed from this virtue, whereby she was deemed worthy to become a virgin mother.” Quæst. et Resp.

<p>But now He doth not so, out of care for her, and for His brethren. I mean, because their
regard for Him was as towards a mere man, and they were vainglorious, He casts out the
disease, not insulting, but correcting them.</p>
<p>But do thou, I pray, examine not the words only, which contain a moderate reproof,
but also the unbecoming conduct of His brethren, and the boldness wherewith they had
been bold and who was the person reproving it, no mere man, but the only-begotten Son
of God; and with what purpose He reproved; that it was not with intent to drive them to
perplexity, but to deliver them from the most tyrannical passion and to lead them on by
little and little to the right idea concerning Himself, and to convince her that He was not
her Son only, but also her Lord: so wilt thou perceive that the reproof is in the highest degree
both becoming Him and profitable to her, and withal having in it much gentleness. For He
said not, “Go thy way, tell my mother, thou art not my mother,” but He addresses Himself
to the person that told Him; saying, “Who is my mother?” together with the things that have
been mentioned providing for another object also. What then is that? That neither they nor
others confiding in their kindred, should neglect virtue. For if she is nothing profited by
being His mother, were it not for that quality in her, hardly will any one else be saved by
his kindred. For there is one only nobleness, to do the will of God. This kind of noble birth
is better than the other, and more real.</p>
<p>2. Knowing therefore these things, let us neither pride ourselves on children that are of
good report, unless we have their virtue; nor upon noble fathers, unless we be like them in
disposition. For it is possible, both that he who begat a man should not be his father, and
that he who did not beget him should be. Therefore in another place also, when some woman
had said, “Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked;” He
said not, “The womb bare me not, neither did I suck the paps,” but this, “Yea rather, blessed
are they that do the will of my Father.”1779 Seest thou how on every occasion He denies not
the affinity by nature, but adds that by virtue? And His forerunner too, in saying, “O generation
of vipers, think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,”1780means not this, that
they were not naturally of Abraham, but that it profits them nothing to be of Abraham,
unless they had the affinity by character; which Christ also declared, when He said, “If ye
were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham;”1781not depriving them of
their kindred according to the flesh, but teaching them to seek after that affinity which is
greater than it, and more real.</p>
<note type="footnote">1779 Luke xi. 27, 28. [According to many Harmonists this occurred about the same time, probably as His
mother was seen approaching.—R.]</note>

<pb n="497"/>
<p>This then He establishes here also, but in a manner less invidious, and more measured,
as became Him speaking to His mother. For He said not at all, “She is not my mother, nor
are those my brethren, because they do not my will;” neither did He declare and pronounce
judgment against them; but He yet left in it their own power to choose, speaking with the
gentleness that becomes Him.</p>
<p>“For he that doeth,” saith He, “the will of my Father, this is my brother, and sister, and
mother.”1782</p>
<p>Wherefore if they desire to be such, let them come this way. And when the woman again
cried out, saying, “Blessed is the womb that bare Thee,” He said not, “She is not my mother,”
but, “If she wishes to be blessed, let her do the will of my Father. For such a one is both
brother, and sister, and mother.”</p>
<p>Oh honor! oh virtue! Unto what a height doth she lead up him that follows after her!
How many women have blessed that holy Virgin, and her womb, and prayed that they might
become such mothers, and give up all! What then is there to hinder? For behold, He hath
marked out a spacious road for us; and it is granted not to women only, but to men also, to
be of this rank, or rather of one yet far higher. For this makes one His mother much more,
than those pangs did. So that if that were a subject for blessing, much more this, inasmuch
as it is also more real. Do not therefore merely desire, but also in the way that leads thee to
thy desire walk thou with much diligence.</p>
<p>3. Having then said these words, “He came out of the house.” Seest thou, how He both
rebuked them, and did what they desired? Which He did also at the marriage.1783 For there
too He at once reproved her asking unseasonably, and nevertheless did not gainsay her; by
the former correcting her weakness, by the latter showing His kindly feeling toward His
mother. So likewise on this occasion too, He both healed the disease of vainglory, and
rendered the due honor to His mother, even though her request was unseasonable. For, “in
the same day,” it is said, “went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.”1784</p>
<p>Why, if ye desire, saith He, to see and hear, behold I come forth and discourse. Thus
having wrought many miracles, He affords again the benefit of His doctrine. And He “sits
by the sea,” fishing and getting into His net them that are on the land.</p>
<p>But He “sat by the sea,” not without a purpose; and this very thing the evangelist has
darkly expressed. For to indicate that the cause of His doing this was a desire to order His
auditory with exactness, and to leave no one behind His back, but to have all face to face,</p>
<p>“And great multitudes,” saith He, “were gathered together unto Him, so that He went
into a ship and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.”1785</p>

<pb n="498"/>
<p>And having sat down there, He speaks by parables.</p>
<p>“And He spake,” it says, “many things unto them in parables.”1786</p>
<p>And yet on the mount, we know, He did no such thing, neither did He weave His discourse
with so many parables, for then there were multitudes only, and a simple people; but
here are also Scribes and Pharisees.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, what kind of parable He speaks first, and how Matthew
puts them in their order. Which then doth He speak first? That which it was most necessary
to speak first, that which makes the hearer more attentive. For because He was to discourse
unto them in dark sayings, He thoroughly rouses His hearers’ mind first by His parable.
Therefore also another evangelist saith that He reproved them, because they do not understand;
saying, “How knew ye not the parable?”1787 But not for this cause only doth He speak
in parables, but that He may also make His discourse more vivid, and fix the memory of it
in them more perfectly, and bring the things before their sight. In like manner do the
prophets also.</p>
<p>4. What then is the parable? “Behold,” saith He, “a sower1788went forth to sow.” Whence
went He forth, who is present everywhere, who fills all things? or how went He forth? Not
in place, but in condition and dispensation to usward, coming nearer to us by His clothing
Himself with flesh. For because we could not enter, our sins fencing us out from the entrance,
He comes forth unto us. And wherefore came He forth? to destroy the ground teeming with
thorns? to take vengeance upon the husbandmen? By no means; but to till and tend it, and
to sow the word of godliness. For by seed here He means His doctrine, and by land, the
souls of men, and by the sower, Himself.</p>
<p>What then comes of this seed? Three parts perish, and one is saved.</p>
<p>“And when He sowed, some seeds fell,” He saith, “by the way side; and the fowls came
and devoured them up.”1789</p>
<p>He said not, that He cast them, but that “they fell.”</p>
<p>“And some upon the rock, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang
up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was up, they were scorched;
and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among the thorns, and
the thorns sprang up, and choked them. But others fell on the good ground, and brought
forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear
let him hear.”1790</p>

from the accounts of Mark and Luke.—R.]</note>

<pb n="499"/>
<p>A fourth part is saved; and not this all alike, but even here great is the difference.</p>
<p>Now these things He said, manifesting that He discoursed to all without grudging. For
as the sower makes no distinction in the land submitted to him, but simply and indifferently
casts his seed; so He Himself too makes no distinction of rich and poor, of wise and unwise,
of slothful or diligent, of brave or cowardly; but He discourses unto all, fulfilling His part,
although foreknowing the results; that it may be in His power to say, “What ought I to have
done, that I have not done?”1791 And the prophets speak of the people as of a vine; “For my
beloved,” it is said, “had a vineyard;”1792and, “He brought a vine out of Egypt;”1793but He,
as of seed. What could this be to show? That obedience now will be quick and easier, and
will presently yield its fruit.</p>
<p>But when thou hearest, “The sower went forth to sow,” think it not a needless repetition.
For the sower frequently goes forth for some other act also, either to plough, or to cut out
the evil herbs, or to pluck up thorns, or to attend to some such matter; but He went forth
to sow.</p>
<p>Whence then, tell me, was the greater part of the seed lost? Not through the sower, but
through the ground that received it; that is, the soul that did not hearken.</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He not say, Some the careless received, and lost it; some the rich,
and choked it, and some the superficial, and betrayed it? It is not His will to rebuke them
severely, lest He should cast them into despair, but He leaves the reproof to the conscience
of His hearers.</p>
<p>And this was not the case with the seed only, but also with the net; for that too produced
many that were unprofitable.</p>
<p>5. But this parable He speaks, as anointing His disciples, and to teach them, that even
though the lost be more than such as receive the word yet they are not to despond. For this
was the ease even with their Lord, and He who fully foreknew that these things should be,
did not desist from sowing.</p>
<p>And how can it be reasonable, saith one, to sow among the thorns, on the rock, on the
wayside? With regard to the seeds and the earth it cannot be reasonable; but in the case of
men’s souls and their instructions, it hath its praise, and that abundantly. For the husbandman
indeed would reasonably be blamed for doing this; it being impossible for the rock to
become earth, or the wayside not to be a wayside, or the thorns, thorns; but in the things
that have reason it is not so. There is such a thing as the rock changing, and becoming rich

<pb n="500"/>
land; and the wayside being no longer trampled on, nor lying open to all that pass by, but
that it may be a fertile field; and the thorns may be destroyed, and the seed enjoy full security.
For had it been impossible, this Sower would not have sown. And if the change did not take
place in all, this is no fault of the Sower, but of them who are unwilling to be changed: He
having done His part: and if they betrayed what they received of Him, He is blameless, the
exhibitor of such love to man.</p>
<p>But do thou mark this, I pray thee; that the way of destruction is not one only, but there
are differing ones, and wide apart from one another. For they that are like the wayside are
the coarse-minded,1794and indifferent, and careless; but those on the rock such as fail from
weakness only.</p>
<p>For “that which is sown upon the stony places,” saith He, “the same is he that heareth
the word, and anon with joy receiveth it. Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a
while; but when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended!
When any one,” so He saith, “heareth the word of truth and understandeth it not,
then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth that which was sown out of his heart. This is he
that is sown by the wayside.”1795</p>
<p>Now it is not the same thing for the doctrine to wither away, when no man is evil entreating,
or disturbing its foundations, as when temptations press upon one. But they that
are likened to the thorns, are much more inexcusable than these.</p>
<p>6. In order then that none of these things may befall us, let us by zeal and continual remembrance
cover up the things that are told us. For though the devil do catch them away,
yet it rests with us, whether they be caught away; though the plants wither, yet it is not from
the heat this takes place (for He did not say, because of the heat it withered, but, “because
it had no root”); although His sayings are choked, it is not because of the thorns, but of them
who suffer them to spring up. For there is a way, if thou wilt, to check this evil growth, and
to make the right use of our wealth. Therefore He said not, “the world,” but “the care of the
world;” nor “riches,” but “the deceitfulness of riches.”</p>
<p>Let us not then blame the things, but the corrupt mind. For it is possible to be rich and
not to be deceived; and to be in this world, and not to be choked with its cares. For indeed
riches have two contrary disadvantages; one, care, wearing us out, and bringing a darkness
over us; the other, luxury, making us effeminate.</p>
<p>And well hath He said, “The deceitfulness of riches.” For all that pertains to riches is
deceit; they are names only, not attached to things. For so pleasure and glory, and splendid
array, and all these things, are a sort of vain show, not a reality.</p>

<pb n="501"/>
<p>Having therefore spoken of the ways of destruction, afterwards He mentions the good
ground, not suffering them to despair, but giving a hope of repentance, and indicating that
it is possible to change from the things before mentioned into this.</p>
<p>And yet if both the land be good, and the Sower one, and the seed the same, wherefore
did one bear a hundred, one sixty, one thirty? Here again the difference is from the nature
of the ground, for even where the ground is good, great even therein is the difference. Seest
thou, that not the husbandman is to be blamed, nor the seed, but the land that receives it?
not for its nature, but for its disposition. And herein too, great is His mercy to man, that
He doth not require one measure of virtue, but while He receives the first, and casts not out
the second, He gives also a place to the third.</p>
<p>And these things He saith, least they that followed Him should suppose that hearing is
sufficient for salvation. And wherefore, one may say, did He not put the other vices also,
such as lust, vainglory? In speaking of “the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,”
He set down all. Yea, both vainglory and all the rest belong to this world, and to the deceitfulness
of riches; such as pleasure, and gluttony, and envy, and vainglory, and all the like.</p>
<p>But He added also the “way” and the “rock,” signifying that it is not enough to be freed
from riches only, but we must cultivate also the other parts of virtue. For what if thou art
free indeed from riches, yet are soft and unmanly? and what if thou art not indeed unmanly,
but art remiss and careless about the hearing of the word? Nay, no one part is sufficient for
our salvation, but there is required first a careful hearing, and a continual recollection; then
fortitude, then contempt of riches, and deliverance from all worldly things.</p>
<p>In fact, His reason for putting this before the other, is because the one is first required
(for “How shall they believe except they hear?”1796just as we too, except we mind what is
said, shall not be able so much as to learn what we ought to do): after that, fortitude, and
the contempt of things present.</p>
<p>7. Hearing therefore these things, let us fortify ourselves on all sides, regarding His instructions,
and striking our roots deep, and cleansing ourselves from all worldly things. But
if we do the one, neglecting the other, we shall be nothing bettered; for though we perish
not in one way, yet shall we in some other. For what signifies our not being ruined by riches,
if we are by indolence: or not by indolence, if we are by softness. For so the husbandman,
whether this way or that way he lose his crop, equally bewails himself. Let us not then soothe
ourselves upon our not perishing in all these ways, but let it be our grief, in whichever way
we are perishing.</p>
<p>And let us burn up the thorns, for they choke the word. And this is known to those rich
men, who not for these matters alone, but for others also prove unprofitable. For having
become slaves and captives of their pleasures, they are useless even for civil affairs, and if
<note type="footnote">1796 Rom. x. 14.</note>

<pb n="502"/>
for them, much more for those of Heaven. Yea, and in two ways hereby our thoughts are
corrupted; both by the luxury, and by the anxiety too. For either of these by itself were
enough to overwhelm the bark; but when even both concur, imagine how high the billow
swells.</p>
<p>And marvel not at His calling our luxury, “thorns.” For thou indeed art not aware of it,
being intoxicated with thy passion, but they that are in sound health know that it pricks
sharper than any thorn, and that luxury wastes the soul worse than care, and causes more
grievous pains both to body and soul. For one is not so sorely smitten by anxiety, as by
surfeiting. Since when watchings, and throbbings of the temples, and heaviness in the head,
and pangs of the bowels, lay hold of such a man, you may imagine how many thorns these
surpass in grievousness. And as the thorns, on whichever side they are laid hold of, draw
blood from the hands that seize them, just so doth luxury plague both feet, and hands, and
head, and eyes, and in general all our members; and it is withered also, and unfruitful, like
the thorn, and hurts much more than it, and in our vital parts. Yea, it brings on premature
old age, and dulls the senses, and darkens our reasoning, and blinds the keen-sighted mind,
and makes the body tumid,1797rendering excessive the deposition of that which is cast away,
and gathering together a great accumulation of evils; and it makes the burden too great, and
the load overwhelming; whence our falls are many and continual, and our shipwrecks frequent.</p>
<p>For tell me, why pamper thy body? What? are we to slay thee in sacrifice, to set thee on
the table? The birds it is well for thee to pamper: or rather, not so well even for them; for
when they are fattened, they are unprofitable for wholesome food. So great an evil is luxury,
that its mischief is shown even in irrational beings. For even them by luxury we make unprofitable,
both to themselves and to us. For their superfluous flesh is indigestible, and the
moister kind of corruption is engendered by that kind of fatness. Whereas the creatures that
are not so fed, but live, as one may say, in abstinence, and moderate diet, and in labor and
hardship, these are most serviceable both to themselves and to others, as well for food, as
for everything else. Those, at any rate, who live on them, are in better health; but such as
are fed on the others are like them, growing dull and sickly, and rendering their chain more
grievous. For nothing is so hostile and hurtful to the body, as luxury; nothing so tears it in
pieces, and overloads and corrupts it, as intemperance.</p>
<p>Wherefore above all may this circumstance make one amazed at them for their folly,
that not even so much care as others show towards their wine skins, are these willing to
evince towards themselves. For those the wine merchants do not allow to receive more than
is fit, lest they should burst; but to their own wretched belly these men do not vouchsafe
even so much forethought, but when they have stuffed it and distended it, they fill all, up
<note type="footnote">1797 πλαδαρν.</note>

<pb n="503"/>
to the ears, up to the nostrils, to the very throat itself, thereby pressing into half its room
the spirit, and the power that directs the living being. What? was thy throat given thee for
this end, that thou shouldest fill it up to the very mouth, with wine turned sour, and all
other corruption? Not for this, O man, but that thou shouldest above all things sing to God,
and offer up the holy prayers, and read out the divine laws, and give to thy neighbors profitable
counsel. But thou, as if thou hadst received it for this end, dost not suffer it to have
leisure for that ministry, so much as for a short season, but for all thy life subjectest it to this
evil slavery. And as if any man having had a lyre given him with golden strings, and beautifully
constructed, instead of awakening with it the most harmonious music, were to cover
it over with much dung and clay; even so do these men. Now the word, dung, I use not of
living, but of luxurious living, and of that great wantonness. Because what is more than ne-
cessary is not nourishment, but merely injurious. For in truth the belly alone was made
merely for the reception of food; but the month, and the throat, and tongue, for other things
also, far more necessary than these: or rather, not even the belly for the reception of food
simply, but for the reception of moderate food. And this it makes manifest by crying out
loudly against us, when we tease it by this greediness; nor doth it clamor against us only,
but also avenging that wrong exacts of us the severest penalty. And first it punishes the feet,
that bear and conduct us to those wicked revels, then the hands that minister to it, binding
them together for having brought unto it such quantities and kinds of provisions; and many
have distorted even their very mouth, and eyes, and head. And as a servant receiving an
order beyond his power, not seldom out of desperation becomes insolent to the giver of the
order: so the belly too, together with these members, often ruins and destroys, from being
over-strained, the very brain itself. And this God hath well ordered, that from excess so
much mischief should arise; that when of thine own will thou dost not practise self-restraint,
at least against thy will, for fear of so great ruin, thou mayest learn to be moderate.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us flee luxury, let us study moderation, that we may both
enjoy health of body, and having delivered our soul from all infirmity, may attain unto the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLV.</head>
<p>Matt. XIII. 10, 11.</p>
<p>“And the disciples came and said unto Him, Why speakest Thou unto them in parables? He
answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you1798to know the mysteries of
the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.”</p>
<p>We have good cause to admire the disciples, how, longing as they do to learn, they know
when they ought to ask. For they do it not before all: and this Matthew shows by saying,
“And they came.” And, as to this assertion not being conjecture, Mark hath expressed it
more distinctly, by saying, that “they came to Him privately.”1799 This then His brethren
and His mother should also have done, and not have called Him out, and made a display.</p>
<p>But mark their kindly affection also, how they have much regard for the others, and
seek their good first, and then their own. “For why,” it is said, “speakest Thou unto them in
parables?” They did not say, why speakest thou unto us in parables? Yea, and on other occasions
also their kindliness towards men appears in many ways; as when they say, “Send the
multitude away;”1800and, “Knowest thou that they were offended ?”1801</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “Because it is given unto you,” so He speaks, “to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.”1802 But this He said, not
bringing in necessity, or any allotment1803made causelessly and at random, but implying
them to be the authors of all their own evils, and wishing to represent that the thing is a gift,
and a grace bestowed from above.</p>
<p>It by no means follows, however, because it is a gift, that therefore free will is taken
away; and this is evident from what comes after. To this purpose, in order that neither the
one sort may despair, nor the other grow careless, upon being told that “it is given,” He
signifies the beginning to be with ourselves.</p>
<p>“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but
whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that which he seemeth to have.”1804
And although the saying be full of much obscurity, yet it indicates unspeakable justice.
For what He saith is like this: When any one hath forwardness and zeal, there shall be given
<note type="footnote">1798 [R.V., “Unto you it is given,” omitting “Because.”]</note>

<pb n="505"/>
unto him all things on God’s part also: but if he be void of these, and contribute not his own
share, neither are God’s gifts bestowed. For even “what he seemeth to have,” so He saith,
“shall be taken away from him;” God not so much taking it away, as counting him unworthy
of His gifts. This we also do; when we see any one listening carelessly, and when with much
entreaty we cannot persuade him to attend, it remains for us to be silent. For if we are still
to go on, his carelessness is aggravated. But him that is striving to learn, we lead on, and
pour in much.</p>
<p>And well said He, “Even that which he seemeth to have.” For he hath not really even
this.</p>
<p>Then He also made what He had said more distinct, pointing out the meaning of, “To
him that hath, shall be given, but from him that hath not, even that which he seemeth to
have, shall be taken away.”</p>
<p>“Therefore,” saith He, “speak I to them in parables; because they seeing see not.”1805</p>
<p>“It were meet then,” one may say, “to have opened their eyes, if they see not.” Nay, if
the blindness were natural, it were meet to open them; but because it was a voluntary and
self-chosen blindness, therefore He said not simply, “They see not,” but, “seeing, they see
not;” so that the blindness is of their own wickedness. For they saw even devils cast out, and
said, “By Beelzebub, prince of the devils, He casteth out the devils.”1806 They heard Him
guiding them unto God, and evincing His great unanimity with Him, and they say, “This
man is not of God.”1807 Since then the judgment they pronounced was contrary both to
their sight and hearing, therefore, saith He, the very hearing do I take away from them. For
they derive thence no advantage, but rather greater condemnation. For they not only disbelieved,
but found fault also, and accused, and laid snares. However, He saith not this, for it
is not His will to give disgust in accusing them. Therefore neither at the beginning did He
so discourse to them, but with much plainness; but because they perverted themselves,
thenceforth He speaks in parables.</p>
<p>2. After this, lest any one should suppose His words to be a mere accusation, and lest
men should say, Being our enemy He is bringing these charges and calumnies against us;
He introduces the prophet also, pronouncing the same judgment as Himself.</p>
<p>“For in them is fulfilled,” saith He, “the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye
shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive.”1808
Seest thou the prophet likewise, accusing them with this same accuracy? for neither did
He say, Ye see not, but “Ye shall see and not perceive;” nor again, Ye shall not hear, but “Ye
<note type="footnote">1805 Matt. xiii. 13.</note>

<note type="footnote">1808 Matt. xiii. 14. See Is. vi. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="506"/>
shall hear and not understand.” So that they first inflicted the loss on themselves, by stopping
their ears, by closing their eyes, by making their heart fat. For they not only failed to hear,
but also “heard heavily,” and they did this, He saith,</p>
<p>“Lest at any time they should be converted, and I should heal them;”1809describing their
aggravated wickedness, and their determined defection from Him. And this He saith to
draw them unto Him, and to provoke them, and to signify that if they would convert1810
He would heal them: much as if one should say, “He would not look at me, and I thank him;
for if he had vouchsafed me this, I should straightway have given in:” and this he saith, to
signify how he would have been reconciled. Even so then here too it is said, “Lest at any
time they should convert,1811and I should heal them;” implying that both their conversion
was possible, and that upon their repentance they might be saved, and that not for His own
glory, but for their salvation, He was doing all things.</p>
<p>For if it had not been His will that they should hear and be saved, He ought to have been
silent, not to have spoken in parables; but now by this very thing He stirs them up, even by
speaking under a veil. “For God willeth not the death of the sinner, but that he should turn
unto Him and live.”1812</p>
<p>For in proof that our sin belongs not to nature, nor to necessity and compulsion, hear
what He saith to the apostles, “But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they
hear;”1813not meaning this kind of sight nor hearing, but that of the mind. For indeed these
too were Jews, and brought up in the same circumstances; but nevertheless they took no
hurt from the prophecy, because they had the root of His blessings well settled in them,
their principle of choice, I mean, and their judgment.</p>
<p>Seest thou that, “unto you it is given,” was not of necessity? For neither would they
have been blessed, unless the well-doing had been their own. For tell me not this, that it was
spoken obscurely; for they might have come and asked Him, as the disciples did: but they
would not, being careless and supine. Why say I, they would not? nay, they were doing the
very opposite, not only disbelieving, not only not hearkening, but even waging war, and
disposed to be very bitter against all He said: which He brings in the prophet laying to their
charge, in the words, “They heard heavily.”</p>
<p>But not such were these; wherefore He also blessed them. And in another way too He
assures them again, saying,</p>
<note type="footnote">1809 Matt. xiii. 15. [The passage is abridged. R.V., “should turn again ” (so in Isaiah). Chrysostom takes it in
this sense, as the context shows.—R.]</note>

<p>“For verily I say unto you, many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those
things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and
have not heard them;”1814my coming, He means; my very miracles, my voice, my teaching.
For here He prefers them not to these depraved only, but even to such as have done virtuously;
yea, and He affirms them to be more blessed even than they. Why can this be? Because
not only do these see what the Jews saw not, but even what those of old desired to see. For
they indeed beheld by faith only: but these by sight too, and much more distinctly.</p>
<p>Seest thou how again He connects the old dispensation with the new, signifying that
those of old not only knew the things to come but also greatly desired them? But had they
pertained to some strange and opposing God, they would never have desired them.</p>
<p>“Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower,”1815saith He; and He speaks what we before
mentioned, of carelessness and attention, of cowardice and fortitude, of wealth and voluntary
poverty; pointing out the hurt from the one, and the benefit from the other.</p>
<p>Then of virtue also He brings forward different forms. For being full of love to man, He
marked out not one only way, nor did He say, “unless one bring forth an hundred, he is an
outcast;” but he that brings forth sixty is saved also, and not he only, but also the producer
of thirty. And this He said, making out salvation to be easy.</p>
<p>3. And thou then, art thou unable to practise virginity? Be chaste in marriage. Art thou
unable to strip thyself of thy possessions? Give of thy substance. Canst thou not bear that
burden? Share thy goods with Christ. Art thou unwilling to yield Him up all? Give Him but
the half, but the third part. He is thy brother, and joint-heir, make Him joint-heir with thee
here too. Whatsoever thou givest Him, thou wilt give to thyself. Hearest thou not what saith
the prophet? “Them that pertain to thy seed thou shalt not overlook.”1816 But if we must
not overlook our kinsmen, much less our Lord, having towards thee, together with His authority
as Lord, the claim also of kindred, and many more besides. Yea, for He too hath
made thee a sharer in His goods, having received nothing of thee, but having begun with
this unspeakable benefit. What then can it be but extreme senselessness, not even by this
gift to be made kind towards men, not even to give a return for a free gift, and less things
for greater? Thus whereas He hath made thee heir of Heaven, impartest thou not to Him
even of the things on earth? He, when thou hadst done no good work, but wert even an enemy,
reconciled thee: and dost thou not requite Him, being even a friend and benefactor?</p>
<p>Yet surely, even antecedently to the kingdom, and to all the rest, even for the very fact
of His giving, we ought to feel bound to Him. For so servants too, when bidding their masters
to a meal, account themselves not to be giving but receiving; but here the contrary hath

taken place: not the servant the Lord, but the Lord hath first bidden the servant unto His
own table; and dost thou not bid Him, no not even after this? He first hath introduced thee
under His own roof; dost thou not take Him in, so much as in the second place? He clad
thee, being naked; and dost thou not even after this receive Him being a stranger? He first
gave thee to drink out of His own cup, and dost thou not impart to Him so much as cold
water? He hath made thee drink of the Holy Spirit, and dost thou not even soothe His bodily
thirst? He hath made thee drink of the Spirit, when thou wast deserving of punishment; and
dost thou neglect Him even when thirsty, and this when it is out of His own, that thou art
to do all these things? Dost thou not then esteem it a great thing, to hold the cup out of
which Christ is to drink, and to put it to His lips? Seest thou not that for the priest alone is
it lawful1817to give the cup of His blood? But I am by no means strict about this, saith He;
but though thyself should give, I receive; though thou be a layman, I refuse it not. And I do
not require such as I have given: for not blood do I seek, but cold water. Consider to whom
thou art giving drink, and tremble. Consider, thou art become a priest of Christ, giv ing
with thine own hand, not flesh but bread, not blood, but a cup of cold water. He clothed
thee with a garment of salvation, and clothed thee by Himself; do thou at least by thy servant
clothe Him. He made thee glorious in Heaven, do thou deliver Him from shivering, and
nakedness, and shame. He made thee a fellow-citizen of angels, do thou impart to Him at
least of the covering of thy roof, give house-room to Him at least as to thine own servant.
“I refuse not this lodging and that, having opened to thee the whole Heaven. I have delivered
thee from a most grievous prison; this I do not require again, nor do I say, deliver me; but
if thou wouldest look upon me only, when I am bound, this suffices me for refreshment.
When thou wert dead, I raised thee; I require not this again of thee, but I say, visit me only
when sick.”</p>
<p>Now when His gifts are so great, and His demands exceeding easy, and we do not supply
even these; what deep of hell must we not deserve? Justly shall we depart into the fire that
is prepared for the devil and his angels, being more insensible than any rock. For how great
insensibility is it, tell me, for us, who have received, and are to receive so much, to be slaves
of money, from which we shall a little while hence be separated even against our will? And
others indeed have given up even their life, and shed their blood; and dost thou not even
give up thy superfluities for Heaven’s sake, for the sake of so great crowns?</p>
<p>And of what favor canst thou be worthy? of what justification? who in thy sowing of
the earth, gladly pourest forth all, and in lending to men at usury sparest nothing; but in
feeding thy Lord through His poor art cruel and inhuman?</p>
<p>Having then considered all these things, and calculated what we have received, what
we are to receive, what is required of us, let us show forth all our diligence on the things

spiritual. Let us become at length mild and humane, that we may not draw down on ourselves
the intolerable punishment. For what is there that hath not power to condemn us? Our
having enjoyed so many and such great benefits; our having no great thing required of us;
our having such things required, as we shall leave here even against our will; our exhibiting
so much liberality in our worldly matters. Why each one of these, even by itself, were enough
to condemn us; but when they all meet together, what hope will there be of salvation?</p>
<p>In order then that we may escape all this condemnation, let us show forth some bounty
towards those who are in need. For thus shall we enjoy all the good things, both here, and
there; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XIII. 24-30.</p>
<p>“Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a
man which sowed good seed in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought
forth fruit, then appeared the tares. So the servants of the householder came and said
unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? He
said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then
that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
up also the wheat with them. Let both therefore grow together until the harvest.”1818</p>
<p>What is the difference between this, and the parable before it? There He speaks of them
that have not at all holden with Him, but have started aside, and have thrown away the seed;
but here He means the societies of the heretics. For in order that not even this might disturb
His disciples, He foretells it also, after having taught them why He speaks in parables. The
former parable then means their not receiving Him; this, their receiving corrupters. For
indeed this also is a part of the devil’s craft, by the side of the truth always to bring in error,
painting thereon many resemblances, so as easily to cheat the deceivable. Therefore He calls
it not any other seed, but tares; which in appearance are somewhat like wheat.</p>
<p>Then He mentions also the manner of his device. For “while men slept,” saith He. It is
no small danger, which He hereby suspends over our rulers, to whom especially is entrusted
the keeping of the field; and not the rulers only, but the subjects too.</p>
<p>And He signifies also that the error comes after the truth, which the actual event testifies.
For so after the prophets, were the false prophets; and after the apostles, the false apostles;
and after Christ, Antichrist. For unless the devil see what to imitate, or against whom to
plot, he neither attempts, nor knows how. Now then also, having seen that “one brought
forth a hundred, another sixty, another thirty,” he proceeds after that another way. That is,
not having been able to carry away what had taken root, nor to choke, nor to scorch it up,
he conspires against it by another craft, privily casting in his own inventions.</p>
<p>And what difference is there, one may say, between them that sleep, and them that resemble
the wayside? That in the latter case he immediately caught it away; yea, he suffered
it not even to take root; but here more of his craft was needed.</p>

<pb n="511"/>
<p>And these things Christ saith, instructing us to be always wakeful. For, saith He, though
thou quite escape those harms, there is yet another harm. For as in those instances “the
wayside,” and “the rock,” and “the thorns,” so here again sleep occasions our ruin; so that
there is need of continual watchfulness. Wherefore He also said, “He that endureth to the
end, the same shall be saved.”1819</p>
<p>Something like this took place even at the beginning. Many of the prelates, I mean,
bringing into the churches wicked men, disguised heresiarchs, gave great facility to the laying
that kind of snare. For the devil needs not even to take any trouble, when he hath once
planted them among us.</p>
<p>And how is it possible not to sleep? one may say. Indeed, as to natural sleep, it is not
possible; but as to that of our moral faculty, it is possible. Wherefore Paul also said, “Watch
ye, stand fast in the faith.”1820</p>
<p>After this He points out the thing to be superfluous too, not hurtful only; in that, after
the land hath been tilled, and there is no need of anything, then this enemy sows again; as
the heretics also do, who for no other cause than vainglory inject their proper venom.</p>
<p>And not by this only, but by what follows likewise, He depicts exactly all their acting.
For, “When the blade was sprung up,” saith He, “and brought forth fruit, then appeared the
tares also;” which kind of thing these men also do. For at the beginning they disguise
themselves; but when they have gained much confidence, and some one imparts to them
the teaching of the word, then they pour out their poison.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He bring in the servants, telling what hath been done? That He may
pronounce it wrong to slay them.</p>
<p>And He calls him “an enemy,” because of his harm done to men. For although the despite
is against us, in its origin it sprang from his enmity, not to us, but to God. Whence it is
manifest, that God loves us more than we love ourselves.</p>
<p>And see from another thing also, the malicious craft of the devil. For he did not sow
before this, because he had nothing to destroy, but when all had been fulfilled, that he might
defeat the diligence of the Husbandman; in such enmity against Him did he constantly act.</p>
<p>And mark also the affection of the servants. I mean, what haste they are in at once to
root up the tares, even though they do it indiscreetly; which shows their anxiety for the crop,
and that they are looking to one thing only, not to the punishment of that enemy, but to
the preservation of the seed sown. For of course this other is not the urgent consideration.</p>
<p>Wherefore how they may for the present extirpate the mischief, this is their object. And
not even this do they seek absolutely, for they trust not themselves with it, but await the
Master’s decision, saying, “Wilt Thou?”</p>
<note type="footnote">1819 Matt. x. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">1820 1 Cor. xvi. 13.</note>

<pb n="512"/>
<p>What then doth the Master? He forbids them, saying, “Lest haply ye root up the wheat
with them.” And this He said, to hinder wars from arising, and blood and slaughter. For it
is not right to put a heretic to death, since an implacable war would be brought into the
world. By these two reasons then He restrains them; one, that the wheat be not hurt; another,
that punishment will surely overtake them, if incurably diseased. Wherefore, if thou
wouldest have them punished, yet without harm to the wheat, I bid thee wait for the proper
season.</p>
<p>But what means, “Lest ye root up the wheat with them?” Either He means this, If ye are
to take up arms, and to kill the heretics, many of the saints also must needs be overthrown
with them; or that of the very tares it is likely that many may change and become wheat. If
therefore ye root them up beforehand, ye injure that which is to become wheat, slaying
some, in whom there is yet room for change and improvement. He doth not therefore forbid
our checking heretics, and stopping their mouths, and taking away their freedom of speech,
and breaking up their assemblies and confederacies, but our killing and slaying them.</p>
<p>But mark thou His gentleness, how He not only gives sentence and forbids, but sets
down reasons.</p>
<p>What then, if the tares should remain until the end? “Then I will say to the reapers,
Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.”1821 He again
reminds them of John’s words,1822introducing Him as judge; and He saith, So long as they
stand by the wheat, we must spare them, for it is possible for them even to become wheat
but when they have departed, having profited nothing, then of necessity the inexorable
punishment will overtake them. “For I will say to the reapers,” saith He, “Gather ye together
first the tares.” Why, “first?” That these may not be alarmed, as though the wheat were carried
off with them. “And bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my
barn.”1823</p>
<p>2. “Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like to
a grain of mustard seed.”1824</p>
<p>That is, since He had said, that of the crop three parts are lost, and but one saved, and
in the very part again which is saved so great damage ensues; lest they should say, “And
who, and how many will be the faithful?” this fear again He removes, by the parable of the
mustard seed leading them on to belief, and signifying that in any case the gospel1825shall
be spread abroad.</p>

<p>Therefore He brought forward the similitude of this herb, which has a very strong resemblance
to the subject in hand; “Which indeed is the least,” He saith, “of all seeds, but
when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of
the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.”1826</p>
<p>Thus He meant to set forth the most decisive sign of its greatness. “Even so then shall
it be with respect to the gospel too,” saith He. Yea, for His disciples were weakest of all, and
least of all; but nevertheless, because of the great power that was in them, It hath been unfolded1827in
every part of the world.</p>
<p>After this He adds the leaven to this similitude, saying,</p>
<p>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.”1828</p>
<p>For as this converts the large quantity of meal into its own quality,1829even so shall ye
convert the whole world.</p>
<p>And see His wisdom, in that He brings in things natural, implying that as the one cannot
fail to take place, so neither the other. For say not this to me: “What shall we be able to do,
twelve men, throwing ourselves upon so vast a multitude?” Nay, for this very thing most of
all makes your might conspicuous, that ye mix with the multitude and are not put to flight.
As therefore the leaven then leavens the lump when it comes close to the meal, and not
simply close, but so as to be actually mixed with it (for He said not, “put,” simply, but “hid”);
so also ye, when ye cleave to your enemies, and are made one with them, then shall ye get
the better of them. And as the leaven, though it be buried, yet is not destroyed, but by little
and little transmutes all into its own condition; of like sort will the event be here also, with
respect to the gospel. Fear ye not then, because I said there would be much injurious dealing:
for even so shall ye shine forth, and get the better of all.</p>
<p>But by “three measures,” here, He meant many, for He is wont to take this number for
a multitude.</p>
<p>And marvel not, if discoursing about the kingdom, He made mention of a little seed
and of leaven; for He was discoursing with men inexperienced and ignorant, and such as
needed to be led on by those means. For so simple were they, that even after all this, they
required a good deal of explanation.</p>

verity of His deeds, and on either ground let them adore Him, that He both foretold so great

a thing, and fulfilled it. Yea, for it is He that put the power into the leaven. With this intent
He mingled also with the multitude those who believe on Him, that we might impart unto
the rest of our wisdom. Let no one therefore reprove us for being few. For great is the power
of the gospel, and that which hath been once leavened, becomes leaven again for what remains.
And as a spark, when it hath caught in timber, makes what hath been burnt up already
increase the flame, and so proceeds to the rest; even so the gospel likewise. But He said not
fire, but “leaven.” Why might this be? Because in that case the whole effect is not of the fire,
but partly of the timber too that is kindled, but in this the leaven doth the whole work by
itself.</p>
<p>3. Now if twelve men leavened the whole world, imagine how great our baseness, in
that when we being so many are not able to amend them that remain; we, who ought to be
enough for ten thousand worlds, and to become leaven to them. “But they,” one may say,
“were apostles.” And what then? Were they not partakers with thee? Were they not brought
up in cities? Did they not enjoy the same benefits? Did they not practise trades? What, were
they angels? What, came they down from Heaven?</p>
<p>“But they had signs,” it will be said. It was not the signs that made them admirable. How
long shall we use those miracles as cloaks for our own remissness? Behold the choir of the
Saints, that they shone not by those miracles.1830 Why, many who had actually cast out
devils, because they wrought iniquity, instead of being admired, did even incur punishment.</p>
<p>And what can it be then, he will say, that showed them great? Their contempt of wealth,
their despising glory, their freedom from worldly things. Since surely, had they wanted these
qualities, and been slaves of their passions, though they had raised ten thousand dead, so
far from doing any good, they would even have been accounted deceivers. Thus it is their
life, so bright on all sides, which also draws down the grace of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What manner of miracle did John work, that he fixed on himself the attention1831of so
many cities? For as to the fact that he did no wondrous works, hear the evangelist, saying,
“John did no miracle.”1832 And whence did Elias become admirable? Was it not from his
boldness towards the king? from his zeal towards God? from his voluntary poverty? from
his garment of sheep’s skin, and his cave, and his mountains? For his miracles he did after
all these. And as to Job, what manner of miracle did he work in sight of the devil, that he
was amazed at him? No miracle indeed, but a life that shone and displayed an endurance

firmer than any adamant. What manner of miracle did David, yet being young, that God
should say, “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart?”1833 And
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, what dead body did they raise? what leper did they cleanse?
Knowest thou not that the miracles, except we be sober, do even harm in many cases? Thus
many of the Corinthians were severed one from another; thus many of the Romans were
carried away with pride; thus was Simon cast out. Thus he, who at a certain time had a desire
to follow Christ, was rejected, when he had been told, “The foxes have holes, and the birds
of the air nests.”1834 For each of these, one aiming at the wealth, another at the glory, which
the miracles bring, fell away and perished. But care of practice, and love of virtue, so far
from generating such a desire, doth even take it away when it exists.</p>
<p>And Himself too, when He was making laws for His own disciples, what said He? “Do
miracles, that men may see you”? By no means. But what? “Let your light shine before men,
that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.”1835 And
to Peter again He said not, “If thou lovest me,” “do miracles,” but “feed my sheep.”1836 And
whereas He everywhere distinguishes him with James and John above all the rest, for what,
I pray thee, did He distinguish them? For their miracles? Nay, all alike cleansed the lepers,
and raised the dead; and to all alike He gave that authority.</p>
<p>Whence then had these the advantage? From the virtue in their soul. Seest thou how
everywhere practice is required, and the proof by works? “For by their fruits,” saith He, “ye
shall know them.”1837 And what commends our own life? Is it indeed a display of miracles,
or the perfection of an excellent conversation? Very evidently it is the second; but as to the
miracles, they both have their origin from hence, and terminate herein. For both he that
shows forth an excellent life, draws to himself this gift, and he that receives the gift, receives
it for this end, that he may amend other men’s lives. Since even Christ for this end wrought
those miracles, that having made Himself thereby credible, and drawn men unto Him, He
might bring virtue into our life. Wherefore also He lays more stress of the two on this. For
He is not at all satisfied with the signs only, but He also threatens hell, and promises a
kingdom, and lays down those startling laws, and all things He orders to this end, that He
may make us equal to the angels.</p>
<p>And why say I, that Christ doth all for this object? Why, even thou, should one give thee
thy choice, to raise dead men by His name, or to die for His name; which I pray thee, of the
two wouldest thou rather accept? Is it not quite plain, the latter? and yet the one is a miracle,

the other but a work. And what, if one offered thee to make grass gold, or to be able to despise
all wealth as grass, wouldest thou not rather accept this latter? and very reasonably. For
mankind would be attracted by this more than any way. For if they saw the grass changed
into gold, they would covet themselves also to acquire that power, as Simon did, and the
love of money would be increased in them; but if they saw us all contemning and neglecting
gold, as though it were grass, they would long ago have been delivered from this disease.</p>
<p>4. Seest thou that our practice has more power to do good? By practice I mean, not thy
fasting, nor yet thy strewing sackcloth and ashes under thee, but if thou despise wealth, as
it ought to be despised; if thou be kindly affectioned, if thou give thy bread to the hungry,
if thou control anger, if thou cast out vainglory, if thou put away envy. So He Himself used
to teach: for, “Learn of me,” saith He, “for I am meek and lowly in heart.”1838 He did not
say, “for I fasted,” although surely He might have spoken of the forty days, yet He saith not
this; but, “I am meek and lowly in heart.” And again, when sending them out, He said not,
“Fast,” but, “Eat of all that is set before you.”1839 With regard to wealth, however, He required
of them great strictness, saying, “Provide not gold, or silver, or brass, in your purses.”1840</p>
<p>And all this I say, not to depreciate fasting, God forbid, but rather highly to commend
it. But I grieve when other duties being neglected, ye think it enough for salvation, having
but the last place in the choir of virtue. For the greatest thing is charity, and moderation,
and almsgiving; which hits a higher mark even than virginity.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if thou desire to become equal to the apostles, there is nothing to hinder
thee. For to have arrived at this virtue only suffices for thy not at all falling short of them.
Let no one therefore wait for miracles.1841 For though the evil spirit is grieved, when he is
driven out of a body, yet much more so, when he sees a soul delivered from sin. For indeed
this is his great power.1842 This power caused Christ to die, that He might put an end to it.
Yea, for this brought in death; by reason of this all things have been turned upside down.
If then thou remove this, thou hast cut out the nerves of the devil, thou hast “bruised his
head,” thou hast put an end to all his might, thou hast scattered his host, thou hast exhibited
a sign greater than all signs.</p>
<p>The saying is not mine, but the blessed Paul’s. For when he had said, “Covet earnestly
the best gifts, and yet show I unto you a more excellent way;”1843\he did not speak next of
a sign, but of charity, the root of all our good things. If then we practise this, and all the self-

denial that flows from it, we shall have no need of signs; even as on the other hand, if we do
not practise it, we shall gain nothing by the signs.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind then all this, let us imitate those things whereby the apostles became
great. And whereby did they become great? Hear Peter, saying, “Behold we have forsaken
all, and followed Thee; what shall we have therefore?”1844 Hear also Christ saying to them,
“Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones,” and, “every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren,
or father, or mother, shall receive an hundredfold in this world, and shall inherit everlasting
life.”1845 From all worldly things, therefore, let us withdraw ourselves, and dedicate ourselves
to Christ, that we may both be made equal to the apostles according to His declaration, and
may enjoy eternal life; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“All these things spake Jesus unto the multitudes in parables, and without a parable spake He
not1846unto them; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I
will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret1847from the
foundation of the world.”1848</p>
<p>But Mark saith, “As they were able to hear it, He spake the word unto them in parables.”
1849</p>
<p>Then pointing out that He is not making a new thing, He brings in the Prophet also,
proclaiming beforehand this His manner of teaching. And to teach us the purpose of Christ,
how He discoursed in this manner, not that they might be ignorant, but that He might lead
them to inquiry, he added, “And without a parable spake He nothing unto them.” Yet surely
He did say many things without a parable; but then nothing. And for all this no man asked
Him questions, whereas the Prophets, we know, they were often questioning: as
Ezekiel,1850for instance; as many others: but these did no such thing. Yet surely His sayings
were enough to cast them into perplexity, and to stir them up to the inquiry; for indeed a
very sore punishment was threatened by those parables: however, not even so were they
moved.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He left them and went away. For,</p>
<p>“Then,” saith he, “Jesus sent the multitudes away,1851and went into His house.”1852
And not one of the Scribes follows Him; whence it is clear that for no other purpose
did they follow, than to take hold of Him.1853 But when they marked not His sayings,

<p>“And His disciples come unto Him, asking Him concerning the parable of the
tares;”1854although at times wishing to learn, and afraid1855to ask. Whence then arose their
confidence in this instance? They had been told, “To you it is given to know the mysteries
of the kingdom of Heaven;” and they were emboldened. Wherefore also they ask in private;
not as grudging the multitude, but observing their Master’s law. For, “To these,” saith He,
“it is not given.”</p>
<p>And why may it be that they let pass the parable of the leaven, and of the mustard seed,
and inquire concerning this? They let those pass, as being plainer; but about this, as having
an affinity to that before spoken, and as setting forth something more than it, they are desirous
to learn (since He would not have spoken the same to them a second time); for indeed
they saw how severe was the threatening therein uttered.1856 Wherefore neither doth He
blame them, but rather completes His previous statements.</p>
<p>And, as I am always saying, the parables must not be explained throughout word for
word, since many absurdities will follow; this even He Himself is teaching us here in thus
interpreting this parable. Thus He saith not at all who the servants are that came to Him,
but, implying that He brought them in, for the sake of some order, and to make up the picture,
He omits that part, and interprets those that are most urgent and essential, and for the
sake of which the parable was spoken; signifying Himself to be Judge and Lord of all.</p>
<p>“And He answered,” so it is said, “and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
the Son of Man; the field is the world, the good seed, these are the children of the kingdom,
but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that soweth them is the devil;
and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels. As therefore the tares are
gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of Man shall
send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them
which do iniquity;1857 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire, there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of

<p>For whereas He Himself is the sower, and that of His own field, and out of His own
kingdom He gathers, it is quite clear that the present world also is His.</p>
<p>But mark His unspeakable love to man, and His leaning to bounty, and His disinclination
to punishment; in that, when He sows, He sows in His own person, but when He punishes,
it is by others, that is, by the angels.</p>
<p>“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” Not
because it will be just so much only, but because this star is surpassed in brightness by none
that we know. He uses the comparisons that are known to us.</p>
<p>And yet surely elsewhere He saith, the harvest is already come; as when He saith of the
Samaritans, “Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.”
1859 And again, “The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.”1860 How
then saith He there, that the harvest is already come, while here He said, it is yet to be? According
to another signification.</p>
<p>And how having elsewhere said, “One soweth, and another reapeth,”1861doth He here
say, it is Himself that soweth? Because there again, He was speaking, to distinguish the
apostles, not from Himself, but from the prophets, and that in the case of the Jews and
Samaritans. Since certainly it was He who sowed through the prophets also.</p>
<p>And at times He calls this self-same thing both harvest and sowing, naming it with relation,
now to one thing, now to another. Thus when He is speaking of the conviction and
obedience of His converts,1862 He calls the thing “a harvest,” as though He had accomplished
all; but when He is seeking after the fruit of their hearing, He calls it seed, and the end,
harvest.</p>
<p>And how saith He elsewhere, that “the righteous are caught up first?”1863 Because they
are indeed caught up first, but Christ being come, those others are given over to punishment,
and then the former depart into the kingdom of heaven. For because they must be in heaven,
but He Himself is to come and judge all men here; having passed sentence upon these, like
some king He rises with His friends, leading them to that blessed portion. Seest thou that
the punishment is twofold, first to be burnt up, and then to fall from that glory?</p>
<p>2. But wherefore doth He still go on, when the others have withdrawn, to speak to these
also in parables? They had become wiser by His sayings, so as even to understand. At any
rate, to them He saith afterwards,</p>
<note type="footnote">1859 John iv. 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">1860 Matt. ix. 37; Luke x. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1861 John iv. 37.</note>

<pb n="521"/>
<p>“Have ye understood all these things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.”1864 So completely,
together with its other objects, did the parable effect this too, that it made them more clear
sighted. What then saith He again?</p>
<p>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath
found, he hideth, and for joy thereof selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again,
the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who, when he
had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.”1865</p>
<p>Much as in the other place, the mustard seed and the leaven have but some little difference
from each other, so here also these two parables, that of the treasure and that of the
pearl. This being of course signified by both, that we ought to value the gospel above all
things. And the former indeed, of the leaven and of the mustard seed, was spoken with a
view to the power of the gospel, and to its surely prevailing over the world; but these declare
its value, and great price. For as it extends itself like mustard seed, and prevails like leaven,
so it is precious like a pearl, and affords full abundance like a treasure. We are then to learn
not this only, that we ought to strip ourselves of everything else, and cling to the gospel, but
also that we are to do so with joy; and when a man is dispossessing himself of his goods, he
is to know that the transaction is gain, and not loss.</p>
<p>Seest thou how both the gospel is hid in the world, and the good things in the gospel?</p>
<p>Except thou sell all, thou buyest not; except thou have such a soul, anxious and inquiring,
thou findest not. Two things therefore are requisite, abstinence from worldly matters, and
watchfulness. For He saith “One seeking goodly pearls, who when he had found one of great
price, sold all and bought it.” For the truth is one, and not in many divisions.</p>
<p>And much as he that hath the pearl knows indeed himself that he is rich, but others
know not, many times, that he is holding it in his hand (for there is no corporeal bulk); just
so also with the gospel, they that have hold of it know that they are rich, but the unbelievers,
not knowing of this treasure, are in ignorance also of our wealth.</p>
<p>3. After this, that we may not be confident in the gospel merely preached, nor think that
faith only suffices us for salvation, He utters also another, an awful parable. Which then is
this? That of the net.</p>
<p>“For the kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered
of every kind; which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the
good into vessels, but cast the bad away.”1866</p>

<pb n="522"/>
<p>And wherein doth this differ from the parable of the tares? For there too the one are
saved, the other perish; but there, for choosing of wicked doctrines; and those before this
again, for not giving heed to His sayings, but these for wickedness of life; who are the most
wretched of all, having attained to His knowledge, and being caught, but not even so capable
of being saved.</p>
<p>Yet surely He saith elsewhere, that the shepherd Himself separates them, but here He
saith the angels do this;1867and so with respect to the tares. How then is it? At one time He
discourses to them in a way more suited to their dullness,1868at another time in a higher
strain.</p>
<p>And this parable He interprets without so much as being asked, but of His own motion
He explained it by one part of it, and increased their awe. For lest, on being told, “They cast
the bad away,” thou shouldest suppose that ruin to be without danger; by His interpretation
He signified the punishment, saying, “They will cast them into the furnace.”1869 And He
declared the gnashing of teeth, and the anguish, that it is unspeakable.</p>
<p>Seest thou how many are the ways of destruction? By the rock, by the thorns, by the
wayside, by the tares, by the net. Not without reason therefore did He say, “Broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go away1870by it.”1871</p>
<p>4. Having then uttered all this, and concluded His discourse in a tone to cause fear, and
signified that these are the majority of cases (for He dwelt more on them). He saith,</p>
<p>“Have ye understood all these things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.”1872</p>
<p>Then because they understood, He again praises them, saying,</p>
<p>“Therefore every Scribe, which is instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven,1873is like unto
a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old.”1874</p>
<p>Wherefore elsewhere also He saith, “I will send you wise men and scribes.”1875 Seest
thou how so far from excluding the Old Testament, He even commends it, and speaks
publicly in favor of it, calling it “a treasure”?</p>

<p>So that as many as are ignorant of the divine Scriptures cannot be “householders;” such
as neither have of themselves, nor receive of others, but neglect their own case, perishing
with famine. And not these only, but the heretics too,1876are excluded from this blessing.
For they bring not forth things new and old. For they have not the old things, wherefore
neither have they the new; even as they who have not the new, neither have they the old,
but are deprived of both. For these are bound up and interwoven one with another.</p>
<p>Let us then hear, as many of us as neglect the reading of the Scriptures, to what harm
we are subjecting ourselves, to what poverty. For when are we to apply ourselves to the real
practice of virtue, who do not so much as know the very laws according to which our practice
should be guided? But while the rich, those who are mad about wealth, are constantly
shaking out their garments, that they may not become moth-eaten; dost thou, seeing forgetfulness
worse than any moth wasting thy soul, neglect conversing with books? dost thou
not thrust away from thee the pest, adorn thy soul, look continually upon the image of virtue,
and acquaint thyself with her members and her head? For she too hath a head and members
more seemly than any graceful and beautiful body.</p>
<p>What then, saith one, is the head of virtue? Humility. Wherefore Christ also begins with
it, saying, “Blessed are the poor.”1877 This head hath not locks and ringlets, but beauty, such
as to gain God’s favor. For, “Unto whom shall I look,” saith He, “but unto him that is meek
and humble, and trembleth at my words?”1878 And, “Mine eyes are upon the meek of the
earth.”1879And, “The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart.”1880 This head,
instead of locks, and flowing hair, bears sacrifices acceptable to God. It is a golden altar,
and a spiritual place of sacrifice;1881“For a contrite spirit is a sacrifice to God.”1882 This is
the mother of wisdom. If a man have this, he will have the rest also.</p>
<p>Hast thou seen a head such as thou hadst never seen? Wilt thou see the face too, or
rather mark it? Mark then for the present its color, how ruddy, and blooming, and very
engaging; and observe what are its ingredients. “Well, and what are they?” Shame-facedness

and blushing. Wherefore also some one saith, “Before a shamefaced man shall go favor.”1883
This sheds much beauty over the other members also. Though thou mix ten thousand colors,
thou wilt not produce such a bloom.</p>
<p>And if thou wilt see the eyes also, behold them exactly delineated with decency and
temperance. Wherefore they become also so beautiful and sharpsighted, as to behold even
the Lord Himself. For, “Blessed,” saith He, “are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”1884</p>
<p>And her mouth is wisdom and understanding, and the knowledge of spiritual hymns.
And her heart, acquaintance with Scripture, and maintenance of sound doctrines, and benevolence,
and kindness. And as without this last there is no living, so without that other
is never any salvation. Yea, for from that all her excellencies have birth. She hath also for
feet and hands the manifestations of her good works. She hath a soul too, godliness. She
hath likewise a bosom of gold, and firmer than adamant, even fortitude; and all may be
taken captive more easily than that bosom may be riven asunder. And the spirit that is in
the brain and heart, is charity.1885</p>
<p>5. Wilt thou that in her actual deeds also I show thee her image? Consider, I pray thee,
this very evangelist: although we have not his whole life in writing, nevertheless even from
a few facts one may see his image shine forth.</p>
<p>First, as to his having been lowly and contrite, hear him, after his gospel, calling himself
a publican; for his being also merciful, see him stripping himself of all and following Jesus;
and as to his piety, it is evident from his doctrines. And his wisdom again it is easy to see
from the gospel which he composed, and his charity1886(for he cared for the whole world);
and the manifestation of his good works, from the throne on which he is to sit;1887and his
courage too, “by his departing with joy from the presence of the council.”1888</p>
<p>Let us imitate then this virtue, and most of all his humility and almsgiving, without
which one cannot be saved. And this is shown by the five virgins, and together with them
by the Pharisee. For without virginity indeed it is possible to see the kingdom, but without
almsgiving it cannot be. For this is among the things that are essential, and hold all together.
Not unnaturally then have we called it the heart of virtue. But this heart, unless it supply
breath to all, is soon extinguished. In the same way then as the fountain also, if it confine
its streams to itself, grows putrid; so it is with the rich also, when they keep their possessions
to themselves. Wherefore even in our common conversation we say, “great is the consump-

tion1889of wealth with such a man;” instead of saying, “great is the abundance, great the
treasure.” For in truth there is a consumption, not of the possessors only, but of the riches
themselves. Since both garments laid by spoil, and gold is cankered, and corn is eaten up,
and the soul too of their owner is more than they all cankered and corrupted by the cares
of them.</p>
<p>And if thou be willing to produce in the midst a miser’s soul; like a garment eaten by
innumerable worms, and not having any sound part, even so wilt thou find it, perforated
on all sides by cares; rotted, cankered by sins.</p>
<p>But not such the poor man’s soul, the soul of him, I mean, that is voluntarily poor; but
it is resplendent as gold, it shines like a pearl, and it blooms like a rose. For no moth is there,
no thief is there, no worldly care, but as angels converse, so do they.</p>
<p>Wouldest thou see the beauty of this soul? Wouldest thou acquaint thyself with the
riches of poverty? He commands not men, but he commands evil spirits. He stands not at
a king’s side, but he hath taken his stand near to God. He is the comrade, not of men, but
of angels. He hath not chests, two, or three, or twenty, but such an abundance as to account
the whole world as nothing. He hath not a treasure, but heaven. He needs not slaves, or
rather hath his passions for slaves, hath for slaves the motives1890that rule over kings. For
that which commands him who wears the purple, that motive shrinks before him.1891 And
royalty, and gold, and all such things, he laughs at, as at children’s toys; and like hoops, and
dice, and heads, and balls, so doth he count all these to be contemptible. For he hath an
adorning, which they who play with these things cannot even see.</p>
<p>What then can be superior to this poor man? He hath at least heaven for his pavement;
but if the pavement be like this, imagine the roof! But hath he not horses and chariots? Why,
what need hath he of these, who is to be borne upon the clouds, and to be with Christ?</p>
<p>Having these things then impressed on our minds, let us, both men and women, seek
after that wealth, and the plenty that cannot be rifled; that we may attain also unto the
kingdom of heaven, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XIII. 53.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, that, when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence.”</p>
<p>Wherefore said He, “these”? Because He was to speak others besides. And wherefore,
again, doth He depart? Desiring to sow the word everywhere.</p>
<p>“And when He was come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue.”1892
And what doth he now call His country? As it seems to me, Nazareth. “For He did not
many mighty works there,”1893it is said, but in Capernaum He did miracles: wherefore He
said also, “And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto Heaven, shalt be brought down
to hell; for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it
would have remained until this day.”1894</p>
<p>But having come there, while He slackens somewhat in His miracles; so as not to inflame
them unto more envy, nor to condemn them more grievously, by the aggravation of their
unbelief: He yet puts forth a doctrine, having no less of wonder in it than the miracles. For
these utterly senseless men, when they ought to have marvelled, and to have been amazed
at the power of His words, they on the contrary hold Him cheap, because of him who seemed
to be His father; yet we know they had many examples of these things in the former times,
and from fathers of no note had seen illustrious children. For so David was the son of a
certain mean husbandman, Jesse; and Amos, the child of a goatherd, and himself a goatherd;
1895and Moses too, the lawgiver, had a father very inferior to himself. When they
therefore, for this especially, ought to adore and be amazed, that being of such parents He
spake such things, it being quite manifest, that so it was not of man’s care, but of God’s
grace: yet they, what things they should admire Him for, for those they despise Him.</p>
<p>He is moreover continually frequenting the synagogues, lest if He were always abiding
in the wilderness, they should the more accuse Him as making a schism, and fighting against
their polity. Being amazed therefore, and in perplexity, they said, “Whence hath this man
this wisdom, and these powers?”1896either calling the miracles powers, or even the wisdom
itself. “Is not this the carpenter’s son?”1897 The greater then the marvel, and the more
abundant the ground of amaze. “Is not His mother called Mary, and His brethren James,

and Joses,1898and Simon, and Judas? and His sisters, are they not all with us? Whence hath
this man these things? And they were offended in Him.”1899</p>
<p>Seest thou that Nazareth was where He was discoursing? “Are not his brethren,” it is
said, “such a one, and such a one?” And what of this? Why, by this especially you ought to
have been led on to faith. But envy you see is a poor base thing, and often falls foul of itself.
For what things were strange and marvellous, and enough to have gained them over, these
offended them.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ unto them? “A prophet,” saith He, “is not without honor, save
in his own country, and in his own house: and He did not,” it is said, “many mighty works,
because of their unbelief.”1900 But Luke saith, “And He did not there many miracles.”1901
And yet it was to be expected He should have done them. For if the feeling of wonder towards
Him was gaining ground (for indeed even there He was marvelled at), wherefore did He
not do them? Because He looked not to the display of Himself, but to their profit. Therefore
when this succeeded not, He overlooked what concerned Himself, in order not to aggravate
their punishment.</p>
<p>And yet see after how long a time He came to them, and after how great a display of
miracles: but not even so did they endure it, but were inflamed again with envy.</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He yet do a few miracles? That they might not say, “Physician, heal
thyself.”1902 That they might not say, “He is a foe and an enemy to us, and overlooks His
own;” that they might not say, “If miracles had been wrought, we also should have believed.”
Therefore He both wrought them, and stayed: the one, that He might fulfill His own part;
the other, that He might not condemn them the more.</p>
<p>And consider thou the power of His words, herein at least, that possessed as they were
by envy, they did yet admire. And as with regard to His works, they do not find fault with
what is done, but feign causes which have no existence, slaying, “In Beelzebub He casteth
out the devils;” even so here too, they find no fault with the teaching, but take refuge in the
meanness of His race.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, the Master’s gentleness, how He reviles them not, but with
great mildness saith, “A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country.” And neither
here did He stop, but added, “And in his own house.” To me it appears, that with covert
reference to His very own brethren, He made this addition.</p>

<p>But in Luke He puts examples also of this, saying, that neither did Elias come unto His
own, but to the stranger widow; neither by Eliseus was any other leper healed, but the
stranger Naaman;1903and Israelites neither received benefit, nor conferred benefit, but the
foreigners. And these things He saith, signifying in every instance their evil disposition, and
that in His case nothing new is taking place.</p>
<p>2. “At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus.”1904 For Herod the king,
this man’s father, he that slew the children, was dead.</p>
<p>But not without a purpose doth the evangelist signify the time, but to make thee observe
also the haughtiness of the tyrant, and his thoughtlessness, in that not at the beginning did
he inform himself about Christ, but after a very long time.1905 For such are they that are in
places of power, and are encompassed with much pomp, they learn these things late, because
they do not make much account of them.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how great a thing virtue is, that he was afraid of him even
when dead, and out of his fear he speaks wisely even concerning a resurrection.</p>
<p>“For he said,” it is mentioned, “unto his servants, This is John, whom I slew, he is risen
from the dead, and therefore the mighty powers do work in him.”1906 Seest thou the intensity
of his fear? for neither then did he dare to publish it abroad, but he still speaks but to his
own servants.</p>
<p>But yet even this opinion savored of the soldier, and was absurd. For many besides had
risen from the dead, and no one had wrought anything of the kind. And his words seem to
me to be the language both of vanity, and of fear. For such is the nature of unreasonable
souls, they admit often a mixture of opposite passions.</p>
<p>But Luke affirms that the multitudes said, “This is Elias, or Jeremias, or one of the old
prophets,”1907but he, as uttering forsooth something wiser than the rest, made this assertion.</p>
<p>But it is probable that before this, in answer to them that said He was John (for many
had said this too), he had denied it, and said, “I slew him,” priding himself and glorying in
it. For this both Mark and Luke report that he said, “John I beheaded.”1908 But when the
rumor prevailed, then he too saith the same as the people.</p>

<p>Then the evangelist relates to us also the history. And what might his reason be for not
introducing it as a subject by itself?1909 Because all their labor entirely was to tell what related
to Christ, and they made themselves no secondary work besides this, except it were again
to contribute to the same end. Therefore neither now would they have mentioned the history
were it not on Christ’s account, and because Herod said, “John is risen again.”</p>
<p>But Mark saith, that Herod exceedingly honored the man, and this, when reproved.1910
So great a thing is virtue.</p>
<p>Then his narrative proceeds thus: “For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him,
and put him in prison, for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife. For John said unto him,
It is not lawful for thee to have her. And when he would have put him to death, he feared
the people, because they counted him as a prophet.”1911</p>
<p>And wherefore doth he not address his discourse at all to her, but to the man? Because
it depended more on him.
But see how inoffensive he makes his accusation, as relating a history rather than
bringing a charge.</p>
<p>4. “But when Herod’s birth-day was kept,”1912saith he, “the daughter of Herodias danced
before them,1913and pleased Herod.”1914 O diabolical revel! O satanic spectacle! O lawless
dancing! and more lawless reward for the dancing. For a murder more impious than all
murders was perpetrated, and he that was worthy to be crowned and publicly honored, was
slain in the midst, and the trophy of the devils was set on the table.</p>
<p>And the means too of the victory were worthy of the deeds done. For,</p>
<p>“The daughter of Herodias,” it is said, “danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Whereupon he swore1915with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. And she being
before instructed of1916her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.”1917</p>
<p>Her reproach is twofold; first, that she danced, then that she pleased him, and so pleased
him, as to obtain even murder for her reward.</p>

<p>Seest thou how savage he was? how senseless? how foolish? in putting himself under
the obligation of an oath, while to her he gives full power over her request. But when he saw
the evil actually ensuing, “he was sorry,”1918it is said; and yet in the first instance he had
put him in bonds. Wherefore then is he sorry? Such is the nature of virtue, even amongst
the wicked admiration and praises are its due. But alas for her madness! When she too ought
to admire, yea, to bow down to him, for trying to redress her wrong, she on the contrary
even helps to arrange the plot, and lays a snare, and asks a diabolical favor.</p>
<p>But he was afraid “for the oath’s sake,” it is said, “and them that sat at meat with him.”
And how didst thou not fear that which is more grievous? Surely if thou wast afraid to have
witnesses of thy perjury, much more oughtest thou to fear having so many witnesses of a
murder so lawless.</p>
<p>But as I think many are ignorant of the grievance itself, whence the murder had its origin,
I must declare this too, that ye may learn the wisdom of the lawgiver. What then was the
ancient law, which Herod indeed trampled on, but John vindicated? The wife of him that
died childless was to be given to his brother.1919 For since death was an incurable ill, and
all was contrived for life’s sake; He makes a law that the living brother should marry her,
and should call the child that is born by the name of the dead, so that his house should not
utterly perish. For if the dead were not so much as to leave children, which is the greatest
mitigation of death, the sorrow would be without remedy. Therefore you see, the lawgiver
devised this refreshment for those who were by nature deprived of children, and commanded
the issue to be reckoned as belonging to the other.</p>
<p>But when there was a child, this marriage was no longer permitted. “And wherefore?”
one may say, “for if it was lawful for another, much more for the brother.” By no means.
For He will have men’s consanguinity extended, and the sources multiplied of our interest
in each other.</p>
<p>Why then, in the case also of death without offspring, did not another marry her? Because
it would not so be accounted the child of the departed; but now his brother begetting it, the
fiction became probable. And besides, any other man had no constraining call to build up
the house of the dead, but this had incurred the claim by relationship.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as Herod had married his brother’s wife, when she had a child, therefore
John blames him, and blames him with moderation, showing together with his boldness,
his consideration also.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how the whole theatre was devilish. For first, it was made
up of drunkenness and luxury, whence nothing healthful could come. Secondly, the spectators
in it were depraved, and he that gave the banquet the worst transgressor of all. Thirdly, there
<note type="footnote">1918 Matt. xiii. 9. [R.V., “was grieved.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">1919 Deut. xxv. 5.</note>

<pb n="531"/>
was the irrational pleasure. Fourthly, the damsel, because of whom the marriage was illegal,
who ought even to have hid herself, as though her mother were dishonored by her, comes
making a show, and throwing into the shade all harlots, virgin as she was.</p>
<p>And the time again contributes no little to the reproof of this enormity. For when he
ought to be thanking God, that on that day He had brought him to light, then he ventures
upon those lawless acts. When one in chains ought to have been freed by him, then he adds
slaughter to bonds.</p>
<p>Hearken, ye virgins, or rather ye wives also, as many as consent to such unseemliness
at other person’s weddings, leaping, and bounding, and disgracing our common nature.
Hearken, ye men too, as many as follow after those banquets, full of expense and drunkenness,
and fear ye the gulf of the evil one. For indeed so mightily did he seize upon that wretched
person just then, that he sware even to give the half of his kingdom: this being Mark’s
statement, “He sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the
half of my kingdom.”1920</p>
<p>Such was the value he set upon his royal power; so was he once for all made captive by
his passion, as to give up his kingdom for a dance.1921vilifying, reviling, insulting. But not
so the saints; they on the contrary mourn for such as sin, rather than curse them.</p>
<p>8. This then let us also do, and let us weep for Herodias, and for them that imitate her.
For many such revels now also take place, and though John be not slain, yet the members
of Christ are, and in a far more grievous way. For it is not a head in a charger that the dancers
of our time ask, but the souls of them that sit at the feast. For in making them slaves, and
leading them to unlawful loves, and besetting them with harlots, they do not take off the
head, but slay the soul, making them adulterers, and effeminate, and whoremongers.</p>
<p>For thou wilt not surely tell me, that when full of wine, and drunken, and looking at a
woman who is dancing and uttering base words, thou dost not feel anything towards her,
neither art hurried on to profligacy, overcome by thy lust. Nay, that awful thing befalls thee,
that thou “makest the members of Christ members of an harlot.”1922</p>
<p>For though the daughter of Herodias be not present, yet the devil, who then danced in
her person, in theirs also holds his choirs now, and departs with the souls of those guests
taken captive.</p>
<p>But if ye are able to keep clear of drunkenness, yet are ye partakers of another most
grievous sin; such revels being also full of much rapine. For look not, I pray thee, on the
meats that are set before them, nor on the cakes; but consider whence they are gathered,
and thou wilt see that it is of vexation, and covetousness, and violence, and rapine.</p>

<p>“Nay, ours are not from such sources,” one may say. God forbid they should be: for
neither do I desire it. Nevertheless, although they be clear of these, not even so are our costly
feasts freed from blame. Hear, at all events, how even apart from these things the prophet
finds fault with them, thus speaking, “Woe to them that drink wine racked off, and anoint
themselves with the chief ointments.”1923 Seest thou how He censures luxury too? For it is
not covetousness which He here lays to their charge, but prodigality only.</p>
<p>And thou eatest to excess, Christ not even for need; thou various cakes, He not so much
as dry bread; thou drinkest Thasian wine, but on Him thou hast not bestowed so much as
a cup of cold water in His thirst. Thou art on a soft and embroidered bed, but He is perishing
with the cold.</p>
<p>Wherefore, though the banquets be clear from covetousness, yet even so are they accursed,
because, while for thy part thou doest all in excess, to Him thou givest not even His
need; and that, living in luxury upon things that belong to Him. Why, if thou wert guardian
to a child, and having taken possession of his goods, were to neglect him in extremities,
thou wouldest have ten thousand accusers, and wouldest suffer the punishment appointed
by the laws; and now having taken possession of the goods of Christ, and thus consuming
them for no purpose, dost thou not think thou wilt have to give account?</p>
<p>9. And these things I say not of those who introduce harlots to their tables (for to them
I have nothing to say, even as neither have I to the dogs), nor of those who cheat some, and
pamper others (for neither with them have I anything to do, even as I have not with the
swine and with the wolves); but of those who enjoy indeed their own property, but do not
impart thereof to others; of those who spend their patrimony at random. For neither are
these clear from reprehension. For how, tell me, wilt thou escape reprov ing and blame,
while thy parasite is pampered, and the dog that stands by thee, but Christ’s worth appears
to thee even not equal to theirs? when the one receives so much for laughter’s sake, but the
other for the Kingdom of Heaven not so much as the smallest fraction thereof. And while
the parasite, on saying something witty, goes away filled; this Man, who hath taught us, what
if we had not learnt we should have been no better than the dogs,—is He counted unworthy
of even the same treatment with such an one?</p>
<p>Dost thou shudder at being told it? Shudder then at the realities. Cast out the parasites,
and make Christ to sit down to meat with thee. If He partake of thy salt, and of thy table,
He will be mild in judging thee: He knows how to respect a man’s table.1924 Yea, if robbers
know this, much more the Lord. Think, for instance, of that harlot, how at a table He justified
her, and upbraids Simon, saying, “Thou gavest me no kiss.”1925 I say, if He feed thee, not
<note type="footnote">1923 Amos vi. 6, LXX. [τν διυλισμνον ονον.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1924 That is, to respect the obligation incurred by having been a person’s guest.</note>
<note type="footnote">1925 Luke vii. 54.</note>

<pb n="533"/>
doing these things, much more will He reward thee, doing them. Look not at the poor man,
that he comes to thee filthy and squalid, but consider that Christ by him is setting foot in
thine house, and cease from thy fierceness, and thy relentless words, with which thou art
even aspersing such as come to thee, calling them impostors, idle, and other names more
grievous than these.</p>
<p>And think, when thou art talking so, of the parasites; what kind of works do they accomplish?
in what respect do they profit thine house? Do they really make thy dinner pleasant
to thee? pleasant, by their being beaten and saying foul words? Nay, what can be more unpleasing
than this, when thou smitest him that is made after God’s likeness, and from thine
insolence to him gatherest enjoyment for thyself, making thine house a theatre, and filling
thy banquet with stage-players, thou who art well born and free imitating the actors with
their heads shaven?1926 For among them too is laughter, and rude blows.</p>
<p>These things then dost thou call pleasure, I pray thee, which are deserving of many tears,
of much mourning and lamentation? And when it were fit to urge them to a good life, to
give timely advice, dost thou lead them on to perjuries, and disorderly language, and call
the thing a delight? and that which procures hell, dost thou account a subject of pleasure?
Yea, and when they are at a loss for witty sayings, they pay the whole reckoning with oaths
and false swearing. Are these things then worthy of laughter, and not of lamentations and
tears? Nay, who would say so, that hath understanding?</p>
<p>And this I say, not forbidding them to be fed, but not for such a purpose. Nay, let their
maintenance have the motive of kindness, not of cruelty; let it be compassion, not insolence.
Because he is a poor man, feed him; because Christ is fed, feed him; not for introducing
satanical sayings, and disgracing his own life. Look not at him outwardly laughing, but examine
his conscience, and then thou wilt see him uttering ten thousand imprecations against
himself, and groaning, and wailing. And if he do not show it, this also is due to thee.</p>
<p>10. Let the companions of thy meals then be men that are poor and free, not perjured
persons, nor stage-players. And if thou must needs ask of them a requital for their food,
enjoin them, should they see anything done that is amiss, to rebuke, to admonish, to help
thee in thy care over thine household, in the government of thy servants. Hast thou children?
Let these be joint fathers to them, let them divide thy charge with thee, let them yield thee
such profits as God loveth. Engage them in a spiritual traffic. And if thou see one needing
protection, bid them succor, command them to minister. By these do thou track the strangers
out, by these clothe the naked, by these send to the prison, put an end to the distresses of
others.</p>

<pb n="534"/>
<p>Let them give thee, for their food, this requital, which profits both thee and them, and
carries with it no condemnation.</p>
<p>Hereby friendship also is more closely riveted. For now, though they seem to be loved,
yet for all that they are ashamed, as living without object in thy house; but if they accomplish
these purposes, both they will be more pleasantly situated, and thou wilt have more satisfaction
in maintaining them, as not spending thy money without fruit; and they again will
dwell with thee in boldness and due freedom, and thy house, instead of a theatre, will become
to thee a church, and the devil will be put to flight, and Christ will enter, and the choir of
the angels. For where Christ is, there are the angels too, and where Christ and the angels
are, there is Heaven, there is a light more cheerful than this of the sun.</p>
<p>And if thou wouldest reap yet another consolation through their means, command
them, when thou art at leisure, to take their books and read the divine law. They will have
more pleasure in so ministering to you, than in the other way. For these things add respect
both to thee and to them, but those bring disgrace upon all together; upon thee as an insolent
person and a drunkard, upon them as wretched and gluttonous. For if thou feed in order
to insult them, it is worse than if thou hadst put them to death; but if for their good and
profit, it is more useful again than if thou hadst brought them back from their way to execution.
And now indeed thou dost disgrace them more than thy servants, and thy servants
enjoy more liberty of speech, and freedom of conscience, than they do; but then thou wilt
make them equal to the angels.</p>
<p>Set free therefore both them and thine own self, and take away the name of parasite,
and call them companions of thy meals;1927cast away the appellation of flatterers, and bestow
on them that of friends. With this intent indeed did God make our friendships, not for evil
to the beloved and loving, but for their good and profit.</p>
<p>But these friendships are more grievous than any enmity. For by our enemies, if we will,
we are even profited; but by these we must needs be harmed, no question of it. Keep not
then friends to teach thee harm; keep not friends who are enamored rather of thy table than
of thy friendship. For all such persons, if thou retrench thy good living, retrench their
friendship too; but they that associate with thee for virtue’s sake, remain continually, enduring
every change.</p>
<p>And besides, the race of the parasites doth often take revenge upon thee, and bring upon
thee an ill fame. Hence at least I know many respectable persons to have got bad characters,
and some have been evil reported of for sorceries, some for adulteries and corrupting of
youths. For whereas they have no work to do, but spend their own life unprofitably; their
ministry is suspected by the multitude as being the same with that of corrupt youths.</p>

<p>Therefore, delivering ourselves both from evil report, and above all from the hell that
is to come, and doing the things that are well-pleasing to God, let us put an end to this
devilish custom, that “both eating and drinking we may do all things to the glory of
God,”1928and enjoy the glory that cometh from Him; unto which may we all attain, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, now
and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XLIX.</head>
<p>Matt. XIV. 13.</p>
<p>“But when Jesus heard of it, He departed thence by ship into a desert place apart; and when
the multitudes had heard thereof, they followed Him on foot out of all the cities.”1929</p>
<p>See Him on every occasion “departing,”1930 For not by His appearance only, but by His
actions He would have this confirmed, because He knew the devil’s craft, and that he would
leave nothing undone to destroy this doctrine.</p>
<p>He then for this end retires; but the multitudes not even so withdraw themselves from
Him, but they follow, riveted to Him, and not even John’s tragical end alarmed them. So
great a thing is earnest desire, so great a thing is love; in such wise doth it overcome and
dispel all dangers.</p>
<p>Therefore they straightway also received their reward. For “Jesus,” it is said, “went forth,
and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed
their sick.”1931</p>
<p>For great as their assiduity was, yet nevertheless His doings exceeded what any diligence
could earn. Wherefore He sets forth also His motive for so healing them, His mercy, intense
mercy: and He healeth all.</p>
<p>And He requires not faith here. For both by coming to Him, and by leaving their cities,
and by diligently seeking Him, and by abiding with Him even when hunger was pressing,
they display their own faith.</p>
<p>But He is about to feed them also. And He doth not this of Himself, but waits to be entreated;
on every occasion, as I have said, maintaining this rule, not to spring onward to His
miracles, preventing them, but upon some call.1932</p>
<p>And why did none of the multitude come near and speak for them? They reverenced
Him exceedingly, and felt not even their hunger, through their longing to stay with Him.
Neither indeed do His disciples, when they were come to Him, say, “Feed them;” for as yet
they were rather in an imperfect state; but what?</p>
<p>“And when it was evening,” it is said, “His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a desert
place, and the time is now passed; send the multitude away, that they may go and buy
themselves victuals.”1933</p>

<p>For if even after the miracle they forgot what had been done, and after the baskets,
supposed Him to be speaking of loaves, when He gave the name of “leaven” to the doctrine
of the Pharisees;1934much less, when they had never yet had experience of such a miracle,
would they have expected any such thing. And yet He had made a beginning by actually
healing many sick; but nevertheless, not even from this did they expect the miracle of the
loaves; so imperfect were they as yet.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray, the Teacher’s skill, how distinctly He summons them on towards
believing. For He said not at once, “I feed them;” which indeed would not have been easily
received; but what?</p>
<p>“But Jesus,” so it is written, “said unto them, “They need not depart; give ye them to
eat.”1935</p>
<p>He said not, “I give them,” but, “Give ye them;” for as yet their regard to Him was as to
a man. But they not even so are awakened, but still reason as with a man, saying,</p>
<p>“We have but five loaves, and two fishes.”1936</p>
<p>Wherefore Mark also saith, “They understood not the saying, for their heart was
hardened.”1937</p>
<p>They continuing therefore to crawl on the ground, then at length He brings in His own
part, and saith, “Bring them hither to me.” For although the place be desert, yet He that
feeds the world is here; and although the time be now past, yet He that is not subject to time
is discoursing with you.</p>
<p>But John saith also, that they were “barley loaves,”1938not mentioning it without object,
but teaching us to trample under foot the pride of costly living. Such was the diet of the
prophets also.1939</p>
<p>2. “He took therefore the five loaves, and the two fishes, and commanded the multitude,”
it is said, “to sit down upon the grass, and looking up to Heaven, He blessed, and brake, and
gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.1940 And they did all eat and were
filled, and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that
had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.”1941</p>

<pb n="538"/>
<p>Wherefore did He look up to Heaven, and bless? It was to be believed of Him, both that
He is of the Father, and that He is equal to Him. But the proofs of these things seemed to
oppose one another. For while His equality was indicated by His doing all with authority,
of His origin from the Father they could no otherwise be persuaded, than by His doing all
with great lowliness, and with reference to Him, and invoking Him on His works. Wherefore
we see that He neither did these actions only, nor those, that both might be confirmed; and
now He works miracles with authority, now with prayer.</p>
<p>Then again, that what He did might not seem an inconsistency, in the lesser things He
looks up to Heaven, but in the greater doth all with authority; to teach thee in the lesser also,
that not as receiving power from elsewhere, but as honoring Him that begat Him, so He
acts. For example: when He forgave sins, and opened paradise, and brought in the thief, and
most utterly set aside the old law, and raised innumerable dead, and bridled the sea, and
reproved the un-uttered thoughts of men, and created an eye;—which are achievements of
God only and of none else;—we see Him in no instance praying: but when He provided for
the loaves to multiply themselves, a far less thing than all these, then He looks up to Heaven;
at once establishing these truths which I have spoken of, and instructing us not to touch a
meal, until we have given thanks to Him who giveth us this food.</p>
<p>And why doth He not make it of things that are not? Stopping the mouth of Marcion,
and of Manichæans, who alienate His creation from Him, and teaching by His very works,
that even all the things that are seen are His works and creatures, and signifying that it is
Himself who gives the fruits, who said at the beginning, “Let the earth put forth the herb of
grass,” and “Let the waters bring forth things moving with living souls.”1942</p>
<p>For this is not at all a less work than the other. For though those were made of things
that are not, yet nevertheless were they of water; and it was no greater thing to produce
fruits out of the earth, and moving things with life out of the water, than out of five loaves
to make so many; and of fishes again, which was a sign that He was ruler both of the earth
and of the sea.</p>
<p>Thus, since the sick were constantly the subject of His miracles, He works also a general
benefit, that the many might not be spectators only of what befell others, but themselves
also partakers of the gift.</p>
<p>And that which in the wilderness seemed to the Jews marvellous, (they said at least,
“Can He give bread also? or prepare a table in the wilderness?”1943) this He shows forth in
His works. With this view also He leads them into the wilderness, that the miracle might
be very far beyond suspicion, and that no one might think that any village lying near contributed
ought to the meal. For this reason He mentions the hour also, not the place only.</p>
<note type="footnote">1942 Gen. l. 11, 20. [LXX., ἐρπετ ψυχν ζωσν.]</note>

<pb n="539"/>
<p>And another thing too we learn, the self-restraint of the disciples which they practised
in necessary things, and how little they accounted of food. For being twelve, they had five
loaves only and two fishes; so secondary to them were the things of the body: so did they
cling to the things spiritual only.</p>
<p>And not even that little did they hold fast, but gave up even it when asked. Whereby we
should be taught, that though we have but little, this too we ought to give up to them that
are in need. Thus, when commanded to bring the five loaves, they say not, “and whence are
we to have food? whence to appease our own hunger?” but they obey at once.</p>
<p>And besides what I have mentioned, to this end, as I at least think, He makes it out of
the materials which they had, namely, that He might lead them to faith; for as yet they were
rather in a weak state.1944</p>
<p>Wherefore also “He looks up to Heaven.” For of the other miracles they had many examples,
but of this none.1945</p>
<p>3. “He took the loaves,” therefore, “and brake them, and gave them by His disciples,”
hereby to honor them; and not in honor to them only, but also that, when the miracle had
been done they might not disbelieve it, nor forget it when it had past, their own hands
bearing them witness.1946</p>
<p>Wherefore also He suffers the multitudes first to have a sense of hunger, and waits for
these to come to Him first and ask Him, and by them makes the people sit down, and by
them distributes; being minded by their own confessions and actions to prepossess them
every one.1947</p>
<p>Therefore also, from them He receives the loaves, that the testimonies of what was doing
might be many, and that they might have memorials of the miracle. For if even after these
occurrences they forgot,1948what would not have been their case, had He omitted those
provisions?</p>

<p>And He commands them to sit down on the trampled grass, instructing the multitudes
in self-denial. For His will was not to feed their bodies only, but also to instruct their souls.
As well by the place therefore, as by His giving them nothing more than loaves and fishes,
and by setting the same before all, and making it common, and by affording no one more
than another, He was teaching them humility, and temperance, and charity, and to be of
like mind one towards another, and to account all things common.</p>
<p>“And He brake and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.” The five
loaves He brake and gave, and the five multiplied themselves in the hands of the disciples.
And not even here doth He stay the miracle, but He made them even to exceed; to exceed,
not as whole loaves, but as fragments; to signify that of those loaves these were remains, and
in order that the absent might learn what had been done.</p>
<p>For this purpose indeed He suffered the multitudes to hunger, that no one might suppose
what took place to be illusion.</p>
<p>For this also He caused just twelve baskets to remain over, that Judas also might bear
one. For He was able indeed to have appeased their hunger, but the disciples would not have
known His power, since in Elijah’s case also this took place.1949</p>
<p>At all events, so greatly were the Jews amazed at Him for this, that they wished even to
make Him a king,1950although with regard to the other miracles they did not so in any instance.</p>
<p>What reasoning now may set forth, how the loaves multiplied1951themselves; how they
flowed together in the wilderness; how they were enough for so many (for there were “five
thousand men beside women and children;” which was a very great commendation of the
people, that both women and men attended Him); how the remnants had their being (for
this again is not less than the former), and became so abundant, that the baskets were equal
in number to the disciples, and neither more nor less?</p>
<p>Having then taken the fragments, He gave them not to the multitudes, but to the disciples,
and that, because the multitudes were in a more imperfect state than the disciples.</p>
<p>And, having wrought the miracle, “straightway He constrained His disciples to get into
a ship, and to go before Him unto the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.”1952
For even if He had seemed, when in sight, to be presenting an illusion, and not to have
wrought a truth; yet surely not in His absence also. For this cause then, submitting His
proceedings to an exact test, He commanded those that had got the memorials, and the
proof of the miracles, to depart from Him.</p>

<pb n="541"/>
<p>And besides this, when He is doing great works, He disposes elsewhere of the multitudes
and the disciples, instructing us in nothing to follow after the glory that comes from the
people, nor to collect a crowd about us.</p>
<p>Now by saying, “He constrained them,” He indicates the very close attendance of the
disciples.</p>
<p>And His pretext indeed for dismissing them was the multitude, but He was Himself
minded to go up into the mountain; and He did this, instructing us neither to be always in
intercourse with multitudes, nor always to fly from the crowd, but each of the two as may
be expedient, and giving each duly his turn.</p>
<p>4. Let us learn therefore ourselves also to wait upon Jesus; but not for His bounty in
things sensible, lest we be upbraided like the Jews. For “ye seek me,” saith He, “not because
ye saw the miracles,1953but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.”1954 Therefore
neither doth He work this miracle continually, but a second time only; that they might be
taught not to be slaves to their belly, but to cling incessantly to the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>To these then let us also cling, and let us seek the heavenly bread, and having received
it, let us cast away all worldly care. For if those men left houses, and cities, and kinsmen,
and all, and abode in the wilderness, and when hunger was pressing, withdrew not; much
more ought we, when approaching such a table, to show forth a more abundant self-command,
and to set our love on the things of the Spirit, and to seek the things of sense as secondary
to these.</p>
<p>Since even they were blamed, not because they sought Him for the bread, but because
it was for this only they sought Him, and for this primarily. For should any one despise the
great gifts, but cling to the small, and to those which the giver would have him despise, he
loses these latter too: as on the other hand, if we love those, He adds these also. For these
are but an appendage to the others; so vile are they and trifling, compared with those, although
they be great. Let us not therefore spend our diligence on them, but account both
the acquisition and loss of them alike indifferent, even as Job also neither clung to them
when present, nor sought them absent. For on this account, they are called χρματα,1955not
that we should bury them in the earth, but that we should use them aright.</p>
<p>And as of artisans every one hath his peculiar skill, even so the rich man, as he knows
not how to work in brass, nor to frame ships, nor to weave, nor to build houses, nor any
such thing;—let him learn then to use his wealth aright, and to pity the poor; so shall he
know a better art than all those.</p>
<note type="footnote">1953 [R.V., “ye saw signs.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">1954 John vi. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">1955 That is, “things for use.”</note>

<pb n="542"/>
<p>For indeed this is above all those arts. Its workshop is builded in Heaven. It hath its
tools not of iron and brass, but of goodness and of a right will. Of this art Christ is the
Teacher, and His Father. “For be ye merciful,” saith He, “as your Father which is in Heaven.”
1956</p>
<p>And what is indeed marvellous, being so much superior to the rest, it needs no labor,
no time for its perfection; it is enough to have willed, and the whole is accomplished.</p>
<p>But let us see also the end thereof, what it is. What then is the end of it? Heaven, the
good things in the heavens, that unspeakable glory, the spiritual bride-chambers, the bright
lamps, the abiding with the Bridegroom; the other things, which no speech, nor even understanding,
is able to set forth.</p>
<p>So that herein likewise great is its difference from all others. For most of the arts profit
us for the present life, but this for the life to come also.</p>
<p>5. But if it so far excels the arts that are necessary to us for the present, as medicine, for
instance, and house-building, and all others like them: much more the rest, which if any
one were nicely to examine, he would not even allow them to be arts. Wherefore I at least
would not call those others, as they are unnecessary, so much as arts at all. For wherein is
delicate cookery and making sauces profitable to us? Nowhere: yea, they are greatly unprofitable
and hurtful, doing harm both to body and soul, by bringing upon us the parent of all
diseases and sufferings, luxury, together with great extravagance.1957</p>
<p>But not these only, but not even painting, or embroidery, would I for one allow to be
an art, for they do but throw men into useless expense. But the arts ought to be concerned
with things necessary and important to our life, to supply and work them up. For to this
end God gave us skill at all, that we might invent methods, whereby to furnish out our life.
But that there should be figures1958either on walls, or on garments, wherein is it useful, I
pray thee? For this same cause the sandal-makers too, and the weavers, should have great
retrenchments made in their art. For most things in it they have carried into vulgar ostentation,
1959having corrupted its necessary use, and mixed with an honest art an evil craft; which
has been the case with the art of building also. But even as to this, so long as it builds houses
and not theatres, and labors upon things necessary, and not superfluous, I give the name of
an art; so the business of weaving too, as long as it makes clothes, and coverlids, but does
not imitate the spiders, and overwhelm men with much absurdity, and unspeakable effeminacy,
so long I call it an art.</p>

<pb n="543"/>
<p>And the sandal-makers’ trade, so long as it makes sandals, I will not rob of the appellation
of art; but when it perverts men to the gestures of women, and causes them by their sandals
to grow wanton and delicate, we will set it amidst the things hurtful and superfluous, and
not so much as name it an art.</p>
<p>And I know well, that to many I seem over-minute in busying myself about these things;
I shall not however refrain for this. For the cause of all our evils is this, such faults being at
all counted trifling, and therefore disregarded.</p>
<p>And what sin, say you, can be of less account than this, of having an ornamented and
glittering sandal, which fits the foot; if indeed it seem right at all to denominate it a sin?</p>
<p>Will ye then that I let loose my tongue upon it, and show its unseemliness, how great
it is? and will ye not be angry? Or rather, though ye be angry, I care not much. Nay, for
yourselves are to blame for this folly, who do not so much as think it is a sin, and hereby
constrain us to enter upon the reproof of this extravagance. Come then, let us examine it,
and let us see what sort of an evil it is. For when the silken threads, which it is not seemly
should be even inwoven in your garments, these are sewn by you into your shoes, what reproach,
what derision do these things deserve?</p>
<p>And if thou despise our judgments, hear the voice of Paul, with great earnestness forbidding
these things, and then thou wilt perceive the absurdity of them. What then saith he?
“Not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.”1960 Of what favor then canst
thou be worthy; when, in spite of Paul’s prohibiting the married woman to have costly
clothing, thou extendest this effeminacy even to thy shoes, and hast no end of contri vances
for the sake of this ridicule and reproach? Yes: for first a ship is built, then rowers are
mustered, and a man for the prow, and a helmsman, and a sail is spread, and an ocean traversed,
and, leaving wife and children and country, the merchant commits his very life to
the waves, and comes to the land of the barbarians, and undergoes innumerable dangers
for these threads, that after it all thou mayest take them, and sew them into thy shoes, and
ornament the leather. And what can be done worse than this folly?</p>
<p>But the old ways are not like these, but such as become men. Wherefore I for my part
expect that in process of time the young men amongst us will wear even women’s shoes,
and not be ashamed. And what is more grievous, men’s fathers seeing these things are not
much displeased, but do even account it an indifferent matter.</p>
<p>Would ye that I should add what is still more grievous; that these things are done even
when there are many poor? Would ye that I bring before you Christ, an hungered, naked,
wandering everywhere, in chains? And how many thunderbolts must ye not deserve, overlooking
Him in want of necessary food, and adorning these pieces of leather with so much
diligence? And He indeed, when He was giving law to His disciples, would not so much as
<note type="footnote">1960 1 Tim. ii. 9.</note>

<pb n="544"/>
suffer them to have shoes at all, but we cannot bear to walk, I say not barefooted, but even
with feet shod as they ought to be.</p>
<p>7. What then can be worse than this unseemliness, this absurdity? For the thing marks
a soul, in the first place effeminate, then unfeeling and cruel, then curious and idly busy.
For when will he be able to attend to any necessary matter, who is taken up with these superfluous
things? when will such a youth endure to take heed to his soul, or to consider so
much as that he hath a soul? Yes, he surely will be a trifler who cannot help admiring such
things; he cruel, who for their sake neglects the poor; he void of virtue, who spends all his
diligence on them.</p>
<p>For he that is curious about the beauty of threads, and the bloom of colors, and the
tendrils made of such woven work, when will he be able to look upon the heaven? when will
he admire the beauty there, who is excited about a kind of beauty that belongs to pieces of
leather, and who is bending to the earth? And whereas God hath stretched out the Heaven,
and lighted up the sun, drawing thy looks upwards; thou constrainest thyself to look
downwards, and to the earth, like the swine, and obeyest the devil. For indeed this wicked
demon hath devised this unseemliness, to draw thee off from that beauty. For this intent
hath he drawn thee this way; and God, showing Heaven, is outvied by a devil showing certain
skins, or rather not even skins (for indeed these too are God’s works), but effeminacy and
a bad kind of skill.</p>
<p>And the young man goes about bending down towards the earth, he that is required to
seek wisdom concerning the things in Heaven; priding himself more on these trifles than
if he had accomplished some great and good work, and walking on tiptoe in the forum, and
hereby begetting to himself superfluous sorrows and distresses, lest he should stain them
with the mud when it is winter; lest he should cover them with the dust, when summer is
come.</p>
<p>What sayest thou, O man? Hast thou cast thy whole soul into the mire through this extravagance,
and dost thou overlook it trailing on the ground, and art thou so anxious about
a pair of shoes? Mark their use, and respect the verdict thou passest on them. For to tread
on mud and mire, and all the spots on the pavement, for this were thy shoes made. Or if
thou canst not bear this, take and hang them from thy neck, or put them on thy head.</p>
<p>And ye indeed laugh at hearing this. But I am inclined to weep for these men’s madness,
and their earnest care about these matters. For in truth they would rather stain their body
with mud, than those pieces of leather.</p>
<p>Triflers then they become in this way, and fond of money again in another way. For he
that has been used to be frantic and eager upon such matters, requires also for his clothes
and for all other things much expense, and a large income.</p>

<pb n="545"/>
<p>And if he have a munificent father, his thraldom becomes worse, his absurd fancy more
intense; but if a parsimonious one, he is driven to other unseemliness, by way of getting together
a little money for such expenses.</p>
<p>Hence many young men have even sold their manhood, and have become parasites to
the rich, and have undertaken other servile offices, purchasing thereby the fulfillment of
such desires.</p>
<p>So then, that this man is sure to be at once fond of money, and a trifler, and about important
things the most indolent of all men, and that he will be forced to commit many sins,
is hereby evident. And that he is cruel and vainglorious, neither this will any one gainsay:
cruel, in that when he sees a poor man, through the love of finery he makes as though he
did not even see him, but while he is decking out these things with gold, overlooks him
perishing of hunger; vainglorious, since even in such little matters he trains himself to hunt
after the admiration of the beholders. For I suppose no general prides himself so much on
his legions and trophies, as our profligate youths on the decking out of their shoes, on their
trailing garments, on the dressing of their hair; yet surely all these are works of other persons,
in their trades. But if men do not cease from vain boasting in the works of others, when will
they cease from it in their own?</p>
<p>8. Shall I mention yet other things more grievous than these? or are even these enough
for you? Well then; I must end my speech here; since even this have I said, because of the
disputatious, who maintain the thing not to be so very wrong.
And although I know that many of the young will not so much as attend to what I have
said, being once for all intoxicated with this fancy, I yet ought not therefore to keep silence.
For such fathers as have understanding, and are as yet sound, will be able to force them,
even against their will, to a becoming decency.</p>
<p>Say not then, “this is of no consequence, that is of no consequence;” for this, this hath
ruined all. For even hereby ought you to train them, and by the things which seem trifling
to make them grave, great of soul, superior to outward habiliments; so shall we find them
approved in the great things also. For what is more ordinary than the learning of letters?
nevertheless thereby do men become rhetoricians,1961and sophists, and philosophers, and
if they know not their letters, neither will they ever have that knowledge.
And this we have spoken not to young men only, but to women also, and to young
damsels. For these too are liable to the like charges, and much more, inasmuch as seemliness
is a thing appropriate to a virgin.</p>
<p>What has been said therefore to the others; do ye account to have been said to you also,
that we may not repeat again the same things.</p>
<note type="footnote">1961 [ῥήτορε.]</note>

<pb n="546"/>
<p>For it is full time now to close our discourse with prayer. All of you then pray with us,
that the young men of the church above all things may be enabled to live orderly, and to
attain an old age becoming them. Since for those surely who do not so live, it were well not
to come to old age at all. But for them that have grown old even in youth, I pray that they
may attain also to the very deep of gray hairs, and become fathers of approved children, and
may be a joy to them that gave them birth, and above all surely to the God that made them,
and may exterminate every distempered fancy, not that about their shoes, nor about their
clothes only, but every other kind also.</p>
<p>For as untilled land, such is also youth neglected, bringing forth many thorns from
many quarters. Let us then send forth on them the fire of the Spirit, and burn up these
wicked desires, and let us break up our fields, and make them ready for the reception of the
seed, and the young men amongst us let us exhibit with soberer minds than the old elsewhere.
For this in fact is the marvellous thing, when temperance shines forth in youth; since he
surely that is temperate in old age cannot have a great reward, having in perfection the security
from his age. But what is wonderful, is to enjoy a calm amidst waves, and in a furnace
not to be burnt, and in youth not to run wanton.</p>
<p>With these things then in our minds, let us emulate that blessed Joseph, who shone
through all these trials, that we may attain unto the same crowns with him; unto which may
we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be
glory unto the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, now and always, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily L.</head>
<p>Matt. XIV. 23, 24.</p>
<p>“And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the mountain apart to pray:
and when the evening was come, He was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst
of the sea, tossed with waves:1962for the wind was contrary.”
For what purpose doth He go up into the mountain? To teach us, that loneliness and
retirement is good, when we are to pray to God. With this view, you see, He is continually
withdrawing into the wilderness, and there often spends the whole night in prayer, teaching
us earnestly to seek such quietness in our prayers, as the time and place may confer. For the
wilderness is the mother of quiet; it is a calm and a harbor, delivering us from all turmoils.</p>
<p>He Himself then went up thither with this object, but the disciples are tossed with the
waves again, and undergo a storm, equal even to the former. But whereas before they had
Him in the ship when this befell them, now they were alone by themselves. Thus gently and
by degrees He excites and urges them on for the better, even to the bearing all nobly. Accordingly
we see, that when they were first near that danger, He was present, though asleep, so
as readily to give them relief; but now leading them to a greater degree of endurance, He
doth not even this, but departs, and in mid sea permits the storm to arise, so that they might
not so much as look for a hope of preservation from any quarter; and He lets them be tempest-
tost all the night, thoroughly to awaken, as I suppose, their hardened heart.</p>
<p>For such is the nature of the fear, which the time concurs with the rough weather in
producing. And together with the compunction, He cast them also into a greater longing
for Himself, and a continual remembrance of Him.</p>
<p>Accordingly, neither did He present Himself to them at once. For, “in the fourth watch,”
so it is said, “of the night, He went unto them, walking upon the sea;”1963instructing them
not hastily to seek for deliverance; from their pressing dangers, but to bear all occurrences
manfully. At all events, when they looked to be delivered, then was their fear again
heightened. For,</p>
<p>“When the disciples,” it is said, “saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying,
It is a spirit: and they cried out for fear.”1964</p>
<p>Yea, and He constantly doth so; when He is on the point of removing our terrors, He
brings upon us other worse things, and more alarming: which we see took place then also.
<note type="footnote">1962 [R.V., “distressed by the waves.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">1963 Matt. xiv. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">1964 Matt. xiv. 26. [R.V., “It is an apparition,” but Chrysostom has the indirect form, “saying that it is an apparition.”
The Greek term is φντασμα, not πνεμα.—R.]</note>

<pb n="548"/>
For together with the storm, the sight too troubled them, no less than the storm. Therefore
neither did He remove the darkness, nor straightway make Himself manifest, training them,
as I said, by the continuance of these fears, and instructing them to be ready to endure. This
He did in the case of Job also; for when He was on the point of removing the terror and the
temptation, then He suffered the end to grow more grievous; I mean not for his children’s
death, or the words of his wife, but because of the reproaches, both of his servants and of
his friends. And when He was about to rescue Jacob from his affliction in the strange land,
He allowed his trouble to be awakened and aggravated: in that his father-in-law first overtook
him and threatened death, and then his brother coming immediately after, suspended over
him the extremest danger.</p>
<p>For since one cannot be tempted both for a long time and severely; when the righteous
are on the point of coming to an end of their conflicts, He, willing them to gain the more,
enhances their struggles. Which He did in the case of Abraham too, appointing for his last
conflict that about his child. For thus even things intolerable will be tolerable, when they
are so brought upon us, as to have their removal near, at the very doors.</p>
<p>So did Christ at that time also, and did not discover Himself before they cried out. For
the more intense their alarm, the more did they welcome His coming. Afterward when they
had exclaimed, it is said,
“Straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.”1965
This word removed their fear, and caused them to take confidence. For as they knew
Him not by sight, because of His marvellous kind of motion, and because of the time, He
makes Himself manifest by His voice.</p>
<p>2. What then saith Peter, everywhere ardent, and ever starting forward before the rest?</p>
<p>“Lord, if it be Thou,” saith he, “bid me come unto Thee on the water.”1966</p>
<p>He said not, “Pray and entreat,” but, “bid.” Seest thou how great his ardor, how great
his faith? Yet surely he is hereby often in danger, by seeking things beyond his measure. For
so here too he required an exceedingly great thing, for love only, not for display. For neither
did he say, “Bid me walk on the water,” but what? “Bid me come unto Thee.” For none so
loved Jesus.</p>
<p>This he did also after the resurrection; he endured not to come with the others, but leapt
forward.1967 And not love only, but faith also doth he display. For he not only believed that
He was able Himself to walk on the sea, but that He could lead upon it others also; and he
longs to be quickly near Him.</p>
<note type="footnote">1965 Matt. xiv. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">1966 Matt. xiv. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">1967 John xxi. 7.</note>

<pb n="549"/>
<p>“And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the
water, and came1968to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous,1969he was afraid; and
beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth
His hand and caught him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou
doubt?”1970</p>
<p>This is more wonderful than the former. Therefore this is done after that. For when He
had shown that He rules the sea, then He carries on the sign to what is yet more marvellous.
Then He rebuked the winds only; but now He both walks Himself, and permits another to
do so; which thing if He had required to be done at the beginning, Peter would not have so
well received it, because he had not yet acquired so great faith.</p>
<p>Wherefore then did Christ permit him? Why, if He had said, “thou canst not,” Peter
being ardent would have contradicted Him again. Wherefore by the facts He convinces him,
that for the future he may be sobered.</p>
<p>But not even so doth he endure. Therefore having come down, he becomes dizzy; for
he was afraid. And this the surf caused, but his fear was wrought by the wind.</p>
<p>But John saith, that “they willingly received Him into the ship; and immediately the
ship was at the land whither they went,”1971relating this same circumstance. So that when
they were on the point of arriving at the land, He entered the ship.</p>
<p>Peter then having come down from the ship went unto Him, not rejoicing so much in
walking on the water, as in coming unto Him. And when he had prevailed over the greater,
he was on the point of suffering evil from the less, from the violence of the wind, I mean,
not of the sea. For such a thing is human nature; not seldom effecting great things, it exposes
itself in the less; as Elias felt toward Jezebel, as Moses toward the Egyptian, as David toward
Bathsheba. Even so then this man also; while their fear was yet at the height, he took courage
to walk upon the water, but against the assault of the wind he was no longer able to stand;
and this, being near Christ. So absolutely nothing doth it avail to be near Christ, not being
near Him by faith.</p>
<p>And this also showed the difference between the Master and the disciple, and allayed
the feelings of the others. For if in the case of the two brethren they had indignation, much
more here; for they had not yet the Spirit vouchsafed unto them.</p>

<p>But afterwards they were not like this. On every occasion, for example, they give up the
first honors to Peter, and put him forward in their addresses to the people, although of a
rougher vein than any of them.1972</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not command the winds to cease, but Himself stretched forth
His hand and took hold of him? Because in him faith was required. For when our part is
wanting, then God’s part also is at a stand.</p>
<p>Signifying therefore that not the assault of the wind, but his want of faith had wrought
his overthrow, He saith, “Wherefore didst thou doubt, O thou of little faith?” So that if his
faith had not been weak, he would have stood easily against the wind also. And for this
reason, you see, even when He had caught hold of Him, He suffers the wind to blow,
showing that no hurt comes thereby, when faith is steadfast.</p>
<p>And as when a nestling has come out of the nest before the time, and is on the point of
falling, its mother bears it on her wings, and brings it back to the nest; even so did Christ.
“And when they were come into the ship, then the wind ceased.”1973</p>
<p>Whereas before this they had said, “What manner of man is this, that even the winds
and the sea obey Him!”1974now it is not so. For “they that were in the ship,” it is said, “came
and worshipped Him, saying, Of a truth Thou art Son of God.”1975 Seest thou, how by degrees
he was leading them all higher and higher? For both by His walking on the sea, and by His
commanding another to do so, and preserving him in jeopardy; their faith was henceforth
great. For then indeed He rebuked the sea, but now He rebukes it not, in another way signifying
His power more abundantly. Wherefore also they said, “Of a truth Thou art Son of
God.”</p>
<p>What then? Did He rebuke them on their so speaking? Nay, quite the contrary, He
rather confirmed what they said, with greater authority healing such as approached Him,
and not as before.</p>
<p>“And when they were gone over,” so it is said, “they came into the land of Gennesaret.
And when the men of that place had knowledge of Him, they sent out into all that country
round about, and brought unto Him all that were diseased; and besought Him that they
might touch the hem of His garment; and as many as touched were made perfectly
whole.”1976</p>

<p>For neither did they approach Him as before, dragging Him into their houses, and
seeking a touch of His hand, and directions from Him in words; but in a far higher strain,
and with more of self-denial, and with a more abundant faith did they try to win themselves
a cure; for she that had the issue of blood taught them all to be severe in seeking wisdom.</p>
<p>And the evangelist, implying also that at long intervals He visited the several neighborhoods,
saith, “The men of that place took knowledge of Him, and sent out into the country
round about, and brought unto Him them that were diseased.” But yet the interval, so far
from abolishing their faith, made it even greater, and preserved it in vigor.</p>
<p>3. Let us also then touch the hem of His garment, or rather, if we be willing, we have
Him entire. For indeed His body is set before us now, not His garment only, but even His
body; not for us to touch it only, but also to eat, and be filled. Let us now then draw near
with faith, every one that hath an infirmity. For if they that touched the hem of His garment
drew from Him so much virtue, how much more they that possess Him entire? Now to draw
near with faith is not only to receive the offering, but also with a pure heart to touch it; to
be so minded, as approaching Christ Himself. For what, if thou hear no voice? Yet thou
seest Him laid out; or rather thou dost also hear His voice, while He is speaking by the
evangelists.</p>
<p>Believe, therefore, that even now it is that supper, at which He Himself sat down. For
this is in no respect different from that. For neither doth man make this and Himself the
other; but both this and that is His own work. When therefore thou seest the priest delivering
it unto thee, account not that it is the priest that doeth so, but that it is Christ’s hand that is
stretched out.</p>
<p>Even as when he baptizes, not he doth baptize thee, but it is God that possesses thy head
with invisible power, and neither angel nor archangel nor any other dare draw nigh and
touch thee; even so now also. For when God begets, the gift is His only. Seest thou not those
who adopt to themselves sons here, how they commit not the act to slaves, but are themselves
present at the judgment-seat? Even so neither hath God committed His gift to angels, but
Himself is present, commanding and saying, “Call no man Father on earth;”1977not that
thou shouldest dishonor them that gave thee birth, but that thou shouldest prefer to all those
Him that made thee, and enrolled thee amongst His own children. For He that hath given
the greater, that is, hath set Himself before thee, much more will He not think scorn to distribute
unto thee of His body. Let us hear therefore, both priests and subjects, what we have
had vouchsafed to us; let us hear and tremble. Of His own holy flesh He hath granted us
our fill; He hath set before us Himself sacrificed.</p>

<p>What excuse shall we have then, when feeding on such food, we commit such sins?
when eating a lamb, we become wolves? when feeding on a sheep, we spoil by violence like
the lions?</p>
<p>For this mystery He directs to be always clear, not from violence only, but even from
bare enmity. Yea, for this mystery is a mystery of peace; it allows us not to cling to wealth.
For if He spared not Himself for us, what must we deserve, sparing our wealth, and being
lavish of a soul, in behalf of which He spared not Himself?</p>
<p>Now upon the Jews God every year bound in their feasts a memorial of His peculiar
favors to them: but for thee, every day, as I may say, through these mysteries.</p>
<p>Be not therefore ashamed of the cross: for these are our venerable things, these our
mysteries; with this gift do we adorn ourselves, with this we are beautified.</p>
<p>And if I say, He stretched out the heaven, He spread out the earth and the sea, He sent
prophets and angels, I say nothing in comparison. For the sum of His benefits is this, that
“He spared not His own Son,”1978in order to save His alienated servants.</p>
<p>4. Let no Judas then approach this table, no Simon; nay, for both these perished through
covetousness. Let us flee then from this gulf; neither let us account it enough for our salvation,
if after we have stripped widows and orphans, we offer for this table a gold and jewelled
cup. Nay, if thou desire to honor the sacrifice, offer thy soul, for which also it was slain;
cause that to become golden; but if that remain worse than lead or potter’s clay, while the
vessel is of gold, what is the profit?</p>
<p>Let not this therefore be our aim, to offer golden vessels only, but to do so from honest
earnings likewise. For these are of the sort that is more precious even than gold, these that
are without injuriousness. For the church is not a gold foundry nor a workshop for silver,
but an assembly of angels. Wherefore it is souls which we require, since in fact God accepts
these for the souls’ sake.</p>
<p>That table at that time was not of silver nor that cup of gold, out of which Christ gave
His disciples His own blood; but precious was everything there, and awful, for that they
were full of the Spirit.1979</p>
<p>Wouldest thou do honor to Christ’s body? Neglect Him not when naked; do not while
here thou honorest Him with silken garments, neglect Him perishing without of cold and
nakedness. For He that said, “This is my body,” and by His word confirmed the fact, “This
same said, “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me not;” and, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to
one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.”1980 For This indeed needs not coverings, but
a pure soul; but that requires much attention.</p>

<pb n="553"/>
<p>Let us learn therefore to be strict in life, and to honor Christ as He Himself desires. For
to Him who is honored that honor is most pleasing, which it is His own will to have, not
that which we account best. Since Peter too thought to honor Him by forbidding Him to
wash his feet, but his doing so was not an honor, but the contrary.</p>
<p>Even so do thou honor Him with this honor, which He ordained, spending thy wealth
on poor people. Since God hath no need at all of golden vessels, but of golden souls.</p>
<p>And these things I say, not forbidding such offerings to be provided; but requiring you,
together with them, and before them, to give alms. For He accepts indeed the former, but
much more the latter. For in the one the offerer alone is profited, but in the other the receiver
also. Here the act seems to be a ground even of ostentation; but there all is mercifulness,
and love to man.</p>
<p>For what is the profit, when His table indeed is full of golden cups, but He perishes with
hunger? First fill Him, being an hungered, and then abundantly deck out His table also.
Dost thou make Him a cup of gold, while thou givest Him not a cup of cold water? And
what is the profit? Dost thou furnish His table with cloths bespangled with gold, while to
Himself thou affordest not even the necessary covering? And what good comes of it? For
tell me, should you see one at a loss for necessary food, and omit appeasing his hunger,
while you first overlaid his table with silver; would he indeed thank thee, and not rather be
indignant? What, again, if seeing one wrapped in rags, and stiff with cold, thou shouldest
neglect giving him a garment, and build golden columns, saying, “thou wert doing it to his
honor,” would he not say that thou wert mocking, and account it an insult, and that the
most extreme?</p>
<p>Let this then be thy thought with regard to Christ also, when He is going about a wanderer,
and a stranger, needing a roof to cover Him; and thou, neglecting to receive Him,
deckest out a pavement, and walls, and capitals of columns, and hangest up silver chains by
means of lamps,1981but Himself bound in prison thou wilt not even look upon.</p>
<p>5. And these things I say, not forbidding munificence in these matters, but admonishing
you to do those other works together with these, or rather even before these. Because for
not having done these no one was ever blamed, but for those, hell is threatened, and unquenchable
fire, and the punishment with evil spirits. Do not therefore while adorning His
house overlook thy brother in distress, for he is more properly a temple than the other.</p>
<p>And whereas these thy stores will be subject to alienations both by unbelieving kings,
and tyrants, and robbers; whatever thou mayest do for thy brother, being hungry, and a

brackets for lamps, on which the Anathemata, or votive offerings, were suspended.” See Bingh. 8, 8, 1.</note>

stranger, and naked, not even the devil will be able to despoil, but it will be laid up in an
inviolable treasure.</p>
<p>Why then doth He Himself say, “The poor always ye have with you, but me ye have not
always?”1982 Why, for this reason most of all should we give alms, that we have Him not
always an hungered, but in the present life only. But if thou art desirous to learn also the
whole meaning of the saying, understand that this was said not with a view to His disciples,
although it seem so, but to the woman’s weakness. That is, her disposition being still rather
imperfect, and they doubting about her; to revive her He said these things. For in proof that
for her comfort He said it, He added, “Why trouble ye the woman?”1983 And with regard
to our having Him really always with us, He saith, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world.”1984 From all which it is evident, that for no other object was this said,
but that the rebuke of the disciples might not wither the faith of the woman, just then budding.</p>
<p>Let us not then bring forward these things now, which were uttered because of some
economy, but let us read all the laws, those in the New and those in the Old Testament, that
are set down about almsgiving, and let us be very earnest about this matter. For this cleanses
from sin. For “give alms, and all things will be clean unto you.”1985 This is a greater thing
than sacrifice. “For I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.”1986 This opens the heavens. For
“thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.”1987 This is more indispensable
than virginity: for thus were those virgins cast out of the bridechamber; thus
were the others brought in.</p>
<p>All which things let us consider, and sow liberally, that we may reap in more ample
abundance, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LI.</head>
<p>Matt. XV. 1.</p>
<p>“Then came to Jesus Scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do Thy
disciples,” etc.1988</p>
<p>Then; when? when He had wrought His countless miracles; when He had healed the
infirm by the touch of the hem of His garment. For even with this intent doth the evangelist
mark the time, that He might signify their unspeakable wickedness, by nothing repressed.</p>
<p>But what means, “The Scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem?”1989 In every
one of the tribes were they scattered abroad, and divided into twelve parts; but they who
occupied the chief city were worse than the others, as both enjoying more honor, and having
contracted much haughtiness.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how even by the question itself they are convicted; in not saying,
“Why do they transgress the law of Moses,” but, “the tradition of the elders.” Whence it is
evident that the priests were inventing many novelties, although Moses, with much terror
and with much threatening, had enjoined neither to add nor take away. “For ye shall not
add,” saith he, “unto the word which I command you this day, and ye shall not take away
from it.”1990</p>
<p>But not the less were they innovating; as in this instance, that one ought not to eat with
unwashen hands, that we must wash cups and brazen vessels, that we must wash also
ourselves. Thus, when men were henceforth, as time advanced, to be freed from their observances,
at that very time they bound them with the same in more and more instances,
fearing lest any one should take away their power, and wishing to strike more dread, as
though they were themselves also lawgivers. The thing in fact proceeded so far in enormity,
that while their own commandments were kept, those of God were transgressed; and they
so far prevailed, that the matter had actually become a ground of accusation. Which was a
twofold charge against them, in that they both invented novelties, and were so strict exactors
on their own account, while of God they made no reckoning.</p>
<p>And omitting to speak of the other things, the pots and the brazen vessels (for it was
too ridiculous), what seemed more reasonable than the rest, that they bring forward, wishing,

as seems at least to me, in that way to provoke Him to anger. Wherefore also they made
mention of the elders, in order that He, as setting them at nought, might give occasion
against Himself.</p>
<p>But it were meet first to inquire, why the disciples ate with unwashen hands. Wherefore
then did they so eat? Not as making a point of it, but as overlooking henceforth the things
that are superfluous, and attending to such as are necessary; having no law to wash or not
to wash, but doing either as it happened. For they that despised even their own necessary
food, how were they to hold these things worth much consideration? This then having often
happened unintentionally,—for instance, when they ate in the wilderness, when they plucked
the ears of corn,—is now put forward as a charge by these persons, who are always transgressing
in the great things, and making much account of the superfluous.</p>
<p>2. What then saith Christ? He did not set Himself against it, neither made He any defense,
but straightway blames them again, plucking down their confidence, and signifying that he
who commits great sins ought not to be strict with others concerning small matters. “What?
when you ought to be blamed,” saith He, “do ye even blame?”</p>
<p>But do thou observe, how when it is His will to set aside any of the things enjoined by
the law, He does it in the form of an apology; and so He did in that case. For by no means
doth He proceed at once to transgress it, nor doth He say, “It is nothing;” for surely He
would have made them more audacious; but first He clean cuts away their boldness, bringing
forward the far heavier charge, and directing it upon their head. And He neither saith, “they
do well in transgressing it,” lest He should give them a hold on Him; nor doth He speak ill
of their proceeding, lest He should confirm the law: nor again, on the other hand, doth He
blame the elders, as lawless and unholy men; for doubtless they would have shunned Him
as a reviler and injurious: but all these things He gives up, and proceeds another way. And
He seems indeed to be rebuking the persons themselves who had come to Him, but He is
reprehending them that enacted these laws; nowhere indeed making mention of the elders,
but by His charge against the Scribes casting down them also, and signifying that their sin
is twofold, first in disobeying God, next in doing so on men’s account; as though He had
said, “Why this, this hath ruined you, your obeying the elders in all things.”</p>
<p>Yet He saith not so, but this is just what He intimates, by answering them as follows:</p>
<p>“Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by1991your tradition? For God
commanded, saying, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that curseth father or
mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
<note type="footnote">1991 [R.V., “because of.”]</note>

<pb n="557"/>
It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, and1992honor not his father or
his mother1993—And ye have made void the commandment1994of God by your tradition.1995</p>
<p>And He said not, “the elders’ tradition,” but “your own.” And, “ye say;” again He said
not, “the elders say:” in order to make His speech less galling. That is, because they wanted
to prove the disciples transgressors of the law, He signifies that they themselves are doing
so, but that these are free from blame. For of course that is not a law, which is enjoined by
men (wherefore also He calls it “a tradition”), and especially by men that are transgressors
of the law.</p>
<p>And since this had no shade of contrariety to the law, to command men to wash their
hands, He brings forward another tradition, which is opposed to the law. And what He
saith is like this. “They taught the young, under the garb of piety, to despise their fathers.”
How, and in what way? “If one of their parents said to his child, Give me this sheep that
thou hast, or this calf, or any such thing, they used to say, ‘This is a gift to God, whereby
thou wouldest be profited by me, and thou canst not have it.’ And two evils hence arose: on
the one hand they did not bring them to God, on the other they defrauded their parents
under the name of the offering, alike insulting their parents for God’s sake, and God for
their parents’ sake.” But He doth not say this at once, but first rehearses the law, by which
He signifies His earnest desire that parents should be honored. For, “honor,” saith He, “thy
father and thy mother, that thou mayest live long upon the earth.”1996 And again, “He that
curseth father or mother, let him die the death.”1997</p>
<p>But He, omitting the first, the reward appointed for them that honor their parents, states
that which is more awful, the punishment, I mean, threatened to such as dishonor them;
desiring both to dismay them, and to conciliate such as have understanding; and He implies
them to be for this worthy of death. For if he who dishonors them in word is punished,
much more ye, who do so in deed, and who not only dishonor, but also teach it to others.
“Ye then who ought not so much as to live, how find ye fault with the disciples?”</p>
<p>“And what wonder is it, if ye offer such insults to me, who am as yet unknown, when
even to the Father ye are found doing the like?” For everywhere He both asserts and implies,
that from Him they began with this their arrogance.</p>
<note type="footnote">1992 [Chrysostom read κα, with the rec. text, thus making the sentence break off. The A.V. supplies “he shall

<p>But some do also otherwise interpret, “It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me;” that is, I owe thee no honor, but it is a free gift from me to thee, if indeed I do honor
thee. But Christ would not have mentioned an insult of that sort.</p>
<p>And Mark again makes this plainer, by saying, “It is Corban, by whatsoever thou
mightest be profited by me;”1998which means, not a gift and present, but properly an offering.</p>
<p>Having then signified that they who were trampling on the law could not be justly entitled
to blame men for transgressing a command of certain elders, He points out this same thing
again from the prophet likewise. Thus, having once laid hold of them severely, He proceeds
further: as on every occasion He doth, bringing forward the Scriptures, and so evincing
Himself to be in accordance with God.</p>
<p>And what saith the prophet? “This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart
is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments
of men.”1999</p>
<p>Seest thou a prophecy in exact accordance with His sayings, and from the very first
proclaiming beforehand their wickedness? For what Christ laid to their charge now, of this
Isaiah also spake from the very first; that the words of God they despise, “for in vain do they
worship me,” saith He; but of their own they make much account, “teaching,” saith He, “for
doctrines the commandments of men.” Therefore with reason the disciples keep them not.</p>
<p>3. Having, you see, given them their mortal blow; and from the facts first, then from
their own suffrage, then from the prophet having aggravated the charge, with them indeed
He discourses not at all, incorrigibly disposed as they are now come to be, but directs His
speech to the multitudes, so as to introduce His doctrine, great and high, and full of much
strictness; and taking occasion from the former topic, He proceeds to insert that which is
greater, casting out also the observance of meats.</p>
<p>But see when. When He had cleansed the leper, when He had repealed the Sabbath,
when He had shown Himself King of earth and sea, when He had made laws, when He had
remitted sins, when He had raised dead men, when He had afforded them many proofs of
His Godhead, then He discourses of meats.</p>
<p>For indeed all the religion of the Jews is comprised in this; if thou take this away, thou
hast even taken away all. For hereby He signifies, that circumcision too must be abrogated.
But of Himself He doth not prominently introduce this (forasmuch as that was older than
the other commandments, and had higher estimation), but He enacts it by His disciples.
For so great a thing was it, that even the disciples after so long a time being minded to do
it away, first practise it, and so put it down.2000</p>
<note type="footnote">1998 Mark vii. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1999 Matt. xv. 8, 9. See Is. xxix. 13. [R.V., “teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2000 Acts xvi. 3.</note>

<pb n="559"/>
<p>But see how He introduces His law: how “He called the multitude, and said unto them,
Hear and understand.”2001</p>
<p>Thus He doth by no means simply reveal it to them, but by respect and courtesy, first,
He makes His saying acceptable (for this the evangelist declares by saying, “He called them
unto Him”): and secondly, by the time also; in that after their refutation, and His victory
over them, and the accusation by the prophet, then He begins His legislation, when they
too would more easily receive His sayings.</p>
<p>And He doth not merely call them unto Him, but also makes them more attentive. For
“understand,” saith He, that is, “consider, rouse yourselves; for of that sort is the law now
about to be enacted. For if they set aside the law, even unseasonably, for their own tradition,
and ye hearkened; much more ought ye to hearken unto me, who at the proper season am
leading you unto a higher rule of self restraint.”</p>
<p>And He did not say, “The observance of meats is nothing, neither that Moses had given
wrong injunctions, nor that of condescension He did so;” but in the way of admonition and
counsel, and taking His testimony from the nature of the things, He saith: “Not the things
that go into the mouth, defile the man, but the things that go out of the mouth;”2002resorting
to nature herself both in His enactment and in His demonstration. Yet they hearing all this,
made no reply, neither did they say, “What sayest Thou? When God hath given charges
without number concerning the observance of meats, dost thou make such laws?” But since
He had utterly stopped their mouths, not by refuting them only, but also by publishing their
craft, and exposing what was done by them in secret, and revealing the secrets of their mind;
their mouths were stopped, and so they went away.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how He doth not yet venture distinctly to set Himself with boldness
against the meats. Therefore neither did He say “the meats,” but, “the things that enter in
defile not the man;” which it was natural for them to suspect concerning the unwashen
hands also. For He indeed was speaking of meats, but it would be understood of these matters
too.</p>
<p>Why, so strong was the feeling of scruple about the meats, that even after the resurrection
Peter said, “Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.”2003 For although
it was for the sake of others that He said this, and in order to leave Himself a justification
against his censurers, by pointing out that he actually remonstrated, and not even
so was excused, nevertheless it implies the depth of their impression on that point.</p>
<p>Wherefore you see He Himself also at the beginning spake not openly concerning meats,
but, “The things that go into the mouth;” and again, when He had seemed afterwards to

<pb n="560"/>
speak more plainly, He veiled it by His conclusion, saying, “But to eat with unwashen hands
defileth not the man:”2004that He might seem to have had His occasion from thence, and
to be still discoursing of the same. Therefore He said not, “To eat meats defileth not a man,”
but is as though He were speaking on that other topic; that they may have nothing to say
against it.</p>
<p>4. When therefore they had heard these things, “the Pharisees,” it is said, “were offended,”
2005not the multitudes. For “His disciples,” so it is said, “came and said unto Him,
Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard the saying?” Yet surely
nothing had been said unto them.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? He did not remove the offense in respect of them, but reproved
them, saying, “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted
up.”2006 For He is wont both to despise offenses, and not to despise them. Elsewhere, for
example, He saith, “But lest we should offend them, cast an hook into the sea:”2007but here
He saith, “Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind: and if the blind lead the blind,
both shall fall into the ditch.”2008</p>
<p>But these things His disciples said, not as grieving for those men only, but as being
themselves also slightly perplexed. But because they durst not say so in their own person,
they would fain learn it by their telling Him of others. And as to its being so, hear how after
this the ardent and ever-forward Peter came to Him, and saith, “Declare unto us this parable,”
2009discovering the trouble in his soul, and not indeed venturing to say openly, “I am
offended,” but requiring that by His interpretation he should be freed from his perplexity;
wherefore also he was reproved.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall
be rooted up.”</p>
<p>This, they that are diseased with the Manichæan pest affirm to be spoken of the law;
but their months are stopped by what had been said before. For if He was speaking of the
law, how doth He further back defend it, and fight for it, saying, “Why do ye transgress the

commandments of God for your tradition?” And how doth He bring for ward the prophet?
But of themselves and of their traditions He so speaks. For if God said, “Honor thy father
and thy mother,” how is not that of God’s planting, which was spoken by God?</p>
<p>And what follows also indicates, that of themselves it was said, and of their traditions.
Thus He added, “They are blind leaders of the blind.” Whereas, had He spoken it of the law,
He would have said, “It is a blind leader of the blind.” But not so did He speak, but, “They
are blind leaders of the blind:” freeing it from the blame, and bringing it all round upon
them.</p>
<p>Then to sever the people also from them, as being on the point of falling into a pit by
their means, He saith, “If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”</p>
<p>It is a great evil merely to be blind, but to be in such a case and have none to lead him,
nay, to occupy the place of a guide, is a double and triple ground of censure. For if it be a
dangerous thing for the blind man not to have a guide, much more so that he should even
desire to be guide to another.</p>
<p>What then saith Peter? He saith not, “What can this be which Thou hast said?” but as
though it were full of obscurity, he puts his question. And he saith not, “Why hast thou
spoken contrary to the law?” for he was afraid, lest he should be thought to have taken offense,
but asserts it to be obscure. However, that it was not obscure, but that he was offended, is
manifest, for it had nothing of obscurity.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He rebukes him, saying, “Are ye also yet without understanding?”2010
For as to the multitude, they did not perhaps so much as understand the saying; but themselves
were the persons offended. Wherefore, whereas at first, as though asking in behalf of
the Pharisees, they were desirous to be told; when they heard Him denouncing a great threat,
and saying, “Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up,”
and, “They are blind leaders of the blind,” they were silenced. But he, always ardent, not
even so endures to hold his peace, but saith, “Declare unto us this parable.”2011</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? With a sharp rebuke He answers, “Are ye also yet without understanding?
Do ye not yet understand?”</p>
<p>But these things He said, and reproved them, in order to cast out their prejudice; He
stopped not however at this, but adds other things also, saying, “That whatsoever entereth
in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught; but those things which
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of
the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, blasphemies, falsewitnessings:
and these are the things that defile the man: but to eat with unwashen hands
defileth not the man.”2012</p>

<p>Seest thou how sharply He deals with them, and in the way of rebuke?</p>
<p>Then He establishes His saying by our common nature, and with a view to their cure.
For when He saith, “It goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught,” he is still answering
according to the low views of the Jews. For He saith, “it abides not, but goes out:”
and what if it abode? it would not make one unclean. But not yet were they able to hear this.</p>
<p>And one may remark, that because of this the lawgiver allows just so much time, as it
may be remaining within one, but when it is gone forth, no longer. For instance, at evening
He bids you wash yourself, and so be clean; measuring the time of the digestion, and of the
excretion.2013 But the things of the heart, He saith, abide within, and when they are gone
forth they defile, and not when abiding only. And first He puts our evil thoughts, a kind of
thing which belonged to the Jews; and not as yet doth He make His refutation from the
nature of the things, but from the manner of production from the belly and the heart respectively,
and from the fact that the one sort remains, the other not; the one entering in from
without, and departing again outwards, while the others are bred2014within, and having
gone forth they defile, and then more so, when they are gone forth. Because they were not
yet able, as I said, to be taught these things with all due strictness.</p>
<p>But Mark saith, that “cleansing the meats,”2015 He spake this. He did not however express
it, nor at all say, “but to eat such and such meats defileth not the man,” for neither could
they endure to be told it by Him thus distinctly. And accordingly His conclusion was, “But
to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.”2016</p>
<p>5. Let us learn then what are the things that defile the man; let us learn, and let us flee
them. For even in the church we see such a custom prevailing amongst the generality, and
men giving diligence to come in clean garments, and to have their hands washed; but how
to present a clean soul to God, they make no account.</p>
<p>And this I say, not forbidding them to wash hands or mouth; but willing men so to wash
as is meet, not with water only, but instead of water, with all virtues. For the filth of the

mouth is evil speaking, blasphemy, reviling, angry words, filthy talking, laughter, jesting: if
then thou art conscious to thyself of uttering none of them, neither of being defiled with
this filth, draw near with confidence; but if thou hast times out of number received these
stains, why dost thou labor in vain, washing thy tongue indeed with water, but bearing about
on it such deadly and hurtful filth? For tell me, hadst thou dung on thy hands, and mire,
wouldest thou indeed venture to pray? By no means. And yet this were no hurt; but that is
ruin. How then art thou reverential in the different things, but in the forbidden remiss?</p>
<p>What then? should not we pray? saith one. We should indeed, but not while defiled,
and having upon us mire of that sort.</p>
<p>“What then, if I have been overtaken?” saith one. Cleanse thyself. “How, and in what
way?” Weep, groan, give alms, apologize to him that is affronted, reconcile him to thyself
hereby, wipe clean thy tongue, lest thou provoke God more grievously. For so if one had
filled his hands with dung, and then should lay hold of thy feet, entreating thee, far from
hearing him, thou wouldest rather spurn him with thy foot; how then durst thou in such
sort draw nigh to God? Since in truth the tongue is the hand of them that pray, and by it we
lay hold on the knees of God. Defile it not therefore, lest to thee also He say, “Though ye
make many prayers, I will not hearken.”2017 Yea, and “in the power of the tongue are death
and life;”2018and, “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned.”2019</p>
<p>I bid thee then watch thy tongue more than the apple of thine eye. The tongue is a royal
steed. If then thou put a bridle on it, and teach it to pace orderly, the King will rest and take
His seat thereon; but if thou suffer it to rush about unbridled and leap wantonly, it becomes
a beast for the devil and bad spirits to ride on. And while thou, fresh from the company of
thine own wife, darest not pray, although this is no blame at all; dost thou lift up thine hands,
fresh from reviling and insult, which brings after it no less than hell, before thou hast well
cleansed thyself? And how dost thou not shudder? tell me. Hast thou not heard Paul, saying,
“Marriage is honorable, and the bed undefiled?”2020 But if on rising from the undefiled bed,
thou darest not draw nigh in prayer, how dost thou coming from the bed of the devil call
on that awful and terrible name? For it is truly the devil’s bed, to wallow in insults and reviling.
And like some wicked adulterer, wrath dallies with us in great delight, casting into us
deadly seed, and making us give birth to diabolical enmity, and doing all things in a way
opposite to marriage. For whereas marriage causes the two to become one flesh, wrath severs
into many parts them that were united, and cleaves and cuts in pieces the very soul.</p>

<p>That thou mayest therefore with confidence draw nigh to God, receive not wrath, when
it comes in upon thee, and desires to be with thee, but drive it away like a mad dog.</p>
<p>For so Paul too commanded: his phrase being, “lifting up holy hands without wrath
and disputing.”2021 Dishonor not then thy tongue, for how will it entreat for thee, when it
hath lost its proper confidence? but adorn it with gentleness, with humility, make it worthy
of the God who is entreated, fill it with blessing, with much almsdoing. For it is possible
even with words to do alms. “For a word is a better thing than a gift,”2022and “answer the
poor man peaceably with meekness.”2023 And all the rest of thy time too adorn it with the
rehearsing of the laws of God; “Yea, let all thy communication be in the law of the Most
High.”2024</p>
<p>Having thus adorned ourselves, let us come to our King, and fall at His knees,2025not
with the body only, but also with the mind. Let us consider whom we are approaching, and
on whose behalf, and what we would accomplish. We are drawing nigh unto God, whom
the seraphim behold and turn away their faces, not bearing His brightness; at sight of whom
the earth trembles. We draw nigh unto God, “who dwelleth in the light, which no man can
approach unto.”2026 And we draw nigh unto Him for deliverance from hell, for remission
of sins, for escape from those in tolerable punishments, for attaining to the Heavens, and
to the good things that are there. Let us, I say, fall down before Him both in body and in
mind, that He may raise us up when we are down; let us converse with all gentleness and
meekness.</p>
<p>And who is so wretched and miserable, one may say, as not to become gentle in prayer?
He that prays with an imprecation, and fills himself with wrath, and cries out against his
enemies.</p>
<p>6. Nay, if thou wilt accuse, accuse thyself. If thou wilt whet and sharpen thy tongue, let
it be against thine own sins. And tell not what evil another hath done to thee, but what thou
hast done to thyself; for this is most truly an evil; since no other will really be able to injure
thee, unless thou injure thyself. Wherefore, if thou desire to be against them that wrong
thee, approach as against thyself first; there is no one to hinder; since by coming into court
against another, thou hast but the greater injury to go away with.</p>

<p>And what injury at all hast thou really to mention? That such an one insulted and spoiled
thee by violence, and encompassed thee with dangers? Nay, this is receiving not injury, but
if we be sober, the very greatest benefit; the injured being he that did such things, not he
that suffered them. And this is more than any one thing the cause of all our evils, that we
do not so much as know at all who is the injured, and who the injurious person. Since if we
knew this well, we should not ever injure ourselves, we should not pray against another,
having learnt that it is impossible to suffer ill of another. For not to be spoiled, but to spoil,
is an evil. Wherefore, if thou hast spoiled, accuse thyself; but if thou hast been spoiled, rather
pray for him that spoiled thee, because he hath done thee the greatest good. For although
the intent of the doer was not such, yet thou hast received the greatest benefit, if thou hast
endured it nobly. For him, both men, and the laws of God declare to be wretched, but thee,
the injured party, they crown, and proclaim thy praise.</p>
<p>For so if any one sick of a fever had violently taken from any other a vessel containing
water, and had had his fill of his pernicious desire, we should not say that the despoiled had
been injured, but the spoiler; for he has aggravated his fever, and made his disease more
grievous. Now in this way I bid thee reason concerning him also that loves wealth and
money. For he too, having a far worse fever than the other, has by this rapine fanned the
flame in himself.</p>
<p>Again, were some madman to snatch a sword from any one, and destroy himself, which
again is the injured? He that hath been robbed, or the robber? It is quite clear, he that did
the robbery.</p>
<p>Well then, in the case of seizing property also, let us give the same suffrage. For what a
sword is to a madman, much the same is wealth to a covetous man; nay, it is even a worse
thing. For the madman, when he has taken the sword, and thrust it through himself, is both
delivered from his madness, and hath no second blow to receive; but the lover of money
receives daily ten thousand wounds more grievous than his, without delivering himself from
his madness, but aggravating it more exceedingly: and the more wounds he receives, the
more doth he give occasion for other more grievous blows.</p>
<p>Reflecting then on these things, let us flee this sword; let us flee the madness; though
late, let us become temperate. For this virtue too ought to be called temperance, not less
than that which is used to be so called among all men. For whereas there the dominion of
one lust is to be struggled against, here we have to master many lusts, and those of all kinds.</p>
<p>Yea, nothing, nothing is more foolish2027than the slave of wealth. He thinks he overcomes
when he is overcome. He thinks he is master, when he is a slave, and putting bonds on
himself, he rejoices; making the wild beast fiercer, he is pleased; and becoming a captive, he
prides himself, and leaps for joy; and seeing a dog rabid and flying at his soul, when he ought

to bind him and weaken him by hunger, he actually supplies him with abundance of food,
that he may leap upon him more fiercely, and be more formidable.</p>
<p>Reflecting then on all these things, let us loose the bonds, let us slay the monster, let us
drive away the disease, let us cast out this madness; that we may enjoy a calm and pure
health, and having with much pleasure sailed into the serene haven, may attain unto the
eternal blessings; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, now and always, and world without end.

<p>Matt. XV. 21, 22.</p>
<p>“And Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman
of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto Him,2028saying, Have mercy on
me, O Lord, Thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.”</p>
<p>But Mark saith, that “He could not be hid,”2029though He had entered into the house.
And why did He go at all into these parts? When He had set them free from the observance
of meats, then to the Gentiles also He goes on to open a door, proceeding in due course;
even as Peter, having been first directed to annul this law, is sent to Cornelius.2030</p>
<p>But if any one should say, “How then, while saying to His disciples, “Go not into the
way of the Gentiles,”2031doth He Himself admit her?” first, this would be our reply, that
what He enjoined upon His disciples, He was not Himself also tied to; secondly, that not in
order to preach did He depart; which indeed Mark likewise intimating said, He even hid
Himself, yet was not concealed.</p>
<p>For as His not hastening to them first was a part of the regular course of His proceedings,
so to drive them away when coming to Him was unworthy of His love to man. For if the
flying ought to be pursued, much more ought the pursuing not to be avoided.
See at any rate how worthy this woman is of every benefit. For she durst not even come
to Jerusalem, fearing, and accounting herself unworthy. For were it not for this, she would
have come there, as is evident both from her present earnestness, and from her coming out
of her own coasts.</p>
<p>And some also taking it as an allegory say, that when Christ came out of Judea, then the
church ventured to approach Him, coming out herself also from her own coasts. For it is
said, “Forget thine own people and thy father’s house.”2032 For both Christ went out of His
borders, and the woman out of her borders, and so it became possible for them to fall in
with each other: thus He saith, “Behold a woman of Canaan coming out of her own coasts.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2028 [R.V., “And Jesus went out thence and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a
Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried.” But Chrysostom agrees with the rec. text, in
adding “unto Him.” There is some doubt as to the correct form of the Greek verb rendered “cried,” both in the
New Testament and in Chrysostom’s text.—R.]</note>

<pb n="568"/>
<p>The evangelist speaks against the woman, that he may show forth her marvellous act,
and celebrate her praise the more. For when thou hearest of a Canaanitish woman, thou
shouldest call to mind those wicked nations, who overset from their foundations the very
laws of nature. And being reminded of these, consider also the power of Christ’s advent.
For they who were cast out, that they might not pervert any Jews, these appeared so much
better disposed than the Jews, as even to come out of their coasts, and approach Christ;
while those were driving Him away, even on His coming unto them.</p>
<p>2. Having then come unto Him, she saith nothing else, but “Have mercy on me,” and
by her cry brings about them many spectators. For indeed it was a pitiful spectacle to see a
woman crying aloud in so great affliction, and that woman a mother, and entreating for a
daughter, and for a daughter in such evil case: she not even venturing to bring into the
Master’s sight her that was possessed, but leaving her to lie at home, and herself making the
entreaty.</p>
<p>And she tells her affliction only, and adds nothing more; neither doth she drag the
physician to her house, like that nobleman, saying, “Come and lay thy hand upon her,” and,
“Come down ere my child die.”2033</p>
<p>But having described both her calamity, and the intensity of the disease, she pleads the
Lord’s mercy, and cries aloud; and she saith not, “Have mercy on my daughter,” but, “Have
mercy on me.” For she indeed is insensible of her disease, but it is I that suffer her innumerable
woes; my disease is with consciousness, my madness with perception of itself.</p>
<p>2. “But He answered her not a word.”2034</p>
<p>What is this new and strange thing? the Jews in their perverseness He leads on, and
blaspheming He entreats them, and tempting Him He dismisses them not; but to her, running
unto Him, and entreating, and beseeching Him, to her who had been educated neither in
the law, nor in the prophets, and was exhibiting so great reverence; to her He doth not
vouchsafe so much as an answer.</p>
<p>Whom would not this have offended, seeing the facts so opposite to the report? For
whereas they had heard, that He went about the villages healing, her, when she had come
to Him, He utterly repels. And who would not have been moved by her affliction, and by
the supplication she made for her daughter in such evil case? For not as one worthy, nor as
demanding a due, not so did she approach Him, but she entreated that she might find mercy,
and merely gave a lamentable account of her own affliction; yet is she not counted worthy
of so much as an answer.</p>
<note type="footnote">2033 See John iv. 49, and comp. Matt. ix. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">2034 Matt. xv. 23.</note>

<pb n="569"/>
<p>Perhaps many of the hearers were offended, but she was not offended. And why say I,
of the hearers? For I suppose that even the very disciples must have been in some degree
affected at the woman’s affliction, and have been greatly troubled, and out of heart.</p>
<p>Nevertheless not even in this trouble did they venture to say, “Grant her this favor,”
but, “His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us.”
For we too, when we wish to persuade any one, oftentimes say the contrary.</p>
<p>But Christ saith, “I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”2035</p>
<p>What then did the woman, after she heard this? Was she silent, and did she desist? or
did she relax her earnestness? By no means, but she was the more instant. But it is not so
with us; rather, when we fail to obtain, we desist; whereas it ought to make us the more urgent.</p>
<p>And yet, who would not have been driven to perplexity by the word which was then
spoken? Why His silence were enough to drive her to despair, but His answer did so very
much more. For together with herself, to see them also in utter perplexity that were pleading
with her, and to hear that the thing is even impossible to be done, was enough to cast her
into unspeakable perplexity.</p>
<p>Yet nevertheless the woman was not perplexed, but on seeing her advocates prevail
nothing, she made herself shameless with a goodly shamelessness.</p>
<p>For whereas before this she had not ventured so much as to come in sight (for “she crieth,”
it is said, “after us”), when one might expect that she should rather depart further off
in utter despair, at that very time she comes nearer, and worships, saying, “Lord, help
me.”2036</p>
<p>What is this, O woman? Hast thou then greater confidence than the apostles? more
abundant strength? “Confidence and strength,” saith she, “by no means; nay, I am even full
of shame. Yet nevertheless my very shamelessness do I put forward for entreaty; He will
respect my confidence.” And what is this? Heardest thou not Him saying, “I am not sent
but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel?” “I heard,” saith she, “but He Himself is Lord.”
Wherefore neither did she say, “Entreat and beseech,” but, “Help me.”</p>
<p>3. What then saith Christ? Not even with all this was He satisfied, but He makes her
perplexity yet more intense again, saying,</p>
<p>“It is not meet to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the dogs.”2037</p>
<p>And when He vouchsafed her a word, then He smote her more sharply than by His silence.
And no longer doth He refer the cause to another, nor say, “I am not sent,” but the
more urgent she makes her entreaty, so much the more doth He also urge His denial. And
He calls them no longer “sheep,” but “children,” and her “a dog.”</p>

<pb n="570"/>
<p>What then saith the woman? Out of His own very words she frames her plea. “Why,
though I be a dog,” said she, “I am not an alien.”</p>
<p>Justly did Christ say, “For judgment am I come.”2038 The woman practises high selfcommand,
and shows forth all endurance and faith, and this, receiving insult; but they,
courted and honored, requite it with the contrary.</p>
<p>For, “that food is necessary for the children,” saith she, “I also know; yet neither am I
forbidden, being a dog. For were it unlawful to receive, neither would it be lawful to partake
of the crumbs; but if, though in scanty measure, they ought to be partakers, neither am I
forbidden, though I be a dog; nay, rather on this ground am I most surely a partaker, if I
am a dog.”</p>
<p>With this intent did Christ put her off, for He knew she would say this; for this did He
deny the grant, that He might exhibit her high self-command.</p>
<p>For if He had not meant to give, neither would He have given afterwards, nor would
He have stopped her mouth again. But as He doth in the case of the centurion, saying, “I
will come and heal him,”2039that we might learn the godly fear of that man, and might hear
him say, “I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof;”2040and as He doth
in the case of her that had the issue of blood, saying, “I perceive that virtue hath gone out
of me,”2041that He might make her faith manifest; and as in the case of the Samaritan woman,
that He might show how not even upon reproof she desists:2042so also here, He would not
that so great virtue in the woman should be hid. Not in insult then were His words spoken,
but calling her forth, and revealing the treasure laid up in her.</p>
<p>But do thou, I pray thee, together with her faith see also her humility. For He had called
the Jews “children,” but she was not satisfied with this, but even called them “masters;” so
far was she from grieving at the praises of others.</p>
<p>“Why, the dogs also,”2043saith she, “eat of the crumbs that fall from their master’s
table.”2044</p>
<p>Seest thou the woman’s wisdom, how she did not venture so much as to say a word
against it, nor was stung by other men’s praises, nor was indignant at the reproach? Seest
thou her constancy? He said, “It is not meet,” and she said, “Truth, Lord;” He called them

“children,” but she “masters;” He used the name of a dog, but she added also the dog’s act.
Seest thou this woman’s humility?</p>
<p>Hear the proud language of the Jews. “We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in
bondage to any man;”2045and, “We be born of God.”2046 But not so this woman, rather she
calls herself a dog, and them masters; so for this she became a child. What then saith Christ?
“O woman, great is thy faith.”2047</p>
<p>Yea, therefore did He put her off, that He might proclaim aloud this saying, that He
might crown the woman.</p>
<p>“Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” Now what He saith is like this: “Thy faith indeed is
able to effect even greater things than these; nevertheless, Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.”</p>
<p>This was akin to that voice that said, “Let the Heaven be, and it was.”2048</p>
<p>“And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how this woman too contributed not a little to the healing of her daughter?
For to this purpose neither did Christ say, “Let thy little daughter be made whole,” but,
“Great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt;” to teach thee that the words were not
used at random, nor were they flattering words, but great was the power of her faith.</p>
<p>The certain test, however, and demonstration thereof, He left to the issue of events. Her
daughter accordingly was straightway healed.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how when the apostles had failed, and had not succeeded,
this woman had success. So great a thing is assiduity in prayer. Yea, He had even rather be
solicited by us, guilty as we are, for those who belong to us, than by others in our behalf.
And yet they had more liberty to speak; but she exhibited much endurance.</p>
<p>And by the issue He also excused Himself to His disciples for the delay, and showed
that with reason He had not assented to their request.</p>
<p>4. “And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went
up into the mountain, and sat down there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having
with them those that were lame, blind, maimed, dumb; and cast them2049at His feet; and
He healed them, insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak,
the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see, and they glorified the God
of Israel.”2050</p>

<pb n="572"/>
<p>Now He goes about Himself, now sits awaiting the diseased, and hath the lame brought
up unto the mountain. And no longer do they touch so much as His garment, but advance
a higher step, being cast at His feet: and they showed their faith doubly, first, by going up
into the mountain though lame, then by wanting nothing else but to be cast at His feet only.</p>
<p>And great was the marvel and strange, to see them that were carried walking, the blind
needing not any to lead them by the hand. Yea, both the multitude of the healed, and the
facility of their cure amazed them.</p>
<p>Seest thou, how the woman indeed He healed with so much delay, but these immediately?
not because these are better than she is, but because she is more faithful than they. Therefore,
while in her case He defers and delays, to manifest her constancy; on these He bestows the
gift immediately, stopping the mouths of the unbelieving Jews, and cutting away from them
every plea. For the greater favors one hath received, so much the more is he liable to punish-
ment, if he be insensible, and the very honor make him no better. Therefore you see the
rich also proving wicked, are more punished than the poor, for not being softened even by
their prosperity. For tell me not that they gave alms. Since if they gave not in proportion to
their substance, not even so shall they escape; our alms being judged not by the measure of
our gifts, but by the largeness2051of our mind. But if these suffer punishment, much more
they that are eager about unnecessary things; who build houses of two and three stories, but
despise the hungry; who give heed to covetousness, but neglect alms-giving.</p>
<p>5. But since the discourse hath fallen on almsgiving, come then, let us resume again today
that argument, which I was making three days ago concerning benevolence, and left
unfinished. Ye remember, when lately I was speaking of vanity about your shoes, and of
that empty trouble, and the luxury of the young, that it was from almsgiving that our discourse
passed on to those charges against you. What were the matters then at that time
brought forward? That almsgiving is a kind of art, having its workshop in Heaven, and for
its teacher, not man, but God. Then inquiring what is an art, and what not an art, we came
upon fruitless labors, and evil devices, amongst which we made mention also of this art
concerning men’s shoes.</p>
<p>Have ye then recalled it to mind? Come now, let us to-day also resume what we then
said, and let us show how almsgiving is an art, and better than all arts. For if the peculiarity
of art is to issue in something useful, and nothing is more useful than almsgiving, very
evidently this is both an art, and better than all arts. For it makes for us not shoes, nor doth
it weave garments, nor build houses that are of clay; but it procures life everlasting, and
snatches us from the hands of death, and in either life shows us glorious, and builds the
mansions that are in Heaven, and those eternal tabernacles.</p>
<note type="footnote">2051 δαψιλε.</note>

<pb n="573"/>
<p>This suffers not our lamps to go out, nor that we should appear at the marriage having
filthy garments, but washes them, and renders them purer than snow. “For though your
sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.”2052not send them away fasting, lest they
faint in the way.”</p>
<p>Both above, when going to do this miracle, He first healed them that were maimed in
body, and here He doth the self-same thing; from the healing of the blind and the lame, He
goes on to this again.</p>
<p>But why might it be, that then His disciples said, “Send away the multitude,” but now
they said not so; and this, though three days had past? Either being themselves improved
by this time, or seeing that the people had no great sense of hunger; for they were glorifying
God for the things that were done.</p>
<p>But see how in this instance too He doth not proceed at once to the miracle, but calls
them forth thereunto. For the multitudes indeed who had come out for healing durst not
ask for the loaves; but He, the benevolent and provident one, gives even to them that ask
not, and saith unto His disciples, “I have compassion, and will not send them away fasting.”</p>
<p>For lest they should say that they came having provisions for the way, He saith, “They
continue with me now three days;” so that even if they came having any, it is all spent. For
therefore He Himself did not this on the first and second day, but when all had been consumed
by them, in order that having first been in want, they might more eagerly accept His
work.</p>
<p>Therefore He saith, “Lest they faint in the way;” implying both their distance to be great,
and that they had nothing left.</p>
<p>“Then, if thou art not willing to send them away fasting, wherefore dost thou not work
the miracle?” That by this question and by their answer He might make the disciples more
heedful, and that they might show forth their faith, coming unto Him, and saying, “Make
loaves.”</p>
<p>But not even so did they understand the motive of His question; wherefore afterwards
He saith to them, as Mark relates, “Are your hearts so hardened? Having eyes, see ye not?
and having ears, hear ye not?”2053</p>
<p>Since, if this were not so, wherefore doth He speak to the disciples, and signify the
multitude’s worthiness to receive a benefit, and add also the pity He Himself feels?</p>
<p>But Matthew saith, that after this He also rebuked them, saying, “O ye of little faith, do
ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many
<note type="footnote">2052 θλω.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2053 Mark viii. 17, 18.</note>

<pb n="574"/>
baskets ye took up? nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye
took up?”2054 So completely do the evangelists harmonize one with another.</p>
<p>What then say the disciples? Still they creep on the ground, although He had done so
very many things in order that that miracle might be kept in memory; as by His question,
and by the answer, and by making them minister herein, and by distributing the baskets;
but their state of mind was yet rather imperfect.</p>
<p>Wherefore also they say to Him, “Whence should we have so many loaves in the wilderness?”
2055</p>
<p>Both before this, and now, they make mention of the wilderness; themselves in a weak
way of argument so speaking, yet even hereby putting the miracle above suspicion. That is,
lest any should affirm (as I have indeed already said), that they obtained it from some
neighboring village, the place is acknowledged, that the miracle may be believed. With this
view, both the former miracle and this He works in a wilderness, at a great distance from
the villages.</p>
<p>The disciples, considering none of all this, said, “Whence should we have so many loaves
in a wilderness?” For they thought verily He had said it as purposing next to enjoin them
to feed the people; most foolishly; since with this intent He had said, and that lately, “Give
ye them to eat,”2056that He might bring them to an urgent need of entreating Him.</p>
<p>But now He saith not this, “Give ye them to eat,” but what? “I have compassion on them,
and will not send them away fasting;” bringing the disciples nearer, and provoking them
more, and granting them clearer sight, to ask these things of Him. For in truth they were
the words of one signifying that He hath power not to send them away fasting; of one
manifesting His authority. For the expression, “I will not,” implies such a purpose in Him.</p>
<p>2. Since however they still spake of the multitude merely, and the place, and the wilderness
(for “whence,” it is said, “should we have in a wilderness so many loaves, as to fill so
great a multitude”?); and not even so understood what He said, He proceeds to contribute
His own part, and saith unto them,</p>
<p>“How many loaves have ye? And they say, Seven, and a few little fishes.”2057</p>
<p>And they no more say, “But what are these among so many?”2058as they had said before.
So that although they reached not His whole meaning, yet nevertheless they became higher
by degrees. For so He too, arousing their mind hereby, puts the question much as He had

<pb n="575"/>
done before, that by the very form of the inquiry He might remind them of the works already
done.</p>
<p>But as thou hast seen their imperfection hereby, so do thou observe the severity of their
spirit, and admire their love of truth, how, writing themselves, they conceal not their own
defects, great as they were. For it was no small blame to have presently forgotten this miracle,
which had so recently taken place; wherefore they are also rebuked.</p>
<p>And herewith consider also their strictness in another matter, how they were conquerors
of their appetite; how disciplined to make little account of their diet. For being in the wilderness
and abiding there three days, they had seven loaves.</p>
<p>Now all the rest He doth as on the former occasion; thus He both makes them sit down
on the ground, and He makes the loaves multiply themselves in the hands of the disciples.</p>
<p>For, “He commanded,” it is said, “the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He
took the seven loaves, and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to His disciples,
and the disciples to the multitude.”2059</p>
<p>But when we come to the end, there is a difference.</p>
<p>For, “they did all eat,” so it is said, “and were filled, and they took up of the broken meat
that was left,2060seven baskets full. And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides
women and children.”2061</p>
<p>But why at the former time, when there were five thousand, did twelve baskets full remain
over and above, whereas here, when there were four thousand, it was seven baskets full? For
what purpose, I say, and by what cause, were the remnants less, the guests not being so
many?</p>
<p>Either then one may say this, that the baskets on this last occasion2062were greater than
those used before,2063or if this were not so, lest the equality of the miracle should again cast
them into forgetfulness, He rouses their recollection by the difference, that by the variation
they might be reminded of both one and the other. Accordingly, in that case, He makes the
baskets full of fragments equal in number to His disciples, in this, the other baskets equal
to the loaves; indicating even hereby His unspeakable power, and the ease wherewith He
exercised His authority, in that it was possible for Him to work such miracles, both in this

way and in the other. For neither was it of small power, to maintain the exact number, both
then and now; then when there were five thousand, now when there were four thousand;
and not suffer the remnants to be more than the baskets used on the one occasion or on the
other, although the number of the guests was different.</p>
<p>And the end again was like the former. For as then He left the multitude and withdrew
in a ship, so also now; and John also saith this.2064 For since no sign did so work upon them
to follow Him, as the miracle of the loaves; and they were minded not only to follow Him,
but also to make Him a king;2065avoiding all suspicion of usurping royalty, He hastens away
after this work of wonder: and He doth not even go away afoot, lest they should follow Him,
but by entering into a ship.</p>
<p>“And He sent away the multitudes,” so it saith, “and went on board the ship, and came
into the coasts of Magdala.”2066</p>
<p>3. “And the Pharisees and Sadducees came and2067desired Him to show them a sign
from Heaven. But He saith, When it is evening, ye say, Fair weather, for the sky is red; and
in the morning, Foul weather today, for the sky is red and lowering. Ye can discern the face
of the sky, but can ye not the signs of the times?2068 A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
And He left them, and departed.”2069</p>
<p>But Mark saith, that when they were come unto Him, and were questioning with Him,
“He sighed deeply in His spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign?”2070</p>
<p>And yet surely their inquiry was deserving of anger and great displeasure; yet nevertheless
the benevolent and provident One is not angry, but pities and bewails them as incurably
diseased, and after so full a demonstration of His power, tempting Him.</p>
<p>For not in order to believe did they seek, but to lay hold of Him. Since had they come
unto Him as ready to believe, He would have given it. For He who said to the woman, “It
is not meet,”2071and afterwards gave, much more would He have shown His bounty to these.</p>
<p>But since they did not seek to believe, therefore He also calls them hypocrites, because
in another place they said one thing, and meant another. Yea, had they believed, they would

not even have asked. And from another thing too it is evident that they believed not; that
when reproved and exposed, they abode not with Him, nor said, “We are ignorant and seek
to learn.”</p>
<p>But for what sign from Heaven were they asking? Either that He should say the sun, or
curb the moon, or bring down thunderbolts, or work a change in the air, or some other such
thing.</p>
<p>What then saith He to all this? “Ye can discern the face of the sky, but can ye not discern
the signs of the times?”2072 See His meekness and moderation. For not even as before did
He refuse merely, and say, “There shall none be given them,” but He states also the cause
why He gives it not, even though they were not asking for information.</p>
<p>What then was the cause? “Much as in the sky,” saith He, “one thing is a sign of a storm,
another of fair weather, and no one when he saw the sign of foul weather would seek for a
calm, neither in calm and fair weather for a storm; so should you reckon with regard to me
also. For this present time of my coming, is different from that which is to come. Now there
is need of these signs which are on the earth, but those in Heaven are stored up against that
time. Now as a physician am I come, then I shall be here as a judge; now to seek that which
is gone astray, then to demand an account. Therefore in a hidden manner am I come, but
then with much publicity, folding up the heaven, hiding the sun, not suffering the moon to
give her light. Then ‘the very powers of the heavens shall be shaken,’2073and the manifestation
of my coming shall imitate lightning that appears at once to all.2074 But not now is the time
for these signs; for I am come to die, and to suffer all extremities.”</p>
<p>Heard ye not the prophet, saying, “He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall His voice
be heard without?”2075and another again, “He shall come down as rain upon a fleece of
wool?”2076</p>
<p>And if men speak of the signs in Pharaoh’s time, there was an enemy then from whom
deliverance was needed, and it all took place in due course. But to Him that came among
friends there was no need of those signs.</p>
<p>“And besides, how shall I give the great signs, when the little are not believed?” Little,
I mean, as regards display, since in power these latter were much greater than the former.
For what could be equal to remitting sins, and raising the dead, and driving away devils,
and creating a body, and ordering all other things aright?</p>

<p>But do thou see their hardened heart, how on being told, that “no sign should be given
them but the sign of the prophet Jonas,” they do not ask. And yet, knowing both the
prophet, and all that befell him, and having been told this a second time, they ought to have
inquired and learnt what the saying could mean; but, as I said, there is no desire of information
in these their doings. For this cause “He also left them, and departed.”</p>
<p>4. “And when His disciples,” so it is said, “were come to the other side, they forgot to
take bread. Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
and of the Sadducees.”2077</p>
<p>And why said He not plainly, Beware of their teaching? His will is to remind them of
what had been done, for He knew they had forgotten. But for accusing them at once there
seemed to be no reasonable ground, but to take the occasion from themselves, and so to
reprove them, would make the charge admissible. “And why did He not then reprove them,
when they said, ‘Whence should we have so many loaves in the wilderness?’ for it seemed
a good time then to say what He says here.” That He might not seem to rush hastily on the
miracle. And besides, He would not blame them before the multitude, nor seek honor in
their presence. And now too the accusation had greater reason, for that after repetition of
the miracle they were so minded.</p>
<p>Wherefore also He works another miracle, and then and not till then He reproves; I
mean, He brings forward what they were reasoning in their hearts. But what were their
reasonings? “Because,” so it is said, “we have taken no bread.”2078 For as yet they were full
of trepidation about the purifications of the Jews, and the observances of meats.</p>
<p>Wherefore on all accounts He attacks them even with severity, saying, “Why reason ye
in yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have brought no bread?2079 Perceive ye not yet,
neither understand? Have ye your heart hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? Having ears,
hear ye not?2080 Do ye not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up? neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets
ye took up?”2081</p>
<p>Seest thou intense displeasure? For nowhere else doth He appear to have so rebuked
them. Wherefore then doth He so? In order again to cast out their prejudice about the meats.
I mean that with this view, whereas then He had only said, “Perceive ye not, neither understand?”
in this place, and with a strong rebuke, He saith, “O ye of little faith.”2082</p>

<p>For not everywhere is lenity a good thing. And as He used to allow them freedom of
speech, so doth He also reprove, by this variety providing for their salvation. And mark
thou at once His reproof, how strong, and His mildness. For all but excusing Himself to
them for His severe reproofs to them, He saith, “Do ye not yet consider the five loaves, and
how many baskets ye took up; and the seven loaves, and how many baskets ye took up?”
And to this end He sets down also the numbers, as well of the persons fed as of the fragments,
at once both bringing them to recollection of the past, and making them more attentive to
the future.</p>
<p>And to teach thee how great the power of His reproof, and how it roused up their
slumbering mind, hear what saith the evangelist. For Jesus having said no more, but having
reproved them, and added this only, “How is it that ye do not understand, that I spake it
not to you concerning bread that ye should beware, but of the leaven of the Pharisees and
Sadducees;”2083 He subjoined, saying, “Then understood they that He bade them not beware
of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees,”2084although He
had not uttered that interpretation.</p>
<p>See how much good His reproof wrought. For it both led them away from the Jewish
observances, and when they were remiss, made them more heedful, and delivered them
from want of faith;2085</p>
<p>Wherefore hath he mentioned the founder of the city? Because there was another besides,
Cæsarea Stratonis. But not in that, but in this doth He ask them, leading them far away from
the Jews, so that being freed from all alarm, they might speak with boldness all that was in
their mind.</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not ask them at once their own opinion, but that of the people?
In order that when they had told the people’s opinion, and then were asked, “But
whom2086say ye that I am?” by the manner of His inquiry they might be led up to a sublimer
notion, and not fall into the same low view as the multitude. Accordingly He asks them not
at all in the beginning of His preaching, but when He had done many miracles, and had
discoursed with them of many and high doctrines, and had afforded so many clear proofs
of His Godhead, and of His unanimity with the Father, then He puts this question to them.</p>
<p>And He said not, “Whom say the Scribes and Pharisees that I am?” often as these had
come unto Him, and discoursed with Him; but, “Whom do men say that I am?” inquiring

after the judgment of the people, as unbiassed. For though it was far meaner than it should
be, yet was it free from malice, but the other was teeming with much wickedness.</p>
<p>And signifying how earnestly He desires His Economy2087to be confessed, He saith,
“The Son of Man;” thereby denoting His Godhead, which He doth also in many other places.
For He saith, “No man hath ascended up to Heaven, but the Son of Man, which is in Heaven.”
2088 And again, “But when ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up, where He was before.”</p>
<p>Then, since they said, “Some John the Baptist, some Elias, some Jeremias, or one of the
prophets,”2090and set forth their mistaken opinion, He next added, “But whom say ye that
I am?”2091calling them on by His second inquiry to entertain some higher imagination
concerning Him, and indicating that their former judgment falls exceedingly short of His
dignity. Wherefore He seeks for another judgment from themselves, and puts a second
question, that they might not fall in with the multitude, who, because they saw His miracles
greater than human, accounted Him a man indeed, but one that had appeared after a resurrection,
as Herod also said.2092 But He, to lead them away from this notion, saith, “But
whom say ye that I am?” that is, “ye that are with me always, and see me working miracles,
and have yourselves done many mighty works by me.”</p>
<p>2. What then saith the mouth of the apos tles, Peter, the ever fervent, the leader of the
apostolic choir?2093 When all are asked, he answers. And whereas when He asked the
opinion of the people, all replied to the question; when He asked their own, Peter springs
forward, and anticipates them, and saith, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”2094</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it unto thee.”2095</p>
<p>Yet surely unless he had rightly confessed Him, as begotten of the very Father Himself,
this were no work of revelation; had he accounted our Lord to be one of the many, his saying
was not worthy of a blessing. Since before this also they said, “Truly He is Son of
God,”2096those, I mean, who were in the vessel after the tempest, which they saw, and were

not blessed, although of course they spake truly. For they confessed not such a Sonship as
Peter, but accounted Him to be truly Son as one of the many, and though peculiarly so
beyond the many, yet not of the same substance.</p>
<p>And Nathanael too said, “Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel;”
2097and so far from being blessed, he is even reproved by Him, as having said what
was far short of the truth. He replied at least, “Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the
fig-tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.”2098</p>
<p>Why then is this man blessed? Because he acknowledged Him very Son. Wherefore you
see, that while in those former instances He had said no such thing, in this case He also
signifies who had revealed it. That is, lest his words might seem to the many (because he
was an earnest lover of Christ) to be words of friendship and flattery, and of a disposition
to show favor to Him, he brings forward the person who had made them ring2099in his soul;
to inform thee that Peter indeed spake, but the Father suggested, and that thou mightest
believe the saying to be no longer a human opinion, but a divine doctrine.</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He not Himself declare it, nor say, “I am the Christ,” but by His
question establish this, bringing them in to confess it? Because so to do was both more
suitable to Him, yea necessary at that time, and it drew them on the more to the belief of
the things that were said.</p>
<p>Seest thou how the Father reveals the Son, how the Son the Father? For “neither knoweth
any man the Father,” saith He, “save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
Him.”2100 It cannot therefore be that one should learn the Son of any other than of the
Father; neither that one should learn the Father of any other than of the Son. So that even
hereby, their sameness of honor and of substance is manifest.</p>
<p>3. What then saith Christ? “Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called
Cephas.”2101“Thus since thou hast proclaimed my Father, I too name him that begat thee;”
all but saying, “As thou art son of Jonas, even so am I of my Father.” Else it were superfluous
to say, “Thou art Son of Jonas;” but since he had said, “Son of God,” to point out that He is
so Son of God, as the other son of Jonas, of the same substance with Him that begat Him,
therefore He added this, “And I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I
build my Church;”2102that is, on the faith of his confession. Hereby He signifies that many
were now on the point of believing, and raises his spirit, and makes him a shepherd. “And

the gates of hell2103shall not prevail against it.” “And if not against it, much more not against
me. So be not troubled because thou art shortly to hear that I shall be betrayed and crucified.”</p>
<p>Then He mentions also another honor. “And I also2104will give thee the keys of the
heavens.”2105 But what is this, “And I also will give thee?” “As the Father hath given thee
to know me, so will I also give thee.”</p>
<p>And He said not, “I will entreat the Father” (although the manifestation of His authority
was great, and the largeness of the gift unspeakable), but, “I will give thee.” What dost Thou
give? tell me. “The keys of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be
bound in Heaven,2106and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.”
How then is it not “His to give to sit on His right hand, and on His left,”2107when He saith,
“I will give thee”?</p>
<p>Seest thou how He, His own self, leads Peter on to high thoughts of Him, and reveals
Himself, and implies that He is Son of God by these two promises? For those things which
are peculiar to God alone, (both to absolve sins, and to make the church in capable of
overthrow in such assailing waves, and to exhibit a man that is a fisher more solid than any
rock, while all the world is at war with him), these He promises Himself to give; as the
Father, speaking to Jeremiah, said, He would make him as “a brazen pillar, and as a
wall;”2108but him to one nation only, this man in every part of the world.</p>
<p>I would fain inquire then of those who desire to lessen the dignity of the Son, which
manner of gifts were greater, those which the Father gave to Peter, or those which the Son
gave him? For the Father gave to Peter the revelation of the Son; but the Son gave him to
sow that of the Father and that of Himself in every part of the world; and to a mortal man
He entrusted the authority over all things in Heaven, giving him the keys; who extended
the church to every part of the world, and declared it to be stronger than heaven. “For
heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.”2109 How then is He
less, who hath given such gifts, hath effected such things?</p>
<p>And these things I say, not dividing the works of Father and Son (“for all things are
made by Him, and without Him was nothing made which was made”):2110but bridling the
shameless tongue of them that dare so to speak.</p>

<p>But see, throughout all, His authority: “I say unto thee, Thou art Peter; I will build the
Church; I will give thee the keys of Heaven.”2111</p>
<p>4. And then, when He had so said, “He charged them that they should tell no man that
He was the Christ.”2112</p>
<p>And why did He charge them? That when the things which offend are taken out of the
way, and the cross is accomplished, and the rest of His sufferings fulfilled, and when there
is nothing any more to interrupt and disturb the faith of the people in Him, the right opinion
concerning Him may be engraven pure and immovable in the mind of the hearers. For, in
truth, His power had not yet clearly shone forth. Accordingly it was His will then to be
preached by them, when both the plain truth of the facts, and the power of His deeds were
pleading in support of the assertions of the apostles. For it was by no means the same thing
to see Him in Palestine, now working miracles, and now insulted and persecuted (and especially
when the very cross was presently to follow the miracles that were happening); and
to behold him everywhere in the world, adored and believed, and no more suffering anything,
such as He had suffered.</p>
<p>Therefore He bids them “tell no man.” For that which hath been once rooted and then
plucked up, would hardly, if planted, again be retained among the many; but that which,
once fixed, hath remained immovable, and hath suffered injury from no quarter, easily
mounts up, and advances to a greater growth.</p>
<p>And if they who had enjoyed the benefit of many miracles, and had had part in so many
unutterable mysteries, were offended by the mere hearing of it; or rather not these only, but
even the leader2113of them all, Peter; consider what it was likely the common sort should
feel, being first told that He is the Son of God, then seeing Him even crucified and spit upon,
and that without knowledge of the secret of those mysteries, or participation in the gift of
the Holy Ghost. For if to His disciples He said, “I have many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now;”2114much more would the rest of the people have utterly failed, had
the chiefest of these mysteries been revealed to them before the proper time. Accordingly
He forbids them to tell.</p>
<p>And to instruct thee how great a thing it was, their afterwards learning His doctrine
complete, when the things that offend had passed by; learn it from this same leader of theirs.
For this very Peter, he who after so many miracles proved so weak as even to deny Him,
and to be in fear of a mean damsel; after the cross had come forth, and he had received the
certain proofs of the resurrection, and there was nothing more to offend and trouble him,

retained the teaching of the Spirit so immovable, that more vehemently than a lion he sprang
upon the people of the Jews, for all the dangers and innumerable deaths which were
threatened.</p>
<p>With reason then did He bid them not tell the many before the crucifixion, since not
even to them that were to teach did He venture to commit all before the crucifixion. “For I
have many things to say unto you,” saith He, “but ye cannot bear them now.”</p>
<p>And of the things too that He did say, they do not understand many, which He did not
make plain before the crucifixion. At least when He was risen from the dead, then and not
before they knew some of His sayings.</p>
<p>5. “From that time forth began He to show unto them that He must suffer.2115 From
that time.” What time? When He had fixed the doctrine in them; when He had brought in
the beginning of the Gentiles.2116</p>
<p>But not even so did they understand what He said. “For the saying,” it is said, “was hid
from them;”2117and they were as in a kind of perplexity, not knowing that He must rise
again. Therefore He rather dwells on the difficulties, and enlarges His discourse, that He
may open their mind, and they may understand what it can be that He speaks of.</p>
<p>“But they understood not, but the saying was hid from them, and they feared to ask
this;”2118not whether He should die, but how, and in what manner, and what this mystery
could be. For they did not even know what was this same rising again, and supposed it much
better not to die. Therefore, the rest being troubled and in perplexity, Peter again, in his
ardor, alone ventures to discourse of these things; and not even he openly, but when he had
taken Him apart; that is, having separated himself from the rest of the disciples; and he saith,
“Be it far from Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee.”2119 What ever is this? He that obtained
a revelation, he that was blessed, hath he so soon fallen away, and suffered overthrow,
so as to fear His passion? And what marvel, that one who had not on these points received
any revelation, should have that feeling? Yea, to inform thee that not of himself did he speak
those other things either, see in these matters that were not revealed to him how he is confounded
and overthrown, and being told ten thousand times, knows not what the saying
can mean.</p>
<p>For that He is Son of God he had learnt, but what the mystery of the cross and of the
resurrection might be, was not yet manifest to him: for “the saying,” it is said, “was hid from
them.”</p>

<p>Seest thou that with just cause He bade them not declare it to the rest? For if it so confounded
them, who must needs be made aware of it, what would not all others have felt?</p>
<p>6. He however, to signify that He is far from coming to the passion against His will,
both rebuked Peter, and called him Satan.</p>
<p>Let them hear, as many as are ashamed of the suffering of the cross of Christ. For if the
chief apostle, even before he had learnt all distinctly, was called Satan for feeling this, what
excuse can they have, who after so abundant proof deny His economy? I say, when he who
had been so blessed, who made such a confession, has such words addressed to him; consider
what they will suffer, who after all this deny the mystery of the cross.</p>
<p>And He said not, “Satan spake by thee,” but, “Get thee behind me, Satan.”2120 For indeed
it was a desire of the adversary that Christ should not suffer. Therefore with such great
severity did He rebuke him, as knowing that both he and the rest are especially afraid of
this, and will not easily receive it.</p>
<p>Therefore He also reveals the thoughts of his mind, saying, “Thou savorest2121not the
things that be of God, but those that be of men.”</p>
<p>But what means, “Thou savorest2122not the things that be of God, but those that be of
men”? Peter examining the matter by human and earthly reasoning, accounted it disgraceful
to Him and an unmeet thing. Touching him therefore sharply,2123 He saith, “My passion
is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou
hadst hearkened to my sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding,
thou wouldest know that this of all things most becometh me. For thou indeed
supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I say unto thee, that for me not to suffer is
of the devil’s mind;” by the contrary statements repressing his alarm.</p>
<p>Thus as John, accounting it unworthy of Christ to be baptized by him, was persuaded
of Christ to baptize Him, He saying, “Thus it becometh us,”2124and this same Peter too,
forbidding Him to wash his feet, by the words, “Thou hast no part with me, unless I wash
thy feet;”2125even so here too He restrained him by the mention of the opposite, and by the
severity of the reproof repressed his fear of suffering.</p>
<p>7. Let no man therefore be ashamed of the honored symbols of our salvation, and of
the chiefest of all good things, whereby we even live, and whereby we are; but as a crown,
so let us bear about the cross of Christ. Yea, for by it all things are wrought, that are wrought

among us. Whether one is to be new-born, the cross is there; or to be nourished with that
mystical food, or to be ordained, or to do anything else, everywhere our symbol of victory
is present. Therefore both on house, and walls, and windows, and upon our forehead, and
upon our mind, we inscribe it with much care.</p>
<p>For of the salvation wrought for us, and of our common freedom, and of the goodness
of our Lord, this is the sign. “For as a sheep was He led to the slaughter.”2126 When therefore
thou signest thyself, think of the purpose of the cross, and quench anger, and all the other
passions. When thou signest thyself, fill thy forehead with all courage, make thy soul free.
And ye know assuredly what are the things that give freedom. Wherefore also Paul leading
us there, I mean unto the freedom that beseems us, did on this wise lead us unto it, having
reminded us of the cross and blood of our Lord. “For ye are bought,” saith he, “with a price;
be not ye the servants of men.”2127 Consider, saith he, the price that hath been paid for thee,
and thou wilt be a slave to no man; by the price meaning the cross.</p>
<p>Since not merely by the fingers ought one to engrave it, but before this by the purpose
of the heart with much faith. And if in this way thou hast marked it on thy face, none of the
unclean spirits will be able to stand near thee, seeing the blade whereby he received his
wound, seeing the sword which gave him his mortal stroke. For if we, on seeing the places
in which the criminals are beheaded, shudder; think what the devil must endure, seeing the
weapon, whereby Christ put an end to all his power, and cut off the head of the dragon.</p>
<p>Be not ashamed then of so great a blessing, lest Christ be ashamed of thee, when He
comes with His glory, and the sign appears before Him, shining beyond the very sunbeam.2128
For indeed the cross cometh then, uttering a voice by its appearance, and pleading with the
whole world for our Lord, and signifying that no part hath failed of what pertained to Him.</p>
<p>This sign, both in the days of our forefathers and now, hath opened doors that were
shut up;2129this hath quenched poisonous drugs;2130this hath taken away the power of
hemlock; this hath healed bites of venomous beasts. For if it opened the gates of hell, and
threw wide the archways of Heaven, and made a new entrance into Paradise, and cut away
the nerves of the devil; what marvel, if it prevailed over poisonous drugs, and venomous
beasts, and all other such things.</p>
<p>This therefore do thou engrave upon thy mind, and embrace the salvation of our souls.
For this cross saved and converted the world, drove away error, brought back truth, made

earth Heaven, fashioned men into angels. Because of this, the devils are no longer terrible,
but contemptible; neither is death, death, but a sleep; because of this, all that warreth against
us is cast to the ground, and trodden under foot.</p>
<p>If any one therefore say to thee, Dost thou worship the crucified? say, with your voice
all joy, and your countenance gladdened, “I do both worship Him, and will never cease to
worship.” And if he laugh, weep for him, because he is mad. Thank the Lord, that He hath
bestowed on us such benefits, as one cannot so much as learn without His revelation from
above. Why, this is the very reason of his laughing, that “the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit.”2131 Since our children too feel this, when they see any of the great and
marvellous things; and if thou bring a child into the mysteries, he will laugh. Now the heathen
are like these children; or rather they are more imperfect even than these; wherefore also
they are more wretched, in that not in an immature age, but when full grown, they have the
feelings of babes; wherefore neither are they worthy of indulgence.</p>
<p>But let us with a clear voice, shouting both loud and high, cry out and say (and should
all the heathen be present, so much the more confidently), that the cross is our glory, and
the sum of all our blessings, and our confidence, and all our crown. I would that also with
Paul I were able to say, “By which the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world;”2132but I cannot, restrained as I am by various passions.</p>
<p>8. Wherefore I admonish both you, and surely before you myself, to be crucified to the
world, and to have nothing in common with the earth, but to set your love on your country
above, and the glory and the good things that come from it. For indeed we are soldiers of a
heavenly King, and are clad with spiritual arms. Why then take we upon ourselves the life
of traders, and mountebanks, nay rather of worms? For where the King is, there should also
the soldier be. Yea, we are become soldiers, not of them that are far off, but of them that are
near. For the earthly king indeed would not endure that all should be in the royal courts,
and at his own side, but the King of the Heavens willeth all to be near His royal throne.</p>
<p>And how, one may say, is it possible for us, being here, to stand by that throne? Because
Paul too being on earth was where the seraphim, where the cherubim are; and nearer to
Christ, than these the body guards to the king. For these turn about their faces in many
directions, but him nothing beguiled nor distracted, but he kept his whole mind intent
upon the king. So that if we would, this is possible to us also.</p>
<p>For were He distant from us in place, thou mightest well doubt, but if He is present
everywhere, to him that strives and is in earnest He is near. Wherefore also the prophet said,
“I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me;2133” and God Himself again, “I am a God nigh at

hand, and not a God afar off.”2134 Then as our sins separate us from Him, so do our righteousnesses
draw us nigh unto Him. “For while thou art yet speaking,” it is said, “I will say,
Here I am.”2135 What father would ever be thus obedient to his offspring? What mother is
there, so ready, and continually standing, if haply her children call her? There is not one,
no father, no mother: but God stands continually waiting, if any of his servants should
perchance call Him; and never, when we have called as we ought, hath He refused to hear.
Therefore He saith, “While thou art yet speaking,” I do not wait for thee to finish, and I
straightway hearken.</p>
<p>9. Let us call Him therefore, as it is His will to be called. But what is this His will? “Loose,”
saith He, “every band of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive covenants, tear
in pieces every unjust contract. Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring in the poor that
are cast out to thy house. If thou seest one naked, cover him, and them that belong to thy
seed thou shalt not overlook. Then shall thy light break forth in the morning, and thine
healings shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory
of the Lord shall cover thee. Then thou shalt call upon me, and I will give ear unto thee;
whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am.”2136</p>
<p>And who is able to do all this? it may be asked. Nay, who is unable, I pray thee? For
which is difficult of the things I have mentioned? Which is laborious? Which not easy?</p>
<p>Why, so entirely are they not possible only, but even easy, that many have actually
overshot the measure of those sayings, not only tearing in pieces unjust contracts, but even
stripping themselves of all their goods; making the poor welcome not to roof and table, but
even to the sweat of their body, and laboring in order to maintain them; doing good not to
kinsmen only, but even to enemies.</p>
<p>But what is there at all even hard in these sayings? For neither did He say, “Pass over
the mountain, go across the sea, dig through so many acres of land, abide without food,
wrap thyself in sackcloth;” but, “Impart to the poor,2137impart of thy bread, cancel the
contracts unjustly made.”</p>
<p>What is more easy than this? tell me. But even if thou account it difficult, look, I pray
thee, at the rewards also, and it shall be easy to thee.</p>
<p>For much as our emperors at the horse races heap together before the combatants
crowns, and prizes, and garments, even so Christ also sets His rewards in the midst of His
course, holding them out by the prophet’s words, as it were by many hands. And the emper-

ors, although they be ten thousand times emperors, yet as being men, and the wealth which
they have in a course of spending, and their munificence of exhaustion, are ambitious of
making the little appear much; wherefore also they commit each thing severally into the
hand of the several attendants, and so bring it forward. But our King contrariwise, having
heaped all together (because He is very rich, and doeth nothing for display), He so brings
it forward, and what He so reaches out is indefinitely great, and will need many hands to
hold it. And to make thee aware of this, examine each particular of it carefully.</p>
<p>“Then,” saith He, “shall thy light break forth in the morning.”2138 Doth not this gift
appear to thee as some one thing? But it is not one; nay, for it hath many things in it, both
prizes, and crowns, and other rewards. And, if ye are minded, let us take it to pieces and
show all its wealth, as it shall be possible for us to show it; only do not ye grow weary.</p>
<p>And first, let us learn the meaning of “It shall break forth.” For He said not at all, “shall
appear,” but “shall break forth;” declaring to us its quickness and plentifulness, and how
exceedingly He desires our salvation, and how the good things themselves travail to come
forth, and press on; and that which would check their unspeakable force shall be nought;
by all which He indicates their plentifulness, and the infinity of His abundance. But what
is “the morning.” It means, “not after being in life’s temptations, neither after our evils have
come upon us;” nay, it is quite beforehand with them. For as in our fruits, we call that early,
which has shown itself before its season; so also here again, declaring its rapidity, he has
spoken in this way, much as above He said, “Whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo!
here I am.”</p>
<p>But of what manner of light is He speaking, and what can this light be? Not this, that is
sensible; but another far better, which shows us Heaven, the angels, the archangels, the
cherubim, the seraphim, the thrones, the dominions, the principalities, the powers, the
whole host, the royal palaces, the tabernacles. For shouldest thou be counted worthy of this
light, thou shalt both see these, and be delivered from hell, and from the venomous worm,
and from the gnashing of teeth, and from the bonds that cannot be broken, and from the
anguish and the affliction, from the darkness that hath no light, and from being cut asunder,
and from the river of fire, and from the curse, and from the abodes of sorrow; and thou
shalt depart, “where sorrow and woe are fled away,”2139where great is the joy, and the peace,
and the love, and the pleasure, and the mirth; where is life eternal, and unspeakable glory,
and inexpressible beauty; where are eternal tabernacles, and the untold glory of the King,
and those good things, “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into

<head>Homily LV.</head>
<p>Matt. XVI. 24.</p>
<p>“Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will come after me, let him renounce himself,
2141and take up his cross and follow me.”</p>
<p>Then; when? When Peter said, “Be it far from Thee, this shall not be unto Thee;” and
was told, “Get thee behind me, Satan.”2142 For He was by no means satisfied with the mere
rebuke, but, willing also more abundantly to show both the extravagance of what Peter had
said, and the benefit of His passion, He saith, “Thy word to me is, “Be it far from Thee, this
shall not be unto Thee:” but my word to thee is, “Not only is it hurtful to thee, and destructive,
to hinder me and to be displeased at my Passion, but it will be impossible for thee even to
be saved, unless thou thyself too be continually prepared for death.”</p>
<p>Thus, lest they should think His suffering unworthy of Him, not by the former things
only, but also by the events that were coming on, He teaches them the gain thereof. Thus
in John first, He saith, “Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit;”2143but here more abundantly working it
out, not concerning Himself only doth He bring forward the statement that it is meet to die,
but concerning them also. “For so great is the profit thereof, that in your case also unwillingness
to die is grievous, but to be ready for it, good.”</p>
<p>This however He makes clear by what follows, but for the present He works it out on
one side only. And see how He also makes His discourse unexceptionable: not saying at all,
“whether you will, or no, you must suffer this,” but how? “If any man will come after me.”
“I force not, I compel not, but each one I make lord of his own choice; wherefore also I say,
‘If any man will.’ For to good things do I call you, not to things evil, or burdensome; not to
punishment and vengeance, that I should have to compel. Nay, the nature of the thing is
alone sufficient to attract you.”</p>
<p>Now, thus saying, He drew them unto Him the more. For he indeed that uses compulsion
oftens turns men away, but he that leaves the hearer to choose attracts him more. For
soothing is a mightier thing than force. Wherefore even He Himself said, “If any man will.”
“For great,” saith He, “are the good things which I give you, and such as for men even to
run to them of their own accord. For neither if one were giving gold, and offering a treasure,
<note type="footnote">2141 [R.V., “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself,” etc. The Oxford translator substitutes
“renounce” to bring out the distinction between ἀπαρνεσθαι and ἀρνεσθαι, which is pointed out in the Homily,

<note type="footnote">2142 Matt. xvi. 22, 23.</note>

<pb n="592"/>
would he invite with force. And if that invitation be without compulsion, much more this,
to the good things in the Heavens. Since if the nature of the thing persuade thee not to run,
thou art not worthy to receive it at all, nor if thou shouldest receive it, wilt thou well know
what thou hast received.”</p>
<p>Wherefore Christ compels not, but urges, sparing us. For since they seemed to be
murmuring much, being secretly disturbed at the saying, He saith, “No need of disturbance
or of trouble. If ye do not account what I have mentioned to be a cause of innumerable
blessings, even when befalling yourselves, I use no force, nor do I compel, but if any be
willing to follow, him I call.”</p>
<p>“For do not by any means imagine that this is your following of me; I mean, what ye
now do attending upon me. Ye have need of many toils, many dangers, if ye are to come
after me. For thou oughtest not, O Peter, because thou hast confessed me Son of God,
therefore only to expect crowns, and to suppose this enough for thy salvation, and for the
future to enjoy security, as having done all. For although it be in my power, as Son of God,
to hinder thee from having any trial at all of those hardships; yet such is not my will, for thy
sake, that thou mayest thyself too contribute something, and be more approved.”</p>
<p>For so, if one were a judge at the games, and had a friend in the lists, he would not wish
to crown him by favor only, but also for his own toils; and for this reason especially, because
he loves him. Even so Christ also; whom He most loves, those He most of all will have to
approve themselves by their own means also, and not from His help alone.</p>
<p>But see how at the same time He makes His saying not a grievous one. For He doth by
no means compass them only with His terror, but He also puts forth the doctrine generally
to the world, saying, “If any one will,” be it woman or man, ruler or subject, let him come
this way.</p>
<p>2. And though he seem to have spoken but one single thing, yet His sayings are three,
“Let him renounce himself,” and “Let him bear his cross,” and “Let him follow me;” and
two of them are joined together, but the one is put by itself.</p>
<p>But let us see first what it can be to deny one’s self. Let us learn first what it is to deny
another, and then we shall know what it may be to deny one’s self. What then is it to deny
another? He that is denying another,—for example, either brother, or servant, or whom you
will,—should he see him either beaten, or bound, or led to execution, or whatever he may
suffer, stands not by him, doth not help him, is not moved, feels nothing for him, as being
once for all alienated from him. Thus then He will have us disregard our own body, so that
whether men scourge, or banish, or burn, or whatever they do, we may not spare it. For this
is to spare it. Since fathers too then spare their offspring, when committing them to teachers,
they command not to spare them.</p>

<pb n="593"/>
<p>So also Christ; He said not, “Let him not spare himself,” but very strictly, “Let him renounce
himself;” that is, let him have nothing to do with himself, but give himself up to all
dangers and conflicts; and let him so feel, as though another were suffering it all.</p>
<p>And He said not, “Let him deny,”2144but “Let him renounce;”2145even by this small
addition intimating again, how very far it goes. For this latter is more than the former.</p>
<p>“And let him take up his cross.” This arises out of the other. For to hinder thy supposing
that words, and insults, and reproaches are to be the limits of our self-renunciation, He saith
also how far one ought to renounce one’s self; that is, unto death, and that a reproachful
death. Therefore He said not, “Let him renounce himself unto death,” but, “Let him take
up his cross;” setting forth the reproachful death; and that not once, nor twice, but
throughout all life one ought so to do. “Yea,” saith He, “bear about this death continually,
and day by day be ready for slaughter. For since many have indeed contemned riches, and
pleasure, and glory, but death they despised not, but feared dangers; I,” saith He, “will that
my champion should wrestle even unto blood, and that the limits of his course should reach
unto slaughter; so that although one must undergo death, death with reproach, the accursed
death, and that upon evil surmise, we are to bear all things nobly, and rather to rejoice in
being suspected.”</p>
<p>“And let him follow me.” That is, it being possible for one to suffer, yet not to follow
Him, when one doth not suffer for Him (for so robbers often suffer grievously, and violaters
of tombs, and sorcerers); to hinder thy supposing that the mere nature of thy calamities is
sufficient, He adds the occasion of these calamities.</p>
<p>And what is it? In order that, so doing and suffering, thou mayest follow Him; that for
Him thou mayest undergo all things; that thou mayest possess the other virtues also. For
this too is expressed by “Let him follow me;” so as to show forth not fortitude only, such as
is exercised in our calamities, but temperance also, and moderation, and all self-restraint.
This being properly “to follow,” the giving heed also to the other virtues, and for His sake
suffering all.</p>
<p>For there are who follow the devil even to the endurance of all this, and for his sake give
up their own lives; but we for Christ, or rather for our own sakes: they indeed to harm
themselves both here and there; but we, that we may gain both lives.</p>
<p>How then is it not extreme dullness, not to show forth even the same fortitude with
them that perish; and this, when we are to reap from it so many crowns? Yet with us surely
Christ Himself is present to be our help, but with them no one.</p>
<p>Now He had indeed already spoken this very injunction, when He sent them, saying,
“Go not into the way of the Gentiles” (for, saith He, “I send you as sheep in the midst of
<note type="footnote">2144 ἀρνησσθω.</note>
<note type="footnote">2145 ἀπαρνησσθω. [Comp. note, p. 338.]</note>

<pb n="594"/>
wolves,” and, “ye shall be brought before kings and governors”)2146but now with more intensity
and severity. For then He spake of death only, but here He hath mentioned a cross
also, and a continual cross. For “let him take up,” saith He, “his cross;” that is, “let him carry
it continually and bear it.” And this He is wont to do in everything; not in the first instance,
nor from the beginning, but quietly and gradually, bringing in the greater commandments,
that the hearers may not count it strange.</p>
<p>3. Then, because the saying seemed to be vehement, see how He softens it by what follows,
and sets down rewards surpassing our toils; and not rewards only, but also the penalties
of vice: nay, on these last He dwells more than on those, since not so much His bestowing
blessings, as His threat of severities, is wont to bring ordinary men to their senses. See at
least how He both begins here from this, and ends in this.</p>
<p>“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it,” saith He, “but whosoever shall lose his
life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited,2147if he should gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?”2148</p>
<p>Now what He saith is like this: “not as unsparing towards you, but rather as exceedingly
sparing you, I enjoin these things. For he who spares his child, ruins it; but he who spares
it not, preserves.” To which effect also a certain wise man said, “If thou beat thy son with a
rod, he shall not die, but thou shalt deliver his soul from death.”2149 And again, “He that
refresheth his son, shall bind up his wounds.”2150</p>
<p>This takes place in the camp also. For if the general, sparing the soldiers, commands
them to remain within the place always, he will destroy with them the inhabitants too.</p>
<p>“In order then that this may not happen in your case also,” saith He, “ye must be arrayed
against continual death. For now too a grievous war is about to be kindled. Sit not therefore
within, but go forth and fight; and shouldest thou fall in thy post, then hast thou obtained
life.” For if in the visible wars he that in his post meets slaughter, is both more distinguished
than the rest, and more invincible, and more formidable to the enemy; although we know
that after death the king, in behalf of whom he takes his station, is not able to raise him up
again: much more in these wars, when there are such hopes of resurrection besides, will he
who exposes his own life unto death, find it; in one sense, because he will not be quickly
taken; in a second, because even though he fall, God2151will lead his life on to a higher life.</p>

<p>4. Then, because he had said, “He who will save shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose
shall save it,” and on that side had set salvation and destruction, and on this salva tion and
destruction; to prevent any one’s imagining the one destruction and salvation to be all the
same with the other, and to teach thee plainly that the difference between this salvation and
that is as great as between destruction and salvation; from the contraries also He makes an
inference once for all to establish these points. “For what is a man profited,”2152saith He,
“if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?”</p>
<p>Seest thou how the wrongful preservation of it is destruction, and worse than all destruction,
as being even past remedy, from the want of anything more to redeem it? For “tell me
not this,” saith He, “that he that hath escaped such dangers hath saved his life; but together
with his life put also the whole world, yet what profit hath he thereby, if the soul perish?”</p>
<p>For tell me, shouldest thou see thy servants in luxury, and thyself in extreme calamity,
wilt thou indeed profit aught by being master? By no means. Make this reckoning then with
regard to thy soul also, when the flesh is in luxury and wealth, and she awaiting the destruction
to come.</p>
<p>“What shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?”2153</p>
<p>Again, He dwells upon the same point. What? hast thou another soul to give for this
soul? saith He. Why, shouldest thou lose money, thou wilt be able to give money; or be it
house, or slaves, or any other kind of possession, but for thy soul, if thou lose it, thou wilt
have no other soul to give: yea, though thou hadst the world, though thou wast king of the
whole earth, thou wouldest not be able, by paying down all earthly goods, with the earth itself,
to redeem but one soul.</p>
<p>And what marvel, if it be so with the soul? Since even in the body one may see that so
it turns out. Though thou wear ten thousand diadems, but have a body sickly by nature,
and incurable, thou wilt not be able, not by giving all thy kingdom, to recover this body,
not though thou add innumerable persons, and cities, and goods.</p>
<p>Now thus I bid thee reason with regard to thy soul also; or rather even much more with
regard to the soul; and do thou, forsaking all besides, spend all thy care upon it. Do not then
while taking thought about the things of others, neglect thyself and thine own things; which
now all men do, resembling them that work in the mines. For neither do these receive any
profit from this labor, nor from the wealth; but rather great harm, both because they incur
fruitless peril, and incur it for other men, reaping no benefit from such their toils and deaths.
These even now are objects of imitation to many, who are digging up wealth for others; or
rather we are more wretched even than this, inasmuch as hell itself awaits us after these our

<pb n="596"/>
labors. For they indeed are staid from those toils by death, but to us death proves a beginning
of innumerable evils.</p>
<p>But if thou say, thou hast in thy wealth the fruit of thy toils: show me thy soul gladdened,
and then I am persuaded. For of all things in us the soul is chief. And if the body be fattened,
while she is pining away, this prosperity is nothing to thee (even as when the handmaiden
is glad, the happiness of the maidservant is nothing to her mistress perishing, nor is the fair
robe anything compared with the weak flesh); but Christ will say unto thee again, “What
shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?” on every hand commanding thee to be busied
about that, and to take account of it only.</p>
<p>5. Having alarmed them therefore hereby, He comforts them also by His good things.</p>
<p>“For the Son of Man shall come,” saith He, “in the glory of His Father with His holy
angels, and then He shall reward every man according to his works.”2154</p>
<p>Seest thou how the glory of the Father and of the Son is all one? But if the glory be one,
it is quite evident that the substance also is one. For if in one substance there be a difference
of glory (“for there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory
of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory;”2155although the substance be
one), how may the substance of those differ, whereof the glory is one? For He said not at
all, “In glory such as the Father’s,” whereby thou mightest suppose again some variation;
but implying entire perfection, “In that same glory,” saith He, “will He come;” for it to be
deemed one and the same.</p>
<p>“Now, why fear, O Peter” (so He speaks), “on being told of death? Why, then shalt thou
see me in the glory of the Father. And if I am in glory, so are ye; your interests are no wise
limited to the present life, but another sort of portion will take you up, a better one.” Nevertheless,
when He had spoken of the good things, He stayed not at this, but mingled the
fearful things also, bringing forward that judgment-seat, and the inexorable account, and
the inflexible sentence, and the judgment that cannot be deceived.</p>
<p>He suffered not however His discourse to appear only dismal, but tempered it also with
good hopes. For neither did He say, “then shall He punish them that sinned,” but, “He shall
reward every man according to his doings.”2156 And this He said, reminding not only the
sinners of punishment, but also them that have done well of prizes and crowns.</p>
<p>6. And He indeed spake it, in part to refresh the good, but I ever shudder at hearing it,
for I am not of them that are crowned, and I suppose that others also share with us in our
fear and anxiety. For whom is this saying not enough to startle, when he hath entered into

<pb n="597"/>
his own conscience; and to make him shudder, and convince him that we have need of
sackcloth, and of prolonged fasting, more than the people of the Ninevites? For not for an
overthrow of a city, and the common end, are we concerned, but for eternal punishment,
and the fire that is never quenched.</p>
<p>Wherefore also I praise and admire the monks that have occupied the desert places, as
for the rest, so for this saying. For they after having made their dinners, or rather after supper
(for dinner they know not at any time, because they know that the present time is one of
mourning and fasting); after supper then, in saying certain hymns of thanksgiving unto
God, they make mention of this expression also. And if ye would hear the very hymns
themselves, that ye too may say them continually, I will rehearse to you the whole of that
sacred song. The words of it then stand as follows: “Blessed God, who feedest me from my
youth up, who givest food to all flesh; fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that always having
all sufficiency we may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord; with whom
be unto Thee glory, honor and might, with the Holy Spirit, forever. Amen. Glory to Thee,
O Lord, glory to Thee, O Holy One, glory to Thee, O King, that Thou hast given us meat to
make us glad. Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be found well-pleasing before Thee,
not being ashamed, when Thou renderest to every man according to his works.”</p>
<p>Now this hymn is in all parts worthy of admiration, but especially the above ending of
it. That is, because meals and food are wont to dissipate and weigh down, they put this saying
as a kind of bridle upon the soul, at the time of indulgence reminding it of the time of
judgment. For they have learnt what befell Israel through a costly table. “For my beloved,”
saith He, “ate, and waxed fat, and kicked.”2157 Wherefore also Moses said, “When thou shalt
have eaten and drunk and art full, remember the Lord thy God.”2158</p>
<p>For after that feast, then they ventured on those acts of lawless daring.</p>
<p>Do thou therefore also look to it, lest something like it befall thee. For though thou
sacrifice not to stone nor to gold, either sheep or bullocks, see lest to wrath thou sacrifice
thine own soul, lest to whoredom or other like passions, thou sacrifice thine own salvation.
Yea—on this account, you see, they being afraid of these downfalls, when they have enjoyed
their meal, or rather fasting (for their meal is in fact fasting), remind themselves of the terrible
judgment-seat, and of that day. And if they who correct themselves both with fasting, and
with nights spent on the ground, with watchings, and with sackcloth, and with ten thousand
means, do yet require also this reminding, when will it be possible for us to live virtuously;
who set forth tables loaded with innumerable wrecks, and do not so much as pray at all,
neither in the beginning nor the end ?</p>

<pb n="598"/>
<p>7. Wherefore to put an end to these shipwrecks, let us bring before us that hymn and
unfold it all, that seeing the profit thereof, we too may chant it constantly over our table,
and quell the rude motions of the belly, introducing both the manners and laws of those
angels into our houses. For you ought indeed to go there and reap these fruits; but since ye
are not willing, at least through our words, hear this spiritual melody, and let every one after
his meal say these words, beginning thus.</p>
<p>“Blessed God.” For the apostolic law they straightway fulfill, that commands, “Whatsoever
we do in word or in deed, that we do it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving
thanks to God and the Father by Him.”2159</p>
<p>Next, the thanksgiving takes place not for that one day only, but for all their life. For,
“Who feedest me,” it is said, “from my youth up.” And a lesson of self-command is drawn
thence, that when God feeds, we must not take thought. For if upon a king’s promising thee
to furnish thy daily food out of his own stores, thou wouldest be of good hope for the future;
much more, when God gives, and all things pour upon thee as out of fountains, shouldest
thou be freed from all anxiety. Yea, and to this very intent they so speak, that they may
persuade both themselves, and those that are made disciples by them, to put off all worldly
care.</p>
<p>Then, not to have thee suppose that for themselves only they offer up this thanksgiving,
they further say, “Who givest food to all flesh,” giving thanks in behalf of all the world; and
as fathers of the whole earth, so do they offer up their praises for all, and train themselves
to a sincere brotherly love. For it is not even possible they should hate them, in behalf of
whom they thank God, that they are fed.</p>
<p>Seest thou both charity introduced by their thanksgiving, and worldly care cast out,
both by the preceding words, and by these? For if He feed all flesh, much more them that
are devoted to him; if them that are entangled in worldly cares, much more them that are
freed from the same.</p>
<p>To establish this, Christ Himself said, “How many sparrows do ye exceed in value?”2160
And He said it, teaching them not to put their confidence in wealth and land and seeds; for
it is not these that feed us, but the word of God.2161</p>
<p>Hereby they stop the mouths, both of the Manichæans, and of them of Valentinus, and
of all that are diseased in their way. For sure this Being is not evil, who sets his own stores
before all, even before them that blaspheme Him.</p>
<p>Then comes the petition: “Fill our hearts with joy and gladness.” With what manner of
joy then, doth it mean? the joy of this world? God forbid: for had they meant this, they would
<note type="footnote">2159 Colos. iii. 17.</note>

<pb n="599"/>
not have occupied summits of mountains, and deserts, nor wrapt themselves in sackcloth;
but that joy they mean, which hath nothing in common with this present life, the joy of
angels, the joy above.</p>
<p>And they do not simply ask for it, but in great excess; for they say not, “give,” but, “fill,”
and they say not “us,” but “our hearts.” For this is especially a heart’s joy; “For the fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace.”2162</p>
<p>Thus, because sin brought in sorrow, they request that through joy righteousness may
be implanted in them, for no otherwise might joy be engendered.</p>
<p>“That, always having all sufficiency, we may abound unto every good work.”2163 See
how they fulfill that word of the gospel which saith, “Give us this day our daily bread,” and
how they seek even this for spiritual ends. For their phrase is, “That we may abound unto
every good work.” They said not, “That we may do our duty only,” but “even more than
what is enjoined,” for, “that we may abound,” means this. And while of God they seek sufficiency
in things needful, themselves are willing to obey not in sufficiency only, but with
much abundance, and in all things. This is the part of well-disposed servants, this of men
strict in goodness, to abound always, and in all things.</p>
<p>Then again reminding themselves of their own weakness, and that without the influence
from above nothing noble can be done; having said, “that we may abound unto every good
work,” they add, “in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom unto Thee be glory, honor, and might
forever. Amen;” framing this end like their commencement by a thread of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>8. After this again, they seem to begin afresh, but they are keeping to the same argument.
As Paul also in the beginning of an epistle, having closed with a doxology, where he says,
“According to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever. Amen;”2164begins
the subject again on which he was writing. And again in another place when he had said,
“They worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever:
Amen;”2165he completed not his discourse, but begins again.</p>
<p>Therefore neither let us blame these our angels, as acting disorderly, for that having
closed with a doxology they begin again the sacred hymns. For they follow apostolical laws,
beginning from a doxology, and ending therein, and after that end making a commencement
again.</p>
<p>Wherefore they say, “Glory be to Thee, O Lord; glory be to Thee, O Holy One; glory be
to Thee, O King; that Thou hast given us food to make us glad.”</p>

<p>Since not for the greater things only, but also for the lesser, we ought to give thanks.
And they do give thanks for these also, putting to shame the heresy of the Manichæans, and
of as many as affirm our present life to be evil. For lest for their high self-command, and
contempt of the belly, thou shouldest suspect them as abhorring the meat, like the heretics
aforesaid, who choke themselves2166to death; they by their prayer teach thee, that not from
abhorrence of God’s creatures they abstain from most of them, but as exercising self-restraint.</p>
<p>And see how after thanksgiving for His past gifts, they are importunate also for the
greater things, and dwell not upon the mat ters of this life, but mount above the heavens,
and say, “Fill us with the Holy Ghost.” For it is not even possible to approve one’s self as
one ought, not being filled with that grace; as there is no doing anything noble or great,
without the benefit of Christ’s influences.</p>
<p>As therefore when they had said, “That we may abound unto every good work,” they
added, “In Christ Jesus;” so here also they say, “Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be
found to have been well-pleasing before Thee.”2167</p>
<p>Seest thou how for the things of this life they pray not, but give thanks only; but for the
things of the Spirit, they both give thanks and pray. For, “seek ye,” saith He, “the kingdom
of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.”2168</p>
<p>And mark too another kind of severe goodness in them; their saying, namely, “That we
may be found to have been well-pleasing in Thy sight, not being ashamed.” For “we care
not,” say they, “for the shame that proceeds from the many, but whatever men may say of
us, laughing, upbraiding, we do not so much as regard it; but our whole endeavor is not to
be put to shame then.” But in these expressions, they bring in also the river of fire, and the
prizes, and the rewards.</p>
<p>They said not, “that we be not punished,” but, “that we be not ashamed.”2169 For this
is to us far more fearful than hell, to seem to have offended our Lord.</p>
<p>But since the more part and the grosser sort are not in fear of this, they add, “When
Thou renderest to every man according to his works.” Seest thou how greatly these strangers
and pilgrims have benefitted us, these citizens of the wilderness, or rather citizens of the
Heavens? For whereas we are strangers to the Heavens, but citizens of the earth, these are
just the contrary.</p>

<p>And after this hymn, being filled with much compunction, and with many and fervent
tears, so they proceed to sleep, snatching just so much of it as a little to refresh themselves.
And again, the nights they make days, spending them in thanksgivings and in the singing
of psalms.</p>
<p>But not men only, but women also practise this self-denial, overcoming the weakness
of their nature by the abundance of their zeal.</p>
<p>Let us be abashed then at their earnestness, we who are men, let us cease to be fastened
to the things present, to shadow, to dreams, to smoke. For the more part of our life is passed
in insensibility.</p>
<p>For both the first period of our life is full of much folly, and that again which travels on
to old age, makes all the feeling that is in us wither away, and small is the space between,
that is able feelingly to enjoy pleasure; or rather, not even that hath a pure participation
thereof, by reason of innumerable cares and toils, that harrass it.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I pray, let us seek the unmovable and eternal goods, and the life that never
has old age.</p>
<p>For even one dwelling in a city may imitate the self-denial of the monks; yea, one who
has a wife, and is busied in a household, may pray, and fast, and learn compunction. Since
they also, who at the first were instructed by the apostles, though they dwelt in cities, yet
showed forth the piety of the occupiers of the deserts: and others again who had to rule over
workshops, as Priscilla and Aquila.</p>
<p>And the prophets too, all had both wives and households, as Isaiah, as Ezekiel, as the
great Moses, and received no hurt therefrom in regard of virtue.</p>
<p>These then let us also imitate, and continually offer thanksgiving to God, continually
sing hymns to Him; let us give heed to temperance, and to all other virtues, and the selfdenial
that is practised in the deserts, let us bring into our cities; that we may appear both
well-pleasing before God, and approved before men, and attain unto the good things to
come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with
whom be unto the Father, glory, honor, and might, together with the holy and life-giving
Spirit, now and always and world without end. Amen.2170</p>

bonum: Per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum: Amen.” The conclusion of St. Chrysostom’s grace seems to be

<p>Matt. XVI. 28.</p>
<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, There are some of them that stand here, which shall not taste
of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”</p>
<p>Thus, inasmuch as He had discoursed much of dangers and death, and of His own
passion, and of the slaughter of the disciples, and had laid on them those severe injunctions;
and these were in the present life and at hand, but the good things in hope and expectation:—
for example, “They save their life who lose it;” “He is coming in the glory of His
Father;” “He renders His rewards:”—He willing to assure their very sight, and to show what
kind of glory that is wherewith He is to come, so far as it was possible for them to learn it;
even in their present life He shows and reveals this; that they should not grieve any more,
either over their own death, or over that of their Lord, and especially Peter in His sorrow.</p>
<p>And see what He doth. Having discoursed of hell,2171and of the kingdom (for as well
by saying, “He that findeth his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose it for my sake, shall
find it;”2172as by saying, “He shall reward every man according to his works,”2173 He had
manifested both of these): having, I say, spoken of both, the kingdom indeed He shows in
the vision, but hell not yet.</p>
<p>Why so? Because had they been another kind of people, of a grosser sort, this too would
have been necessary; but since they are approved and considerate, He leads them on the
gentler way. But not therefore only doth He make this disclosure, but because to Himself
also it was far more suitable.</p>
<p>Not however that He passes over this subject either, but in some places He almost brings
even before our eyes the very realities of hell; as when He introduces the picture of Lazarus,
and mentions him that exacted the hundred pence, and him that was clad in the filthy garments,
and others not a few.</p>
<p>2. “And after six days He taketh with Him Peter and James and John.”2174</p>
<p>Now another says, “after eight,”2175not contradicting this writer, but most fully agreeing
with him. For the one expressed both the very day on which He spake, and that on which
He led them up; but the other, the days between them only.</p>

<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, the severe goodness of Matthew, not concealing those who
were preferred to himself. This John also often doth, recording the peculiar praises of Peter
with great sincerity. For the choir of these holy men was everywhere pure from envy and
vainglory.</p>
<p>Having taken therefore the leaders, “He bringeth them up into a high mountain apart,
and was transfigured before them: and His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment
was2176white as the light. And there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with
Him.”2177</p>
<p>Wherefore doth He take with Him these only? Because these were superior to the rest.
And Peter indeed showed his superiority by exceedingly loving Him; but John by being exceedingly
loved of Him; and James again by his answer which he answered with his brother,
saying, “We are able to drink the cup;”2178nor yet by his answer only, but also by his works;
both by the rest of them, and by fulfilling, what he said. For so earnest was he, and grievous
to the Jews, that Herod himself supposed that he had bestowed herein a very great favor on
the Jews, I mean in slaying him.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He not lead them up straightway? To spare the other disciples any
feeling of human weakness: for which cause He omits also the names of them that are to go
up. And this, because the rest would have desired exceedingly to have followed, being to see
a pattern of that glory; and would have been pained, as overlooked. For though it was
somewhat in a corporeal way that He made the disclosure, yet nevertheless the thing had
much in it to be desired.</p>
<p>Wherefore then doth He at all foretell it? That they might be readier to seize the high
meaning, by His foretelling it; and being filled with the more vehement desire in that round
of days, might so be present with their mind quite awake and full of care.</p>
<p>3. But wherefore doth He also bring forward Moses and Elias? One might mention
many reasons. And first of all this: because the multitudes said He was, some Elias, some
Jeremias, some one of the old prophets, He brings the leaders of His choir, that they might
see the difference even hereby between the servants and the Lord; and that Peter was rightly
commended for confessing Him Son of God.</p>
<p>But besides that, one may mention another reason also: that because men were continually
accusing Him of transgressing the law, and accounting Him to be a blasphemer, as appropriating
to Himself a glory which belonged not to Him, even the Father’s, and were
saying, “This Man is not of God, because He keepeth not the Sabbath day;”2179and again,

“For a good work we stone Thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that Thou, being a
man, makest Thyself God:”2180that both the charges might be shown to spring from envy,
and He be proved not liable to either; and that neither is His conduct a transgression of the
law, nor His calling Himself equal to the Father an appropriation of glory not His own; He
brings forward them who had shone out in each of these respects: Moses, because he gave
the law, and the Jews might infer that he would not have overlooked its being trampled on,
as they supposed, nor have shown respect to the transgressor of it, and the enemy of its
founder: Elias too for his part was jealous for the glory of God, and were any man an adversary
of God, and calling himself God, making himself equal to the Father, while he was
not what he said, and had no right to do so; he was not the person to stand by, and hearken
unto him.</p>
<p>And one may mention another reason also, with those which have been spoken of. Of
what kind then is it? To inform them that He hath power both of death and life, is ruler
both above and beneath. For this cause He brings forward both him that had died, and him
that never yet suffered this.</p>
<p>But the fifth motive, (for it is a fifth, besides those that have been mentioned), even the
evangelist himself hath revealed. Now what was this? To show the glory of the cross, and to
console Peter and the others in their dread of the passion, and to raise up their minds. Since
having come, they by no means held their peace, but “spake,” it is said, “of the glory2181which
He was to accomplish at Jerusalem;2182” that is, of the passion, and the cross; for so they
call it always.</p>
<p>And not thus only did He cheer them, but also by the excellency itself of the men, being
such as He was especially requiring from themselves. I mean, that having said, “If any man
will come after me, let him take up his cross, and follow me;” them that had died ten thousand
times for God’s decrees, and the people entrusted to them, these persons He sets before
them. Because each of these, having lost his life, found it. For each of them both spake boldly
unto tyrants, the one to the Egyptian, the other to Ahab; and in behalf of heartless and disobedient
men; and by the very persons who were saved by them, they were brought into
extreme danger; and each of them wishing to withdraw men from idolatry; and each being
unlearned; for the one was of a “slow tongue,”2183and dull of speech, and the other for his
part also somewhat of the rudest in his bearing: and of voluntary poverty both were very

strict observers; for neither had Moses made any gain, nor had Elias aught more than his
sheepskin; and this under the old law, and when they had not received so great a gift of
miracles. For what if Moses clave a sea? yet Peter walked on the water, and was able to remove
mountains, and used to work cures of all manner of bodily diseases, and to drive away savage
demons, and by the shadow of his body to work those wonderful and great prodigies; and
changed the whole world. And if Elias too raised a dead man, yet these raised ten thousand;
and this before the spirit was as yet vouchsafed to them. He brings them forward accordingly
for this cause also. For He would have them emulate their winning ways toward the people,
and their presence of mind and inflexibility; and that they should be meek like Moses, and
jealous for God like Elias, and full of tender care, as they were. For the one endured a famine
of three years for the Jewish people; and the other said, “If thou wilt forgive them their sin,
forgive; else blot me too out of the book, which thou hast written.”2184 Now of all this He
was reminding them by the vision.</p>
<p>For He brought those in glory too, not that these should stay where they were, but that
they might even surpass their limitary lines. For example, when they said, “Should we
command fire to come down from heaven,” and made mention of Elias as having done so,
He saith, “Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of;”2185training them to forbearance
by the superiority in their gift.</p>
<p>And let none suppose us to condemn Elias as imperfect; we say not this; for indeed he
was exceedingly perfect, but in his own times, when the mind of men was in some degree
childish, and they needed this kind of schooling. Since Moses too was in this respect perfect;
nevertheless these have more required of them than he. For “except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
kingdom of Heaven.”2186 For not into Egypt did they enter, but into the whole world, worse
disposed than the Egyptians; neither were they to speak with Pharaoh, but to fight hand to
hand with the devil, the very prince of wickedness. Yea, and their appointed struggle was,
both to bind him, and to spoil all his goods; and this they did cleaving not the sea, but an
abyss of ungodliness, through the rod of Jesse,—an abyss having waves far more grievous.
See at any rate how many things there were to put the men in fear; death, poverty, dishonor,
their innumerable sufferings; and at these things they trembled more than the Jews of old
at that sea. But nevertheless against all these things He persuaded them boldly to venture,
and to pass as along dry ground with all security.</p>
<p>To train them therefore for all this, He brought forward those who shone forth under
the old law.</p>

<p>4. What then saith the ardent Peter? “It is good for us to be here.”2187 For because he
had heard that Christ was to go to Jerusalem and to suffer, being in fear still and trembling
for Him, even after His reproof, he durst not indeed approach and say the same thing again,
“Be it far from thee;2188but from that fear obscurely intimates the same again in other words.
That is, when he saw a mountain, and so great retirement and solitude, his thought was,
“He hath great security here, even from the place; and not only from the place, but also from
His going away no more unto Jerusalem.” For he would have Him be there continually:
wherefore also he speaks of “tabernacles.” For “if this may be,” saith he, “we shall not go up
to Jerusalem; and if we go not up, He will not die, for there He said the scribes would set
upon Him.”</p>
<p>But thus indeed he durst not speak; but desiring however to order things so, he said
undoubtingly, “It is good for us to be here,” where Moses also is present, and Elias; Elias
who brought down fire on the mountain, and Moses who entered into the thick darkness,
and talked with God; and no one will even know where we are.</p>
<p>Seest thou the ardent lover of Christ? For look not now at this, that the manner of his
exhortation was not well weighed, but see how ardent he was, how burning his affection to
Christ. For in proof that not so much out of fear for himself he said these things, hear what
he saith, when Christ was declaring beforehand His future death, and the assault upon Him:
“I will lay down my life for Thy sake.2189 Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny
Thee.2190</p>
<p>And see how even in the very midst of the actual dangers he counselled amiss2191for
himself. We know that when so great a multitude encompassed them, so far from flying, he
even drew the sword, and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant. To such a degree did
he disregard his own interest, and fear for his Master. Then because he had spoken as affirming
a fact, he checks himself, and thinking, what if he should be again reproved, he saith,
“If Thou wilt, let us make2192here three tabernacles, one for Thee and one for Moses, and
one for Elias.”</p>
<p>What sayest thou, O Peter? didst thou not a little while since distinguish Him from the
servants? Art thou again numbering Him with the servants? Seest thou how exceedingly
imperfect they were before the crucifixion? For although the Father had revealed it to him,
yet he did not always retain the revelation, but was troubled by his alarm; not this only,

<pb n="607"/>
which I have mentioned, but another also, arising from that sight. In fact, the other evangelists,
to declare this, and to indicate that the confusion of his mind, with which he spake these
things, arose from that alarm, said as follows; mark, “He wist not what to say, for they were
sore afraid;”2193but Luke after his saying, “Let us make three tabernacles,” added, “not
knowing what he said.”2194 Then to show that he was holden with great fear, both he and
the rest, he saith, “They were heavy with sleep, and when they were awake they saw His
glory;”2195meaning by deep sleep here, the deep stupor engendered in them by that vision.
For as eyes are darkened by an excessive splendor, so at that time also did they feel. For it
was not, I suppose, night, but day; and the exceeding greatness of the light weighed down
the infirmity of their eyes.</p>
<p>5. What then? He Himself speaks nothing, nor Moses, nor Elias, but He that is greater
than all, and more worthy of belief, the Father, uttereth a voice out of the cloud.</p>
<p>Wherefore out of the cloud? Thus doth God ever appear. “For a cloud and darkness are
round about Him;”2196and, “He sitteth on a light cloud;”2197and again, “Who maketh clouds
His chariot;”2198and, “A cloud received Him out of their sight;”2199and, “As the Son of Man
coming in the clouds.”2200</p>
<p>In order then that they might believe that the voice proceeds from God, it comes from
thence.</p>
<p>And the cloud was bright. For “while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
them; and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased; hear ye Him.”2201</p>
<p>For as, when He threatens, He shows a dark cloud;—as on Mount Sinai; for “Moses,”
it is said, “entered into the cloud, and into the thick darkness; and as a vapor, so went up
the smoke;”2202and the prophet said, when speaking of His threatening, “Dark water in
clouds of the air;”2203—so here, because it was His desire not to alarm, but to teach, it is a
bright cloud.</p>

<p>And whereas Peter had said “Let us make three tabernacles,” He showed a tabernacle
not made with hands. Wherefore in that case it was smoke, and vapor of a furnace; but in
this, light unspeakable and a voice.</p>
<p>Then, to signify that not merely concerning some one of the three was it spoken, but
concerning Christ only; when the voice was uttered, they were taken away. For by no means,
had it been spoken merely concerning any one of them, would this man have remained
alone, the two being severed from Him.</p>
<p>Why then did not the cloud likewise receive Christ alone, but all of them together? If it
had received Christ alone, He would have been thought to have Himself uttered the voice.
Wherefore also the evangelist, making sure this same point, saith, that the voice was from
the cloud, that is, from God.</p>
<p>And what saith the voice? “This is my beloved Son.” Now if He is beloved, fear not thou,
O Peter. For thou oughtest indeed to know His power already, and to be fully assured
touching His resurrection; but since thou knowest not, at least from the voice of the Father
take courage. For if God be mighty, as surely He is mighty, very evidently the Son is so
likewise. Be not afraid then of those fearful things.</p>
<p>But if as yet thou receive it not, consider at least that other fact, that He is both a Son,
and is beloved. For “This,” it is said, “is My beloved Son.” Now if He is beloved, fear not.
For no one gives up one whom he loves. Be not thou therefore confounded; though thou
lovest Him beyond measure, thou lovest Him not as much as He that begat Him.</p>
<p>“In whom I am well pleased.” For not because He begat Him only, doth He love Him,
but because He is also equal to Him in all respects, and of one mind with Him. So that the
charm of love is twofold, or rather even threefold, because He is the Son, because He is beloved,
because in Him He is well pleased.</p>
<p>But what means, “In whom I am well pleased?” As though He had said, “In whom I am
refreshed, in whom I take delight;” because He is in all respects perfectly equal with Himself,
and there is but one will in Him and in the Father, and though He continue a Son, He is in
all respects one with the Father.</p>
<p>“Hear ye Him.” So that although He choose to be crucified, you are not to oppose Him.</p>
<p>6. “And when they heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came
and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. And when they lifted up their eyes,
they saw no man, save Jesus only.”2204</p>
<p>How was it that, when they heard these words, they were dismayed? And yet before this
also a like voice was uttered at Jordan, and a multitude was present, and no one felt anything
of the kind; and afterwards again, when also they said, “It thundered,”2205yet neither at that

time did they experience anything like this. How then did they fall down in the mount?
Because there was solitude, and height, and great quietness, and a transfiguration full of
awe, and a pure light, and a cloud stretched out; all which things put them in great alarm.
And the amazement came thick on every side, and they fell down both in fear at once and
in adoration.</p>
<p>But that the fear abiding so long might not drive out their recollection, presently He
puts an end to their alarm, and is seen Himself alone, and commands them to tell no man
this, until He is risen from the dead.</p>
<p>For “as they came down from the mount, He charged them to tell the vision to no man,
until He were risen from the dead.”2206what they were about.</p>
<p>7. Nothing then is more blessed than the apostles, and especially the three, who even in
the cloud were counted worthy to be under the same roof with the Lord.</p>
<p>But if we will, we also shall behold Christ, not as they then on the mount, but in far
greater brightness. For not thus shall He come hereafter. For whereas then, to spare His
disciples, He discovered so much only of His brightness as they were able to bear; hereafter
He shall come in the very glory of the Father, not with Moses and Elias only, but with the
infinite host of the angels, with the archangels, with the cherubim, with those infinite tribes,
not having a cloud over His head, but even heaven itself being folded up.</p>
<p>For as it is with the judges; when they judge publicly, the attendants drawing back the
curtains show them to all; even so then likewise all men shall see Him sitting, and all the
human race shall stand by, and He will make answers to them by Himself; and to some He
will say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat;”2207to
others, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things,
I will set thee over many things.”2208</p>
<p>And again passing an opposite sentence, to some He will answer, “Depart into the
everlasting fire, that is prepared for the devil and his angels,”2209and to others, “O thou
wicked and slothful servants.”2210 And some He will “cut asunder,” and “deliver to the
tormentors;” but others He will command to “be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer
darkness.”2211 And after the axe the furnace will follow; and all out of the net, that is cast
away, will fall therein.</p>

<p>“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun;”2212or rather more than the sun. But
so much is said, not because their light is to be so much and no more, but since we know
no other star brighter than this, He chose by the known example to set forth the future
brightness of the saints.</p>
<p>Since on the mount too, when He says, “He did shine as the sun,” for the same cause
did He so speak. For that the comparison did not come up to His light, the apostles showed
by falling down. For had the brightness not been unalloyed, but comparable to the sun; they
would not have fallen, but would easily have borne it.</p>
<p>The righteous therefore will shine as the sun, and more than the sun in that time; but
the sinners shall suffer all extremities. Then will there be no need of records, proofs, witnesses.
For He who judges is Himself all, both witness, and proof, and judge. For He knows all
things exactly; “For all things are naked and opened unto His eyes.”2213</p>
<p>No man will there appear rich or poor, mighty or weak, wise or unwise, bond or free;
but these masks will be dashed in pieces, and the inquiry will be into their works only. For
if in our courts, when any one is tried for usurpation, or murder, whatever he may be,
whether governor, or consul, or what you will, all these dignities fleet away, and he that is
convicted suffers the utmost penalty; much more will it be so there.</p>
<p>8. Therefore that this may not be so, let us lay aside our filthy garments, let us put on
the armor of light, and the glory of God will wrap us around. For what is even grievous in
the injunctions? or what is there not easy? Hear, for instance, the prophet speaking, and
then thou shalt know the easiness thereof. “Neither though thou bow as a collar thy neck,
and strew beneath thee sackcloth and ashes, not even so shalt thou call a fast acceptable; but
loose every bond of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive bargains.”2214</p>
<p>See a prophet’s wisdom, how stating first whatever was irksome, and removing it, he
exhorts them to obtain salvation by the duties that are easy; signifying, that God needs not
toils, but obedience.</p>
<p>Then implying that virtue is easy, but vice grievous and galling, he makes it out by the
bare names; “For,” saith he, “vice is a bond,” and “a twisted knot,” but virtue is a disengagement
and release from all these.</p>
<p>“Tear in sunder every unjust compact;” thus calling men’s bills about the interest due
to them, and the sums they have lent.
“Set at liberty them that are bruised;” them that are afflicted. For such a being is the
debtor; when he sees his creditor, his mind is broken, and he fears him more than a wild
beast.</p>

<p>“Bring in the poor that are cast out to thy house; if thou seest one naked, clothe him,
and them that belong to thy seed thou shalt not overlook.”2215</p>
<p>Now in our late discourse which we made unto you when declaring the rewards, we
showed the wealth arising from these acts; but now let us see if any of the injunctions be
grievous, and transcending our nature. Nay, nothing of the kind shall we discover, but quite
the contrary; that while these courses are very easy, those of vice are full of labor. For what
is more vexatious than to be lending, and taking thought about usuries and bargains, and
demanding sureties, and fearing and trembling about securities, about the principal, about
the writings, about the interest, about the bondsmen?</p>
<p>For such is the nature of worldly things; yea, nothing is so unsound and suspicious as
that which is accounted security, and contrived for that purpose; but to show mercy is easy,
and delivers from all anxiety.</p>
<p>Let us not then traffic in other men’s calamities, nor make a trade of our benevolence.
And I know indeed that many hear these words with displeasure; but what is the profit of
silence? For though I should hold my peace, and give no trouble by my words, I could not
by this silence deliver you from your punishment; rather it has altogether the opposite result;
the penalty is enhanced, and not to you only, but to me also, doth such a silence procure
punishment. What then signify our gracious words, when in our works they help us not,
but rather do harm? What is the good of delighting men in word, while we vex them in
deed, bringing pleasure to the ears, and punishment to the soul? Wherefore I must needs
make you sorry here, that we may not suffer punishment there.</p>
<p>9. For indeed a dreadful disease, beloved, dreadful and needing much attendance, hath
fallen on the church. Those, namely, who are enjoined not even by honest labors to lay up
treasures, but to open their houses to the needy, make a profit of other men’s poverty, devising
a specious robbery, a plausible covetousness.</p>
<p>For tell me not of the laws that are without; since even the publican fulfills the law that
is without, but nevertheless is punished: which will be the case with us also, unless we refrain
from oppressing the poor, and from using their need and necessity as an occasion for
shameless trafficking.</p>
<p>For to this intent thou hast wealth, to relieve poverty, not to make a gain of poverty; but
thou with show of relief makest the calamity greater, and sellest benevolence for money.
Sell it, I forbid thee not, but for a heavenly kingdom. Receive not a small price for so good
a deed, thy monthly one in the hundred,2216but that immortal life. Why art thou beggarly,
and poor, and mean, selling thy great things for a little, even for goods that perish, when it
should be for an everlasting kingdom? Why dost thou leave God, and get human gains?

Why dost thou pass by the wealthy one, and trouble him that hath not? and leaving the sure
paymaster make thy bargain with the unthankful? The other longs to repay, but this even
grudges in the act of repaying. This hardly repays a hundredth part, but the other “an hundredfold
and eternal life.” This with insults and revilings, but the other with praises and
auspicious words. This stirs up envy against thee, but the other even weaves for thee crowns.
This hardly here, but the other both there and here.</p>
<p>Surely then is it not the utmost senselessness, not so much as to know how to gain? How
many have lost their very principal for the interest’s sake? How many have fallen into perils
for usurious gains. How many have involved both themselves and others in extreme poverty
through their unspeakable covetousness!</p>
<p>For tell me not this, that he is pleased to receive, and is thankful for the loan. Why, this
is a result of thy cruelty. Since Abraham too,2217contriving how his plan might take with
the barbarians, did himself give up his wife to them; not however willingly, but through fear
of Pharaoh. So also the poor man, because thou countest him not even worth so much
money, is actually compelled to be thankful for cruelty.</p>
<p>And it seems to me as though, shouldest thou deliver him from dangers, thou wouldest
exact of him a payment for this deliverance. “Away,” saith he; “let it not be.” What sayest
thou? Delivering him from the greater evil, thou art unwilling to exact money, and for the
lesser dost thou display so much inhumanity?</p>
<p>Seest thou not how great a punishment is appointed for the deed? hearest thou not that
even in the old law this is forbidden?2218 But what is the plea of the many? “When I have
received the interest, I give to the poor;” one tells me. Speak reverently, O man; God desires
not such sacrifices. Deal not subtilly with the law. Better not give to a poor man, than give
from that source; for the money that hath been collected by honest labors, thou often makest
to become unlawful because of that wicked increase; as if one should compel a fair womb
to give birth to scorpions.</p>
<p>And why do I speak of God’s law? Do not even ye call it “filth”? But if ye, the gainers,
give your voice so, consider what suffrage God will pass upon you.</p>
<p>And if thou wilt ask the Gentile lawgivers too, thou wilt be told that even by them this
thing is deemed a proof of the most utter shamelessness. Those, for example, who are in
offices of honor, and belong to the great council, which they call the senate, may not legally
disgrace themselves with such gains; there being a law among them which prohibits the
same.2219</p>

forbidden; but most or all of them seem to be speaking of exorbitant interest, or of lending to the poor.</note>

<p>How then is it not a horrible thing, if thou ascribe not even so much honor to the polity
of Heaven, as the legislators to the council of the Romans; but Heaven is to obtain less than
earth, and thou art not ashamed even of the very folly of the thing? For what could be more
foolish than this, unless one without land, rain, or plough, were to insist upon sowing?2220
Tares therefore, to be committed to the fire, do they reap, who have devised this evil husbandry.</p>
<p>Why, are there not many honest trades? in the fields, the flocks, the herds, the breeding
of cattle, in handicrafts, in care of property? Why rave and be frantic, cultivating thorns for
no good? What if the fruits of the earth are subject to mischance; hail, and blight, and excessive
rain? yet not to such an extent as are money dealings. For in whatsoever cases of that
sort occur, the damage of course concerns the produce, but the principal remains, I mean,
the land. But herein many often have suffered shipwreck in their principal; and before the
loss too they are in continual dejection. For never doth the money-lender enjoy his possessions,
nor find pleasure in them; but when the interest is brought, he rejoices not that he
hath received gain, but is grieved that the interest hath not yet come up to the principal.
And before this evil offspring is brought forth complete, he compels it also to bring
forth,2221making the interest principal, and forcing it to bring forth its untimely and
abortive brood of vipers. For of this nature are the gains of usury; more than those wild
creatures do they devour and tear the souls of the wretched.2222 This “is the bond of iniquity:”
this “the twisted knot of oppressive bargains.”</p>
<p>Yea, “I give,” he seems to say, “not for thee to receive, but that thou mayest repay more.”
And whereas God commands not even to receive what is given (for “give,” saith He, “to
them from whom ye look not to receive”),2223thou requirest even more than is given, and
what thou gavest not, this as a debt, thou constrainest the receiver to pay.</p>
<p>And thou indeed supposest thy substance to be increased hereby, but instead of substance
thou art kindling the unquenchable fire.</p>
<p>That this therefore may not be, let us cut out the evil womb of usurious gains, let us
deaden these lawless travailings, let us dry up this place of pernicious teeming, and let us

<p>Matt. XVII. 10.</p>
<p>“And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?”</p>
<p>Not then from the Scriptures did they know this, but the Scribes used to explain themselves,
and this saying was reported abroad amongst the ignorant people; as about Christ
also.</p>
<p>Wherefore the Samaritan woman also said, “Messiah cometh; when He is come, He will
tell us all things:”2225and they themselves asked John, “Art thou Elias, or the Prophet?”2226
For the saying, as I said, prevailed, both that concerning the Christ and that concerning
Elias, not however rightly interpreted by them.</p>
<p>For the Scriptures speak of two advents of Christ, both this that is past, and that which
is to come; and declaring these Paul said, “The grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath
appeared, teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
and righteously, and godly.”2227 Behold the one, hear how he declares the other also; for
having said these things, he added, “Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of our great
God and Saviour Jesus Christ.”2228 And the prophets too mention both; of the one, however,
that is, of the second, they say Elias will be the forerunner. For of the first, John was forerunner;
whom Christ called also Elias, not because he was Elias, but because he was fulfilling
the ministry of that prophet. For as the one shall be forerunner of the second advent, so was
the other too of the first. But the Scribes, confusing these things and perverting the people,
made mention of that other only to the people, the second advent, and said, “If this man is
the Christ, Elias ought to have come beforehand.” Therefore the disciples too speak as follows,
“How then say the Scribes, Elias must first come?”</p>
<p>Therefore also the Pharisees sent unto John, and asked him, “Art thou Elias?”2229making
no mention anywhere of the former advent.</p>
<p>What then is the solution, which Christ alleged? “Elias indeed cometh then, before my
second advent; and now too is Elias come;” so calling John.</p>
<p>In this sense Elias is come: but if thou wouldest seek the Tishbite, he is coming.
Wherefore also He said, “Elias truly cometh, and shall restore all things.”2230 All what things?

Such as the Prophet Malachi spake of; for “I will send you,” saith He, “Elias the Tishbite,
who shall restore the heart of father to son, lest I come and utterly smite the earth.”2231</p>
<p>Seest thou the accuracy of prophetical language? how, because Christ called John, Elias,
by reasoning of their community of office, lest thou shouldest suppose this to be the meaning
of the prophet too in this place, He added His country also, saying, “the Tishbite;”2232whereas
John was not a Tishbite. And herewith He sets down another sign also, saying, “Lest I come
and utterly smite the earth,” signifying His second and dreadful advent. For in the first He
came not to smite the earth. For, “I came not,” saith He, “to judge the world, but to save the
world.”2233</p>
<p>To show therefore that the Tishbite comes before that other advent, which hath the
judgment, He said this. And the reason too of his coming He teaches withal. And what is
this reason? That when He is come, he may persuade the Jews to believe in Christ, and that
they may not all utterly perish at His coming. Wherefore He too, guiding them on to that
remembrance, saith, “And he shall restore all things;” that is, shall correct the unbelief of
the Jews that are then in being.
Hence the extreme accuracy of his expression; in that he said not, “He will restore the
heart of the son to the father,” but “of the father to the son.”2234 For the Jews being fathers
of the apostles, his meaning is, that he will restore to the doctrines of their sons, that is, of
the apostles, the hearts of the fathers, that is, the Jewish people’s mind.2235
“But I say unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done
unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer of them. Then
they understood that He spake to them of John.”2236
And yet neither the Scribes said this, nor the Scriptures; but because now they were
sharper and more attentive to His sayings, they quickly caught His meaning.
And whence did the disciples know this? He had already told them, “He is Elias, which
was for to come;”2237but here, that he hath come; and again, that “Elias cometh and will

restore all things.” But be not thou troubled, nor imagine that His statement wavers, though
at one time He said, “he will come,” at another, “he hath come.” For all these things are true.
Since when He saith, “Elias indeed cometh, and will restore all things,” He means Elias
himself, and the conversion of the Jews which is then to take place; but when He saith,
“Which was for to come,” He calls John, Elias, with regard to the manner of his administration.
Yea, and so the prophets used to call every one of their approved kings, David;2238and
the Jews, “rulers of Sodom,”2239and “sons of Ethiopians;”2240because of their ways. For as
the other shall be forerunner of the second advent, so was this of the first.</p>
<p>2. And not for this only doth He call him Elias everywhere, but to signify His perfect
agreement with the Old Testament, and that this advent too is according to prophecy.
Wherefore also He adds again, “He came, and they knew him not, but have done unto
him all things whatsoever they listed.”2241 What means, “call things whatsoever they listed?”
They cast him into prison, they used him despitefully, they slew him, they brought his head
in a charger.</p>
<p>“Likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer of them.” Seest thou how again He in due
season reminds them of His passion, laying up for them great store of comfort from the
passion of John. And not in this way only, but also by presently working great miracles. Yea,
and whensoever He speaks of His passion, presently He works miracles, both after those
sayings and before them; and in many places one may find Him to have kept this rule.</p>
<p>“Then,” for instance, it saith, “He began to signify how that He must go unto Jerusalem,
and be killed, and suffer many things.”2242“Then:” when? when He was confessed to be
Christ, and the Son of God.</p>
<p>Again on the mountain, when He had shown them the marvellous vision, and the
prophets had been discoursing of His glory, He reminded them of His passion. For having
spoken of the history concerning John, He added, “Likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer
of them.”</p>
<p>And after a little while again, when He had cast out the devil, which His disciples were
not able to cast out; for then too, “As they abode in Galilee,” so it saith, “Jesus said unto
them, The Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinful2243men, and they shall kill
Him, and the third day He shall rise again.”2244</p>

<p>Now in doing this, He by the greatness of the miracles was abating the excess of their
sorrow, and in every way consoling them; even as here also, by the mention of John’s death,
He afforded them much consolation.</p>
<p>But should any one say, “Wherefore did He not even now raise up Elias and send him,
witnessing as He doth so great good of his coming?” we should reply, that even as it was,
while thinking Christ to be Elias, they did not believe Him. For “some say,” such are the
words, “that Thou art Elias, and others, Jeremias.”2245 And indeed between John and Elias,
there was no difference but the time only. “Then how will they believe at that time?” it may
be said. Why, “he will restore all things,” not simply by being recognized, but also because
the glory of Christ will have been growing more intense up to that day, and will be among
all clearer than the sun. When therefore, preceded by such an opinion and expectation, he
comes making the same proclamation as John, and himself also announcing Jesus, they will
more easily receive his sayings. But in saying, “They knew him not,” He is excusing also
what was done in His own case.2246</p>
<p>And not in this way only doth He console them, but also by pointing out that John’s
sufferings at their hands, whatever they are, are undeserved; and by His throwing into the
shade what would annoy them, by means of two signs, the one on the mountain, the other
just about to take place.</p>
<p>But when they heard these things, they do not ask Him when Elias cometh; being
straitened either by grief at His passion, or by fear. For on many occasions, upon seeing
Him unwilling to speak a thing clearly, they are silent, and so an end. For instance, when
during their abode in Galilee He said, “The Son of Man shall be betrayed, and they shall kill
Him;”2247it is added by Mark, “That they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask
Him;”2248by Luke, “That it was hid from them, that they might not perceive it, and they
feared to ask Him of that saying.”2249</p>
<p>3. “And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man, kneeling
down to Him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic, and sore
vexed;2250for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. And I brought him
unto Thy disciples, and they could not cure him.”2251</p>

<p>This man the Scripture signifies to be exceedingly weak in faith; and this is many ways
evident; from Christ’s saying, “All things are possible to him that believeth;”2252from the
saying of the man himself that approached, “Help Thou mine unbelief:”2253from Christ’s
commanding the devil to “enter no more into him;”2254and from the man’s saying again to
Christ, “If Thou canst.”2255“Yet if his unbelief was the cause,” it may be said, “that the devil
went not out, why doth He blame the disciples?” Signifying, that even without persons to
bring the sick in faith, they might in many instances work a cure. For as the faith of the
person presenting oftentimes availed for receiving the cure, even from inferior ministers;
so the power of the doers oftentimes sufficed, even without belief in those who came to work
the miracle.</p>
<p>And both these things are signified in the Scripture. For both they of the company of
Cornelius by their faith drew unto themselves the grace of the Spirit; and in the case of
Eliseus2256again, when none had believed, a dead man rose again. For as to those that cast
him down, not for faith but for cowardice did they cast him, unintentionally and by chance,
for fear of the band of robbers, and so they fled: while the person himself that was cast in
was dead, yet by the mere virtue of the holy body the dead man arose.</p>
<p>Whence it is clear in this case, that even the disciples were weak; but not all; for the
pillars2257were not present there. And see this man’s want of consideration, from another
circumstance again, how before the multitude he pleads to Jesus against His disciples, saying,
“I brought him to Thy disciples, and they could not cure him.”</p>
<p>But He, acquitting them of the charges before the people, imputes the greater part to
him. For, “O faithless and perverse generation,” these are His words, “how long shall I be
with you?”2258not aiming at his person only, lest He should confound the man, but also at
all the Jews. For indeed many of those present might probably be offended, and have undue
thoughts of them.</p>
<p>But when He said, “How long shall I be with you,” He indicates again death to be welcome
to Him, and the thing an object of desire, and His departure longed for, and that not
crucifixion, but being with them, is grievous.</p>
<p>He stopped not however at the accusations; but what saith He? “Bring him hither to

for His disciples, and leading the other to a good hope, and that he might believe in his attaining
deliverance from the evil.</p>
<p>And He suffers him to be torn, not for display (accordingly, when a crowd began to
gather, He proceeded to rebuke him), but for the father’s own sake, that when he should
see the evil spirit disturbed at Christ’s mere call, so at least, if in no other way, he might be
led to believe the coming miracle.</p>
<p>And because he had said, “Of a child,” and, “If thou canst help me,” Christ saith, “To
him that believeth, all things are possible,”2260again giving the complaint a turn against
him. And whereas when the leper said, “If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me
clean,”2261bearing witness to His authority Christ commending him, and confirming His
words, said, “I will, be thou clean;” in this man’s case, upon his uttering a speech in no way
worthy of His power,—“If Thou canst, help me,”—see how He corrects it, as not rightly
spoken. For what saith He? “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”
2262 What He saith is like this: “Such abundance of power is with me, that I can
even make others work these miracles. So that if thou believe as one ought, even thou thyself
art able,” saith He, “to heal both this one, and many others.” And having thus said, He set
free the possessed of the devil.</p>
<p>But do thou not only from this observe His providence and His beneficence, but also
from that other time, during which He allowed the devil to be in him. Since surely, unless
the man had been favored with much providential care even then, he would have perished
long ago; for “it cast him both into the fire,” so it is said, “and into the water.” And he that
dared this would assuredly have destroyed the man too, unless even in so great madness
God had put on him His strong curb: as indeed was the case with those naked men that
were running in the deserts and cutting themselves with stones.</p>
<p>And if he call him “a lunatic,” trouble not thyself at all, for it is the father of the possessed
who speaks the word. How then saith the evangelist also, “He healed many that were lunatic?”
2263 Denominating them according to the impression of the multitude. For the evil
spirit, to bring a reproach upon nature,2264by wine? For the weaker the vessel, the more
entire the shipwreck, whether she be free or a slave. For the free woman behaves herself

midst of the slaves, and they cause the gifts of God to be blasphemously spoken of by foolish
men.</p>
<p>For instance, I hear many say, when these excesses happen, “Would there were no wine.”
O folly! O madness! When other men sin, dost thou find fault with God’s gifts? And what
great madness is this? What? did the wine, O man, produce this evil? Not the wine, but the
intemperance of such as take an evil delight in it. Say then, “Would there were no drunkenness,
no luxury;” but if thou say, “Would there were no wine,” thou wilt say, going on by
degrees, “Would there were no steel, because of the murderers; no night, because of the
thieves; no light, because of the informers; no women, because of adulteries;” and, in a word,
thou wilt destroy all.</p>
<p>But do not so; for this is of a satanical mind; do not find fault with the wine, but with
the drunkenness; and when thou hast found this self-same man sober, sketch out all his
unseemliness, and say unto him, Wine was given, that we might be cheerful, not that we
might behave ourselves unseemly; that we might laugh, not that we might be a laughingstock;
that we might be healthful, not that we might be diseased; that we might correct the weakness
of our body, not cast down the might of our soul.</p>
<p>God honored thee with the gift, why disgrace thyself with the excess thereof? Hear what
Paul saith, “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.”2265 But if
that saint, even when oppressed with disease, and enduring successive sicknesses, partook
not of wine, until his Teacher suffered him; what excuse shall we have, who are drunken
in health? To him indeed He said, “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake;” but to each of
you who are drunken, He will say, “Use little wine, for thy fornications, thy frequent filthy
talking, for the other wicked desires to which drunkenness is wont to give birth.” But if ye
are not willing, for these reasons, to abstain; at least on account of the despondencies which
come of it, and the vexations, do ye abstain. For wine was given for gladness, “Yea, wine,”
so it is said, “maketh glad the heart of man:”2266but ye mar even this excellence in it. For
what kind of gladness is it to be beside one’s self, and to have innumerable vexations, and
to see all things whirling round, and to be oppressed with giddiness, and like those that have
a fever, to require some who may drench their heads with oil?2267</p>
<p>6. These things are not said by me to all: or rather they are said to all, not because all
are drunken, God forbid; but because they who do not drink take no thought of the drunken.
Therefore even against you do I rather inveigh, that are in health; since the physician too

leaves the sick, and addresses his discourse to them that are sitting by them. To you therefore
do I direct my speech, entreating you neither to be at any time over-taken by this passion,
and to draw up2268as by cords those who have been so overtaken, that they be not found
worse than the brutes. For they indeed seek nothing more than what is needful, but these
have become even more brutish than they, overpassing the boundaries of moderation. For
how much better is the ass than these men? how much better the dog! For indeed each of
these animals, and of all others, whether it need to eat, or to drink, acknowledges sufficiency
for a limit, and goes not on beyond what it needs; and though there are innumerable persons
to constrain, it will not endure to go on to excess.</p>
<p>In this respect then we are worse even than the brutes, by the judgment not of them
that are in health only, but even by our own. For that ye have judged yourselves to be baser
than both dogs and asses,2269revealed to Peter, He doth hereby again confirm. And neither
at this did He stop, but by His very condescension declares this self-same truth; an instance
of exceeding wisdom.</p>
<p>For after thus speaking, He saith, “But lest we should offend them, go thou and cast an
hook into the sea, and take up the fish that first cometh up, and thou shalt find therein a
piece of money;2270that take, and give unto them for me and thee.”2271</p>
<p>See how He neither declines the tribute, nor simply commands to pay it, but having
first proved Himself not liable to it, then He gives it: the one to save the people, the other,
those around Him, from offense. For He gives it not at all as a debt, but as doing the
best2272for their weakness. Elsewhere, however, He despises the offense, when He was discoursing
of meats,2273teaching us to know at what seasons we ought to consider them that
are offended, and at what to disregard them.</p>
<p>And indeed by the very mode of giving He discloses Himself again. For wherefore doth
He not command him to give of what they have laid up? That, as I have said, herein also He
might signify Himself to be God of all, and the sea also to be under His rule. For He had
indeed signified this even already, by His rebuke, and by His commanding this same Peter
to walk on the waves; but He now again signifies the self-same thing, though in another
way, yet so as to cause herein great amazement. For neither was it a small thing, to foretell
that the first, who out of those depths should come in his way, would be the fish that would
pay the tribute; and having cast forth His commandment like a net into that abyss, to bring

up the one that bore the piece of money; but it was of a divine and unutterable power, thus
to make even the sea bear gifts, and that its subjection to Him should be shown on all hands,
as well when in its madness it was silent,2274and when, though fierce, it received its fellow
servant;2275as now again, when it makes payment in His behalf to them that are demanding
it.</p>
<p>“And give unto them,” He saith, “for me and thee.” Seest thou the exceeding greatness
of the honor? See also the self-command of Peter’s mind. For this point Mark, the follower
of this apostle, doth not appear to have set down, because it indicated the great honor paid
to him; but while of the denial he wrote as well as the rest, the things that make him illustrious
he hath passed over in silence, his master perhaps entreating him not to mention the great
things about himself. And He used the phrase, “for me and thee,” because Peter too was a
firstborn child.</p>
<p>Now as thou art amazed at Christ’s power, so I bid thee admire also the disciple’s faith,
that to a thing beyond possibility he so gave ear. For indeed it was very far beyond possibility
by nature. Wherefore also in requital for his faith, He joined him to Himself in the payment
of the tribute.</p>
<p>3. “In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?”2276</p>
<p>The disciples experienced some feeling of human weakness; wherefore the evangelist
also adds this note, saying, “In that hour;” when He had preferred him to all. For of James
too, and John, one was a firstborn son, but no such thing as this had He done for them.</p>
<p>Then, being ashamed to avow their feeling, they say not indeed openly, “Wherefore hast
thou preferred Peter to us?” or, “Is he greater than we are?” for they were ashamed; but indefinitely
they ask, “Who then is greater?” For when they saw the three preferred, they felt
nothing of the kind; but now that the honor had come round to one, they were vexed. And
not for this only, but there were many other things which they put together to kindle that
feeling. For to him He had said, “I will give thee the keys;”2277to him, “Blessed art thou, Simon
Barjona;” to him here, “Give unto them for me and thee;” and seeing too in general how
freely he was allowed to speak, it somewhat fretted them.</p>
<p>And if Mark saith,2278that they did not ask, but reasoned in themselves, that is nothing
contrary to this. For it is likely that they did both the one and the other, and whereas before,
<note type="footnote">2274 Matt. viii. 26.</note>

<pb n="624"/>
on another occasion, they had had this feeling, both once and twice, that now they did both
declare it, and reason among themselves.</p>
<p>But to thee I say, “Look not to the charge against them only, but consider this too; first,
that they seek none of the things of this world; next, that even this passion they afterwards
laid aside, and give up the first place one to another.” But we are not able to attain so much
as unto their faults, neither do we seek, “who is greatest2279in the kingdom of heaven;” but,
who is greatest2280in the earthly kingdom, who is wealthiest, who most powerful.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? He unveils their conscience, and replies to their feeling, not
merely to their words. “For He called a little child unto Him,” saith the Scripture, “and said,
Except ye be converted, and become as this little child, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven.”2281“Why, you,” He saith, “inquire who is greatest, and are contentious for first
honors; but I pronounce him, that is not become lowest of all, unworthy so much as to enter
in thither.”</p>
<p>And full well doth He both allege that pattern, and not allege it only, but also set the
child in the midst, by the very sight abashing them, and persuading them to be in like
manner lowly and artless. Since both from envy the little child is pure, and from vainglory,
and from longing for the first place; and he is possessed of the greatest of virtues, simplicity,
and whatever is artless and lowly.</p>
<p>Not courage then only is wanted, nor wisdom, but this virtue also, humility I mean, and
simplicity. Yea, and the things that belong to our salvation halt even in the chiefest point,
if these be not with us.</p>
<p>The little child, whether it be insulted and beaten, or honored and glorified, neither by
the one is it moved to impatience or envy, nor by the other lifted up.</p>
<p>Seest thou how again He calls us on to all natural excellencies, indicating that of free
choice it is possible to attain them, and so silences the wicked frenzy of the Manichæans?
For if nature be an evil thing, wherefore doth He draw from hence His patterns of severe
goodness?</p>
<p>And the child which He set in the midst I suppose to have been a very young child indeed,
free from all these passions. For such a little child is free from pride and the mad desire of
glory, and envy, and contentiousness, and all such passions, and having many virtues, simplicity,
humility, unworldliness,2282prides itself upon none of them; which is a twofold
severity of goodness; to have these things, and not to be puffed up about them.</p>

<pb n="625"/>
<p>Wherefore He brought it in, and set it in the midst; and not at this merely did He conclude
His discourse, but carries further this admonition, saying, “And whoso shall receive
such a little child in my name, receiveth me.”2283</p>
<p>“For know,” saith He, “that not only, if ye yourselves become like this, shall ye receive
a great reward; but also if for my sake ye honor others who are such, even for your honor
to them do I appoint unto you a kingdom as your recompence.” Or rather, He sets down
what is far greater, saying, “he receiveth me. So exceedingly dear to me is all that is lowly
and artless.” For by “a little child,” here, He means the men that are thus simple and lowly,
and abject and contemptible in the judgment of the common sort.</p>
<p>4. After this, to obtain yet more acceptance for His saying, He establishes it not by the
honor only, but also by the punishment, going on to say, “And whoso shall offend one of
these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
he were drowned in the depth of the sea.”2284</p>
<p>“For as they,” saith He, “who honor these for my sake, have heaven, or rather an honor
greater than the very kingdom; even so they likewise who dishonor them (for this is to offend
them), shall suffer the extremity of punishment. And marvel thou not at His calling the affront
“an offense;”2285for many feeble-minded persons have suffered no ordinary offense
from being treated with slight and insult. To heighten therefore and aggravate the blame,
He states the mischief arising therefrom.</p>
<p>And He doth not go on to express the punishment in the same way, but from the things
familiar to us, He indicates how intolerable it is. For when He would touch the grosser sort
most sharply, He brings sensible images. Wherefore here also, meaning to indicate the
greatness of the punishment they shall undergo, and to strike into the arrogance of those
that despise them, He brought forward a kind of sensible punishment, that of the millstone,
and of the drowning. Yet surely it were suitable to what had gone before to have said, “He
that receiveth not one of these little ones, receiveth not me;” a thing bitterer than any punishment;
but since the very unfeeling, and exceeding gross, were not so much penetrated
by this, terrible as it is, He puts “a millstone,” and “a drowning.” And He said not, “A millstone
shall be hanged about his neck,” but, “It were better for him”2286to undergo this; im-

plying that another evil, more grievous than this, awaits him; and if this be unbearable, much
more that.</p>
<p>Seest thou how in both respects He made His threat terrible, first by the comparison
with the known image rendering it more distinct, then by the excess on its side presenting
it to the fancy as far greater than that visible one. Seest thou how He plucks up by the root
the spirit of arrogance; how He heals the ulcer of vainglory; how He instructs us in nothing
to set our heart on the first honors; how He persuades such as covet them in everything to
follow after the lowest place?</p>
<p>5. For nothing is worse than arrogance.2287 This even takes men out of their natural
senses, and brings upon them the character of fools; or rather, it really makes them to be
utterly like idiots.</p>
<p>For like as, if any one, being three cubits in stature, were to strive to be higher than the
mountains, or actually to think it, and draw himself up, as overpassing their summits, we
should seek no other proof of his being out of his senses; so also when thou seest a man arrogant,
and thinking himself superior to all, and accounting it a degradation to live with
other people, seek not thou after that to see any other proof of that man’s madness. Why,
he is much more ridiculous than any natural fool, inasmuch as he absolutely creates this his
disease on purpose. And not in this only is he wretched, but because he doth without feeling
it fall into the very gulf of wickedness.</p>
<p>For when will such an one come to due knowledge of any sin? when will he perceive
that he is offending? Nay, rather he is as a vile and captive slave, whom the devil having
caught goes off with, and makes him altogether a prey, buffetting him on every side, and
encompassing him with ten thousand insults.</p>
<p>For unto such great folly doth he lead them in the end, as to get them to be haughty towards
their children, and wives, and towards their own forefathers. And others, on the
contrary, He causes to be puffed up by the distinction of their ancestors. Now, what can be
more foolish than this? when from opposite causes people are alike puffed up, the one sort
because they had mean persons for fathers, grandfathers, and ancestors; and the other because
theirs were glorious and distinguished? How then may one abate in each case the swelling
sore? By saying to these last, “Go farther back than your grandfather, and immediate ancestors,
and you will find perchance many cooks, and drivers of asses, and shopkeepers:” but
to the former, that are puffed up by the meanness of their forefathers, the contrary again;
“And thou again, if thou proceed farther up among thy forefathers, wilt find many far more
illustrious than thou art.”</p>
<p>For that nature hath this course, come let me prove it to thee even from the Scriptures.
Solomon was son of a king, and of an illustrious king, but that king’s father was one of the
<note type="footnote">2287 ἀπονοα.</note>

<pb n="627"/>
vile and ignoble. And his grandfather on his mother’s side in like manner; for else he would
not have given his daughter to a mere soldier. And if thou wert to go up again higher from
these mean persons, thou wilt see the race more illustrious and royal. So in Saul’s case too,
so in many others also, one shall come to this result. Let us not then pride ourselves herein.
For what is birth? tell me. Nothing, but a name only without a substance; and this ye will
know in that day. But because that day is not yet come, let us now even from the things
present persuade you, that hence arises no superiority. For should war overtake us, should
famine, should anything else, all these inflated conceits of noble birth are put to the proof:
should disease, should pestilence come upon us, it knows not how to distinguish between
the rich and the poor, the glorious and inglorious, the high born and him that is not such;
neither doth death, nor the other reverses of fortune, but they all rise up alike against all;
and if I may say something that is even marvellous, against the rich more of the two. For by
how much they are less exercised in these things, so much the more do they perish, when
overtaken by them. And the fear too is greater with the rich. For none so tremble at princes
as they; and at multitudes, not less than at princes, yea rather much more; many such houses
in fact have been subverted alike by the wrath of multitudes and the threatening of princes.
But the poor man is exempt from both these kinds of troubled waters.</p>
<p>6. Wherefore let alone this nobility, and if thou wouldest show me that thou art noble,
show the freedom of thy soul, such as that blessed man had (and he a poor man), who said
to Herod, “It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife;”2288such as he was
possessed of, who before him was like him, and after him shall be so again; who said to
Ahab, “I do not trouble Israel, but thou, and thy father’s house;”2289such as the prophets
had, such as all the apostles.</p>
<p>But not like this are the souls of them that are slaves to wealth, but as they that are under
ten thousand tutors, and taskmasters, so these dare not so much as lift up their eye, and
speak boldly in behalf of virtue. For the love of riches, and that of glory, and that of other
things, looking terribly on them, make them slavish flatterers; there being nothing which
so takes away liberty, as entanglement in worldly affairs, and the wearing what are accounted
marks of distinction. For such an one hath not one master, nor two, nor three, but ten
thousand.</p>
<p>And if ye would fain even number them, let us bring in some one of those that are in
honor in kings’ courts, and let him have both very much wealth, and great power, and a
birthplace excelling others, and distinction of ancestry, and let him be looked up to by all
men. Now then let us see, if this be not the very person to be more in slavery than all; and
let us set in comparison with him, not a slave merely, but a slave’s slave, for many though
<note type="footnote">2288 Mark vi. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">2289 1 Kings xviii. 18.</note>

<pb n="628"/>
servants have slaves. This slave’s slave then for his part hath but one master. And what
though that one be not a freeman? yet he is but one, and the other looks only to his pleasure.
For albeit his master’s master seem to have power over him, yet for the present he obeys
one only; and if matters between them two are well, he will abide in security all his life. But
our man hath not one or two only, but many, and more grievous masters. And first he is in
care about the sovereign himself. And it is not the same to have a mean person for a master,
as to have a king, whose ears are buzzed into by many, and who becomes a property now
to this set and now to that.</p>
<p>Our man, though conscious of nothing, suspects all; both his comrades and his subordinates;
both his friends and his enemies.</p>
<p>But the other man too, you may say, fears his master. But how is it the same thing, to
have one or many, to make one timorous? Or rather, if a man inquire carefully, he will not
find so much as one. How, and in what sense? Whereas that slave hath no one that desires
to put him out of that service of his, and to introduce himself (whence neither hath he any
one to plot against him therein); these have not even any other pursuit, but to unsettle him
that is more approved and more beloved by their ruler. Wherefore also he must needs flatter
all, his superiors, his equals, his friends. For where envy is, and love of glory, there even
sincere friendship has no strength. For as those of the same craft cannot love one another
with a perfect and genuine love, so is it with rivals in honor also, and with them that long
for the same among worldly objects. Whence also great is the war within.</p>
<p>Seest thou what a swarm of masters, and of hard masters? Wilt thou that I show thee
yet another, more grievous than this? They that are behind him, all of them strive to get
before him: all that are before him, to hinder him from coming nearer them, and passing
them by.</p>
<p>7. But O marvel! I undertook indeed to show you masters, but our discourse, we find,
coming on and waxing eager, hath performed more than my undertaking, pointing out foes
instead of masters; or rather the same persons both as foes and as masters. For while they
are courted like masters, they are terrible as foes, and they plot against us as enemies. When
then any one hath the same persons both as masters, and as enemies, what can be worse
than this calamity? The slave indeed, though he be subject to command, yet nevertheless
hath the advantage of care and good-will on the part of them who give him orders; but these,
while they receive commands, are made enemies, and are set one against another; and that
so much more grievously than those in battles, in that they both wound secretly, and in the
mask of friends they treat men as their enemies would do, and oftentimes make themselves
credit of the calamity of others.</p>
<p>But not such are our circumstances; rather should another fare ill, there are many to
grieve with him: should he obtain distinction, many to find pleasure with him. Not so again
the apostle: “For whether,” saith he, “one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or

<pb n="629"/>
one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.”2290 And the words of him who
gives these admonitions, are at one time, “What is my hope or joy? are not even ye?”2291at
another, “Now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord;”2292at another, “Out of much affliction
and anguish of heart I wrote unto you;”2293and, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is
offended, and I burn not?”2294</p>
<p>Wherefore then do we still endure the tempest and the billows of the world without,
and not run to this calm haven, and leaving the names of good things, go on to the very
things themselves? For glory, and dignity, and wealth, and credit, and all such things, are
names with them, but with us realities; just as the grievous things, death and dishonor and
poverty, and whatever else is like them, are names indeed with us, but realities with them.</p>
<p>And, if thou wilt, let us first bring forward glory, so lovely and desirable with all of them.
And I speak not of its being short-lived, and soon put out, but when it is in its bloom, then
show it me. Take not away the daubings and colored lines of the harlot, but bring her forward
decked out, and exhibit her to us, for me thereupon to expose her deformity. Well then, of
course thou wilt tell of her array, and her many lictors, and the heralds’ voice, and the
listening of all classes, and the silence kept by the populace, and the blows given to all that
come in one’s way, and the universal gazing. Are not these her splendors? Come then, let
us examine whether these things be not vain, and a mere unprofitable imagination. For
wherein is the person we speak of the better for these things, either in body, or in soul? for
this constitutes the man. Will he then be taller hereby, or stronger, or healthier, or swifter,
or will he have his senses keener, and more piercing? Nay, no one could say this. Let us go
then to the soul, if haply we may find there any advantage occurring herefrom. What then?
Will such a one be more temperate, more gentle, more prudent, through that kind of attendance?
By no means, but rather quite the contrary. For not as in the body, so also is the result
here. For there the body indeed gains nothing in respect of its proper excellence; but here
the mischief is not only the soul’s reaping no good fruit, but also its actually receiving much
evil therefrom: hurried as it is by such means into haughtiness, and vainglory, and folly, and
wrath, and ten thousand faults like them.</p>
<p>“But he rejoices,” thou wilt say, “and exults in these things, and they brighten him up.”
The crowning point2295of his evils lies in that word of thine, and the incurable part of the
disease. For he that rejoices in these things, would be unwilling however easily to be released

from that which is the ground of his evils; yea, he hath blocked up against himself the way
of healing by this delight. So that here most of all is the mischief, that he is not even pained,
but rather rejoices, when the diseases are growing upon him.</p>
<p>For neither is rejoicing always a good thing; since even thieves rejoice in stealing, and
an adulterer in defiling his neighbor’s marriage bed, and the covetous in spoiling by violence,
and the manslayer in murdering. Let us not then look whether he rejoice, but whether it be
for something profitable, lest2296perchance we find his joy to be such as that of the
adulterer and the thief.</p>
<p>For wherefore, tell me, doth he rejoice? For his credit with the multitude, because he
can puff himself up, and be gazed upon? Nay, what can be worse than this desire, and this
ill-placed fondness? or if it be no bad thing, ye must leave off deriding the vainglorious and
aspersing them with continual mockeries: ye must leave off uttering imprecations on the
haughty and contemptuous. But ye would not endure it. Well then, they too deserve plenty
of censure, though they have plenty of lictors. And all this I have said of the more tolerable
sort of rulers; since the greater part of them we shall find transgressing more grievously than
either robbers, or murderers, or adulterers, or spoilers of tombs, from not making a good
use of their power. For indeed both their thefts are more shameless, and their butcheries
more hardened, and their impurities far more enormous than the others; and they dig
through, not one wall, but estates and houses without end, their prerogative making it very
easy to them.</p>
<p>And they serve a most grievous servitude, both stooping basely under their passions,
2297and trembling at all their accomplices. For he only is free, and he only a ruler, and
more kingly than all kings, who is delivered from his passions.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us follow after the true freedom, and deliver ourselves
from the evil slavery, and let us account neither pomp of power nor dominion of wealth,
nor any other such thing, to be blessed; but virtue only. For thus shall we both enjoy security
here, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XVIII. 7.</p>
<p>Woe unto the world because of offenses:2298for it must needs be that offenses come: but woe
to that man by2299whom the offense cometh.”</p>
<p>“And if ‘it must needs be that offenses come,’” (some one of our adversaries may perchance
say), “why doth He lament over the world, when He ought rather to afford succor,
and to stretch forth His hand in its behalf? For this were the part of a physician, and a protector,
whereas the other might be looked for even from any ordinary person.”
What then could we possibly say, in answer to so shameless a tongue? nay what dost
thou seek for equal to this healing care of His? For indeed being God He became man for
thee, and took the form of a slave, and underwent all extremities, and left undone none of
those things which it concerned Him to do. But inasmuch as unthankful men were nothing
the better for this, He laments over them, for that after so much fostering care they continued
in their unsoundness.</p>
<p>It was like as if over the sick man, that had had the advantage of much attendance, and
who had not been willing to obey the rules of the physician, any one were to lament and
say, “Woe to such a man from his infirmity, which he has increased by his own remissness.”
But in that case indeed there is no advantage from the bewailing, but here this too is a kind
of healing treatment to foretell what would be, and to lament it. For many oftentimes,
though, when advised, they were nothing profited, yet, when mourned for, they amended.</p>
<p>For which reason most of all He used the word “Woe,” thoroughly to rouse them, and
to make them in earnest, and to work upon them to be wakeful. And at the same time He
shows forth the good will He had towards those very men and His own mildness, that He
mourns for them even when gainsaying, not taking mere disgust at it, but correcting them,
both with the mourning, and with the prediction, so as to win them over.</p>
<p>But how is this possible? he may say. For if “it must needs be that offenses come,” how
is it possible to escape these? Because that the offenses come indeed must needs be, but that
men should perish is not altogether of necessity. Like as though a physician should say (for
nothing hinders our using the same illustration again), it must needs be that this disease
should come on, but it is not a necessary consequence that he who gives heed should be of
course destroyed by the disease. And this He said, as I mentioned, to awaken together with
the others His disciples. For that they may not slumber, as sent unto peace and unto untroubled
life, He shows many wars close upon them, from without, from within. Declaring

this, Paul said, “Without were fightings, within were fears;”2300and, “In perils among false
brethren;”2301and in his discourse to the Milesians too He said, “Also of you shall some
arise speaking perverse things;”2302and He Himself too said, “The man’s foes shall be they
of his own household.”2303 But when He said, “It must needs be,” it is not as taking away
the power of choosing for themselves, nor the freedom of the moral principle, nor as placing
man’s life under any absolute constraint of circumstances, that He saith these things, but
He foretells what would surely be; and this Luke hath set forth in another form of expression,
“It is impossible but that offenses should come.”2304</p>
<p>But what are the offenses?2305 The hindrances on the right way. Thus also do those on
the stage call them that are skilled in those matters, them that distort their bodies.</p>
<p>It is not then His prediction that brings the offenses; far from it; neither because He
foretold it, therefore doth it take place; but because it surely was to be, therefore He foretold
it; since if those who bring in the offenses had not been minded to do wickedly, neither
would the offenses have come; and if they had not been to come, neither would they have
been foretold. But because those men did evil, and were incurably diseased, the offenses
came, and He foretells that which is to be.</p>
<p>But if these men had been kept right, it may be said, and there had been no one to bring
in an offense, would not this saying have been convicted of falsehood? By no means, for
neither would it have been spoken. For if all were to have been kept right, He would not
have said, “it must needs be that they come,” but because He foreknew they would be of
themselves incorrigible, therefore He said, the offenses will surely come.</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not take them out of the way? it may be said. Why, wherefore
should they have been taken out of the way? For the sake of them that are hurt? But not
thence is the ruin of them that are hurt, but from their own remissness. And the virtuous
prove it, who, so far from being injured thereby, are even in the greatest degree profited,
such as was Job, such as was Joseph, such as were all the righteous, and the apostles. But if
many perish, it is from their own slumbering. But if it were not so, but the ruin was the effect
of the offenses, all must have perished. And if there are those who escape, let him who doth
not escape impute it to himself. For the offenses, as I have said, awaken, and render more
quick-sighted, and sharper, not only him that is preserved; but even him that hath fallen
into them, if he rise up again quickly, for they render him more safe, and make him more

difficult to overcome; so that if we be watchful, no small profit do we reap from hence, even
to be continually awake. For if when we have enemies, and when so many dangers are
pressing upon us, we sleep, what should we be if living in security. Nay, if thou wilt, look at
the first man. For if having lived in paradise a short time, perchance not so much as a whole
day, and having enjoyed delights, he drove on to such a pitch of wickedness, as even to
imagine an equality with God, and to account the deceiver a benefactor, and not to keep to
one commandment; if he had lived the rest of his life also without affliction, what would he
not have done?</p>
<p>2. But when we say these things, they make other objections again, asking, And why did
God make him such? God did not make him such, far from it, since then neither would He
have punished him. For if we in those matters in which we are the cause, do not find fault
with our servant, much more will not the God of all. “But whence did this come to pass?”
one may say. Of himself and his own remissness. “What means, of himself?” Ask thyself.
For if it be not of themselves the bad are bad, do not punish thy servant nor reprove thy
wife for what errors she may commit, neither beat thy son, nor blame thy friend, nor hate
thine enemy that doth despite to thee: for all these deserve to be pitied, not to be punished,
unless they offend of themselves. “But I am not able to practise self-restraint,” one may say.
And yet, when thou perceivest the cause not to be with them, but of another necessity, thou
canst practise self-restraint. When at least a servant being taken with sickness doth not the
things enjoined him, so far from blaming thou dost rather excuse him. Thus thou art a
witness, that the one thing is of one’s self, the other not of one’s self. So that here too, if thou
knewest that he was wicked from being born such, so far from blaming, thou wouldest rather
have shown him indulgence. For surely, when thou makest him allowance for his illness, it
could not be that thou wouldest have refused to make allowance for God’s act of creation,
if indeed he had been made such from the very first.</p>
<p>And in another way too it is easy to stop the mouths of such men, for great is the
abounding power of the truth. For wherefore dost thou never find fault with thy servant,
because he is not of a beautiful countenance, that he is not of fine stature in his body, that
he is not able to fly? Because these things are natural. So then from blame against his nature
he is acquitted, and no man gainsays it. When therefore thou blamest, thou showest that
the fault is not of nature but of his choice. For if in those things, which we do not blame,
we bear witness that the whole is of nature, it is evident that where we reprove, we declare
that the offense is of the choice.</p>
<p>Do not then bring forward, I beseech thee, perverse reasonings, neither sophistries and
webs slighter than the spider’s, but answer me this again: Did God make all men? It is surely
plain to every man. How then are not all equal in respect of virtue and vice? whence are the
good, and gentle, and meek? whence are the worthless and evil? For if these things do not
require any purpose, but are of nature, how are the one this, the others that? For if by nature

<pb n="634"/>
all were bad, it were not possible for any one to be good, but if good by nature, then no one
bad. For if there were one nature of all men, they must needs in this respect be all one,
whether they were to be this, or whether they were to be that.</p>
<p>But if we should say that by nature the one are good, the other bad, which would not
be reasonable (as we have shown), these things must be unchangeable, for the things of
nature are unchangeable. Nay, mark. All mortals are also liable to suffering; and no one is
free from suffering, though he strive without end. But now we see of good many becoming
worthless, and of worthless good, the one through remissness, the other by earnestness;
which thing most of all indicates that these things do not come of nature.</p>
<p>For the things of nature are neither changed, nor do they need diligence for their acquisition.
For like as for seeing and hearing we do not need labor, so neither should we need
toils in virtue, if it had been apportioned by nature.</p>
<p>“But wherefore did He at all make worthless men, when He might have made all men
good? Whence then are the evil things?” saith he. Ask thyself; for it is my part to show they
are not of nature, nor from God.</p>
<p>“Come they then of themselves?” he saith. By no means. “But are they unoriginated?”
Speak reverently, O man, and start back from this madness, honoring with one honor God
and the evil things, and that honor the highest. For if they be unoriginate they are mighty,
and cannot so much as be plucked up, nor pass into annihilation. For that what is unoriginate
is imperishable, is surely manifest to all.</p>
<p>3. And whence also are there so many good, when evil hath such great power? how are
they that have an origin stronger than that which is unoriginate?</p>
<p>“But God destroys these things,” he saith. When? And how will He destroy what are of
equal honor, and of equal strength, and of the same age, as one might say, with Himself?</p>
<p>Oh malice of the devil! how great an evil hath he invented! With what blasphemy hath
he persuaded men to surround God! with what cloak of godliness hath he devised another
profane account? For desiring to show, that not of Him was the evil, they brought in another
evil doctrine, saying, that these things are unoriginate.</p>
<p>“Whence then are evils?” one may say. From willing and not willing. “But the very thing
of our willing and not willing, whence is it?” From ourselves. But thou dost the same in
asking, as if when thou hadst asked, whence is seeing and not seeing? then when I said, from
closing the eyes or not closing the eyes, thou wert to ask again; the very closing the eyes or
not, whence is it? then having heard that it was of ourselves, and our will, thou wert to seek
again another cause.</p>
<p>For evil is nothing else than disobedience to God. “Whence then,” one may say, “did
man find this?” “Why, was it a task to find this? I pray thee.” “Nay, neither do I say this, that
this thing is difficult; but whence became he desirous to disobey.” “From remissness. For
having power for either, he inclined rather to this.”</p>

<pb n="635"/>
<p>But if thou art perplexed yet and dizzy at hearing this, I will ask thee nothing difficult
nor involved, but a simple and plain question. Hast thou become some time bad? and hast
thou become some time also good? What I mean, is like this. Didst thou prevail some time
over passion, and wast thou taken again by passion? Hast thou been overtaken by drunkenness,
and hast thou prevailed over drunkenness? Wast thou once moved to wrath, and again
not moved to wrath? Didst thou overlook a poor man, and not overlook him? Didst thou
commit whoredom once? and didst thou become chaste again? Whence then are all these
things? tell me, whence? Nay if thou thyself do not tell, I will say. Because at one time thou
didst restrain thyself and strive, but after that thou becamest remiss and careless. For to
those that are desperate, and are continually in wickedness, and are in a state of senselessness,
and are mad, and who are not willing so much as to hear what will amend them, I will not
even discourse of self restraint; but to them that have been sometimes in the one, and
sometimes in the other, I will gladly speak. Didst thou once take by violence the things that
belonged not to thee; and after this, subdued by pity, didst impart even of thine unto him
that was in need? Whence then this change? Is it not quite plain it is from the mind, and
the choice of will?</p>
<p>It is quite plain, and there is no one who would not say this. Wherefore I entreat you
to be in earnest, and to cleave to virtue, and ye will have no need of these questions. For our
evils are mere names, if we be willing. Inquire not then whence are evils, neither perplex
thyself; but having found that they are from remissness only, flee the evil deeds.</p>
<p>And if any one should say, that these things come not from us; whenever thou seest him
angry with his servants, and provoked with his wife, and blaming a child, and condemning
them who injure him, say to him, how then saidst thou, that evils come not from us? For if
they be not from us, wherefore dost thou find fault? Say again; is it of thyself thou revilest,
and insultest? For if it be not of thyself, let no man be angry with thee; but if it be of thyself,
of thyself and of thy remissness are thy evil deeds.</p>
<p>But what? thinkest thou there are some good men? For if indeed no man is good, whence
hast thou this word? whence are praises? But if there are good men, it is quite plain that
they will also reprove the bad. Yet if no one is voluntarily wicked, nor of himself, the good
will be found to be unjustly reproving the bad, and they themselves too will be in this way
bad again. For what can be worse than to subject the guiltless to accusations? But if they
continue in our estimation good men, though reproving, and this especially is a proof of
their goodness, even to the very fools it is hereby plain, that no one is ever by necessity bad.</p>
<p>But if after all this thou wouldest still inquire, whence are evils? I would say, from remissness,
from idleness, from keeping company with the bad, from contempt of virtue;
hence are both the evils themselves, and the fact that some inquire, whence are the evils.
Since of them surely who do right no one inquires about these things, of them that are
purposed to live equitably and temperately; but they, who dare to commit wicked acts, and

<pb n="636"/>
wish to devise some foolish comfort2306to themselves by these discussions, do weave spiders’
webs.</p>
<p>But let us tear these in pieces not by our words only, but by our deeds too. For neither
are these things of necessity. For if they were of necessity, He would not have said, “Woe to
the man, by whom the offense cometh.”2307 For those only doth he bewail, who are wicked
by their choice.</p>
<p>And if He saith “by whom,”2308marvel not. For not as though another were bringing
in it by him, doth He say this, but viewing him as himself causing the whole. For the Scripture
is wont to say, “by whom,” for “of whom;”2309as when it saith, “I have gotten a man by
God,”2310putting not the second cause, but the first; and again, “Is not the interpretation
of them by God,”2311and, “God is faithful, by whom ye are called unto the fellowship of His
Son.”2312</p>
<p>4. And that thou mayest learn that it is not of necessity, hear also what follows. For after
bewailing them, He saith, “If thy hand, or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them
from thee: for it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two
hands or feet to be cast into the fire. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out; it is better
for thee to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into the furnace of
fire;”2313not saying these things of limbs; far from it; but of friends, of relations, whom we
regard in the rank of necessary members. This He had both said further back, and now He
saith it. For nothing is so hurtful as bad company. For what things compulsion cannot,
friendship can often effect, both for hurt, and for profit. Wherefore with much earnestness
He commands us to cut off them that hurt us, intimating these that bring the offenses.</p>
<p>Seest thou how He hath put away the mischief that would result from the offenses? By
foretelling that there surely will be offenses, so that they might find no one in a state of
carelessness, but that looking for them men might be watchful. By showing the evils to be
great (for He would not have said without purpose, “Woe to the world because of the offenses,”
but to show that great is the mischief therefrom), by lamenting again in stronger
terms over him that brings them in. For the saying, “But woe to that man,” was that of one

<pb n="637"/>
showing that great was the punishment, but not this only, but also by the comparison which
He added He increased the fear.</p>
<p>Then He is not satisfied with these things, but He showeth also the way, by which one
may avoid the offenses.</p>
<p>But what is this? The wicked, saith He, though they be exceeding dear friends to thee,
cut off from thy friendship.</p>
<p>And He giveth a reason that cannot be gainsaid. For if they continue friends, thou wilt
not gain them, but thou wilt lose thyself besides; but if thou shouldest cut them off, thine
own salvation at least thou wilt gain. So that if any one’s friendship harms thee, cut it off
from thee. For if of our own members we often cut off many, when they are both in an incurable
state, and are ruining the rest, much more ought one to do this in the case of friends.</p>
<p>But if evils were by nature, superfluous were all this admonition and advice, superfluous
the precaution by the means that have been mentioned. But if it be not superfluous, as surely
it is not superfluous, it is quite clear that wickedness is of the will.2314</p>
<p>“Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that their angels
do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.”2315</p>
<p>He calleth little ones not them that are really little, but them that are so esteemed by the
multitude, the poor, the objects of contempt, the unknown (for how should he be little who
is equal in value to the whole world; how should he be little, who is dear to God?); but them
who in the imagination of the multitude are so esteemed.</p>
<p>And He speaks not of many only, but even of one, even by this again warding off the
hurt of the many offenses. For even as to flee the wicked, so also to honor the good, hath
very great gain, and would be a twofold security to him who gives heed, the one by rooting
out the friendships with them that offend, the other from regarding these saints with respect
and honor.</p>
<p>Then in another way also He makes them objects of reverence, saying, “That their angels
do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.”</p>
<p>Hence it is evident, that the saints have angels, or even all men. For the apostle too saith
of the woman, “That she ought to have power on her head because of the angels.”2316 And
Moses, “He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels2317of
God.”2318</p>

<pb n="638"/>
<p>But here He is discoursing not of angels only, but rather of angels that are greater than
others. But when He saith, “The face of my Father,” He means nothing else than their fuller
confidence, and their great honor.</p>
<p>“For the Son of Man is come to save that which was lost.”2319</p>
<p>Again, He is putting another reason stronger than the former, and connects with it a
parable, by which He brings in the Father also as desiring these things. “For how think ye?”
saith He; “If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not
leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
astray? And if so be that he find it,2320he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and
nine, which went not astray. Even so it is not will before your Father,2321that one of these
little ones should perish.”2322</p>
<p>Seest thou by how many things He is urging to the care of our mean brethren. Say not
then, “Such a one is a blacksmith, a shoemaker, he is a ploughman, he is a fool,” and so
despise him. For in order that thou shouldest not feel this, see by how many motives He
persuades thee to practise moderation, and presses thee into a care for these. He set a little
child, and saith, “Be ye as little children.” And, “Whosoever receiveth such a little child receiveth
me;” and, “Whosoever shall offend,” shall suffer the utmost penalties. And He was
not even satisfied with the comparison of the “millstone,” but added also His “woe,” and
commanded us to cut off such, though they be in the place of hands and eyes to us. And by
the angels again that are entrusted with these same mean brethren, He makes them objects
of veneration, and from His own will and passion (for when He said, “The Son of Man is
come to save that which was lost,” He signifies even the cross, like as Paul saith, speaking
of a brother, “For whom Christ died”); and from the Father, for that neither to Him doth
it seem good that one should perish; and from common custom, because the shepherd leaves
them that are safe, and seeks what is lost; and when he hath found what was gone astray, he
is greatly delighted at the finding and the saving of this.</p>
<p>5. If then God thus rejoices over the little one that is found, how dost thou despise them
that are the objects of God’s earnest care, when one ought to give up even one’s very life for
one of these little ones? But is he weak and mean? Therefore for this very cause most of all,
one ought to do everything in order to preserve him. For even He Himself left the ninety
and nine sheep, and went after this, and the safety of so many availed not to throw into the
shade the loss of one. But Luke saith, that He even brought it on his shoulders, and that

“There was greater joy over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons.”
2323 And from His forsaking those that were saved for it, and from His taking more
pleasure in this one, He showed His earnestness about it to be great.</p>
<p>Let us not then be careless about such souls as these. For all these things are said for this
object. For by threatening, that he who has not become a little child should not so much as
at all set foot in the Heavens, and speaking of “the millstone,” He hath brought down the
haughtiness of the boastful; for nothing is so hostile to love as pride; and by saying, “It must
needs be that offenses come,” He made them to be wakeful; and by adding, “Woe unto him
by whom the offense cometh,” He hath caused each to endeavor that it be not by him. And
while by commanding to cut off them that offend He made salvation easy; by enjoining not
to despise them, and not merely enjoining, but with earnestness (for “take heed,” saith He,
“that ye despise not one of these little ones”), and by saying, “Their angels behold the face
of my Father,” and, “For this end am I come,” and “my Father willeth this,” He hath made
those who should take care of them more diligent.</p>
<p>Seest thou what a wall He hath set around them, and what earnest care He taketh of
them that are contemptible and perishing, at once threatening incurable ills to them that
make them fall, and promising great blessings to them that wait upon them, and take care
of them, and bringing an example from Himself again and from the Father?</p>
<p>Him let us also imitate, refusing none of the tasks that seem lowly and troublesome for
our brethren’s sake; but though we have to do service, though he be small, though he be
mean for whom this is done, though the work be laborious, though we must pass over
mountains and precipices, let all things be held endurable for the salvation of our brother.
For a soul is an object of such earnest care to God, that “He spared not His own Son.”2324</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat, when morning hath appeared, straightway as we come out of our
house, let us have this one object in view, this earnest care above all, to rescue him that is
in danger; I do not mean this danger only that is known by sense, for this is not danger at
all, but the danger of the soul, that which is brought upon men by the devil.</p>
<p>For the merchant too, to increase his wealth, crosses the sea; and the artisan, to add to
his substance, doeth all things. Let us also then not be satisfied with our own salvation only,
since else we destroy even this. For in a war too, and in an engagement, the soldier who is
looking to this only how he may save himself by flight, destroys the rest also with himself;
much as on the other hand the noble-minded one, and he who stands in arms in defense of
the others, with the others preserves himself also. Since then our state too is a war, and of
all wars the bitterest, and an engagement and a battle, even as our King commanded us, so
let us set ourselves in array in the engagement, prepared for slaughter, and blood, and
<note type="footnote">2323 Luke xv. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">2324 Rom. viii. 32.</note>

<pb n="640"/>
murders, looking to salvation in behalf of all, and cheering them that stand, and raising up
them that are down. For indeed many of our brethren lie fallen in this conflict, having
wounds, wallowing in blood, and there is none to heal, not any one of the people, not a
priest, no one else, no one to stand by, no friend, no brother, but we look every man to his
own things.</p>
<p>By reason of this we maim our own interests also. For the greatest confidence and means
of approval is the not looking to our own things.</p>
<p>Therefore I say, are we weak and easy to be overcome both by men, and by the devil,
because we seek the opposite to this, and lock not our shields one with another, neither are
fortified with godly love, but seek for ourselves other motives of friendship, some from relationship,
some from long acquaintance, some from community of interest, some from
neighborhood; and from every cause rather are we friends, than from godliness, when one’s
friendships ought to be formed upon this only. But now the contrary is done; with Jews and
with Greeks2325we sometimes become friends, rather than with the children of the church.</p>
<p>6. Yes, saith he, because the one is worthless, but the other kind and gentle. What sayest
thou? Dost thou call thy brother worthless, who art commanded not to call him so much
as Raca? And art thou not ashamed, neither dost thou blush, at exposing thy brother, thy
fellow member, him that hath shared in the same birth with thee, that hath partaken of the
same table?</p>
<p>But if thou hast any brother after the flesh, if he should perpetrate ten thousand evil
deeds, thou laborest to conceal him, and accountest thyself also to partake of the shame,
when he is disgraced; but as to thy spiritual brother, when thou oughtest to free him from
calumny, thou dost rather encompass him with ten thousand charges against him?</p>
<p>“Why he is worthless and insufferable,” thou mayest say. Nay then for this reason become
his friend, that thou mayest put an end to his being such a one, that thou mayest convert
him, that thou mayest lead him back to virtue.—“But he obeys not,” thou wilt say, “neither
doth he bear advice.”—Whence knowest thou it? What, hast thou admonished him, and
attempted to amend him?—“I have admonished him often,” thou wilt say. How many
times?—Oftentimes, both once, and a second time.—Oh! Is this often? Why, if thou hadst
done this throughout all the time, oughtest thou to grow weary, and to give it up? Seest thou
not how God is always admonishing us, by the prophets, by the apostles, by the evangelists?
What then? have we performed all? and have we been obedient in all things? By no means.
Did He then cease admonishing? Did He hold His peace? Doth He not say each day, “Ye
cannot serve God, and mammon”2326and with many, the superfluity and the tyranny of
wealth yet increases? Doth He not cry aloud each day, “Forgive, and ye shall have forgive-

ness,”2327and we become wild beasts more and more? Doth He not continually admonish
to restrain desire, and to keep the mastery over wicked lust, and many wallow worse than
swine in this sin? But nevertheless, He ceases not speaking.</p>
<p>Wherefore then do we not consider these things with ourselves, and say that even with
us God reasons, and abstains not from doing this, although we disobey Him in many things?</p>
<p>Therefore He said that, “Few are the saved.”2328 For if virtue in ourselves suffices not
for our salvation, but we must take with us others too when we depart; when we have saved
neither ourselves, nor others, what shall we suffer? Whence shall we have any more a hope
of salvation?</p>
<p>But why do I blame for these things, when not even of them that dwell with us do we
take any account, of wife, and children, and servants, but we have care of one thing instead
of another, like drunken men, that our servants may be more in number, and may serve us
with much diligence, and that our children may receive from us a large inheritance, and
that our wife may have ornaments of gold, and costly garments, and wealth; and we care
not at all for themselves, but for the things that belong to them. For neither do we care for
our own wife, nor provide for her, but for the things that belong to the wife; neither for the
child, but for the things of the child.</p>
<p>And we do the same as if any one seeing a house in a bad state, and the walls giving way,
were to neglect to raise up these, and to make up great fences round it without; or when a
body was diseased, were not to take care of this, but were to weave for it gilded garments;
or when the mistress was ill, were to give heed to the maidservants, and the looms, and the
vessels in the house, and mind other things, leaving her to lie and moan.</p>
<p>For this is done even now, and when our soul is in evil and wretched case, and angry,
and reviling, and lusting wrongly, and full of vainglory, and at strife, and dragged down to
the earth, and torn by so many wild beasts, we neglect to drive away the passions from her,
and are careful about house and servants. And while if a bear has escaped by stealth, we shut
up our houses, and run along by the narrow passages, so as not to fall in with the wild beast;
now while not one wild beast, but many such thoughts are tearing in pieces the soul, we
have not so much as a feeling of it. And in the city we take so much care, as to shut up the
wild beasts in solitary places and in cages, and neither at the senate house of the city, nor at
the courts of justice, nor at the king’s palace, but far off somewhere at a distance do we keep
them chained; but in the case of the soul, where the senate house is, where the King’s palace,
where the court of justice is, the wild beasts are let loose, crying and making a tumult about
the mind itself and the royal throne. Therefore all things are turned upside down, and all is
full of disturbance, the things within, the things without, and we are in nothing different

from a city thrown into confusion from being overrun by barbarians; and what takes place
in us is as though a serpent were setting on a brood of sparrows, and the sparrows, with
their feeble cries, were flying about every way affrighted, and full of trouble, without having
any place whither to go and end their consternation.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore I entreat, let us kill the serpent, let us shut up the wild beasts, let us stifle
them, let us slay them, and these wicked thoughts let us give over to the sword of the Spirit,
lest the prophet threaten us also with such things as he threatened Judea, that “The wild
asses shall dance there, and porcupines, and serpents.”2329</p>
<p>For there are, there are even men worse than wild asses, living as it were in the wilderness,
and kicking; yea the more part of the youth amongst us is like this. For indeed having wild
lusts they thus leap, they kick, going about unbridled, and spend their diligence on no becoming
object.</p>
<p>And the fathers are to blame, who while they constrain the horsebreakers to discipline
their horses with much attention, and suffer not the youth of the colt to go on long untamed,
but put upon it both a rein, and all the rest, from the beginning; but their own young ones
they overlook, going about for a long season unbridled, and without temperance; disgracing
themselves, by fornications, and gamings, and continuings in the wicked theatres, when
they ought before fornication to give him to a wife, to a wife chaste, and highly endued with
wisdom; for she will both bring off her husband from his most disorderly course of life, and
will be instead of a rein to the colt.</p>
<p>For indeed fornications and adulteries come not from any other cause, than from young
men’s being unrestrained. For if he have a prudent wife, he will take care of house and
honor and character. “But he is young,” you say. I know it too. For if Isaac was forty years
old when he took his bride, passing all that time of his life in virginity, much more ought
young men under grace to practise this self-restraint. But oh what grief! Ye do not endure
to take care of their chastity, but ye overlook their disgracing, defiling themselves, becoming
accursed; as though ye knew not that the profit of marriage is to preserve the body pure,
and if this be not so, there is no advantage of marriage. But ye do the contrary; when they
are filled with countless stains, then ye bring them to marriage without purpose and without
fruit.</p>
<p>“Why I must wait,” thou wilt say, “that he may become approved, that he may distinguish
himself in the affairs of the state;” but of the soul ye have no consideration, but ye overlook
it as a cast-away. For this reason all things are full of confusion, and disorder, and trouble,
because this is made a secondary matter, because necessary things are neglected, but the
unimportant obtain much forethought.</p>

<p>Knowest thou not, that thou canst do no such kindness to the youth, as to keep him
pure from whorish uncleannness? For nothing is equal to the soul. Because, “What is a man
profited,” saith He, “if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his own soul.”2330 But because
the love of money hath overturned and cast down all, and hath thrust aside the strict fear
of God, having seized upon the souls of men, like some rebel chief upon a citadel; therefore
we are careless both of our children’s salvation, and of our own, looking to one object only,
that having become wealthier, we may leave riches to others, and these again to others after
them, and they that follow these to their posterity, becoming rather a kind of passers on of
our possessions and of our money, but not masters.</p>
<p>Hence great is our folly; hence the free are less esteemed than the slaves. For slaves we
reprove, if not for their sake, yet for our own; but the free enjoy not the benefit even of this
care, but are more vile in our estimation than these slaves. And why do I say, than our slaves?
For our children are less esteemed than cattle; and we take care of horses and asses rather
than of children. And should one have a mule, great is his anxiety to find the best groom,
and not one either harsh, or dishonest, or drunken, or ignorant of his art; but if we have set
a tutor2331over a child’s soul, we take at once, and at random, whoever comes in our way.
And yet than this art there is not another greater. For what is equal to training the soul, and
forming the mind of one that is young? For he that hath this art, ought to be more exactly
observant than any painter and any sculptor.2332</p>
<p>But we take no account of this, but look to one thing only, that he may be trained as to
his tongue. And to this again we have directed our endeavors for money’s sake. For not that
he may be able to speak, but that he may get money, does he learn speaking; since if it were
possible to grow rich even without this, we should have no care even for this.</p>
<p>Seest thou how great is the tyranny of riches? how it has seized upon all things, and
having bound them like some slaves or cattle, drags them where it will?</p>
<p>But what are we advantaged by such accusations against it? For we indeed shoot at it in
words, but it prevails over us in deeds. Nevertheless, not even so shall we cease to shoot at
it with words from our tongue. For if any advance is made, both we are gainers and you;
but if you continue in the same things, all our part at least hath been performed.</p>
<p>But may God both deliver you from this disease, and cause us to glory in you, for to
Him be glory, and dominion, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XVIII. 15.</p>
<p>“If thy brother shall trespass2333against thee, go and tell him his fault2334between thee and
him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.”</p>
<p>For, since He had used vehement language against them that cause offense, and on every
hand had moved them to fear; in order that the offended might not in this way on the other
hand become supine, neither supposing all to be cast upon others, should be led on to another
vice, soften in themselves, and desiring to be humored in everything, and run upon
the shoal of pride; seest thou how He again checks them also, and commands the telling of
the faults to be between the two alone, lest by the testimony of the many he should render
his accusation heavier, and the other, become excited to opposition, should continue incorrigible.</p>
<p>Wherefore He saith, “Between thee and him alone,” and, “If he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.” What is, “If he shall hear thee?” If he shall condemn himself, if he
shall be persuaded that he has done wrong.
“Thou hast gained thy brother.” He did not say, Thou hast a sufficient revenge, but,</p>
<p>“Thou hast gained thy brother,” to show that there is a common loss from the enmity. For
He said not, “He hath gained himself only,” but, “thou too hast gained him,” whereby He
showed that both the one and the other were losers before this, the one of his brother, the
other of his own salvation.</p>
<p>This, when He sat on the mount also, He advised; at one time bringing him who has
given the pain to him that had been pained, and saying, “Be reconciled to thy brother,”2335and
at another commanding him that had been wronged to forgive his neighbor. For He taught
men to say, “Forgive us our debts, like as we forgive our debtors.”2336</p>
<p>But here He is devising another mode. For not him that gave the pain, doth He now call
upon,2337but him that was pained He brings to this one. For because this who hath done
the wrong would not easily come to make excuse, out of shame, and confusion of face, He
draws that other to him, and not merely so, but in such way as also to correct what hath
been done. And He saith not, “Accuse,” nor “Charge him,” nor “Demand satisfaction, and

an account,” but, “Tell him of his fault,”2338saith He. For he is held in a kind of stupor
through anger and shame with which he is intoxicated; and thou, who art in health, must
go thy way to him that is ill, and make the tribunal private, and the remedy such as may be
readily received. For to say, “Tell him of his fault,” is nothing else than “Remind him of his
error,” tell him what thou hast suffered at his hand, which very thing, if it be done as it
ought, is the part of one making excuse for him, and drawing him over earnestly to a reconciliation.</p>
<p>What then, if he should disobey, and be disposed to abide in hardness? “Take with
thyself yet one or two, that in the mouth of two witnesses every word may be established.”2339
For the more he is shameless, and bold, the more ought we to be active for his cure, not in
anger and indignation. For the physician in like manner, when he sees the malady obstinate,
doth not give up nor grow impatient, but then makes the more preparation; which He
commands us to do in this case too.</p>
<p>For since thou appearedst to be too weak alone, make thyself more powerful by this
addition. For surely the two are sufficient to convict him that hath sinned. Seest thou how
He seeketh not the good of him that hath been pained only, but of him also that hath given
the pain. For the person injured is this one who is taken captive by his passion, he it is that
is diseased, and weak, and infirm. Wherefore He often sends the other to this one, now
alone, and now with others; but if he continue in it, even with the church. For, “Tell it,”
saith He, “to the Church.”2340 For if He were seeking this one’s advantage only, He would
not have commanded to pardon, seventy times seven, one repenting. He would not so often
have set so many over him to correct his passion; but if he had remained incorrigible after
the first conference would have let him be; but now once, and twice, and thrice, He commands
to attempt his cure, and now alone and now with two, now with more.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with respect to them that are without He saith no such thing, but, “If any
one smite thee,” He saith, “on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,”2341but here not
in such wise. For what Paul meaneth, saying, “What have I to do to judge them also that are
without?”2342but the brethren he commands both to tell of their faults, and to avoid them,
and to cut them off, not being obedient, that they may be ashamed; this Himself also doeth
here, making these laws about the brethren; and He sets three2343over him for teachers and

judges, to teach him the things that are done at the time of his drunkenness. For though it
be himself that hath said and done all those unreasonable things, yet he will need others to
teach him this, like as the drunken man. For anger and sin is a more frantic thing2344than
any drunkenness, and puts the soul in greater distraction.</p>
<p>Who, for instance, was wiser than David? Yet for all that, when he had sinned he perceived
it not, his lust keeping in subjection all his reasoning powers, and like some smoke
filling his soul. Therefore he stood in need of a lantern from the prophet, and of words
calling to his mind what he had done. Wherefore here also He brings these to him that hath
sinned, to reason with him about the things he had done.</p>
<p>2. But for what reason doth He command this one to tell him of his fault, and not another?
Because this man he would endure more quietly, this, who hath been wronged, who
hath been pained, who hath been despitefully used. For one doth not bear in the same way
being told by another of one’s fault concerning him that hath been insulted, as by the insulted
person himself, especially when this person is alone convicting him. For when he who should
demand justice against him, even this one appears to be caring for his salvation, this will
have more power than anything in the world to shame him.</p>
<p>Seest thou how this is done not for the sake of just punishment, but of amendment?
Therefore He doth not at once command to take with him the two, but when himself hath
failed; and not even then doth He send forth a multitude against him; but makes the addition
no further than two, or even one; but when he has contemned these too, then and not till
then He brings him out to the church.</p>
<p>So much earnestness doth He show, that our neighbor’s sins be not exposed by us. And
indeed He might have commanded this from the first, but that this might not be, He did
not command it, but after a first and second admonition He appoints this.</p>
<p>But what is, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established?”
Thou hast a sufficient testimony. His meaning is, that thou hast done all thy part, that thou
hast left undone none of the things which it pertained to thee to do.</p>
<p>“But if he shall neglect to hear them also, tell it to the church,” that is, to the rulers of
it; “but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican.”
For after this such a one is incurably diseased.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how everywhere He putteth the publican for an example of
the greatest wickedness. For above too He saith, “Do not even the publicans the same?”2345
And further on again, “Even the publicans and the harlots shall go before you into the
Kingdom of Heaven,”2346that is, they who are utterly reprobated and condemned. Let them
hearken, who are rushing upon unjust gains, who are counting up usuries upon usuries.</p>

<p>But why did He set him with these? To soothe the person wronged, and to alarm him.
Is this only then the punishment? Nay, but hear also what follows. “Whatsoever ye shall
bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven.”2347 And He did not say to the ruler of the church,
“Bind such a man,” but, “If thou bind,” committing the whole matter to the person himself,
who is aggrieved, and the bonds abide indissoluble. Therefore he will suffer the utmost ills;
but not he who hath brought him to account is to blame, but he who hath not been willing
to be persuaded.</p>
<p>Seest thou how He hath bound him down with twofold constraint, both by the vengeance
here, and by the punishment hereafter? But these things hath He threatened, that these cir-
cumstances may not arise, but that fearing, at once the being cast out of the church, and
the danger from the bond, and the being bound in Heaven, he may become more gentle.
And knowing these things, if not at the beginning, at any rate in the multitude of the tribunals
he will put off his anger. Wherefore, I tell you, He hath set over him a first, and a second,
and a third court,2348so that though he should neglect to hear the first, he may yield to the
second; and even if he should reject that, he may fear the third; and though he should make
no account of this, he may be dismayed at the vengeance to come, and at the sentence and
judgment to proceed from God.</p>
<p>“And again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything
that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven. For where
two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”2349</p>
<p>Seest thou how by another motive also He puts down our enmities, and takes away our
petty dissensions,2350and draws us one to another, and this not from the punishment only
which hath been mentioned, but also from the good things which spring from charity? For
having denounced those threats against contentiousness, He putteth here the great rewards
of concord, if at least they who are of one accord do even prevail with the Father, as touching
the things they ask, and have Christ in the midst of them.</p>
<p>“Are there then indeed nowhere two of one accord?” Nay, in many places, perchance
even everywhere. “How then do they not obtain all things?” Because many are causes of
their failing. For either they often ask things inexpedient. And why marvellest thou, if this
is the case with some others, whereas it was so even with Paul, when he heard, “My grace
is sufficient for thee; for my strength is perfected in weakness.”2351 Or they are unworthy

to be reckoned with them that heard these words, and contribute not their own part, but
He seeks for such as are like them; therefore He saith “of you,” of the virtuous, of them that
show forth an angelic rule of life.2352 Or they pray against them that have aggrieved them,
seeking for redress and vengeance; and this kind of thing is forbidden, for, “Pray,” saith He,
“for your enemies.”2353 Or having sins unrepented they ask mercy, which thing it is impossible
to receive, not only if themselves ask it, but although others having much confidence
towards God entreat for them, like as even Jeremiah praying for the Jews did hear, “Pray
not thou for this people, because I will not hear thee.”2354</p>
<p>But if all things are there, and thou ask things expedient, and contribute all thine own
part, and exhibit an apostolical life, and have concord and love towards thy neighbor, thou
wilt obtain on thy entreaty; for the Lord is loving towards man.</p>
<p>3. Then because He had said, “Of my Father,” in order that He might show that it is
Himself that giveth, and not He who begat Him only, He added, “For wheresoever two or
three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”</p>
<p>What then? are there not two or three gathered together in His name? There are indeed,
but rarely. For not merely of the assembling doth He speak, neither this doth He require
only; but most surely, as I said before also, the rest of virtue too together with this, and besides,
even this itself He requires with great strictness. For what He saith is like this, “If any
holds me the principal ground of his love to his neighbors, I will be with Him, if he be a
virtuous man in other respects.”</p>
<p>But now we see the more part having other motives of friendship. For one loves, because
he is loved, another because he hath been honored, a third because such a one has been
useful to him in some other worldly matter, a fourth for some other like cause; but for
Christ’s sake it is a difficult thing to find any one loving his neighbor sincerely, and as he
ought to love him. For the more part are bound one to another by their worldly affairs. But
Paul did not love thus, but for Christ’s sake; wherefore even when not loved in such wise as
he loved, he did not cease his love, because he had planted a strong root of his affection; but
not so our present state, but on inquiry we shall find with most men anything likely to
produce friendship rather than this. And if any one bestowed on me power in so great a
multitude to make this inquiry, I would show the more part bound one to another by worldly
motives.</p>
<p>And this is evident from the causes that work enmity. For because they are bound one
to another by these temporal2355motives, therefore they are neither fervent towards one

another, nor constant, but insult, and loss of money, and envy, and love of vainglory, and
every such thing coming upon them, severs the love-tie. For it finds not the root spiritual.
Since if indeed it were such, no worldly thing would dissolve things spiritual. For love for
Christ’s sake is firm, and not to be broken, and impregnable, and nothing can tear it asunder;
not calumnies, not dangers, not death, no other thing of this kind. For though he suffer ten
thousand things, who thus loves; looking to the ground of his love, he will not desist. For
he who loves because of being loved, should he meet with anything painful, puts an end to
his love; but he who is bound by this, will never desist.</p>
<p>Wherefore Paul also said, “Charity never faileth.”2356 For what hast thou to say? That
when honored he insults? that receiving benefits he was minded to slay thee? But even this
works upon thee to love more, if thou lovest for Christ’s sake. For what things are in the
rest subversive of love, these here become apt to produce it. How? First, because such a one
is to thee a cause of rewards; secondly, because he that is so disposed stands in need of more
succor, and much attention. Therefore I say, he who thus loves inquires not about race, nor
country, nor wealth, nor his love to himself, nor any other such matter, but though he be
hated, though he be insulted, though he be slain, continues to love, having as a sufficient
ground for love, Christ; wherefore also he stands steadfast, firm, not to be overthrown,
looking unto Him.</p>
<p>For Christ too so loved his enemies, having loved the obstinate, the injurious, the blasphemers,
them that hated Him, them that would not so much as see Him; them that were
preferring wood and stones to Him, and with the highest love beyond which one cannot
find another. “For greater love hath no man than this,” He saith, “that one lay down his life
for his friends.”2357</p>
<p>And those even that crucified Him, and acted in so many instances with contumely
against Him, see how He continues to treat with kindness. For even to His Father He speaks
for them, saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.”2358 And He sent His
disciples moreover, after these things, unto them.
This love then let us also imitate, unto this let us look, that being followers of Christ,
we may attain both unto the good things here, and unto those to come, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XVIII. 21.</p>
<p>“Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive
him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but,
Until seventy times seven.”2359</p>
<p>Peter supposed he was saying something great, wherefore also as aiming at greatness
he added, “Until seven times?” For this thing, saith he, which Thou hast commanded to do,
how often shall I do? For if he forever sins, but forever when reproved repents, how often
dost thou command us to bear with this man? For with regard to that other who repents
not, neither acknowledges his own faults, Thou hast set a limit, by saying, “Let him be to
thee as the heathen and the publican;” but to this no longer so, but Thou hast commanded
to accept him.</p>
<p>How often then ought I to bear with him, being told his faults, and repenting? Is it
enough for seven times?</p>
<p>What then saith Christ, the good God, who is loving towards man? “I say not unto thee,
until seven times, but, until seventy times seven,” not setting a number here, but what is
infinite and perpetual and forever. For even as ten thousand times signifies often, so here
too. For by saying, “The barren hath borne seven,”2360the Scripture means many. So that
He hath not limited the forgiveness by a number, but hath declared that it is to be perpetual
and forever.</p>
<p>This at least He indicated by the parable that is put after. For that He might not seem
to any to enjoin great things and hard to bear, by saying, “Seventy times seven,” He added
this parable, at once both leading them on to what He had said, and putting down him who
was priding himself upon this, and showing the act was not grievous, but rather very easy.
Therefore let me add, He brought forward His own love to man, that by the comparison,
as He saith, thou mightest learn, that though thou forgive seventy times seven, though thou
continually pardon thy neighbor for absolutely all his sins, as a drop of water to an endless
sea, so much, or rather much more, doth thy love to man come short in comparison of the
boundless goodness of God, of which thou standest in need, for that thou art to be judged,
and to give an account.</p>
<note type="footnote">2359 [R.V. margin, “seventy times and seven.” There is no difference of reading, but one of interpretation.

<pb n="651"/>
<p>Wherefore also He went on to say, “The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a certain
king, which would take account of his servants.2361 And when he had begun to reckon, one
was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not
to pay,2362he commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children, and all that he
had.”2363</p>
<p>Then after this man had enjoyed the benefit of mercy, he went out, and “took by the
throat his fellow-servant, which owed him an hundred pence;”2364and having by these doings
moved his lord, he caused him to cast him again into prison, until he should pay off the
whole.</p>
<p>Seest thou how great the difference between sins against man and against God? As great
as between ten thousand talents, and a hundred pence, or rather even much more. And this
arises both from the difference of the persons, and the constant succession of our sins. For
when a man looks at us, we stand off and shrink from sinning: but when God sees us every
day, we do not forbear, but do and speak all things without fear.</p>
<p>But not hereby alone, but also from the benefit and from the honor of which we have
partaken, our sins become more grievous.</p>
<p>And if ye are desirous to learn how our sins against Him are ten thousand talents, or
rather even much more, I will try to show it briefly. But I fear lest to them that are inclined
to wickedness, and love continually to sin, I should furnish still greater security, or should
drive the meeker sort to despair, and they should repeat that saying of the disciples, “who
can be saved?”2365</p>
<p>Nevertheless for all that I will speak, that I may make those that attend more safe, and
more meek. For they that are incurably diseased, and past feeling, even without these words
of mine, do not depart from their own carelessness, and wickedness; and if even from hence
they derive greater occasion for contempt, the fault is not in what is said, but in their insensibility;
since what is said surely is enough both to restrain those that attend to it, and to prick
their hearts; and the meeker sort, when they see on the one hand the greatness of their sins,
and learn also on the other hand the power of repentance, will cleave to it the more,
wherefore it is needful to speak.</p>
<p>I will speak then, and will set forth our sins, both wherein we offend against God, and
wherein against men, and I will set forth not each person’s own, but what are common; but
his own let each one join to them after that from his conscience.</p>

<p>And I will do this, having first set forth the good deeds of God to us. What then are His
good deeds? He created us when we were not, and made all things for our sakes that are
seen, Heaven, sea, air, all that in them is, living creatures, plants, seeds; for we must needs
speak briefly for the boundless ocean of the works. Into us alone of all that are on earth He
breathed a living soul such as we have, He planted a garden, He gave a help-meet, He set us
over all the brutes, He crowned us with glory and honor.</p>
<p>After that, when man had been unthankful towards his benefactor, He vouchsafed unto
him a greater gift.</p>
<p>2. For look not to this only, that He cast him out of paradise, but mark also the gain that
arose from thence. For after having cast him out of paradise, and having wrought those
countless good works, and having accomplished His various dispensations, He sent even
His own Son for the sake of them that had been benefited by Him and were hating Him,
and opened Heaven to us, and unfolded paradise itself, and made us sons, the enemies, the
unthankful.</p>
<p>Wherefore it were even seasonable now to say, “O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God!”2366</p>
<p>And He gave us also a baptism of the re mission of sins, and a deliverance from vengeance,
and an inheritance of a kingdom, and He promised numberless good things on our
doing what is right, and stretched forth His hand, and shed abroad His Spirit into our hearts.</p>
<p>What then? After so many and such great blessings, what ought to be our disposition;
should we indeed, even if each day we died for Him who so loves us, make due recompense,
or rather should we repay the smallest portion of the debt? By no means, for moreover even
this again is turned to our advantage.</p>
<p>How then are we disposed, whose disposition ought to be like this? Each day we insult
His law. But be ye not angry, if I let loose my tongue against them that sin, for not you only
will I accuse, but myself also.</p>
<p>Where then would ye that I should begin? With the slaves, or with the free? with them
that serve in the army, or with private persons? with the rulers, or with the subjects? with
the women, or with the men? with the aged men, or with the young? with what age? with
what race? with what rank? with what pursuit?</p>
<p>Would ye then that I should make the beginning with them that serve as soldiers? What
sin then do not these commit every day, insulting, reviling, frantic, making a gain of other
men’s calamities, being like wolves, never clear from offenses, unless one might say the sea
too was without waves. What passion doth not trouble them? what disease doth not lay siege
to their soul?</p>
<note type="footnote">2366 Rom. xi. 33.</note>

<pb n="653"/>
<p>For to their equals they show a jealous disposition, and they envy, and seek after vainglory;
and to those that are subject to them, their disposition is covetous; but to them that
have suits, and run unto them as to a harbor, their conduct is that of enemies and perjured
persons. How many robberies are there with them! How many frauds! How many false accusations,
and meannesses! how many servile flatteries!</p>
<p>Come then, let us apply in each case the law of Christ. “He that saith to his brother,
Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.2367 He that hath looked on a woman to lust after
her, hath already committed adultery with her.2368 Unless one humble himself as the little
child, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.”2369</p>
<p>But these even study haughtiness, becoming towards them that are subject to them, and
are delivered into their hands, and who tremble at them, and are afraid of them, more fierce
than a wild beast; for Christ’s sake doing nothing, but all things for the belly, for money, for
vainglory.</p>
<p>Can one indeed reckon up in words the trespass of their actions? What should one say
of their decisions, their laughter, their unseasonable discourses, their filthy language? But
about covetousness one cannot so much as speak. For like as the monks on the mountains
know not even what covetousness is, so neither do these; but in an opposite way to them.
For they indeed, because of being far removed from the disease, know not the passion, but
these, by reason of being exceedingly intoxicated with it, have not so much as a perception
how great the evil is. For this vice hath so thrust aside virtue and tyrannises, that it is not
accounted so much as a heavy charge with those madmen.</p>
<p>But will ye, that we leave these, and go to others of a gentler kind? Come then, let us
examine the race of workmen and artisans. For these above all seem to live by honest labors,
and the sweat of their own brow. But these too, when they do not take heed to themselves,
gather to themselves many evils from hence. For the dishonesty that arises from buying and
selling they bring into the work of honest labor, and add oaths, and perjuries, and falsehoods
to their covetousness often, and are taken up with worldly things only, and continue riveted
to the earth; and while they do all things that they may get money, they do not take much
heed that they may impart to the needy, being always desirous to increase their goods. What
should one say of the revilings that are uttered touching such matters, the insults, the loans,
the usurious gains, the bargains full of much mean trafficking, the shameless buyings and
sellings.</p>
<p>3. But will ye that we leave these too, and go to others who seem to be more just? Who
then are they? They that are possessed of lands, and reap the wealth that springs from the

earth. And what can be more unjust than these? For if any one were to examine how they
treat their wretched and toil-worn laborers, he will see them to be more cruel than savages.
For upon them that are pining with hunger, and toiling throughout all their life, they both
impose constant and intolerable payments, and lay on them laborious burdens, and like
asses or mules, or rather like stones, do they treat their bodies, allowing them not so much
as to draw breath a little, and when the earth yields, and when it doth not yield, they alike
wear them out, and grant them no indulgence. And what can be more pitiable than this,
when after having labored throughout the whole winter, and being consumed with frost
and rain, and watchings, they go away with their hands empty, yea moreover in debt, and
fearing and dreading more that this famine and shipwreck, the torments of the overlookers,
2370and their dragging them about, and their demands, and their imprisonments, and
the services from which no entreaty can deliver them!</p>
<p>Why should one speak of the merchandise which they make of them, the sordid gains
which they gain by them, by their labors and their sweat filling winepresses, and wine vats,
but not suffering them to take home so much as a small measure, but draining off the entire
fruits into the casks of their wickedness, and flinging to them for this a little money?</p>
<p>And new kinds of usuries also do they devise, and not lawful even according to the laws
of the heathens, and they frame contracts for loans full of many a curse. For not the hundredth
part of the sum, but the half of the sum they press for and exact; and this when he
of whom it is exacted has a wife, is bringing up children, is a human being, and is filling
their threshing floor, and their wine-press by his own toils.</p>
<p>But none of these things do they consider. Wherefore now it were seasonable to bring
forward the prophet and say, “Be astonished, O Heaven, and be horribly afraid, O
earth,”2371to what great brutality hath the race of man been madly carried away!2372</p>
<p>But these things I say, not blaming crafts, nor husbandry, nor military service,2373but
ourselves. Since Cornelius also was a centurion, and Paul a worker in leather, and after his
preaching practised his craft, and David was a king, and Job enjoyed the possession of land
and of large revenues, and there was no hindrance hereby to any of these in the way of virtue.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind all these things, and considering the ten thousand talents, let us at least
hence hasten to remit to our neighbors their few and trifling debts. For we too have an account
to give of the commandments wherewith we have been trusted, and we are not able
to pay all, no not whatever we may do. Therefore God hath given us a way to repayment

both ready and easy, and which is able to cancel all these things, I mean, not to be revengeful.</p>
<p>In order then that we may learn this well, let us hear the whole parable, going on regularly
through it. “For there was brought unto Him,” it saith, “one which owed ten thousand talents,
and when he had not to pay, He commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children.”
Wherefore, I pray thee? Not of cruelty, nor of inhumanity (for the loss came back again
upon himself, for she too was a slave), but of unspeakable tenderness.</p>
<p>For it is His purpose to alarm him by this threat, that He might bring him to supplication,
not that he should be sold. For if He had done it for this intent, He would not have consented
to his request, neither would He have granted the favor.</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He not do this, nor forgive the debt before the account? Desiring
to teach him, from how many obligations He is delivering him, that in this way at least he
might become more mild towards his fellow servant. For even if when he had learnt the
weight of his debt, and the greatness of the forgiveness, he continued taking his fellow-servant
by the throat; if He had not disciplined him beforehand with such medicines, to what length
of cruelty might he not have gone?</p>
<p>What then saith the other? “Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And his
Lord2374was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.”2375</p>
<p>Seest thou again surpassing benevolence? The servant asked only for delay and putting
off the time, but He gave more than he asked, remission and forgiveness of the entire debt.
For it had been his will to give it even from the first, but he did not desire the gift to be his
only, but also to come of this man’s entreaty, that he might not go away uncrowned. For
that the whole was of him, although this other fell down to him and prayed, the motive of
the forgiveness showed, for “moved with compassion” he forgave him. But still even so he
willed that other also to seem to contribute something, that he might not be exceedingly
covered with shame, and that he being schooled in his own calamities, might be indulgent
to his fellow-servant.</p>
<p>4. Up to this point then this man was good and acceptable; for he confessed, and
promised to pay the debt, and fell down before him, and entreated, and condemned his own
sins, and knew the greatness of the debt. But the sequel is unworthy of his former deeds.
For going out straightway, not after a long time but straightway, having the bene fit
fresh2376upon him, he abused to wickedness the gift, even the freedom bestowed on him
by his master.</p>
<p>For, “he found one of his fellow-servants, which owed him an hundred pence, and took
him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest.”2377</p>

<pb n="656"/>
<p>Seest thou the master’s benevolence? Seest thou the servant’s cruelty? Hear, ye who do
these things for money. For if for sins we must not do so, much more not for money.</p>
<p>What then saith the other? “Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.”2378 But he
did not regard even the words by which he had been saved (for he himself on saying this
was delivered from the ten thousand talents), and did not recognize so much as the harbor
by which he escaped shipwreck; the gesture of supplication did not remind him of his
master’s kindness, but he put away from him all these things, from covetousness and cruelty
and revenge, and was more fierce than any wild beast, seizing his fellow-servant by the
throat.</p>
<p>What doest thou, O man? perceivest thou not, thou art making the demand upon thyself,
thou an thrusting the sword into thyself, and revoking the sentence and the gift? But none
of these things did he consider, neither did he remember his own state, neither did he yield;
although the entreaty was not for equal objects.</p>
<p>For the one besought for ten thousand talents, the other for a hundred pence; the one
his fellow-servant, the other his lord; the one received entire forgiveness, the other asked
for delay, and not so much as this did he give him, for “he cast him into prison.”</p>
<p>“But when his fellow-servants saw it, they accused him to their lord.” Not even to men
is this well-pleasing, much less to God. They therefore who did not owe, partook of the grief.</p>
<p>What then saith their lord? “O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
thou desiredst2379me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion, even as I had pity on
thee?”2380</p>
<p>See again the lord’s gentleness. He pleads with him, and excuses himself, being on the
point of revoking his gift; or rather, it was not he that revoked it, but the one who had received
it. Wherefore He saith, “I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; shouldest
not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant?” For even if the thing doth seem
to thee hard; yet shouldest thou have looked to the gain, which hath been, which is to be.
Even if the injunction be galling, thou oughtest to consider the reward; neither that he hath
grieved thee, but that thou hast provoked God, whom by mere prayer thou hast reconciled.
But if even so it be a galling thing to thee to become friends with him who hath grieved thee,
to fall into hell is far more grievous; and if thou hadst set this against that, then thou
wouldest have known that to forgive is a much lighter thing.</p>

<pb n="657"/>
<p>And whereas, when he owed ten thousand talents, he called him not wicked, neither
reproached him, but showed mercy on him; when he had become harsh to his fellow-servant,
then he saith, “O thou wicked servant.”</p>
<p>Let us hearken, the covetous, for even to us is the word spoken. Let us hearken also, the
merciless, and the cruel, for not to others are we cruel, but to ourselves. When then thou
art minded to be revengeful, consider that against thyself art thou revengeful, not against
another; that thou art binding up thine own sins, not thy neighbors. For as to thee, whatsoever
thou mayest do to this man, thou doest as a man and in the present life, but God not so, but
more mightily will He take vengeance on thee, and with the vengeance hereafter.</p>
<p>“For He delivered him over till he should pay that which was due,” that is, for ever; for
he will never repay. For since thou art not become better by the kindness shown thee, it remains
that by vengeance thou be corrected.</p>
<p>And yet, “The graces and the gifts are without repentance,”2381but wickedness has had
such power as to set aside even this law. What then can be a more grievous thing than to be
revengeful, when it appears to overthrow such and so great a gift of God.</p>
<p>And he did not merely “deliver” him, but “was wroth.” For when he commanded him
to be sold, his were not the words of wrath (therefore neither did he do it), but a very great
occasion for benevolence; but now the sentence is of much indignation, and vengeance, and
punishment.</p>
<p>What then means the parable? “So likewise shall my Father do also unto you,” He saith,
“if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.”2382</p>
<p>He saith not “your Father,” but “my Father.” For it is not meet for God to be called the
Father of such a one, who is so wicked and malicious.</p>
<p>5. Two things therefore doth He here require, both to condemn ourselves for our sins,
and to forgive others; and the former for the sake of the latter, that this may become more
easy (for he who considers his own sins is more indulgent to his fellow-servant); and not
merely to forgive with the lips, but from the heart.</p>
<p>Let us not then thrust the sword into ourselves by being revengeful. For what grief hath
he who hath grieved thee inflicted upon thee, like thou wilt work unto thyself by keeping
thine anger in mind, and drawing upon thyself the sentence from God to condemn thee?
For if indeed thou art watchful, and keepest thyself under control, the evil will come round
upon his head, and it will be he that will suffer harm; but if thou shouldest continue indignant,
and displeased, then thyself wilt undergo the harm not from him, but from thyself.</p>

<p>Say not then that he insulted thee, and slandered thee, and did unto thee ills beyond
number; for the more thou tellest, so much the more dost thou declare him a benefactor.
For he hath given thee an opportunity to wash away thy sins; so that the greater the injuries
he hath done thee, so much more is he become to thee a cause of a greater remission of sins.</p>
<p>For if we be willing, no one shall be able to injure us, but even our enemies shall advantage
us in the greatest degree. And why do I speak of men? For what can be more wicked
than the devil; yet nevertheless, even hence have we a great opportunity of approving
ourselves; and Job showeth it. But if the devil hath become a cause of crowns, why art thou
afraid of a man as an enemy?</p>
<p>See then how much thou gainest, bearing meekly the spiteful acts of thine enemies. First
and greatest, deliverance from sins; secondly, fortitude and patience; thirdly, mildness and
benevolence; for he that knoweth not how to be angry with them that grieve him, much
more will he be ready to serve them that love him. Fourthly, to be free from anger continually,
to which nothing can be equal. For of him that is free from anger, it is quite clear that he is
delivered also from the despondency hence arising, and will not spend his life on vain labors
and sorrows. For he that knows not how to hate, neither doth he know how to grieve, but
will enjoy pleasure, and ten thousand blessings. So that we punish ourselves by hating others,
even as on the other hand we benefit ourselves by loving them.</p>
<p>Besides all these things, thou wilt be an object of veneration even to thy very enemies,
though they be devils; or rather, thou wilt not so much as have an enemy whilst thou art of
such a disposition.</p>
<p>But what is greater than all, and first, thou gainest the favor of God. Shouldest thou
have sinned, thou wilt obtain pardon; shouldest thou have done what is right, thou wilt
obtain a greater confidence. Let us accomplish therefore the hating no one, that God also
may love us, that, though we be in debt for ten thousand talents, He may have compassion
and pity us.</p>
<p>But hast thou been injured by him? Pity him then, do not hate him; weep and mourn,
do not turn away from him. For thou art not the one that hath offended against God, but
he; but thou hast even approved thyself, if thou endure it. Consider that Christ, when about
to be crucified, rejoiced for Himself, but wept for them that were crucifying Him. This ought
to be our disposition also; and the more we are injured, so much the more should we lament
for them that are injuring us. For to us many are the benefits hence arising, but to them the
opposites.</p>
<p>But did he insult thee, and strike thee before all? Then hath he disgraced and dishonored
himself before all, and hath opened the mouths of a thousand accusers, and for thee hath
he woven more crowns, and gathered for thee many to publish thy forbearance.</p>
<p>But did he slander thee to others? And what is this? God is the one that is to demand
the account, not they that have heard this. For to himself hath he added occasion of punish-

<pb n="659"/>
ment, so that not only for his own sins he should give account, but also of what he said of
thee. And upon thee hath he brought evil report with men, but he himself hath incurred
evil report with God.</p>
<p>And if these things are not sufficient for thee, consider that even thy Lord2383was evil
reported of both by Satan and by men, and that to those most loved by Him; and His Only-
Begotten the same again. Wherefore He said, “If they have called the Master of the house
Beelzebub, much more shall they call them of His household.”2384</p>
<p>And that wicked demon did not only slander Him, but was also believed, and slandered
Him not in ordinary matters, but with the greatest reproaches and accusations. For he affirmed
Him to be possessed, and to be a deceiver, and an adversary of God.</p>
<p>But hast thou also done good, and received evil? Nay, in respect of this most of all lament
and grieve for him that hath done the wrong, but for thyself rather rejoice, because thou art
become like God, “Who maketh the sun to rise upon evil and good.”2385</p>
<p>But if to follow God is beyond thee, although to him that watcheth not even this is hard;
yet nevertheless if this seem to thee to be too great for thee, come let us bring thee to thy
fellow-servants, to Joseph, who suffered countless things, and did good unto his brethren;
to Moses, who after their countless plots against him, prayed for them; to the blessed Paul,
who cannot so much as number what he suffered from them, and is willing to be accursed
for them; to Stephen, who is stoned, and entreating this sin may be forgiven them. And
having considered all these things, cast away all anger, that God may forgive us also all our
trespasses by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and always, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXII.</head>
<p>Matt. XIX. 1.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee,
and came into the coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan.”</p>
<p>Having constantly left Judæa on account of the envy of those men, now He frequents
it from this time forth, because the passion was to be nigh at hand; He goeth not up, however,
unto Jerusalem for a while, but “into the coasts of Judæa.”</p>
<p>“And,” when He was come, “great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them.”2386</p>
<p>For neither in the teaching by words doth He continue always, nor in the wonderful
working of signs, but He doeth now one now the other, variously working the salvation of
them that were waiting upon Him and following Him, so as by the miracles to appear, in
what He said, a Teacher worthy of belief, and by the teaching of His word to increase the
profit from the miracles; and this was to lead them by the hand to the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, this too, how the disciples pass over whole multitudes
with one word, not declaring by name each of them that are healed. For they said not, that
such a one, and such another, but that many, teaching us to be unostentatious. But Christ
healed, benefiting both them, and by them many others. For the healing of these men’s infirmity
was to others a foundation for the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>But not so to the Pharisees, but even for this self-same thing they become more fierce,
and come unto Him tempting Him. For because they could not lay hold of the works that
were doing, they propose to Him questions. For they “came unto Him, and tempting Him
said, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?”2387</p>
<p>O folly! They thought to silence Him by their questions, although they had already received
certain proof of this power in Him. When at least they argued much about the Sabbath,
when they said, “He blasphemeth,” when they said, “He hath a devil,” when they found fault
with His disciples as they were walking in the corn fields, when they argued about unwashen
hands, on every occasion having sewed fast their mouths, and shut up their shameless tongue,
He thus sent them away. Nevertheless, not even so do they keep off from Him. For such is
wickedness, such is envy, shameless and bold; though it be put to silence ten thousand times,
ten thousand times doth it assault again.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, their craft also from the form of their question. For neither
did they say unto Him, Thou didst command not to put away a wife, for indeed He had
<note type="footnote">2386 Matt. xix. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">2387 Matt. xix. 3.</note>

<pb n="661"/>
already discoursed about this law; but never theless they made no mention of those words;
but took occasion from hence, and thinking to make their snare the greater, and being
minded to drive Him to a necessity of contradicting the law, they say not, why didst Thou
enact this or that? but as though nothing had been said, they ask, “Is it lawful?” expecting
that He had forgotten having said it; and being ready if on the one hand He said, “It is lawful
to put away,” to bring against Him the things He Himself had spoken, and to say, How then
didst Thou affirm the contrary? but if the same things now again as before, to bring against
Him the words of Moses.</p>
<p>What then said He? He said not,” tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?” although afterwards He
saith this, but here He speaks not thus. Why can this be? In order that together with His
power He might show forth His gentleness also. For He doth neither always keep silence,
lest they should suppose they are hidden; nor doth He always reprove, in order that He may
instruct us to bear all things with gentleness.</p>
<p>How then doth He answer them? “Have ye not read, that He which made them at2388the
beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father
and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be2389one flesh? So that
they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man
put asunder.”2390</p>
<p>See a teacher’s wisdom. I mean, that being asked, Is it lawful? He did not at once say, It
is not lawful, lest they should be disturbed and put in disorder, but before the decision by
His argument He rendered this manifest, showing that it is itself too the commandment of
His Father, and that not in opposition to Moses did He enjoin these things, but in full
agreement with him.</p>
<p>But mark Him arguing strongly not from the creation only, but also from His command.
For He said not, that He made one man and one woman only, but that He also gave this
command that the one man should be joined to the one woman. But if it had been His will
that he should put this one away, and bring in another, when He had made one man, He
would have formed many women.</p>
<p>But now both by the manner of the creation, and by the manner of lawgiving, He showed
that one man must dwell with one woman continually, and never break off from her.</p>
<p>And see how He saith, “He which made them at the beginning, made them male and
female,” that is, from one root they sprung, and into one body came they together, “for the
twain shall be one flesh.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2388 [R.V., “from.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2389 [R.V., “become.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2390 Matt. xix. 4–6.</note>

<pb n="662"/>
<p>After this, to make it a fearful thing to find fault with this lawgiving, and to confirm the
law, He said not, “Sever not therefore, nor put asunder,” but, “What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.”</p>
<p>But if thou put forward Moses, I tell thee of Moses’ Lord, and together with this, I rely
upon the time also. For God at the beginning made them male and female; and this law is
older (though it seem to have been now introduced by me), and with much earnestness established.
For not merely did He bring the woman to the man, but also commanded to leave
father and mother. And neither did He make it a law for him merely to come to the woman,
but also “to cleave to her,” by the form of the language intimating that they might not be
severed. And not even with this was He satisfied, but sought also for another greater union,
“for the twain,” He saith, “shall be one flesh.”</p>
<p>Then after He had recited the ancient law, which was brought in both by deeds and by
words, and shown it to be worthy of respect because of the giver, with authority after that
He Himself too interprets and gives the law, saying, “So that they are no more twain, but
one flesh.” Like then as to sever flesh is a horrible thing,2391so also to divorce a wife is unlawful.
And He stayed not at this, but brought in God also by saying, “What therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder,” showing that the act was both against nature,
and against law; against nature, because one flesh is dissevered; against law, because that
when God hath joined and commanded it not to be divided, ye conspire to do this.</p>
<p>2. What then ought they to have done after this? Ought they not to have held their peace,
and to have commended the saying? ought they not to have marvelled at His wisdom? ought
they not to have stood amazed at His accordance with the Father? But none of these things
do they, but as though they were contending for the law, they say, “How then did Moses
command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?”2392 And yet they ought
not now to have brought this forward, but rather He to them; but nevertheless He doth not
take advantage of them, nor doth He say to them, “I am not now bound by this,” but He
solves this too.</p>
<p>And indeed if He had been an alien from the old covenant, He would not have striven
for Moses, neither would He have argued positively from the things done once for all at the
beginning; He would not have studied to show that His own precepts agreed with those of
old.</p>
<p>And indeed Moses had given many other commandments besides, both those about
meats, and those about the Sabbath; wherefore then do they nowhere bring him forward,
as here? From a wish to enlist the multitude of the husbands against him. For this was considered
a thing indifferent with the Jews, and all used to do so much as this. Accordingly it
<note type="footnote">2391 έναγ.</note>
<note type="footnote">2392 Matt. xix. 7. [“How” is substituted for “why.”]</note>

<pb n="663"/>
was for this reason that when so many things had been said on the mount, they remembered
this commandment only now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, unspeakable wisdom maketh a defense even for these things, and saith,
“Moses for the hardness of your hearts” thus made the law. And not even him doth He
suffer to remain under accusation, forasmuch as He had Himself given him the law; but
delivers him from the charge, and turns the whole upon their head, as everywhere He doth.</p>
<p>For again when they were blaming His disciples for plucking the ears of corn, He shows
themselves to be guilty; and when they were laying a transgression to their charge as to their
not washing their hands, He shows themselves to be the transgressors, and touching the
Sabbath also: both everywhere, and here in like manner.</p>
<p>Then because the saying was hard to bear, and brought on them much blame, He quickly
directs back His discourse to that ancient law, saying as He had said before also, “But in the
beginning it was not so,” that is, God by His acts at the beginning ordained the contrary.
For in order that they may not say, Whence is it manifest, that “for our hardness Moses said
this?” hereby again He stoppeth their mouths. For if this were the primary law, and for our
good, that other would not have been given at the beginning; God in creating would not
have so created, He would not have said such things.</p>
<p>“But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication, and
marry another, committeth adultery.”2393 For since he had stopped their mouths, He then
gives the law with His own authority, like as touching the meats, like as touching the Sabbath.</p>
<p>For with regard to the meats likewise, when He had overcome them, then, and not till
then, He declared unto the multitude, that, “Not that which goeth in defileth the
man;”2394and with regard to the Sabbath, when He had stopped their mouths, He saith,
“Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath day;”2395and here this self-same thing.</p>
<p>But what took place there, this happened here also. For as there, when the Jews had
been put to silence the disciples were troubled, and came unto Him with Peter and said,
“Declare unto us this parable;”2396even so now also they were troubled and said, “If the case
of the man be so, it is good not to marry.”2397</p>
<p>For now they understood the saying more than before. Therefore then indeed they held
their peace, but now when there hath been gainsaying, and answering, and question, and
learning by reply, and the law appeared more clear, they ask Him. And openly to contradict
they do not dare, but they bring forward what seemed to be a grievous and galling result of

<pb n="664"/>
it, saying, “If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.” For indeed it
seemed to be a very hard thing to have a wife full of every bad quality, and to endure a wild
beast perpetually shut up with one in the house. And that thou mayest learn that this greatly
troubled them, Mark said,2398to show it, that they spake to Him privately.</p>
<p>3. But what is, “If such be the case of a man with his wife?” That is, if to this end he is
joined with her, that they should be one, or, on the other hand, if the man shall get to himself
blame for these things, and always transgresses by putting away, it were easier to fight against
natural desire and against one’s self, than against a wicked woman.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? He said not, “yea, it is easier, and so do,” lest they should suppose
that the thing is a law; but He subjoined, “Not all men receive it, but they to whom it is
given,”2399raising the thing, and showing that it is great, and in this way drawing them on,
and urging them.</p>
<p>But see herein a contradiction. For He indeed saith this is a great thing; but they, that
it is easier. For it was meet that both these things should be done, and that it should be at
once acknowledged a great thing by Him, that it might render them more forward, and by
the things said by themselves it should be shown to be easier, that on this ground too they
might the rather choose virginity and continence. For since to speak of virginity seemed to
be grievous, by the constraint of this law He drove them to this desire. Then to show the
possibility of it, He saith, “There are some eunuchs, who were so born from their mother’s
womb, there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men, and there be eunuchs
which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven’s sake,”2400by these words
secretly leading them to choose the thing, and establishing the possibility of this virtue, and
all but saying, Consider if thou wert in such case by nature, or hadst endured this selfsame
thing at the hands of those who inflict such wanton injuries, what wouldest thou have done,
being deprived indeed of the enjoyment, yet not having a reward? Thank God therefore
now, for that with rewards and crowns thou undergoest this, which those men endure
without crowns; or rather not even this, but what is much lighter, being supported both by
hope, and by the consciousness of the good work, and not having the desire so raging like
waves within thee.</p>
<p>For the excision of a member is not able to quell such waves, and to make a calm, like
the curb of reason; or rather, reason only can do this.</p>
<p>For this intent therefore He brought in those others, even that He might encourage
these, since if this was not what He was establishing, what means His saying concerning the
other eunuchs? But when He saith, that they made themselves eunuchs, He means not the
<note type="footnote">2398 Mark x. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">2399 Matt. xix. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">2400 Matt. xix. 12.</note>

<pb n="665"/>
excision of the members, far from it, but the putting away of wicked thoughts. Since the
man who hath mutilated himself, in fact, is subject even to a curse, as Paul saith, “I would
they were even cut off2401which trouble you.”2402 And very reasonably. For such a one is
venturing on the deeds of murderers, and giving occasion to them that slander God’s creation,
and opens the mouths of the Manichæans, and is guilty of the same unlawful acts as they
that mutilate themselves amongst the Greeks. For to cut off our members hath been from
the beginning a work of demoniacal agency, and satanic device, that they may bring up a
bad report upon the work of God, that they may mar this living creature, that imputing all
not to the choice, but to the nature of our members, the more part of them may sin in security,
as being irresponsible; and doubly harm this living creature, both by mutilating the members,
and by impeding the forwardness of the free choice in behalf of good deeds.</p>
<p>These are the ordinances of the devil, bringing in, besides the things which we have
mentioned, another wicked doctrine also, and making way beforehand for the arguments
concerning destiny and necessity even from hence, and everywhere marring the freedom
given to us of God, and persuading us that evil deeds are of nature, and hence secretly implanting
many other wicked doctrines, although not openly. For such are the devil’s poisons.</p>
<p>Therefore I beseech you to flee from such lawlessness. For together with the things I
have mentioned, neither doth the force of lust become milder hereby, but even more fierce.
For from another origin hath the seed that is in us its sources, and from another cause do
its waves swell. And some say from the brain, some from the loins, this violent impulse hath
its birth; but I should say from nothing else than from an ungoverned will and a neglected
mind: if this be temperate, there is no evil result from the motions of nature.</p>
<p>Having spoken then of the eunuchs that are eunuchs for nought and fruitlessly, unless
with the mind they too practise temperance, and of those that are virgins for Heaven’s sake,
He proceeds again to say, “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,” at once making
them more earnest by showing that the good work is exceeding in greatness, and not suffering
the thing to be shut up in the compulsion of a law, because of His unspeakable gentleness.
And this He said, when He showed it to be most possible, in order that the emulation of the
free choice might be greater.</p>
<p>And if it is of free choice, one may say, how doth He say, at the beginning, “All men do
not receive it, but they to whom it is given?” That thou mightest learn that the conflict is
great, not that thou shouldest suspect any compulsory allotments. For it is given to those,
even to the willing.</p>
<note type="footnote">2401 ἀποκψονται, which may mean this. [R.V. margin, “mutilate themselves.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2402 Gal. v. 12. [Whatever be the meaning of the verb in Galatians, there can be no question that the use here
made of the passage is forced.—R.]</note>

<pb n="666"/>
<p>But He spake thus to show that much influence from above is needed by him who
entereth these lists, whereof He that is willing shall surely partake. For it is customary for
Him to use this form of speech when the good work done is great, as when He saith, “To
you it is given to know the mysteries.”</p>
<p>And that this is true, is manifest even from the present instance. For if it be of the gift
from above only, and they that live as virgins contribute nothing themselves, for nought
did He promise them the kingdom of Heaven, and distinguish them from the other eunuchs.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray, how from some men’s wicked doings, other men gain. I mean,
that the Jews went away having learnt nothing, for neither did they ask with the intent of
learning, but the disciples gained even from hence.</p>
<p>4. “Then were there brought unto Him little children, that He should put His hands on
them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. But He said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven. And He laid His hands
on them, and departed thence.”2403</p>
<p>And wherefore did the disciples repel the little children? For dignity. What then doth
He? Teaching them to be lowly, and to trample under foot worldly pride, He doth receive
them, and takes them in His arms, and to such as them promises the kingdom; which kind
of thing He said before also.2404</p>
<p>Let us also then, if we would be inheritors of the Heavens, possess ourselves of this virtue
with much diligence. For this is the limit of true wisdom; to be simple with understanding;
this is angelic life; yes, for the soul of a little child is pure from all the passions. Towards
them who have vexed him he bears no resentment, but goes to them as to friends, as if
nothing had been done; and how much soever he be beaten by his mother; after her he seeks,
and her doth he prefer to all. Though thou show him the queen with a diadem, he prefers
her not to his mother clad in rags, but would choose rather to see her in these, than the
queen in splendor. For he useth to distinguish what pertains to him and what is strange to
him, not by its poverty and wealth, but by friendship. And nothing more than necessary
things doth he seek, but just to be satisfied from the breast, and then he leaves sucking. The
young child is not grieved at what we are grieved, as at loss of money and such things as
that, and he doth not rejoice again at what we rejoice, namely, at these temporal things, he
is not eager about the beauty of persons.</p>
<p>Therefore He said, “of such is the kingdom of Heaven,” that by choice we should practise
these things, which young children have by nature. For since the Pharisees from nothing
else so much as out of craft and pride did what they did, therefore on every hand He charges
the disciples to be single hearted, both darkly hinting at those men, and instructing these.
<note type="footnote">2403 Matt. xix. 13–15.</note>
<note type="footnote">2404 Matt. xviii. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="667"/>
For nothing so much lifts up unto haughtiness, as power and precedence. Forasmuch then
as the disciples were to enjoy great honors throughout the whole world, He preoccupies
their mind, not suffering them to feel anything after the manner of men, neither to demand
honors from the multitude, nor to have men clear the way2405before them.</p>
<p>For though these seem to be little things, yet are they a cause of great evils. The Pharisees
at least being thus trained were carried on into the very summit of evil, seeking after the
salutations, the first seats, the middle places,2406for from these they were cast upon the shoal
of their mad desire of glory, then from thence upon impiety. So therefore those men went
away having drawn upon themselves a curse by their tempting, but the little children a
blessing, as being freed from all these.</p>
<p>Let us then also be like the little children, and “in malice be we babes.”2407 For it cannot
be, it cannot be for one otherwise to see Heaven, but the crafty and wicked must needs surely
be cast into hell.</p>
<p>5. And before hell too, we shall here suffer the utmost ills. “For if thou be evil,” it is said,
“thou alone shalt endure the evil; but if good, it is for thyself and for thy neighbor.”2408
Mark, at any rate, how this took place in the former instances also. For neither was anything
more wicked than Saul, nor more simple and single-hearted than David. Which therefore
was the stronger? Did not David get him twice into his hands, and having the power to slay
him, forebore? Had he not him shut up as in a net and prison, and spared him? And this
when both others were urging him, and when he himself was able to accuse him of countless
charges; but nevertheless he suffered him to go away safe. And yet the other was pursuing
him with all his army, but he was, with a few desperate fugitives, wandering and changing
from place to place; nevertheless the fugitive had the advantage of the king, forasmuch as
the one came to the conflict with simplicity, the other with wickedness.</p>
<p>For what could be more wicked than that man, who when he was leading his armies,
and bringing all his wars to a successful issue, and undergoing the labors of the victory and
the trophies, but bringing the crowns to him, assayed to slay him?</p>
<p>6. Such is the nature of envy, it is ever plotting against its own honors, and wasting him
that hath it, and encompassing him with countless calamities. And that miserable man, for
instance, until David departed, burst not forth into that piteous cry, bewail ing himself and
saying, “I am sore distressed, and the Philistines make war against me, and the Lord is departed
from me.”2409 Until he was separated from David, he fell not in war, but was both

in safety and in glory; for indeed unto the king passed the glory of the captain. For neither
was the man disposed to usurpation, nor did he assay to depose the other from his throne,
but for him did he achieve all things, and was earnestly attached to him, and this is evident
even from what followed afterwards. For when indeed he was set under him, any one of
them who do not search carefully might perhaps suppose these things to be by the usual
custom of a subject; but after he had withdrawn himself out of Saul’s kingdom, what then
was there to restrain him, and to him even to slay? Had not the other been evil towards him
once, twice, and often? Was it not after having received benefits from him? Was it not having
nothing whereof to accuse him? Was not Saul’s kingdom and safety danger and insecurity
to himself? must he not needs wander and be a fugitive, and be in trembling for fear of the
utmost ills, while the other is alive, and reigning? Nevertheless none of these things constrained
him to stain his sword with blood, but when he saw him asleep, and bound, and
alone, and in the midst of his own men, and had touched his head, and when there were
many rousing him to it, and saying the opportunity thus favorable was a judgment of God,
he at once rebuked those who were urging him on, and refrained from the murder, and sent
him away both safe and well; and as though he had been rather a body guard of his, and a
shield-bearer, not an enemy, so did he chide the host for their treachery towards the king.2410</p>
<p>What could be equal to this soul? What to that mildness? For this it is possible to see
even by the things that have been mentioned but much more by what are done now. For
when we have considered our vileness, then we shall know more perfectly the virtue of those
saints. Wherefore I entreat you to hasten towards the emulation of them.</p>
<p>For indeed if thou lovest glory, and for this cause art plotting against thy neighbor, then
shalt thou enjoy it more largely, when having spurned it, thou wilt abstain from the plotting.
For like as to become rich2411is contrary to covetousness, so is the loving of glory to the
obtaining of glory. And if ye be minded, let us inquire into each. For since we have no fear
of hell, nor much regard for the kingdom, come and even from the things present let us lead
you on.</p>
<p>For who are they that are ridiculous? Tell me. Is it not they that are doing anything for
the sake of glory from the multitude? And who are the objects of praise? Is it not they who
spurn the praise of the multitude? Therefore if the love of vainglory be matter of reproach,
and it cannot be concealed that the vainglorious man loves it, he will assuredly be an object
of reproach, and the love of glory is become to him a cause of dishonor. And not in this respect
only doth he disgrace himself, but also in that he is compelled to do many things
shameful, and teeming with the utmost disgrace. And like as with respect to their gains men
<note type="footnote">2410 1 Sam. xxvi. 16.</note>

Mr. Field, with the Latin Translator.</note>

<pb n="669"/>
are wont to suffer harm more than anything from the disease of covetousness (they become
at least the subjects of many tricks, and of small gains make great losses, wherefore this
saying hath prevailed even to be a proverb); and as to the voluptuous man likewise, his
passion becomes a hindrance to the enjoyment of his pleasure. These at least that are exceedingly
given up thereto, and are the slaves of women these above all do women carry about
as servants, and will never vouchsafe to treat them as men, buffeting, spurning them, leading,
and taking them about everywhere, and giving themselves airs, and in everything merely
giving them orders.</p>
<p>Even so also than him that is arrogant and mad about glory, and accounts himself to
be high, nothing is more base and dishonored. For the race of man is fond of contention,
and against nothing else doth it set itself so much, as against a boaster, and a contemptuous
man, and a slave of glory.</p>
<p>And he himself too, in order to maintain the fashion of his pride, exhibits the conduct
of a slave to the common sort, flattering, courting them, serving a servitude more grievous
than that of one bought for money.</p>
<p>Knowing then all these things, let us lay down these passions, that we may not both pay
a penalty here, and there be punished without end. Let us become lovers of virtue. For so
both before reaching the kingdom we shall reap the greatest benefits here, and when we are
departed thither we shall partake of the eternal blessings; unto which God grant we may all
attain by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXIII.</head>
<p>Matt. XIX. 16.</p>
<p>“And, behold, one came and said unto Him, Good Master, by doing what, shall I inherit
eternal life?”</p>
<p>Some indeed accuse this young man, as one dissembling and ill-minded, and coming
with a temptation to Jesus, but I, though I would not say he was not fond of money, and
under subjection to his wealth, since Christ in fact convicted him of being such a character,
yet a dissembler I would by no means call him, both because it is not safe to venture on
things uncertain, and especially in blame, and because Mark hath taken away this suspicion;
for he saith, that “having come running unto Him, and kneeling to Him, he besought Him,”
and that “Jesus beheld him, and loved him.”2412</p>
<p>But great is the tyranny of wealth, and it is manifest hence; I mean, that though we be
virtuous as to the rest, this ruins all besides. With reason hath Paul also affirmed it to be the
root of all evils in general. “For the love of money is the root of all evils,”2413he saith.</p>
<p>Wherefore then doth Christ thus reply to him, saying, “There is none good?”2414 Because
He came unto Him as a mere man, and one of the common sort, and a Jewish teacher; for
this cause then as a man He discourses with him. And indeed in many instances He replies
to the secret thoughts of them that come unto Him; as when He saith, “We worship we
know what;”2415and, “If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.”2416 When therefore
He saith, “There is none good;” not as putting Himself out from being good doth He say
this, far from it; for he said not, “Why dost thou call me good? I am not good;” but, “there
is none good,” that is, none amongst men.</p>
<p>And when He saith this self-same thing, He saith it not as depriving even men of
goodness, but in contradistinction to the goodness of God. Wherefore also He added, “But
one, that is, God;” and He said not, “but my Father,” that thou mightest learn that He had
not revealed Himself to the young man. So also further back He called men evil, saying, “If
ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.”2417 For indeed there too He

called them evil, not as condemning the whole race as evil (for by “ye,” He means not “ye
men”), but comparing the goodness that is in men with the goodness of God, He thus named
it; therefore also He added, “How much more shall your Father give good things to them
that ask Him?” And what was there to urge Him,2418or what the profit that He should answer
in this way? He leads him on by little and little, and teaches him to be far from all flattery,
drawing him off from the things upon each, and fastening him upon God, and persuading
him to seek after the things to come, and to know that which is really good, and the root
and fountain of all things, and to refer the honors to Him.</p>
<p>Since also when He saith, “Call no one master upon earth,” it is in contradistinction to
Himself He saith this, and that they might learn what is the chief sovereignty over all things
that are. For neither was it a small forwardness the young man had shown up to this time
in having fallen into such a desire; and when of the rest some were tempting, some were
coming to Him for the cure of diseases, either their own or others, he for eternal life was
both coming to Him, and discoursing with Him. For fertile was the land and rich, but the
multitude of the thorns choked the seed. Mark at any rate how he is prepared thus far for
obedience to the commandments. For “By doing what,” he saith, “shall I inherit eternal
life?” So ready was he for the performance of the things that should be told him. But if he
had come unto Him, tempting Him, the evangelist would have declared this also to us, as
He doth also with regard to the others, as in the case of the lawyer. And though himself had
been silent, Christ could not have suffered him to lie concealed, but would have convicted
him plainly, or at least would have intimated it, so that he should not seem to have deceived
Him, and to be hidden, and thereby have suffered hurt.</p>
<p>If he had come unto Him tempting, he would not have departed sorrowing for what he
heard. This was not at any rate ever the feeling of any of the Pharisees, but they grew fierce
when their mouths were stopped. But not so this man; but he goeth away cast down, which
is no little sign that not with an evil will he had come unto Him, but with one too feeble,
and that he did indeed desire life, but was held in subjection by another and most grievous
feeling.</p>
<p>Therefore when Christ said, “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,” he
saith, “Which?” Not tempting, far from it, but supposing there were some others besides
those of the law that should procure him life, which was like one who was very desirous.
Then since Jesus mentioned those out of the law, he saith, “All these things have I kept from
my youth up.”2419 And neither at this did he stop, but again asks, “What lack I yet?” which
itself again was a sign of his very earnest desire.2420</p>
<note type="footnote">2418 [φησν, “one may say,” occurs in the Greek here.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2419 Matt. xix. 20. [R.V. omits “from my youth up.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2420 [An important sentence is omitted here: “But that also was not a little thing which he supposed he lacked,
nor did he think that what he had said sufficed for attaining what he desired.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="672"/>
<p>What then saith Christ? Since He was going to enjoin something great, He setteth forth
the recompenses, and saith, “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, and follow me.”2421</p>
<p>2. Seest thou how many prizes, how many crowns, He appoints for this race? If he had
been tempting, He would not have told him these things. But now He both saith it, and in
order to draw him on, He also shows him the reward to be great, and leaves it all to his own
will, by all means throwing into the shade that which seemed to be grievous in His advice.
Wherefore even before mentioning the conflicts and the toil, He shows him the prize, saying
“If thou wilt be perfect,” and then saith, “Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,” and
straightway again the rewards, “Thou shalt have treasure in Heaven; and come, and follow
me.” For indeed to follow Him is a great recompense. “And thou shalt have treasure in
Heaven.”</p>
<p>For since his discourse was of money, even of all did He advise him to strip himself,
showing that he loses not what he hath, but adds to his possessions, He gave him more than
He required him to give up; and not only more, but also as much greater as Heaven is
greater than earth, and yet more so.</p>
<p>But He called it a treasure, showing the plenteousness of the recompense, its permanency,
its security, so far as it was possible by human similitudes to intimate it to the hearer. It is
not then enough to despise wealth, but we must also maintain poor men, and above all
things follow Christ; that is, do all the things that are ordered by Him, be ready for slaughter
and daily death. “For if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me.”2422 So that to cast away one’s money is a much less thing than this
last commandment, to shed even one’s very blood; yet not a little doth our being freed from
wealth contribute towards this.</p>
<p>“But when the young man heard it, he went away sorrowful.”2423 After this the evangelist,
as it were to show that he hath not felt anything it was unlikely he should feel, saith, “For
he had2424great possessions.” For they that have little are not equally held in subjection, as
they that are overflowed with great affluence, for then the love of it becomes more tyrannical.
Which thing I cease not always saying, that the increase of acquisitions kindles the flame
more, and renders the getters poorer, inasmuch as it puts them in greater desire, and makes
them have more feeling of their want.</p>
<p>See, for example, even here what strength did this passion exhibit. Him that had come
to Him with joy and forwardness, when Christ commanded him to cast away his riches, it

<note type="footnote">2423 Matt. xix. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">2424 [R.V., “he was one that had,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="673"/>
so overwhelmed and weighed down, as not to suffer him so much as to answer touching
these things, but silenced and become dejected and sullen to go away.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “How hardly shall the rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven!”
2425blaming not riches but them that are held in subjection by them. But if the rich man
“hardly,” much more the covetous man. For if not to give one’s own be an hindrance to
entering the kingdom, even to take of other men’s goods, think how much fire it heapeth
up.</p>
<p>Why can it have been, however, that He said to His disciples, that “hardly shall a rich
man enter in,” they being poor men, and having no possessions? Instructing them not to
be ashamed of their poverty, and, as it were, excusing Himself to them for suffering them
to have nothing.</p>
<p>But having said it was hard; as He proceeds, He shows that it is even impossible, and
not merely impossible, but even in the highest degree impossible; and this He showed by
the comparison concerning the camel and the2426needle.</p>
<p>“It is easier” saith He, “for a camel to enter in by the eye of a needle,2427than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”2428 Whence it is shown, that there is no ordinary
reward for them that are rich, and are able to practise self command. Wherefore also He
affirmed it to be a work of God, that He might show that great grace is needed for him who
is to achieve this. At least, when the disciples were troubled, He said, “With men this is impossible;
but with God all things are possible.”2429</p>
<p>And wherefore are the disciples troubled, being poor, yea, exceedingly poor? Wherefore
then are they confounded? Being in pain about the salvation of the rest, and having a great
affection for all, and having already taken upon themselves the tender bowels of teachers.
They were at least in such trembling and fear for the whole world from this declaration, as
to need much comfort.</p>
<p>Therefore, having first “beheld them, He said unto them, The things which are impossible
with men, are possible with God.” For with a mild and meek look, having soothed their
shuddering mind, and having put an end to their distress (for this the evangelist signified
by saying, “He beheld them”), then by His words also He relieves them, bringing before
them God’s power, and so making them feel confidence.</p>

<pb n="674"/>
<p>But if thou wilt learn the manner of it likewise, and how what is impossible may become
possible, hear. Born either for this end did He say, “The things which are impossible with
men, are possible with God,” that thou shouldest give it up, and abstain, as from things
impossible; but that having considered the greatness of the good work, thou shouldest hasten
to it readily, and having besought God to assist thee in these noble contests, shouldest attain
unto life.</p>
<p>3. How then should this become possible? If thou cast away what thou hast, if thou
empty thyself of thy wealth, if thou refrain from the wicked desire. For in proof that He does
not refer it to God alone, but that to this end He said it, that thou shouldest know the vastness
of the good work, hear what follows. For when Peter had said, “Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed Thee,” and had asked, “What shall we have therefore?” having appointed
the reward for them; He added, “And every one who hath forsaken houses, or lands, or
brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit
eternal life.”2430 Thus that which is impossible becometh possible. But how may this very
thing be done, one may say, to forsake these? how is it possible for him that is once sunk in
such lust of wealth, to recover himself? If he begin to empty himself of his possessions, and
cut off what are superfluous. For so shall he both advance further, and shall run on his course
more easily afterwards.</p>
<p>Do not then seek all at once, but gently, and by little and little, ascend this ladder, that
leads thee up to Heaven.2431 For like as those in fevers having acrid bile abounding within
them, when they cast in thereon meats and drinks, so far from quenching their thirst, do
even kindle the flame; so also the covetous, when they cast in their wealth upon this wicked
lust more acrid than that bile, do rather inflame it. For nothing so stays it as to refrain for
a time from the lust of gain, like as acrid bile is stayed by abstinence and evacuations.</p>
<p>But this itself, by what means will it be done? one may say. If thou consider, that whilst
rich, thou wilt never cease thirsting, and pining with the lust of more; but being freed from
thy possessions, thou wilt be able also to stay this disease. Do not then encompass thyself
with more, lest thou follow after things unattainable, and be incurable, and be more miserable
than all, being thus frantic.</p>
<p>For answer me, whom shall we affirm to be tormented and pained? him that longs after
costly meats and drinks, and is not able to enjoy them as he will, or him that hath not such
a desire? It is quite clear one must say, him that desires, but cannot obtain what he desires.
For this is so painful, to desire and not to enjoy, to thirst and not to drink, that Christ desiring
<note type="footnote">2430 Matt. xix. 27–29. [The position of the word “lands” is peculiar; “or wife” is not found here, but occurs
in Homily LXIV. 1.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2431 [The following clause is omitted in the translation: “though (or, if) as a whole it seems difficult to
them.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="673"/>
to describe hell to us, described it in this way, and introduced the rich man thus tormented.
For longing for a drop of water, and not enjoying it, this was his punishment. So then he
that despises wealth quiets the desire, but he that desires to be rich2432hath inflamed it more,
and not yet doth he stay; but though he have got ten thousand talents, he desireth as much
more; though he obtain these, again he aims at twice as much more, and going on he desires
even the mountains, and the earth, and the sea, and all to become gold for him, being mad
with a kind of new and fearful madness, and one that can never thus be extinguished.</p>
<p>And that thou mightest learn, that not by addition but by taking away this evil is stayed;
if thou hadst ever had an absurd desire to fly and to be borne through the air, how wouldest
thou extinguish this unreasonable desire? By fashioning wings, and preparing other instruments,
or by convincing the mind that it is desiring things impossible, and that one should
attempt none of these things? It is quite plain, that by convincing the mind. But that, thou
mayest say, is impossible. But this again is more impossible, to find a limit for this desire.
For indeed it is more easy for men to fly, than to make this lust cease by an addition of more.
For when the objects of desire are possible, one may be soothed by the enjoyment of them,
but when they are impossible, one must labor for one thing, to draw ourselves off from the
desire, as otherwise at least it is not possible to recover the soul.</p>
<p>Therefore that we may not have superfluous sorrows, let us forsake the love of money
that is ever paining, and never endures to hold its peace, and let us remove ourselves to another
love, which both makes us happy, and hath great facility, and let us long after the
treasures above. For neither is the labor here so great, and the gain is unspeakable, and it is
not possible for him to fail of them who is but in any wise watchful and sober, and despises
the things present; even as on the other hand, as to him that is a slave to these last, and is
utterly given up to them, it as altogether of necessity that he fail of those better riches.</p>
<p>4. Considering then all these things, put away the wicked desire of wealth. For neither
couldest thou say this, that it gives the things present, though it deprive us of the things to
come, albeit even if this were so, this were extreme punishment, and vengeance. But now
not even this may be. For besides hell, and before that hell, even here it casts thee into a
more grievous punishment. For many houses hath this lust overthrown, and fierce wars
hath it stirred up, and compelled men to end their lives by a violent death; and before these
dangers it ruins the nobleness of the soul, and is wont often to make him that hath it cowardly,
and unmanly, and rash, and false, and calumnious, and ravenous, and over-reaching,
and all the worst things.</p>
<p>But seeing perhaps the brightness of the silver, and the multitude of the servants, and
the beauty of the buildings, the court paid in the market-place, art thou bewitched thereby?
What remedy then may there be for this evil wound? If thou consider how these things affect
<note type="footnote">2432 [The Greek adds here, κα περιβλλεσθαι πλεω, and to possess himself of more.—R.]</note>

<pb n="676"/>
thy soul, how dark, and desolate, and foul they render it, and how ugly; if thou reckon with
how many evils these things were acquired, with how many labors they are kept, with how
many dangers: or rather they are not kept unto the end, but when thou hast escaped the attempts
of all, death coming on thee is often wont to remove these things into the hand of
thine enemies, and goeth and taketh thee with him destitute, drawing after thee none of
these things, save the wounds and the sores only, which the soul received from these, before
its departing. When then thou seest any one resplendent outwardly with raiment and large
attendance, lay open his conscience, and thou shalt see many a cobweb within, and much
dust. Consider Paul, Peter. Consider John, Elias, or rather the Son of God Himself, who
hath not where to lay His head. Be an imitator of Him, and of His servants, and imagine to
thyself the unspeakable riches of these.</p>
<p>But if having obtained a little sight by these, thou shouldest be darkened again, as in
any shipwreck when a storm hath come on, hear the declaration of Christ, which affirms,
that it is impossible “for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” And against this
declaration set the mountains, and the earth, and the sea; and all things, if thou wilt, suppose2433to
be gold; for thou shalt see nothing equal to the loss arising to thee from thence.
And thou indeed makest mention of acres of land, so many and so many, and of houses ten
or twenty or even more, and of baths as many, and of slaves a thousand, or twice as many,
and of chariots fastened with silver and overlaid with gold; but I say this, that if each one of
you that are rich were to leave this poverty (for these things are poverty compared with what
I am about to say), and were possessed of a whole world, and each of them had as many
men as are now everywhere on land and sea, and each a world both sea and land, and
everywhere buildings, and cities, and nations, and from every side instead of water, instead
of fountains, gold flowed up for him, I would not say those who are thus rich are worth
three farthings, when they are cast out of the kingdom.</p>
<p>For if now aiming at riches that perish, when they miss them, they are tormented, if
they should obtain a perception of those unspeakable blessings, what then will suffice for
consolation for them? There is nothing. Tell me not then of the abundance of their possessions,
but consider how great loss the lovers of this abundance undergo in consequence
thereof, for these things losing Heaven, and being in the same state, as if any one after being
cast out of the highest honor in kings’ courts, having a dung heap, were to pride himself on
that. For the storing up of money differs nothing from that, or rather that is even the better.
For that is serviceable both for husbandry, and for heating a bath, and for other such uses,
but the buried gold for none of these things. And would it were merely useless; but as it is,
it kindles moreover many furnaces for him that hath it, unless he use it rightly; countess
evils at least spring therefrom.</p>
<note type="footnote">2433 τ λγ ποησον.</note>

<pb n="677"/>
<p>Therefore they that are without used to call the love of money the citadel2434of evils;
but the blessed Paul spake much better and more vividly, pronouncing it “the root of all
evils.”2435</p>
<p>Considering then all these things, let us emulate the things worthy of emulation, not
gorgeous buildings not costly estates, but the men that have much confidence towards God,
those that have riches in Heaven, the owners of those treasures, them that are really rich,
them that are poor for Christ’s sake, that we may attain unto the good things of eternity by
the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and always and world without end.

<p>Matt. XIX. 27.</p>
<p>“Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed Thee;
what shall we have therefore?”</p>
<p>All which? O blessed Peter; the rod? the net? the boat? the craft? These things dost thou
tell me of, as all? Yea, saith he, but not for display do I say these things, but in order that by
this question I may bring in the multitude of the poor. For since the Lord had said, “If thou
wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
Heaven;”2436lest any one of the poor should say, What then? if I have no possessions, can
I not be perfect? Peter asks, that thou, the poor man, mayest learn, that thou art made in no
respect inferior by this: Peter asks, that thou mayest not learn from Peter and doubt (for
indeed he was imperfect as yet, and void of the Spirit), but that, having received the declaration
from Peter’s Master, thou mayest be confident.</p>
<p>For like as we do (we make things our own often when speaking of the concerns of
others), so did the apostle, when he put to Him this question in behalf of all the world. Since
that at least he knew with certainty his own portion, is manifest from what had been said
before; for he that had already received the keys of the Heavens, much more might feel
confidence about the things hereafter.</p>
<p>But mark also how exactly his reply is according to Christ’s demand. For He had required
of the rich man these two things, to give that he had to the poor, and to follow Him.
Wherefore he also expresses these two things, to forsake, and to follow. “For behold we have
forsaken all,” saith he, “and have followed Thee.” For the forsaking was done for the sake
of following, and the following was rendered easier by the forsaking, and made them feel
confidence and joy touching the forsaking.</p>
<p>What then saith He? “Verily, I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the re-
generation when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”2437 What then, one may say, shall Judas
sit there? By no means. How, then, doth He say, “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones?” how shall
the terms of the promise be fulfilled?</p>
<p>Hear how, and on what principle. There is a law ordained of God, recited by Jeremiah,
the prophet to the Jews, and in these words: “At what instant I shall speak a sentence concerning
a nation and kingdom, to pluck up and destroy; if that nation turn from their evil
deeds, I also will repent of the evils, which I thought to do unto them. And at what instant
<note type="footnote">2436 Matt. xix. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">2437 Matt. xix. 28.</note>

<pb n="679"/>
I shall speak concerning a nation and kingdom to build and to plant it; and if they do evil
in my sight, that they obey not my voice, I also will repent of the good, which I said I would
do unto them.”2438</p>
<p>For the same custom do I observe with respect to the good things as well, saith He. For
though I spake of building up, should they show themselves unworthy of the promise, I will
no longer do it. Which sort of thing was done with respect to man upon his creation, “For
the dread of you,” it is said, “and the fear of you shall be on the wild beasts,”2439and it came
not to pass, for he proved himself unworthy of the sovereignty, even as did Judas also.</p>
<p>For in order that neither at the denunciations of punishment any men should despair
and become more hardened, nor by the promises of good things be rendered causelessly
more remiss, He remedies both these evils, by that which I have before mentioned, saying
in this way: Though I should threaten, do not despair; for thou art able to repent, and to
reverse the denunciation, like the Ninevites. Though I should promise any good thing, grow
not remiss because of the promise. For shouldest thou appear unworthy, the fact of my
having promised will not advantage thee, but will rather bring punishment. For I promise
thee being worthy.</p>
<p>Therefore even then in His discourse with His disciples He did not promise to them
simply, for neither did He say, “you,” only, but added, “which have followed me,” that He
might both cast out Judas, and draw towards Him those that should come afterwards. For
neither to them only was it said, nor to Judas any more, when he had become unworthy.</p>
<p>Now to the disciples He promised things to come, saying, “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones,”
for they were now of a higher stamp, and sought after none of the things of the present
world, but to the rest He promises also what are here.</p>
<p>For “every one,” He saith, “that hath forsaken brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, or lands, or house, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold in
this world, and shall inherit eternal life.”2440</p>
<p>For lest any after having heard the word “ye,” should suppose this a thing peculiar to
the disciples (I mean now the enjoying the greatest and first honors in the things to come),
He extended the word, and spread the promise over the whole earth, and from the things
present establishes the things to come also. And to the disciples also at the beginning, when
they were in a more imperfect state, He reasoned from the things present. For when He
drew them from the sea, and took them from their trade, and commanded them to forsake
the ships, He made mention not of Heaven, not of thrones, but of the things here, saying,

<pb n="680"/>
“I will make you fishers of men;” but when He had wrought them to be of higher views,
then after that He discourses of the things to come also.</p>
<p>2. But what is, “Judging the twelve tribes of Israel?” This is, “condemning them.” For
they are not surely to sit as judges, but like as He said the Queen of the South should condemn
that generation, and the Ninevites shall condemn them; so now these also. Therefore He
said not, the nations, and the world, but the tribes of Israel. For since both the Jews alike
and the apostles had been brought up under the same laws, and customs, and polity; when
the Jews said, that for this cause they could not believe in Christ, because the law forbade
to receive His commandments, by bringing forward these men, who had received the same
law, and yet had believed, He condemns all those; like as even already He had said, “therefore
they shall be your judges.”2441</p>
<p>And what great thing doth He promise them, it may be said, if what the Ninevites have
and the Queen of the South, this these are to have also? In the first place He had promised
them many other things before this, and after this doth promise them, and this alone is not
their reward.</p>
<p>And besides even in this He intimated by the way something more than these things.
For of those He simply said, The men of Nineveh shall rise up and condemn this gen eration,”
2442and, “The Queen of the South shall condemn it;” but concerning these, not merely
thus, but how? “When the Son of Man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, then shall ye
also sit upon twelve thrones,” saith He, declaring, that they also shall reign with Him, and
partake of that glory. “For if we suffer,” it is said, “we shall also reign with Him.”2443 For
neither do the thrones signify a sitting (in judgment), for He alone is the one that shall sit
and judge, but honor and glory unspeakable did He intimate by the thrones.</p>
<p>To these then He spake of these things, but to all the rest of eternal life and an hundredfold
here. But if to the rest, much more to these too, both these things, and the things in this
life.</p>
<p>And this surely came to pass; for when they had left a fishing rod and a net, they possessed
with authority the substances of all, the prices of the houses and the lands, and the
very bodies of the believers. For often did they choose even to be slain for their sake, as Paul
also bears witness to many, when he saith, “If it had been possible ye would have plucked
out your eyes, and given them to me.”2444 But when He saith, “Every one who hath forsaken
wife,” He saith not this, for marriages to be broken asunder for nought, but as He saith
concerning one’s life, “He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it,”2445not that we should

destroy ourselves, neither that while yet here we should part it from the body, but that we
should prefer godliness to all things; this too He saith also with respect to wife and brethren.</p>
<p>But He seems to me here to intimate also the persecutions. For since there were many
instances both of fathers urging their sons to ungodliness, and wives their husbands; when
they command these things, saith He, let them be neither wives nor parents, even as Paul
likewise said, “But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart.”2446</p>
<p>When He had then raised the spirit of all, and had persuaded them to feel confidence
both with respect to themselves and to all the world, He added, that “Many that were first
shall be last, and last first.”2447 But this although it be spoken also without distinction concerning
many others likewise, it is spoken also concerning these men and concerning the
Pharisees, who did not believe, even as before also He had said, “Many shall come from east
and west and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; but the children of the
kingdom shall be cast out.”2448</p>
<p>Then He adds also a parable, as training those who had fallen short to a great forwardness.</p>
<p>“For the kingdom of Heaven,” He said, “is like to a man that is an householder, which
went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed
with them for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.”</p>
<p>“And at the third hour he saw others standing idle, and to them too he said, Go ye also
into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And about the sixth and ninth
hours he did likewise. And about the eleventh hour, he saw others standing idle, and saith
unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? But they say unto him, No man hath hired
us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoever is right, ye shall receive.”</p>
<p>“So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the
laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they
came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. And the
first supposed that they should receive more, and they received likewise every man a penny.
And when they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying,
These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us that have
borne the burden and heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do
thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way;
I will give unto this last also, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with

<pb n="682"/>
mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? Thus the last shall be first, and the first last:
for many are called, but few chosen.”2449</p>
<p>3. What is to us the intent of this parable? For the beginning doth not harmonize with
what is said at the end, but intimates altogether the contrary. For in the first part He shows
all enjoying the same, and not some cast out, and some brought in; yet He Himself both
before the parable and after the parable said the opposite thing. “That the first shall be last,
and the last first,” that is, before the very first, those not continuing first, but having become
last. For in proof that this is His meaning, He added, “Many are called, but few chosen,” so
as doubly both to sting the one, and to soothe and urge on the other.</p>
<p>But the parable saith not this, but that they shall be equal to them that are approved,
and have labored much. “For thou hast made them equal unto us,” it is said, “that have
borne the burden and heat of the day.”</p>
<p>What then is the meaning of the parable? For it is necessary to make this first clear, and
then we shall clear up that other point. By a vineyard He meaneth the injunctions of God
and His commandments: by the time of laboring, the present life: by laborers, them that in
different ways are called to the fulfillment of the injunctions: by early in the morning, and
about the third and ninth and eleventh hours, them who at different ages have drawn near
to God, and approved themselves.</p>
<p>But the question is this, whether the first having gloriously approved themselves, and
having pleased God, and having throughout the whole day shone by their labors, are possessed
by the basest feeling of vice, jealousy and envy. For when they had seen them enjoying
the same rewards, they say, “These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made
them equal unto us, that have borne the burden and heat of the day.” And in these words,
when they are to receive no hurt, neither to suffer diminution as to their own hire, they were
indignant, and much displeased at the good of others, which was proof of envy and jealousy.
And what is yet more, the good man of the house in justifying himself with respect to them,
and in making his defense to him that had said these things, convicts him of wickedness
and the basest jealousy, saying, “Didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine
is, and go thy way; I will give unto the last even as unto thee. Is thine eye evil, because I am
good?”</p>
<p>What then is it which is to be established by these things? For in other parables also this
self-same thing may be seen. For the son who was approved is brought in, as having felt this
self-same thing, when he saw his prodigal brother enjoying much honor, even more than
himself. For like as these enjoyed more by receiving first, so he in a greater degree was
<note type="footnote">2449 Matt. xx. 1. [This long passage agrees closely with the rec. text. In verses 5, 6, the New Testament narrative
is abridged, but there are scarcely any other peculiarities.—R.]</note>

<pb n="683"/>
honored by the abundance of the things given him; and to these things he that was approved
bears witness.</p>
<p>What then may we say? There is no one who is thus justifying himself, or blaming others
in the kingdom of Heaven; away with the thought! for that place is pure from envy and
jealousy. For if when they are here the saints give their very lives for sinners, much more
when they see them there in the enjoyment of these things, do they rejoice and account
these to be blessings of their own. Wherefore then did He so frame His discourse? The saying
is a parable, wherefore neither is it right to inquire curiously into all things in parables word
by word,2450but when we have learnt the object for which it was composed, to reap this,
and not to busy one’s self about anything further.</p>
<p>Wherefore then was this parable thus composed? what is its object to effect? To render
more earnest them that are converted and become better men in extreme old age, and not
to allow them to suppose they have a less portion. So it is for this cause He introduces also
others displeased at their blessings, not to represent those men as pining or vexed, away
with the thought! but to teach us that these have enjoyed such honor, as could even have
begotten envy in others. Which we also often do, saying, “Such a one blamed me, because
I counted thee worthy of much honor,” neither having been blamed, nor wishing to slander
that other, but hereby to show the greatness of the gift which this one enjoyed.</p>
<p>But wherefore can it have been that He did not hire all at once? As far as concerned
Him, He did hire all; but if all did not hearken at once, the difference was made by the disposition
of them that were called. For this cause, some are called early in the morning, some
at the third hour, some at the sixth, some at the ninth, some at the eleventh, when they
would obey.</p>
<p>This Paul also declared when he said, “When it pleased Him, who separated me from
my mother’s womb.”2451 When did it please Him? When he was ready to obey. For He
willed it even from the beginning, but because he would not have yielded, then it pleased
Him, when Paul also was ready to obey. Thus also did He call the thief, although He was
able to have called him even before, but he would not have obeyed. For if Paul at the beginning
would not have obeyed, much more the thief.</p>
<p>And if they say, “No man hath hired us,” in the first place as I said we must not be
curious about all the points in the parables; but here neither is the good man of the house
represented to say this, but they; but he doth not convict them, that he might drive them to
perplexity, but might win them over. For that He called all, as far as lay in Him, from the
first even the parable shows, saying, that “He went out early in the morning to hire.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2450 κατ λξιν.</note>
<note type="footnote">2451 Gal. i. 15.</note>

<pb n="684"/>
<p>4. From everything then it is manifest to us, that the parable is spoken with reference
to them who from earliest youth, and those who in old age and more tardily, lay hold on
virtue; to the former, that they may not be proud, neither reproach those called at the eleventh
hour; to the latter, that they may learn that it is possible even in a short time to recover all.</p>
<p>For since He had been speaking about earnestness, and the casting away of riches, and
contempt of all one’s possessions, but this needed much vigor of mind and youthful ardor;
in order to kindle in them a fire of love, and to give vigor to their will, He shows that it is
possible even for men coming later to receive the hire of the whole day.</p>
<p>But He doth not say it thus, lest again He should make them proud, but he shows that
the whole is of His love to man, and because of this they shall not fail, but shall themselves
enjoy the unspeakable blessings.</p>
<p>And this chiefly is what it is His will to establish by this parable. And if He adds, that,
“So the last shall be first and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen,” marvel not.
For not as inferring it from the parable doth He say this, but His meaning is this, that like
as this came to pass, so shall that come to pass. For here indeed the first did not become
last, but all received the same contrary to hope and expectation. But as this result took place
contrary to hope and contrary to expectation, and they that came before were equalled by
them that followed, so shall that also come to pass which is more than this, and more strange,
I mean, that the last should come to be even before the first, and that the first should be
after these. So that that is one thing, and this another.</p>
<p>But He seems to me to say these things, darkly hinting at the Jews, and amongst the
believers at those who at first shone forth, but afterwards neglected virtue, and fell back;
and those others again that have risen from vice, and have shot beyond many. For we see
such changes taking place both with respect to faith and practice.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you let us use much diligence both to stand in the right faith, and
to show forth an excellent life. For unless we add also a life suitable to our faith, we shall
suffer the extremest punishment.</p>
<p>And this the blessed Paul showed even from times of old, when he said, that “They did
all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink:” and added, that
they were not saved; “for they were overthrown in the wilderness.”2452 And Christ declared
it even in the evangelists, when He brought in some that had cast out devils and prophesied,
and are led away to punishment. And all His parables also, as that of the virgins, that of the
net, that of the thorns, that of the tree not bringing forth fruit, demand virtue in our works.
For concerning doctrines He discourses seldom, for neither doth the subject need labor,
but of life often or rather everywhere, for the war about this is continual, wherefore also so
is the labor.</p>
<note type="footnote">2452 1 Cor. x. 3, 4, 5.</note>

<pb n="685"/>
<p>And why do I speak of the whole code. For even a part of it overlooked brings upon one
great evils; as, for instance, almsgiving overlooked casts into hell them that have come short
in it; and yet this is not the whole of virtue, but a part thereof. But nevertheless both the
virgins were punished for not having this, and the rich man was for this cause tormented,
and they that have not fed the hungry, are for this condemned with the devil. Again, not to
revile is a very small part of it, nevertheless this too casts out them that have not attained to
it. “For he that saith to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.”2453 Again,
even continence itself is a part, but nevertheless, without this no one shall see the Lord. For,
“Follow peace,” it is said, “and holiness,2454without which no man shall see the Lord.”2455
And humility too in like manner is a part of virtue; but nevertheless though any one should
fulfill other good works, but have not attained to this, he is unclean with God. And this is
manifest from the Pharisee, who though abounding with numberless good works, by this
lost all.</p>
<p>But I have also something more than these things to say again. I mean, that not only
one of them overlooked shuts Heaven against us, but though it be done, yet not in due perfection
and abundance, it produces the selfsame effect again. “For except your righteousness
shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of Heaven.”2456 So that though thou give alms, but not more than they, thou shalt not
enter in.</p>
<p>And how much did they bestow in alms? one may ask. For this very thing, I am minded
to say now, that they who do not give may be roused to give, and they that give may not
pride themselves, but may make increase of their gifts. What then did they give? A tenth of
all their possessions, and again another tenth, and after this a third, so that they almost gave
away the third part, for three-tenths put together make up this. And together with these,
first fruits, and first born, and other things besides, as, for instance, the offerings for sins,
those for purification, those at feasts, those in the jubilee,2457those by the cancelling of debts,
and the dismissals of servants, and the lendings that were clear of usury. But if he who gave
the third part of his goods, or rather the half (for those being put together with these are the
half), if then he who is giving the half, achieves no great thing, he who doth not bestow so
much as the tenth, of what shall he be worthy? With reason He said, “There are few that be
saved.”</p>

<p>5. Let us not, then, despise the care of our life. For if one portion of it despised brings
so great a destruction, when on every hand we are subject to the sentence of condemnation,
how shall we escape the punishment? and what manner of penalty shall we not suffer? and
what manner of hope of salvation have we, one may ask, if each of the things we have
numbered threatens us with hell? I too say this; nevertheless, if we give heed we may be
saved, preparing the medicines of almsgiving, and attending to our wounds.</p>
<p>For oil does not so strengthen a body, as benevolence at once strengthens a soul, and
makes it invincible to all and impregnable to the devil. For wheresoever he may seize us, his
hold then slips, this oil not suffering his grasp to fix on our back.</p>
<p>With this oil therefore let us anoint ourselves continually. For it is the cause of health,
and a supply of light, and a source of cheerfulness. “But such a one,” thou wilt say, “hath
talents of gold so many and so many, and gives away nothing.” And what is that to thee?
For thus shalt thou appear more worthy of admiration, when in poverty thou art more
munificent than he. It was on this ground Paul marvelled at the Macedonians, not because
they gave, but because even though they were in poverty they gave.2458</p>
<p>Look not then at these, but at the common Teacher of all, who “had not where to lay
His head.”2459 And why, you say, doth not this and that person do so? Do not judge another,
but deliver thyself from the charge against thee. Since the punishment is greater when thou
at the same time blamest others, and thyself doest not, when judging other men, thou art
again thyself also subject to the same judgment. For if even them who do right He permits
not to judge others, much more will He not permit offenders. Let us not therefore judge
others, neither let us look to others who are taking their ease, but unto Jesus, and from
thence let us draw our examples.</p>
<p>Why! have I been thy benefactor? Why! did I redeem thee, that thou lookest to me? It
is another who hath bestowed these things on thee. Why dost thou let go thy Master, and
look unto thy fellow-servant? Heardest thou not Him saying, “Learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly in heart?”2460 And again, “He that would be first amongst you, let him be servant
of all:” and again, “Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.”
2461 And after these things again, lest taking offense at them who are remiss amongst
thy fellow-servants, thou continue in contemptuousness; to draw thee off from that, He
saith, “I have made myself an example to you, that as I have done, ye should do also.”2462
But hast thou no teacher of virtue amongst those persons that are with thee, neither such a

one as to lead thee on to these things? More abundant then will be the praise, the commendation
greater, when not even being supplied with teachers thou hast become one to be
marvelled at.</p>
<p>For this is possible, nay very easy, if we be willing: and this they show, who first duly
performed these things, as for instance, Noah, Abraham, Melchizedeck, Job, and all the men
like them. To them it is needful to look every day, and not unto these, whom ye never cease
emulating, and passing about their names in your assemblies. For nothing else do I hear
you saying everywhere, but such words as these; “Such a one has bought so many acres of
land; such a one is rich, he is building.” Why dost thou stare, O man, at what is without?
Why dost thou look to others? If thou art minded to look to others, look to them that do
their duty, to them that approve themselves, to them that carefully fulfill the law, not to
those that have become offenders, and are in dishonor. For if thou look to these, thou wilt
gather hence many evil things, falling into remissness, into pride, into condemnation of
others; but if thou reckon over them that do right, thou wilt lead thyself on unto humility,
unto diligence, unto compunction, unto the blessings that are beyond number.</p>
<p>Hear what the Pharisee suffered, because he let pass them that do right, and looked to
him that had offended; hear and fear.</p>
<p>See how David became one to be marvelled at, because he looked to his ancestors that
were noted for virtue. “For I am a stranger,” saith he, “and a sojourner, as all my fathers
were.”2463 For this man, and all that are like him, let pass them that had sinned, and thought
of those who had approved themselves.</p>
<p>This do thou also. For thou art not set to judge of the negligences of which others have
been guilty, nor to inquire into the sins which others are committing; thou art required to
do judgment on thyself, not on others. “For if we judged ourselves,” it is said, “we should
not be judged, but when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord.”2464 But thou hast
reversed the order, of thyself requiring no account of offenses great or small, but being strict
and curious about the offenses of others.</p>
<p>Let us no more do this, but leaving off this disorderly way, let us set up a tribunal in
ourselves for the sins committed by ourselves, becoming ourselves accusers, and judges,
and executioners for our offenses.</p>
<p>But if it be thy will to be busy about the things of other men also, busy thyself about
their good works, not their sins, that both by the memory of our negligences and by our
emulation for the good works they have done, and by setting before ourselves the judgmentseat
from which no prayers can deliver, wounded each day by our conscience as by a kind of
goad,2465we may lead ourselves on to humility, and a greater diligence, and attain unto the

<p>“And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto
them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief
priests and unto the Scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him
to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third day He shall
be raised.”</p>
<p>He goeth not up at once to Jerusalem when He is come out of Galilee, but having first
wrought miracles, and having stopped the mouths of Pharisees, and having discoursed with
His disciples of renouncing possessions: for, “if thou wilt be perfect,” saith He, “sell that
thou hast:”2466and of virginity, “He that is able to receive, let him receive it:”2467and of humility,
“For except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of Heaven:”2468and of a recompense of the things here, “For whoso hath forsaken
houses, or brethren, or sisters, shall receive an hundredfold in this world:”2469and of rewards
there, “For he shall also inherit,” it is said, “eternal life:” then He assails the city next, and
being on the point of going up, discourses again of His passion. For since it was likely that
they, because they were not willing this should come to pass, would forget it, He is continually
putting them in remembrance, exercising their mind by the frequency with which He reminded
them, and diminishing their pain.</p>
<p>But He speaks with them “apart,” necessarily; for it was not meet that His discourse
about these things should be published to the many; neither that it should be spoken plainly,
for no advantage arose from this. For if the disciples were confounded at hearing these
things, much more the multitude of the people.</p>
<p>What then? was it not told to the people? you may say. It was indeed told to the people
also, but not so plainly. For, “Destroy,” saith He, “this Temple, and in three days I will raise
it up;”2470and, “This generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but

<pb n="690"/>
the sign of Jonas;”2471and again, “Yet a little while am I with you, and ye shall seek me, and
shall not find me.”2472</p>
<p>But to the disciples not so, but as the other things He spake unto them more plainly, so
also spake He this too. And for what purpose, if the multitude understood not the force of
His sayings, were they spoken at all? That they might learn after these things, that foreknowing
it, He came to His passion, and willing it; not in ignorance, nor by constraint. But
to the disciples not for this cause only did He foretell it; but, as I have said, in order that
having been exercised by the expectation, they might more easily endure the passion, and
that it might not confound them by coming upon them without preparation. So for this
cause, while at the beginning He spake of His death only, when they were practised and
trained to hear of it, He adds the other circumstances also; as, for instance, that they should
deliver Him to the Gentiles, that they should mock and scourge Him; as well on this account,
as in order that when they saw the mournful events come to pass, they might expect from
this the resurrection also. For He who had not cloaked from them what would give pain,
and what seemed to be matter of reproach, would reasonably be believed about good things
too.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how with regard to the time also He orders the thing wisely. For
neither at the beginning did He tell them, lest He should disquiet them, neither at the time
itself, lest by this again He should confound them; but when they had received sufficient
proof of His power, when He had given them promises that were very great concerning life
everlasting, then He introduces also what He had to say concerning these things, once and
twice and often interweaving it with His miracles and His instructions.</p>
<p>But another evangelist saith, that He brought in the prophets also as witnesses;2473and
another again saith, that even they themselves understood not His words, but the saying
was hid from them, and that they were amazed as they followed Him.2474</p>
<p>Surely then, one may say, the benefit of the prediction is taken away. For if they knew
not what they were hearing, neither could they look for the event, and not looking for it,
neither could they be exercised by their expectations.</p>
<p>But I say another thing also more perplexing than this: If they did not know, how were
they sorry. For another saith, they were sorry. If therefore they knew it not, how were they
sorry? How did Peter say, “Be it far from Thee. This shall not be unto Thee?”2475</p>

<pb n="691"/>
<p>What then may we say? That He should die indeed they knew, albeit they knew not
clearly the mystery of the Incarnation.2476 Neither did they know clearly about the resurrection,
neither what He was to achieve; and this was hid from them.</p>
<p>For this cause also they felt pain. For some they had known to have been raised again
by other persons, but for any one to have raised up himself again, and in such wise to have
raised himself as not to die any more, they had never known.</p>
<p>This then they understood not, though often said; nay nor of this self-same death did
they clearly know what it was, and how it should come on Him. Wherefore also they were
amazed as they followed Him, but not for this cause only; but to me at least He seems even
to amaze them by discoursing of His passion.</p>
<p>2. Yet none of these things made them take courage, and this when they were continually
hearing about His resurrection. For together with His death this also especially troubled
them, to hear that men should “mock and scourge Him,” and the like. For when they considered
His miracles, the possessed persons whom He had delivered, the dead whom He
had raised, all the other marvellous works which He was doing, and then heard these things,
they were amazed, if He who doeth these works is thus to suffer. Therefore they fell even
into perplexity, and now believed, now disbelieved, and could not understand His sayings.
So far at least were they from understanding clearly what He said, that the sons of Zebedee
at the same time came to Him, and spake to Him of precedence. “We desire,” it is said, “that
one should sit on Thy right hand, and one on Thy left.”2477 How then doth this evangelist
say, that their mother came to Him? It is probable both things were done. I mean, that they
took their mother with them, with the purpose of making their entreaty stronger, and in
this way to prevail with Christ.</p>
<p>For in proof that this is true, as I say, and the request was rather theirs, and that being
ashamed they put forward their mother, mark how Christ directs His words to them.</p>
<p>But rather let us learn, first, what do they ask, and with what disposition, and whence
they were moved to this? Whence then were they moved to this? They saw themselves
honored above the rest, and expected from that they should obtain this request also. But
what can it be they ask? Hear another evangelist plainly declaring this. For, “Because He
was nigh,” it is said, “to Jerusalem, and because they thought the kingdom of God should
immediately appear,”2478they asked these things. For they supposed that this was at the
doors, and visible, and that having obtained what they asked, they would undergo none of
the painful things. For neither for its own sake only did they seek it, but as though they
would also escape the hardships.</p>

<pb n="692"/>
<p>Wherefore also Christ in the first place leads them off from these thoughts, commanding
them to await slaughter and dangers, and the utmost terrors. For, “Are ye able,” saith He,
“to drink of the cup that I drink of?”2479</p>
<p>But let no man be troubled at the apostles being in such an imperfect state. For not yet
was the cross accomplished, not yet the grace of the Spirit given. But if thou wouldest learn
their virtue, notice them after these things, and thou wilt see them superior to every passion.
For with this object He reveals their deficiencies, that after these things thou mightest know
what manner of men they became by grace.</p>
<p>That then they were asking, in fact, for nothing spiritual, neither had a thought of the
kingdom above, is manifest from hence. But let us see also, how they come unto Him, and
what they say. “We would,” it is said, “that whatsoever we shall desire of Thee, Thou
shouldest do it for us.”2480</p>
<p>And Christ saith to them, “What would ye?”2481not being ignorant, but that He may
compel them to answer, and lay open the wound, and so apply the medicine. But they out
of shame and confusion of face, because under the influence of a human passion they were
come to do this, took Him privately apart from the disciples, and asked Him. For they went
before, it is said, so that it might not be observable to them, and so said what they wished.
For it was their desire, as I suppose, because they heard, “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones,” to
have the first place of these seats. And that they had an advantage over the others, they knew,
but they were afraid of Peter, and say, “Command, that one sit on Thy right hand, one on
Thy left;” and they urge Him, saying, “Command.”</p>
<p>What then saith He? Showing, that they asked nothing spiritual, neither, if they had
known again what they were asking, would they have ventured to ask for so much, He saith,
“Ye know not what ye ask,” how great, how marvellous, how surpassing even the powers
above. After that He adds, “Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”2482 Seest thou, how He straightway
drew them off from their suspicion, by framing His discourse from the contrary topics? For
ye, He saith, talk to me of honor and crowns, but I to you of conflicts and labors. For this
is not the season for rewards, neither shall that glory of mine appear now, but the present
time is one of slaughter, and wars, and dangers.</p>
<p>And see how by the form of His question, He both urges and attracts them. For He said
not, “Are ye able to be slain?” “Are ye able to pour forth your blood?” but how? “Are ye able

<note type="footnote">2482 [The longer reading is here accepted. The R.V. follows a briefer reading here and in verse 23.—R.]</note>

<pb n="693"/>
to drink of the cup?” Then to attract them to it, He saith, “Which I shall drink of,” that by
their fellowship with Him in it they might be made more ready.</p>
<p>And a baptism again calls He it; showing that great was the cleansing the world was to
have from the things that were being done.
“They say unto Him, We are able.”2483 Out of their forwardness they straightway undertook
it, not knowing even this which they were saying, but looking to hear what they
had asked.</p>
<p>What then saith He? “Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with.”2484 Great blessings did He foretell to them. His meaning is, ye
shall be counted worthy of martyrdom, and shall suffer these things which I suffer; ye shall
close your life by a violent death, and in these things ye shall be partakers with me; “But to
sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for
whom it is prepared of my Father.”</p>
<p>3. Having first elevated their souls, and made them of a higher character, and having
rendered them such as sorrow could not subdue, then He reproves their request.</p>
<p>But what can be this present saying? For indeed there are two points that are subjects
of inquiry to many: one, if it be prepared for any to sit on His right hand; and then, if the
Lord of all hath not power to bestow it on them for whom it is prepared.</p>
<p>What then is the saying? If we solve the former point, then the second also will be clear
to the inquirers. What then is this? No one shall sit on His right hand nor on His left. For
that throne is inaccessible to all, I do not say to men only, and saints, and apostles, but even
to angels, and archangels, and to all the powers that are on high.</p>
<p>At least Paul puts it as a peculiar privilege of the Only-Begotten, saying, “To which of
the angels said He at any time, Sit thou on my right hand?2485 And of the angels He saith,
who maketh His angels spirits; but unto the Son, ‘Thy throne, O God.’”2486</p>
<p>How then saith He, “To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give,” as
though there are some that should sit there? Not as though there are; far from it; but He
makes answer to the thoughts of them who ask the favor, condescending to their understanding.
For neither did they know that lofty throne, and His sitting at the right hand of the
Father; how should they, when even the things that were much lower than these, and were
daily instilled into them, they understood not? but they sought one thing only, to enjoy the
first honors, and to stand before the rest, and that no one should stand before them with

<pb n="694"/>
Him; even as I have already said before, that, since they heard of twelve thrones, in ignorance
what the saying could mean, they asked for the first place.</p>
<p>What therefore Christ saith is this: “Ye shall die indeed for me, and shall be slain for
the sake of the gospel, and shall be partakers with me, as far as regards the passion: but this
is not sufficient to secure you the enjoyment of the first seat, and to cause that ye should
occupy the first place. For if any one else should come, together with the martyrdom, possessed
of all the other parts of virtue far more fully than you, not because I love you now,
and prefer you to the rest, therefore shall I set aside him that is distinguished by his good
works, and give the first honors to you.”</p>
<p>But thus indeed He did not say it, so as not to pain them, but darkly He intimates the
self-same thing, saying, “Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and ye shall be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left, this is not mine
to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.”</p>
<p>But for whom is it prepared? For them who could become distinguished by their works.
Therefore He said not, It is not mine to give, but my Father’s, lest any should say that He
was too weak, or wanting in vigor for their recompense; but how? It is not mine, but of those
for whom it is prepared.</p>
<p>And in order that what I say may be more plain, let us work it on an illustration, and
let us suppose there was some master of the games, then that many excellent combatants
went down to the contest, and that some two of the combatants that were most nearly connected
with the master of the games were to come to him and say, “Cause us to be crowned
and proclaimed,” confiding in their good-will and friendship with him; and that he were to
say to them, “This is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared,
by their labors, and their toils;” should we indeed condemn him as powerless? By no means,
but we should approve him for his justice, and for having no respect of persons. Like then
as we should not say that he did not give the crown from want of vigor, but as not wishing
to corrupt the law of the games, nor to disturb the order of justice; in like manner now
should I say Christ said this, from every motive to compel them, after the grace of God, to
set their hopes of salvation and approval on the proof of their own good works.</p>
<p>Therefore He saith, “For whom it is prepared.” For what, saith He, if others should appear
better than you? What, if they should do greater things? For shall ye, because ye have become
my disciples, therefore enjoy the first honors, if ye yourselves should not appear worthy of
the choice?</p>
<p>For that He Himself hath power over the whole, is manifest from His having the entire
judgment. For to Peter too He speaks thus, “I will give thee the keys of the Heavens.”2487
And Paul also makes this clear where he saith, “Henceforth is laid up for me the crown of
<note type="footnote">2487 Matt. xvi. 19. [This peculiar reading and rendering is commented on in the note on Homily LIV. 3.—R.]</note>

<pb n="695"/>
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day; and not to me
only, but unto all them also which have loved His appearing.”2488 But the appearing was of
Christ. But that no one will stand before Paul, is surely clear to every one.</p>
<p>And if He hath expressed these things somewhat obscurely, marvel not. For to lead
them on by hidden instruction,2489not to be rudely pressing Him without object or cause
for the first honors (for from a human passion they felt this), and not wishing to give them
pain, by the obscurity He effects both these objects.</p>
<p>“Then were the ten moved with indignation with respect to the two.” Then. When.?
When He had reproved them. So long as the judgment was Christ’s, they were not moved
with indignation; but seeing them preferred, they were contented, and held their peace, out
of reverence and honor to their Master.</p>
<p>And if they were vexed in mind, yet they dared not utter this. And when they had some
feeling of human weakness towards Peter, at the time that He gave the didrachmas, they
did not give way to anger, but asked only, “Who then is greatest?” But since here the request
was the disciples’, they are moved with indignation. And not even here are they straightway
moved with indignation, when they asked, but when Christ had reproved them, and had
said they should not enjoy the first honors, unless they showed themselves worthy of these.</p>
<p>4. Seest thou how they were all in an imperfect state, when both these were lifting
themselves up above the ten, and those envying the two? But, as I said, show me them after
these things, and thou wilt see them delivered from all these passions. Hear at least how this
same John, he who now came to Him for these things, everywhere gives up the first place
to Peter, both in addressing the people, and in working miracles, in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>And he conceals not Peter’s good deeds, but relates both the confession, which he openly
made when all were silent,2490and his entering into the tomb,2491and puts the apostle before
himself. For, because both continued with Him at His crucifixion, taking away the ground
of his own commendation, he saith, “That disciple was known unto the high priest.”2492</p>
<p>But James survived not a long time, but from the beginning he was so greatly filled with
warmth, and so forsook all the things of men, and mounted up to an height unutterable, as
straightway to be slain. Thus, in all respects, they after these things became excellent.2493</p>
<p>But then, “they were moved with indignation.” What then saith Christ? “He called them
unto Him, and said, The princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them.”2494 For, as

they were disturbed and troubled, He soothes them by His call before His word, and by
drawing them near Him. For the two having separated themselves from the company of the
ten, had stood nearer Him, pleading their own interests. Therefore He brings near Him
these also, by this very act, and by exposing and revealing it before the rest, soothing the
passion both of the one and of the other.</p>
<p>And not as before, so now also doth He check them. For whereas before He brings little
children into the midst, and commands to imitate their simplicity and lowliness; here He
reproves them in a sharper way from the contrary side, saying, “The princes of the Gentiles
exercise dominion2495over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them, but it
shall not be so among you;2496but he that will be great among you, let this man be minister
to all; and he that will be first, let him be last of all;”2497showing that such a feeling as this
is that of heathens, I mean, to love the first place. For the passion is tyrannical, and is continually
hindering even great men; therefore also it needs a severer stripe. Whence He too
strikes deeper into them, by comparison with the Gentiles shaming their inflamed soul, and
removes the envy of the one and the arrogance of the other, all but saying, “Be not moved
with indignation, as insulted. For they harm and disgrace themselves most, who on this wise
seek the first places, for they are amongst the last. For matters with us are not like matters
without. ‘For the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,’ but with me the last,
even he is first.”</p>
<p>“And in proof that I say not these things without cause, by the things which I do and
suffer, receive the proof of my sayings. For I have myself done something even more. For
being King of the powers above, I was willing to become man, and I submitted to be despised,
and despitefully entreated. And not even with these things was I satisfied, but even unto
death did I come. Therefore,” He saith,</p>
<p>“Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
His life a ransom for many.”2498“For not even at this did I stop,” saith He, “but even my life
did I give a ransom; and for whom? For enemies. But thou if thou art abused, it is for thyself,
but I for thee.”</p>
<p>Be not then afraid, as though thine honor were plucked down. For how much soever
thou humblest thyself, thou canst not descend so much as thy Lord. And yet His descent
hath become the ascent of all, and hath made His own glory shine forth. For before He was
made man, He was known amongst angels only; but after He was made man and was cruci-

fied, so far from lessening that glory, He acquired other besides, even that from the knowledge
of the world.</p>
<p>Fear not then, as though thine honor were put down, if thou shouldest abase thyself,
for in this way is thy glory more exalted, in this way it becomes greater. This is the door of
the kingdom. Let us not then go the opposite way, neither let us war against ourselves. For
if we desire to appear great, we shall not be great, but even the most dishonored of all.</p>
<p>Seest thou how everywhere He urges them by the opposite things, giving them what
they desire? For in the preceding parts also we have shown this in many instances, and in
the cases of the covetous, and of the vain-glorious, He did thus. For wherefore, He saith,
dost thou give alms before men? That thou mayest enjoy glory? Thou must then not do so,
and thou shalt surely enjoy it. Wherefore dost thou lay up treasures? That thou mayest be
rich? Thou must then not lay up treasures, and thou shalt be rich. Even so here too, wherefore
dost thou set thy heart on the first places? That thou mayest be before others? Choose then
the last place, and then thou wilt enjoy the first. So that if it be thy will to become great, seek
not to become great, and then thou wilt be great. For the other is to be little.</p>
<p>5. Seest thou how He drew them off from the disease, by showing them both from thence
failing of their object, and from hence gaining, that they might flee the one, and follow after
the other.</p>
<p>And of the Gentiles, too, He for this cause reminded them, that in this way again He
might show the thing to be disgraceful and to be abhorred.</p>
<p>For the arrogant is of necessity base, and, on the contrary, the lowly-minded is high.
For this is the height that is true and genuine, and exists not in name only, nor in manner
of address. And that which is from without is of necessity and fear, but this is like to God’s.
Such a one, though he be admired by no one, continues high; even as again the other, though
he be courted by all, is of all men the basest. And the one is an honor rendered of necessity,
whence also it easily passes away; but the other is of principle, whence also it continues
steadfast. Since for this we admire the saints also, that being greater than all, they humbled
themselves more than all. Wherefore even to this day they continue to be high, and not even
death hath brought down that height.</p>
<p>And if ye be minded, let us by reasonings also inquire into this very thing. Any one is
said to be high, either when he is so by greatness of stature, or when he hath chanced to be
set on a high place, and low in like manner, from the opposite things.</p>
<p>Let us see then who is like this, the boaster, or he that keeps within measure, that thou
mayest perceive that nothing is higher than lowliness of mind, and nothing lower than
boastfulness.</p>
<p>The boaster then desires to be greater than all, and affirms no one to be equal in worth
with him; and how much soever honor he may obtain, he sets his heart on more and claims
it, and accounts himself to have obtained none, and treats men with utter contempt, and

<pb n="698"/>
yet seeks after the honor that comes from them; than which what can be more unreasonable?
For this surely is like an enigma. By those, whom he holds in no esteem, he desires to be
glorified.</p>
<p>Seest thou how he who desires to be exalted falls down and is set on the ground? For
that he accounts all men to be nothing compared with himself, he himself declares, for this
is boasting. Why then dost cast thyself upon him who is nothing? why dost thou seek honor
of him? Why dost thou lead about with thee such great multitudes?</p>
<p>Seest thou one low, and set on a low place. Come then, let us inquire about the high
man. This one knows what man is, and that man is a great thing, and that he himself is last
of all, and therefore whatever honor he may enjoy, he reckons this great, so that this one is
consistent with himself and is high, and shifts not his judgment; for whom he accounts
great, the honors that come from them he esteems great also, though they should chance
to be small, because he accounts those who bestow them to be great. But the boastful man
accounts them that give the honors to be nothing, yet the honors bestowed by them he
reckons to be great.</p>
<p>Again, the lowly man is seized by no passion, no anger can much trouble this man, no
love of glory, no envy, no jealousy: and what can be higher than the soul that is delivered
from these things? But the boastful man is held in subjection by all these things, like any
worm crawling in the mire, for jealousy and envy and anger are forever troubling his soul.</p>
<p>Which then is high? He that is superior to his passions, or he that is their slave? He that
trembles at them and is afraid of them, or he that is unsubdued, and never taken by them?
Which kind of bird should we say flies higher? that which is higher than the hands and the
arrows of the hunter, or that which does not even suffer the hunters to need an arrow, from
his flying along the ground, and from not being able ever to elevate himself? Is not then the
arrogant man like this? for indeed every net readily catches him as crawling on the ground.</p>
<p>6. But if thou wilt, even from that wicked demon prove thou this. For what can be baser
than the devil, because he had exalted himself; what higher than the man who is willing to
abase himself? For the former crawls on the ground under our heel (For, “ye tread,” He
saith,2499“upon serpents and scorpions”), but the latter is set with the angels on high.</p>
<p>But if thou desirest to learn this from the example of haughty men also, consider that
barbarian king, that led so great an army, who knew not so much as the things that are
manifest to all; as, for instance, that stone was stone, and the images, images; wherefore he
was inferior even to these. But the godly and faithful are raised even above the sun; than
whom what can be higher, who rise above even the vaults of heaven, and passing beyond
angels, stand by the very throne of the king.</p>

<p>And that thou mayest learn in another way their vileness; who will be abased? He who
has God for his ally, or he with whom God is at war? It is quite plain that it is he with whom
He is at war. Hear then touching either of these what saith the Scripture. “God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”2500</p>
<p>Again, I will ask you another thing also. Which is higher? He who acts as a priest to
God and offers sacrifice? or he who is somewhere far removed from confidence towards
Him? And what manner of sacrifice doth the lowly man offer? one may say. Hear David
saying, “The sacrifice of God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God will not
despise.”2501</p>
<p>Seest thou the purity of this man? Behold also the uncleanness of the other; for “every
one that is proud in heart is unclean before God.”2502 Besides, the one hath God resting
upon him, (“For unto whom will I look,” saith He, “but to him that is meek and quiet, and
trembleth at my words”),2503but the other crawls with the devil, for he that is lifted up with
pride shall suffer the devil’s punishment. Wherefore Paul also said, “Lest, being lifted up
with pride, he should fall into the condemnation of the devil.”2504</p>
<p>And the thing opposite to what he wishes, befalls him. For his wish is to be arrogant,
that he may be honored; but the most contemned of all is this character. For these most of
all are laughing stocks, foes and enemies to all men, the most easy to be subdued by their
enemies, the men that easily fall into anger, the unclean before God.</p>
<p>What then can be worse than this, for this is the extremity of evils? And what is sweeter
than the lowly, what more blessed, since they are longed after, and beloved of God? And
the glory too that cometh of men, these do most of all enjoy, and all honor them as fathers,
embrace them as brothers, receive them as their own members.</p>
<p>Let us then become lowly, that we may be high. For most utterly doth arrogance abase.
This abased Pharaoh. For, “I know not,” he saith, “the Lord,”2505and he became inferior to
flies and frogs, and the locusts, and after that with his very arms and horses was he drowned
in the sea. In direct opposition to him, Abraham saith, “I am dust and ashes,”2506and prevailed
over countless barbarians, and having fallen into the midst of Egyptians, returned,
bearing a trophy more glorious than the former, and, cleaving to this virtue, grew ever more
high. Therefore he is celebrated everywhere, therefore he is crowned and proclaimed; but

Pharaoh is both earth and ashes, and if there is anything else more vile than these. For
nothing doth God so abhor as arrogance. For this object hath He done all things from the
beginning, in order that He might root out this passion. Because of this are we become
mortal, and are in sorrows, and wailings. Because of this are we in toil, and sweat, and in
labor continual, and mingled with affliction. For indeed out of arrogance did the first man
sin, looking for an equality with God. Therefore, not even what things he had, did he continue
to possess, but lost even these.</p>
<p>For arrogance is like this, so far from adding to us any improvement of our life, it subtracts
even what we have; as, on the contrary, humility, so far from subtracting from what
we have, adds to us also what we have not.</p>
<p>This virtue then let us emulate, this let us pursue, that we may both enjoy present honor,
and attain unto the glory to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom be unto the Father glory and might, together with the Holy Ghost, now
and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XX. 29, 30.</p>
<p>“And as they departed from Jericho, great multitudes followed Him. And, behold, two blind
men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have
mercy on us, O Lord, Thou Son of David.”</p>
<p>See whence He passed unto Jerusalem, and where He abode before this, with regard to
which it seems to me especially worthy of inquiry, wherefore He went not away even long
before this from thence unto Galilee, but through Samaria. But this we will leave to them
that are fond of learning. For if any one were disposed to search the matter out carefully,
he will find that John intimates it well, and hath expressed the cause.2507</p>
<p>But let us keep to the things set before us, and let us listen to these blind men, who were
better than many that see. For neither having a guide, nor being able to see Him when come
near to them, nevertheless they strove to come unto Him, and began to cry with a loud voice,
and when rebuked for speaking, they cried the more. For such is the nature of an enduring
soul, by the very things that hinder, it is borne up.</p>
<p>But Christ suffered them to be rebuked, that their earnestness might the more appear,
and that thou mightest learn that worthily they enjoy the benefits of their cure. Therefore
He doth not so much as ask, “Do ye believe?” as He doth with many; for their cry, and their
coming unto Him, sufficed to make their faith manifest.</p>
<p>Hence learn, O beloved, that though we be very vile and outcast, but yet approach God
with earnestness, even by ourselves we shall be able to effect whatsoever we ask. See, for instance,
these men, how, having none of the apostles to plead with them, but rather many to
stop their mouths, they were able to pass over the hindrances, and to come unto Jesus
Himself. And yet the evangelist bears witness to no confidence of life2508in them, but
earnestness sufficed them instead of all.</p>
<p>These then let us also emulate. Though God defer the gift, though there be many withdrawing
us, let us not desist from asking. For in this way most of all shall we win God to us.
See at least even here, how not poverty, not blindness, not their being unheard, not their
being rebuked by the multitude, not anything else, impeded their exceeding earnestness.
Such is the nature of a fervent and toiling soul.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? “He called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto
you? They say unto Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”2509 Wherefore doth He ask

them? Lest any one should think that when they wish to receive one thing, He giveth them
another thing. For indeed it is usual with Him on every occasion, first to make manifest and
discover to all the virtue of those He is healing, and then to apply the cure, for one reason,
that He might lead on the others likewise to emulation; and for another, that He might show
that they were enjoying the gift worthily. This, for instance, He did with respect to the
Canaanitish woman also, this too in the case of the centurion, this again as to her that had
the issue of blood, or rather that marvellous woman even anticipated the Lord’s inquiry;
but not so did He pass her by, but even after the cure makes her manifest. Such earnest care
had He on every occasion to proclaim the good deeds of them that come to Him, and to
show them to be much greater than they are,2510which He doth here also.</p>
<p>Then, when they said what they wished, He had compassion on them, and touched
them. For this alone is the cause of their cure, for which also He came into the world. But
nevertheless, although it be mercy and grace, it seeks for the worthy.</p>
<p>But that they were worthy is manifest, both from what they cried out, and from the fact
that, when they had received, they did not hasten away, as many do, being ungrateful after
the benefits. Nay, they were not like this, but were both persevering before the gift, and
after the gift grateful, for “they followed Him.”</p>
<p>“And when He drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and was come to Bethphage, unto the Mount
of Olives, He sent two of His disciples, saying, Go into the village over against you, and ye
shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. And if any
man say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he sendeth
them. And this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Zechariah the
prophet, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting
upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.”2511</p>
<p>And yet He had often entered Jerusalem before, but never with so much circumstance.
What then is the cause? It was the beginning then of the dispensation; and neither was He
very well known, nor the time of His passion near; wherefore He mixed with them with less
distinction, and more disguising Himself. For He would not have been held in admiration,
had He so appeared, and He would have excited them to greater anger. But when He had

authority of two mss., but defended by Mr. Field. [They are found in all the mss. collated by the latter editor,

example, by putting on an action a higher meaning and intention than was at all fully formed in the mind of
the doer.</note>

both given them sufficient proof of His power, and the cross was at the doors, He makes
Himself then more conspicuous, and doeth with greater circumstance all the things that
were likely to inflame them. For it was indeed possible for this to have been done at the beginning
also; but it was not profitable nor expedient it should be so.</p>
<p>But do thou observe, I pray thee, how many miracles are done, and how many prophecies
are fulfilled. He said, “Ye shall find an ass;” He foretold that no man should hinder them,
but that all, when they heard, should hold their peace.</p>
<p>But this is no small condemnation of the Jews, if them that were never known to Him,
neither had appeared before Him, He persuades to give up their own property, and to say
nothing against it, and that by His disciples, while these, being present with Him at the
working of His miracles, were not persuaded.</p>
<p>2. And do not account what was done to be a small thing. For who persuaded them,
when their own property was taken from them, and that, when they were perhaps poor men
and husbandmen, not to forbid it? Why say I not to forbid it? not to ask, or even if they
asked, to hold their peace, and give it up. For indeed both things were alike marvellous, as
well, if they said nothing, when their beasts were dragged away, or if having spoken, and
heard, “The Lord hath need of them,” they yielded and withstood not, and this when they
see not Him, but His disciples.</p>
<p>By these things He teaches them, that it was in His power to have entirely hindered the
Jews also, even against their will, when they were proceeding to attack Him, and to have
made them speechless, but He would not.</p>
<p>And another thing again together with these doth He teach the disciples, to give whatever
He should ask; and, though he should require them to yield up their very life, to give even
this, and not to gainsay. For if even strangers gave up to Him, much more ought they to
strip themselves of all things.</p>
<p>And besides what we have said, He was fulfilling also another prophecy, one which was
twofold, one part in words, and another in deeds. And that in deeds was, by the sitting on
the ass; and that by words, the prediction of Zacharias; because he had said, that the King
should sit on an ass. And He, having sat and having fulfilled it, gave to the prophecy another
beginning again, by what He was doing typifying beforehand the things to come.</p>
<p>How and in what manner? He proclaimed beforehand the calling of the unclean Gentiles,
and that He should rest upon them, and that they should yield to Him and follow Him, and
prophecy succeeded to prophecy.
But to me He seemeth not for this object only to sit on the ass, but also as affording us
a standard of self-denial. For not only did He fulfill prophecies, nor did He only plant the
doctrines of the truth, but by these very things He was correcting our practice for us,
everywhere setting us rules of necessary use, and by all means amending our life.</p>

<pb n="704"/>
<p>For this cause, I say, even when He was to be born He sought not a splendid house, nor
a mother rich and distinguished, but a poor woman, and one that had a carpenter as her
betrothed husband; and is born in a shed, and laid in a manger: and choosing His disciples,
He chose not orators and wise men, not rich men and nobly born, but poor men, and of
poor families, and in every way undistinguished; and providing His table, at one time He
sets before Himself barley loaves, and at another at the very moment commands the disciples
to buy at the market. And making His couch, He makes it of grass, and putting on raiment,
He clothes Himself in what is cheap, and in no respect different from the common sort;
and a house He did not so much as possess. And if He had to go from place to place, He did
this travelling on foot, and so travelling, as even to grow weary. And sitting, He requires no
throne nor pillow, but sits on the ground, sometimes in the mountain, and sometimes by
the well, and not merely by the well, but also alone, and talks with a Samaritan woman.</p>
<p>Again, setting measures of sorrow, when He had need to mourn, He weeps moderately,
everywhere setting us rules, as I have said, and limits how far one ought to proceed, and not
any further. So for this intent now also, since it happens that some are weak and have need
of beasts to carry them, in this too He fixes a measure, showing that one ought not to yoke
horses or mules to be borne by them, but to use an ass, and not to proceed further, and
everywhere to be limited by the want.</p>
<p>But let us look also at the prophecy, that by words, that by acts. What then is the
prophecy? “Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and riding on an ass, and a young
colt;”2512not driving chariots, like the rest of the kings, not demanding tributes, not
thrusting men off, and leading about guards, but displaying His great meekness even hereby.</p>
<p>Ask then the Jew, what King came to Jerusalem borne on an ass? Nay, he could not
mention, but this alone.</p>
<p>But He did these things, as I said, signifying beforehand the things to come. For here
the church is signified by the colt, and the new people, which was once unclean, but which,
after Jesus sat on them, became clean. And see the image preserved throughout. I mean that
the disciples loose the asses. For by the apostles, both they and we were called; by the apostles
were we brought near. But because our acceptance provoked them also to emulation,
therefore the ass appears following the colt. For after Christ hath sat on the Gentiles, then
shall they also come moving us to emulation.2513 And Paul declaring this, said, “That
blindness2514in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in; and
so all Israel shall be saved.”2515 For that it was a prophecy is evident from what is said. For

<note type="footnote">2514 [R.V., a hardening.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2515 Rom. xi. 25, 26.</note>

<pb n="705"/>
neither would the prophet have cared to express with such great exactness the age of the
ass, unless this had been so.</p>
<p>But not these things only are signified by what is said, but also that the apostles should
bring them with ease. For as here, no man gainsaid them so as to keep the asses, so neither
with regard to the Gentiles was any one able to prevent them, of those who were before
masters of them.</p>
<p>But He doth not sit on the bare colt, but on the apostles’ garments. For after they had
taken the colt, they then gave up all, even as Paul also said, “I will very gladly spend and be
spent for your souls.”2516</p>
<p>But mark how tractable the colt, how being unbroken, and having never known the
rein, he was not restive, but went on orderly; which thing itself was a prophecy of the future,
signifying the submissiveness of the Gentiles, and their sudden conversion to good order.
For all things did that word work, which said, “Loose him, and bring him to me:” so that
the unmanageable became orderly, and the unclean thenceforth clean.</p>
<p>3. But see the baseness of the Jews. He had wrought so many miracles, and never were
they thus amazed at Him; but when they saw a multitude running together, then they marvel.
“For all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? But the multitudes said, This is Jesus the
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.”2517 And when they thought they were saying something
great, even then were their thoughts earthly, and low, and dragging on the ground.2518</p>
<p>But these things He did, not as displaying any pomp, but at once, as I have said, both
fulfilling a prophecy, and teaching self-denial, and at the same time also comforting His
disciples, who were grieving for His death, and showing them that He suffers all these things
willingly. And mark thou, I pray thee, the accuracy of the prophet, how he foretold all things.
And some things David, some things Zechariah, had proclaimed beforehand. Let us also do
likewise, and let us sing hymns, and give up our garments to them that bear Him. For what
should we deserve, when some clothe the ass on which He was set, and others strew the
garments even under her feet; but we, seeing him naked, and not being even commanded
to strip ourselves, but to spend of what is laid by, not even so are liberal? And when they
indeed attend upon Him before and behind, but we, when He cometh unto us, send Him
away, and thrust Him off and insult Him.</p>
<p>How sore a punishment do these things deserve, how great vengeance! Thy Lord cometh
unto thee in need, and thou art not willing so much as to listen to His entreaty, but thou
blamest and rebukest Him, and this, when thou hast heard such words as these. But if in

giving one loaf, and a little money, thou art so mean, and haughty, and backward; if thou
hadst to empty out all, what wouldest thou become?</p>
<p>Seest thou not those that show their magnificence in the theatre, how much they give
away to the harlots? but thou givest not so much as the half, nay often not the smallest part.
But the devil is exhorting to give to whom it may chance, procuring us hell, and thou givest;
but Christ to the needy, promising a kingdom, and thou, far from giving, dost rather insult
them, and thou choosest rather to obey the devil, that thou mightest be punished, than to
submit to Christ, and be saved.</p>
<p>And what could be worse than this frenzy? One procures hell, the other a kingdom, and
ye leave the latter, and run unto the former. And this ye send away, when He cometh unto
you, that when he is far off, ye call unto you. And what you do is the same as if a king bearing
a royal robe, and offering a diadem, did not win your choice, but a robber brandishing a
sword at you, and threatening death, were to win it.</p>
<p>Considering these things then, beloved, let us discern the truth at length though late,
and let us grow sober. For I am now ashamed of speaking of almsgiving, because that having
often spoken on this subject, I have effected nothing worth the exhortation. For some increase
indeed hath there been, but not so much as I wished. For I see you sowing, but not with a
liberal hand. Wherefore I fear too lest ye also “reap sparingly.”2519</p>
<p>For in proof that we do sow sparingly, let us inquire, if it seem good, which2520are more
numerous in the city, poor or rich; and which they, who are neither2521poor nor rich, but
have a middle place. As, for instance, a tenth part is of rich, and a tenth of the poor that have
nothing at all, and the rest of the middle sort.</p>
<p>Let us distribute then amongst the poor the whole multitude of the city, and ye will see
the disgrace how great it is. For the very rich indeed are but few, but those that come next
to them are many; again, the poor are much fewer than these. Nevertheless, although there
are so many that are able to feed the hungry, many go to sleep in their hunger, not because
those that have are not able with ease to succor them, but because of their great barbarity
and inhumanity. For if both the wealthy, and those next to them, were to distribute amongst
themselves those who are in need of bread and raiment, scarcely would one poor person
fall to the share of fifty men or even a hundred. Yet nevertheless, though in such great
abundance of persons to assist them, they are wailing every day. And that thou mayest learn
the inhumanity of the others, when the church is possessed of a revenue of one of the lowest
among the wealthy, and not of the very rich, consider how many widows it succors every
day, how many virgins; for indeed the list of them hath already reached unto the number
<note type="footnote">2519 2 Cor. ix. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">2520 [“who are more numerous.”…“and who are they that are neither,” etc.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2521 [“who are more numerous.”…“and who are they that are neither,” etc.—R.]</note>

<pb n="707"/>
of three thousand. Together with these, she succors them that dwell in the prison, the sick
in the caravansera, the healthy, those that are absent from their home, those that are maimed
in their bodies, those that wait upon the altar; and with respect to food and raiment, them
that casually come every day; and her substance is in no respect diminished. So that if ten
men only were thus willing to spend, there would be no poor.</p>
<p>4. And what, it will be said, are our children to inherit? The principal remains, and the
income again is become more abundant, the goods being stored up for them in Heaven.</p>
<p>But are ye not willing to do this? At least do it by the half, at least by the third part, at
least by the fourth part, at least by the tenth. For owing to God’s favor, it were possible for
our city to nourish the poor of ten cities.</p>
<p>And if ye will, let us make some calculation2522in proof of this; or rather there is no
need so much as of reckoning; for of itself the easiness of the thing is discernible. See at least,
upon public occasions, how much one house hath often not been backward to spend, and
hath not had so much as a little feeling of the expense, which service if each of the rich were
willing to perform for the poor, in a brief moment of time he would have seized on Heaven.</p>
<p>What plea then will there be? what shadow of defense, when not even of the things from
which we must assuredly be separated, when taken away from hence, not even of these do
we impart to the needy with as much liberality as others to those on the stage, and this when
we are to reap so many benefits therefrom? For we ought indeed, even though we were always
to be here, not even so to be sparing of this good expenditure; but when after a little time,
we are to be removed from hence, and dragged away naked from all, what kind of defense
shall we have for not even out of our income giving to the hungry and distressed?2523</p>
<p>For neither do I constrain thee to lessen thy possessions, not because I do not wish it,
but because I see thee very backward. It is not then this I say, but spend of your fruits, and
treasure up nothing from these. It is enough for thee to have the money of thine income
pouring in on thee as from a fountain; make the poor sharers with thee, and become a good
steward of the things given thee of God.</p>
<p>But I pay tribute, one may say. For this cause then dost thou despise, because in this
case no one demands it of thee? And the other, who, should the earth bear, or should it not
bear, takes by force, and extorts, thou darest not gainsay; but Him that is so mild, and then
only demands, when the earth bears, thou answerest not even to a word? And who will deliver
thee from those intolerable punishments? There is no one. For if, because in the other
case a very sore punishment will ensue to thee for not giving, therefore thou becomest diligent
about the payment, consider here too is one more sore; not to be bound, neither to be cast
into prison, but to depart into the eternal fire.</p>
<note type="footnote">2522 συλλογισμν .</note>

<pb n="708"/>
<p>For all reasons then let us pay these tributes first: for great is the facility, and greater the
reward; and more abundant the gain, and worse the punishments to us if we are obstinate.
For a punishment cometh upon us, which hath no end.</p>
<p>But if thou tell me of the soldier’s fighting for thee with the barbarians, there is here too
a camp, that of the poor, and a war, which the poor are waging for thee. For when they receive,
by praying they make God propitious; and making Him propitious, they repulse, instead
of barbarians, the assaults of the devils; they suffer not the evil one to be violent, neither
to attack us continually, but they relax his might.</p>
<p>5. Seeing therefore these soldiers every day fighting in thy behalf with the devil by their
supplications and prayers, demand of thyself this good contribution, their nourishment.
For this King being mild hath not assigned thee any to demand it of thee, but desires thou
shouldest give it willingly; though thou pay by little and little, He receives it; though being
in difficulty, thou shouldest pay after a long time, He doth not press him that hath not.</p>
<p>Let us not then despise His long-suffering; let us treasure up for ourselves, not wrath,
but salvation; not death, but life; not punishment and vengeance, but honors and crowns.</p>
<p>There is no need in this case to pay a hire for the conveyance of the things contributed; there
is no need in this case to labor in turning them into money. If thou givest them up, the Lord
Himself removes them into Heaven; He Himself makes the traffic the more gainful for thee.
There is no need here to find one to carry in what thou hast contributed; contribute
only, and straightway it goeth up, not that others may be maintained as soldiers, but that it
may remain for thee with great profit. For here2524whatsoever thou mayest have given, it
is not possible to recover; but there thou wilt receive them again with much honor, and shalt
gain greater, and more spiritual gains. Here the gifts are a demand; there a loan, and money
at interest, and a debt.</p>
<p>Yea farther, God hath given thee bonds. For “he that showeth mercy to a poor man,” it
is said, “lendeth to the Lord.”2525 He gave thee also an earnest, and bail, and this being God!
What sort of earnest? The things in the present life, the visible, the spiritual things, the
foretaste of the things to come.</p>
<p>Why then dost thou delay, and why art thou backward, having received so many things
already, looking for so many things?</p>
<p>For what thou hast received are these: He Himself made thee a body, He Himself put
in thee a soul, He honored with speech thee alone of the things on the earth, He gave thee
the use of all the things that are seen, He bestowed on thee the knowledge of Himself, He
gave up His Son for thee, He gave thee a baptism full of so many good things, He gave thee
a holy table, He promised a kingdom, and the good things that cannot be told.</p>

<pb n="709"/>
<p>Having then received so many good things, having to receive so many, again I say the
same thing, art thou making petty reckoning about perishing riches, and what excuse wilt
thou have?</p>
<p>But art thou looking altogether at thy children? and dost draw back for the sake of these?
Nay, rather teach them also to gain such gains. For if thou hadst money lent out and bearing
interest, and thou hadst a grateful debtor, thou wouldest ten thousand times rather choose
instead of the gold to leave the bond to thy child, so that he should have the large income
from it, and not be constrained to go about, and seek for others to borrow it.</p>
<p>And now give this bond to thy children, and leave God a debtor to them. Thou dost not
sell thy lands, and give to thy children, but leavest them, that the income may remain, and
that they may have a greater increase of riches from thence; but this bond, which is more
productive than any land or revenue, and bears so many fruits, this art thou afraid to leave
to them? What great folly must this be, and frenzy. And this when thou knowest, that though
thou shouldest leave it to them, thou thyself also shall again take it away with thee.</p>
<p>Of this nature are the things spiritual; they have great munificence. Let us not then be
beggarly; neither be inhuman and savage towards ourselves, but let us traffic in that good
merchandise; that we may both ourselves take it away with us when we depart, and leave it
to our own children, and attain to the good things to come, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father, together with the Holy Ghost,
glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXI. 12, 13.</p>
<p>“And Jesus went into the temple,2526and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple,
and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of them that sold doves,
and saith unto them, It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye have
made it a den of thieves.”2527</p>
<p>This John likewise saith, but he in the beginning of his Gospel, this at the end. Whence
it is probable this was done twice, and at different seasons.</p>
<p>And it is evident both from the times, and from their reply. For there He came at the
very passover, but here much before. And there the Jews say, “What sign showest thou
us?”2528but here they hold their peace, although reproved, because He was now marvelled
at amongst all men.</p>
<p>And this is a heavier charge against the Jews, that when He had done this not once only,
but a second time, they continued in their trafficking, and said that He was an adversary of
God, when they ought even from hence to have learnt His honor for His Father and His
own might. For indeed He also wrought miracles, and they saw His words agreeing with
His works.</p>
<p>But not even so were they persuaded, but “were sore displeased,” and this while they
heard the prophet crying aloud, and the children in a manner beyond their age proclaiming
Him. Wherefore also He Himself sets up Isaiah against them as an accuser, saying, “My
house shall be called a house of prayer.”2529</p>
<p>But not in this way only doth He show His authority, but also by His healing divers infirmities.
“For the blind and the lame came unto Him, and He healed them,”2530and His
power and authority He indicates.</p>
<p>But they not even so would be persuaded, but together with the rest of the miracles
hearing even the children proclaiming, were ready to choke, and say, “Hearest thou not
what these say?”2531 And yet it was Christ’s part to have said this to them, “Hear ye not
what these say?” for the children were singing to Him as to God.</p>

<pb n="711"/>
<p>What then saith He? Since they were speaking against things manifest, He applies His
correction more in the way of reproof, saying, “Have ye never read, Out of the mouths of
babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?” And well did He say, “Out of the mouth.”
For what was said was not of their understanding, but of His power giving articulation to
their tongue yet immature.</p>
<p>And this was also a type of the Gentiles lisping, and sounding forth at once great things
with understanding and faith.</p>
<p>And for the apostles also there was from hence no small consolation. For that they might
not be perplexed, how being unlearned they should be able to publish the gospel, the children
anticipate them, and remove all their anxiety, teaching them, that He would grant them utterance,
who made even these to sing praises.</p>
<p>And not so only, but the miracle showed that He is Creator even of nature. The children
then, although of age immature, uttered things that had a clear meaning, and were in accordance
with those above, but the men things teeming with frenzy and madness. For such is
the nature of wickedness.</p>
<p>Forasmuch then as there were many things to provoke them, from the multitude, from
the casting out of the sellers, from the miracles, from the children, He again leaves them,
giving room to the swelling passion, and not willing to begin His teaching, lest boiling with
envy they should be the more displeased at His sayings.</p>
<p>“Now in the morning as He returned into the city, He was an hungered.”2532 How is
He an hungered in the morning? When He permits the flesh, then it shows its feeling. “And
when He saw a fig tree in the way, He came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves
only.”2533 Another evangelist saith, “The time of figs was not yet;”2534but if it was not time,
how doth the other evangelist say, “He came, if haply He might find fruit thereon.” Whence
it is manifest that this belongs to the suspicion of His disciples, who were yet in a somewhat
imperfect state. For indeed the evangelists in many places record the suspicions of the disciples.</p>
<p>Like as this then was their suspicion, so also was it too to suppose it was cursed for this
cause, because of having no fruit. Wherefore then was it cursed? For the disciples’ sakes,
that they might have confidence. For because everywhere He conferred benefits, but punished
no man; and it was needful that He should afford them a demonstrative proof of His power
to take vengeance also, that both the disciples might learn, and the Jews, that being able to
blast them that crucify Him, of His own will He submits, and does not blast them; and it
was not His will to show forth this upon men; upon the plant did He furnish the proof of
<note type="footnote">2532 Matt. xxi. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">2533 Matt. xxi. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">2534 Mark xi. 13. [The passage is freely cited; “of figs” is applied here and below by the translator.—R.]</note>

<pb n="712"/>
His might in taking vengeance. But when unto places, or unto plants, or unto brutes, any
such thing as this is done, be not curious, neither say, how was the fig-tree justly dried up,
if it was not the time of figs; for this it is the utmost trifling to say; but behold the miracle,
and admire and glorify the worker thereof.</p>
<p>Since in the case also of the swine that were drowned, many have said this, working out
the argument of justice; but neither there should one give heed, for these again are brutes,
even as that was a plant without life.</p>
<p>Wherefore then was the act invested with such an appearance, and with this plea for a
curse? As I said, this was the disciple’s suspicion.</p>
<p>But if it was not yet time, vainly do some say the law is here meant. For the fruit of this
was faith, and then was the time of this fruit, and it had indeed borne it; “For already2535are
the fields white to harvest,” saith He; and, “I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no
labor.”2536</p>
<p>2. Not any therefore of these things doth He here intimate, but it is what I said, He displays
His power to punish, and this is shown by saying, “The time was not yet,” making it
clear that of this special purpose He went, and not for hunger, but for His disciples’ sake,
who indeed marvelled exceedingly, although many miracles had been done greater; but, as
I said, this was strange, for now first He showed forth His power to take vengeance.
Wherefore not in any other, but in the moistest of all planted things did He work the miracle,
so that hence also the miracle appeared greater.</p>
<p>And that thou mightest learn, that for their sakes this was done, that He might train
them to feel confidence, hear what He saith afterwards. But what saith He? “Ye also shall
do greater things, if ye are willing to believe and to be confident in prayer.” Seest thou that
all is done for their sake, so that they might not be afraid and tremble at plots against them?
Wherefore He saith this a second time also, to make them cleave to prayer and faith. “For
not this only shall ye do, but also shall remove mountains; and many more things shall ye
do, being confident in faith and prayer.”2537</p>
<p>But the boastful and arrogant Jews, wishing to interrupt His teaching, came unto Him,
and asked, “By what authority doest thou these things?”2538 For since they could not object
against the miracles, they bring forward against Him the correction of the traffickers in the
temple. And this in John also they appear to ask, although not in these words, but with the
same intent. For there too they say, “What sign showest thou unto us? seeing that thou doest

<pb n="713"/>
these things.” But there He answers them, saying, “Destroy this temple, and I in three days
will raise it up,”2539whereas here He drives them into a difficulty. Whence it is manifest,
that then indeed was the beginning and prelude of the miracles, but here the end.</p>
<p>But what they say is this: Hast thou received the teacher’s chair? Hast thou been ordained
a priest, that thou didst display such authority? it is said. And yet He had done nothing implying
arrogance, but had been careful for the good order of the temple, yet nevertheless
having nothing to say, they object against this. And indeed when He cast them out, they did
not dare to say anything, because of the miracles, but when He showed Himself, then they
find fault with Him.</p>
<p>What then saith He? He doth not answer them directly, to show that, if they had been
willing to see His authority, they could; but He asks them again, saying, “The baptism of
John, whence is it? From heaven, or of men?”2540</p>
<p>And what sort of inference is this? The greatest surely. For if they had said, from heaven,
He would have said unto them, why then did ye not believe him? For if they had believed,
they would not have asked these things. For of Him John had said, “I am not worthy to loose
the latchet of His shoe;” and, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the
world;” and, “This is the Son of God;”2541and, “He that cometh from above is above
all;”2542and, “His fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor.”2543 So that
if they had believed him, there was nothing to hinder them from knowing by what authority
Christ doeth these things.</p>
<p>After this, because they, dealing craftily, said, “We know not,” He said not, neither know
I, but what? “Neither tell I you.”2544 For if indeed they had been ignorant it would have
been requisite for them to be instructed; but since they were dealing craftily with good
reason He answers them nothing.</p>
<p>And how was it they did not say that the baptism was of men? “They feared the
people”2545it is said. Seest thou a perverse heart? In every case they despise God and do all
things for the sake of men. For this man too they feared for their sakes not reverencing the
saint2546but on account of men,2547and they were not willing to believe in Christ, because
of men, and all their evils were engendered to them from hence.</p>

<p>After this, He saith, “What think ye? A man had two sons; and he saith to the first, go,
work to-day in the vineyard. But he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
and went. And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go
sir: and went not. Whether then of them twain did the will of his father? They say, the
first.”2548</p>
<p>Again He convicts them by a parable, intimating both their unreasonable obstinacy,
and the submissiveness of those who were utterly condemned by them. For these two children
declare what came to pass with respect to both the Gentiles and the Jews. For the former
not having undertaken to obey, neither having become hearers of the law, showed forth
their obedience in their works; and the latter having said, “All that the Lord shall speak, we
will do, and will hearken,”2549in their works were disobedient. And for this reason, let me
add, that they might not think the law would benefit them, He shows that this self-same
thing condemns them, like as Paul also saith, “Not the hearers of the law are just before
God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.”2550 For this intent, that He might make
them even self-condemned, He causes the judgment to be delivered by themselves, like as
He does also in the ensuing parable of the vineyard.</p>
<p>3. And that this might be done, He makes trial of the accusation in the person of an
other. For since they were not willing to confess directly, He by a parable drives them on to
what He desired.</p>
<p>But when, not understanding His sayings, they had delivered the judgment, He unfolds
His concealed meaning after this, and saith, “Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of
Heaven before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed
him not; but the publicans2551believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards,
that ye might believe him.”2552</p>
<p>For if He had said simply, harlots go before you, the word would have seemed to them
to be offensive; but now, being uttered after their own judgment it appears to be not too
hard.</p>
<p>Therefore He adds also the accusation. What then is this? “John came,” He saith, “unto
you,” not unto them, and not this only, but; also “in the way of righteousness.” “For neither

<pb n="715"/>
with this can ye find fault, that he was some careless one, and of no profit; but both his life
was irreprehensible, and his care for you great, and ye gave no heed to him.”</p>
<p>And with this there is another charge also, that publicans gave heed; and with this, again
another, that “not even after them did ye. For ye should have done so even before them, but
not to do it even after them was to be deprived of all excuse;” and unspeakable was both the
praise of the one, and the charge against the other. “To you he came, and ye accepted him
not; he came not to them, and they receive him, and not even them did ye take for instructors.”</p>
<p>See by how many things is shown the commendation of those, and the charge against
these. To you he came, not to them. Ye believed not, this offended not them. They believed,
this profited not you.</p>
<p>But the word, “go before you,” is not as though these were following, but as having a
hope, if they were willing. For nothing, so much as jealousy, rouses the grosser sort. Therefore
He is ever saying, “The first shall be last, and the last first.” Therefore He brought in both
harlots and publicans, that they might provoke them to jealousy.</p>
<p>For these two indeed are chief sins, engendered of violent lust, the one of sexual desire,
the other of the desire of money. And He indicates that this especially was hearing the law
of God, to believe John. For it was not of grace only, that harlots entered in, but also of
righteousness. For not, as continuing harlots, did they enter in, but having obeyed and believed,
and having been purified and converted, so did they enter in.</p>
<p>Seest thou how He rendered His discourse less offensive, and more penetrating, by the
parable, by His bringing in the harlots? For neither did He say at once, wherefore believed
ye not John? but what was much more pricking, when, He had put forward the publicans
and the harlots, then He added this, by the order of their actions convicting their unpardonable
conduct, and showing that for fear of men they do all things, and for vainglory. For
they did not confess Christ for fear, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; and again,
of John they dared not speak evil, and not even this from reverence, but for fear. All which
things He convicted by His sayings, and with more severity afterwards did He go on to inflict
the blow, saying, “But ye, when ye knew it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe
him.”</p>
<p>For an evil thing it is not at the first to choose the good, but it is a heavier charge not
even to be brought round. For this above all maketh many wicked, which I see to be the case
with some now from extreme insensibility.</p>
<p>But let no one be like this; but though he be sunk down to the extremity of wickedness,
let him not despair of the change for the better. For it is an easy thing to rise up out of the
very abysses of wickedness.</p>
<p>Heard ye not how that harlot, that went beyond all in lasciviousness, outshone all in
godly reverence. Not the harlot in the gospels do I mean, but the one in our generation, who

<pb n="716"/>
came from Phoenice, that most lawless city. For she was once a harlot among us, having the
first honors on the stage, and great was her name everywhere, not in our city only, but even
as far as the Cilicians and Cappadocians. And many estates did she ruin, and many orphans
did she overthrow; and many accused her of sorcery also, as weaving such toils not by her
beauty of person only, but also by her drugs. This harlot once won even the brother of the
empress, for mighty indeed was her tyranny.</p>
<p>But all at once, I know not how, or rather I do know well, for it was being so minded,
and converting, and bringing down upon herself God’s grace, she despised all those things,
and having cast away the arts of the devils, mounted up to heaven.</p>
<p>And indeed nothing was more vile than she was, when she was on the stage; nevertheless,
afterwards she outwent many in exceeding continence, and having clad herself with sackcloth,
all her time she thus disciplined herself. On the account of this woman both the governor
was stirred up, and soldiers armed, yet they had not strength to carry her off to the stage,
nor to lead her away from the virgins that had received her.</p>
<p>This woman having been counted worthy of the unutterable mysteries, and having exhibited
a diligence proportionate to the grace (given her) so ended her life, having washed
off all through grace, and after her baptism having shown forth much self-restraint. For not
even a mere sight of herself did she allow to those who were once her lovers, when they had
come for this, having shut herself up, and having passed many years, as it were, in a prison.
Thus “shall the last be first, and the first last;” thus do we in every case need a fervent soul,
and there is nothing to hinder one from becoming great and admirable:</p>
<p>4. Let no man then of them that live in vice despair; let no man who lives in virtue
slumber. Let neither this last be confident, for often the harlot will pass him by; nor let the
other despair, for it is possible for him to pass by even the first.</p>
<p>Hear what God saith unto Jerusalem, “I said, after she had committed all these whoredoms,
Turn thou unto me, and she returned not.”2553 When we have come back unto the
earnest love of God, He remembers not the former things. God is not as man, for He reproaches
us not with the past, neither doth He say, Why wast thou absent so long a time?
when we repent; only let us approach Him as we ought. Let us cleave to Him earnestly, and
rivet our hearts to His fear.</p>
<p>Such things have been done not under the new covenant only, but even under the old.
For what was worse than Manasseh? but he was able to appease God. What more blessed
than Solomon? but when he slumbered, he fell. Or rather I can show even both things to
have taken place in one, in the father of this man, for he the same person became at different
times both good and bad. What more blessed than Judas? but he became a traitor. What
more wretched than Matthew? but he became an evangelist. What worse than Paul? but he
<note type="footnote">2553 Jer. iii. 7.</note>

<pb n="717"/>
became an apostle. What more to be envied than Simon? but he became even himself the
most wretched of all.</p>
<p>How many other such changes wouldest thou see, both to have taken place of old, and
now taking place every day? For this reason then I say, Neither let him on the stave despair,
nor let him in the church be confident. For to this last it is said, “Let him that thinketh he
standeth, take heed lest he fall;”2554and to the other, “Shall not he that falleth arise?”2555and,
“Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.”2556 Again, to these He saith,
“Watch;” but to those, “Awake, thou that sleepest and arise from the dead.”2557 For these
need to preserve what they have, and those to become what they are not; these to preserve
their health, those to be delivered from their infirmity, for they are sick; but many even of
the sick become healthy, and of the healthy many by remissness grow infirm.</p>
<p>To the one then He saith, “Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing
come unto thee;”2558but to these, “Wilt thou be made whole? Arise, take up thy bed, and
go unto thine house.”2559 For a dreadful, dreadful palsy is sin, or rather it is not palsy only,
but also somewhat else more grievous. For such a one is not only in inactivity as to good
works, but also in the active doing of evil works. But nevertheless, though thou be so disposed,
and be willing to rouse thyself a little, all the terrors are at an end.</p>
<p>Though thou hast been so “thirty and eight years,” and art earnest to become whole,
there is no one to hinder thee. Christ is present now also, and saith, “Take up thy bed,” only
be willing to rouse thyself, despair not. Hast thou no man? but thou hast God. Hast thou
no one to put thee into the pool? but thou hast Him who suffers thee not to need the pool.
Hast thou had no one to cast thee in there? but thou hast Him that commands thee to take
up thy bed.</p>
<p>Thou mayest not say, “While I am coming, another steppeth down before me.”2560 For
if it be thy will to go down into the fountain, there is none to hinder thee. Grace is not consumed,
is not spent, it is a kind of fountain springing up constantly; by His fullness are we
all healed both soul and body. Let us come unto it then even now. For Rahab also was a
harlot, yet was she saved; and the thief was a murderer, yet he became a citizen of paradise;
and while Judas being with his Master perished, the thief being on a cross became a disciple.

Such are the wonderful works of God. Thus the magi approved themselves, thus the publican
became an evangelist, thus the blasphemer an apostle.</p>
<p>5. Look at these things, and never despair, but be ever confident, and rouse thyself. Lay
hold only on the way that leads thither, and thou wilt advance quickly. Shut not up the
doors, close not up the entrance. Short is the present life, small the labor. But though it were
great, not even so ought one to decline it. For if thou toil not at this most glorious toil that
is spent upon repentance and virtue, in the world thou wilt assuredly toil and weary thyself
in other ways. But if both in the one and the other there be labor, why do we not choose
that which hath its fruit abundant, and its recompense greater.</p>
<p>Yet neither is this labor and that the same. For in worldly pursuits are continual perils,
and losses one upon another, and the hope uncertain; great is the servility, and the expenditure
alike of wealth, and of bodies, and of souls; and then the return of the fruits is far below
our expectation, if perchance it should grow up.</p>
<p>For neither doth toil upon worldly matters everywhere bear fruit; nay but even, when
it hath not failed, but has brought forth its produce even abundantly, short is the time
wherein it continues.</p>
<p>For when thou art grown old, and hast no longer after that the feeling of enjoyment in
perfection, then and not till then doth the labor bear thee its recompense. And whereas the
labor was with the body in its vigor, the fruit and the enjoyment is with one grown old and
languid, when time has dulled even the feeling, although if it had not dulled it, the expectation
of the end suffers us not to find pleasure.</p>
<p>But in the other case not so, but the labor is in corruption and a dying body, but the
crown in one incorruptible, and immortal, and having no end. And the labor is both first
and short-lived; but the reward both subsequent and endless, that with security thou mayest
take thy rest after that, looking for nothing unpleasant.</p>
<p>For neither mayest thou fear change any more or loss as here. What sort of good things,
then, are these, which are both insecure, and short-lived, and earthly, and vanishing before
they have appeared, and acquired with many toils? And what good things are equal to those,
that are immovable, that grow not old, that have no toil, that even at the time of the conflicts
bring thee crowns?</p>
<p>For he that despises money even here already receives his reward, being freed from
anxiety, from rivalry, from false accusation, from plotting from envy. He that is temperate,
and lives orderly, even before his departure, is crowned and lives in pleasure, being delivered
from unseemliness, ridicule, dangers of accusation,2561and the other things that are to be
feared. All the remaining parts of virtue likewise make us a return here already.</p>

<p>In order therefore that we may attain unto both the present and the future blessings,

crowns to come, unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>“Hear another parable. There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and
hedged it round about, and digged a winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
and went into a far country.2562And when the time of the fruit drew near, he
sent his servants to receive the fruits. And the husbandmen took the servants, and beat
some, and killed some, and stoned some. Again he sent other servants more than the first:
and they did unto them likewise. But last he sent unto them his son, saying, It may be
they will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And
they cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the Lord therefore of the vineyard
cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen? They say unto Him, He will miserably
destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, which shall
render him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the
Scriptures, The Stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the
corner?”2563</p>
<p>Many things doth He intimate by this parable, God’s providence, which had been exercised
towards them from the first; their murderous disposition from the beginning; that
nothing had been omitted of whatever pertained to a heedful care of them; that even when
prophets had been slain, He had not turned away from them, but had sent His very Son;
that the God both of the New and of the Old Testament was one and the same; that His
death should effect great blessings; that they were to endure extreme punishment for the
crucifixion, and their crime; the calling of the Gentiles, the casting out of the Jews.</p>
<p>Therefore He putteth it after the former parable, that He may show even hereby the
charge to be greater, and highly unpardonable. How, and in what way? That although they
met with so much care, they were worse than harlots and publicans, and by so much.</p>
<p>And observe also both His great care, and the excessive idleness of these men. For what
pertained to the husbandmen, He Himself did, the hedging it round about, the planting the
vineyard, and all the rest, and He left little for them to do; to take care of what was there,
and to preserve what was given to them. For nothing was left undone, but all accomplished;
and not even so did they gain, and this, when they had enjoyed such great blessings from

Him. For when they had come forth out of Egypt, He gave a law, and set up a city, and built
a temple, and prepared an altar.</p>
<p>“And went into a far country;” that is, He bore long with them, not always bringing the
punishments close upon their sins; for by His going into a far country,2564 He means His
great long-suffering.</p>
<p>And “He sent His servants,” that is, the prophets, “to receive the fruit;” that is, their
obedience, the proof of it by their works. But they even here showed their wickedness, not
only by failing to give the fruit, after having enjoyed so much care, which was the sign of
idleness, but also by showing anger towards them that came. For they that had not to give
when they owed, should not have been indignant, nor angry, but should have entreated.
But they not only were indignant, but even filled their hands with blood, and while deserving
punishment, themselves inflicted punishment.</p>
<p>Therefore He sent both a second, and a third company, both that the wickedness of
these might be shown, and the love towards man of Him who sent them.</p>
<p>And wherefore sent He not His Son immediately? In order that they might condemn
themselves for the things done to the others, and leave off their wrath, and reverence Him
when He came. There are also other reasons, but for the present let us go on to what is next.
But what means, “It may be they will reverence?” It is not the language of one ignorant,
away with the thought! but of one desiring to show the sin to be great; and without any excuse.
Since Himself knowing that they would slay Him, He sent Him. But He saith, “They
will reverence,” declaring what ought to have been done, that it was their duty to have reverenced
Him. Since elsewhere also He saith, “if perchance they will hear;”2565not in this
case either being ignorant, but lest any of the obstinate should say, that His prediction was
the thing that necessitated their disobedience, therefore He frames His expressions in this
way, saying, “Whether they will,” and, “It may be.” For though they had been obstinate towards
His servants, yet ought they to have reverenced the dignity of the Son.</p>
<p>What then do these? When they ought to have run unto Him, when they ought to have
asked pardon for their offenses, they even persist more strongly in their former sins, they
proceed to add unto their pollutions, forever throwing into the shade their former offenses
by their later; as also He Himself declared when He said, “Fill ye up the measure of your
fathers.”2566 For from the first the prophets used to charge them with these things, saying,
<note type="footnote">2564 [The verb ἀπεδμησε means “went into another country.” But Chrysostom here speaks of the ἀποδημαν

“Your hands are full of blood;”2567and, “They mingle blood with blood;”2568and, “They
build up Sion with blood.”2569</p>
<p>But they did not learn self-restraint, albeit they received this commandment first, “Thou
shalt not kill;” and had been commanded to abstain from countless other things because of
this, and by many and various means urged to the keeping of this commandment.</p>
<p>Yet, for all that, they put not away that evil custom; but what say they, when they saw
Him? Come, let us kill Him. With what motive, and for what reason? what of any kind had
they to lay to His charge, either small or great? Is it that He honored you, and being God
became man for your sakes, and wrought His countless miracles? or that He pardoned your
sins? or that He called you unto a kingdom?</p>
<p>But see together with their impiety great was their folly, and the reason of His murder
was full of much madness. “For let us kill Him,” it is said, “and the inheritance shall be ours.”</p>
<p>And where do they take counsel to kill Him? “Out of the vineyard.”</p>
<p>2. Seest thou how He prophesies even the place where He was to be slain. “And they
cast Him out, and slew Him.”</p>
<p>And Luke indeed saith, that He declared what these men should suffer; and they said,
“God forbid;” and He added the testimony [of Scripture]. For “He beheld them, and said,
What is it then that is written? The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become
the head of the corner; and every one that falleth upon it shall be broken.”2570 But Matthew,
that they themselves delivered the sentence. But this is not a contradiction. For indeed both
things were done, both themselves passed the sentence against themselves; and again, when
they perceived what they had said, they added, “God forbid;” and He set up the prophet
against them, persuading them that certainly this would be.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not even so did He plainly reveal the Gentiles, that He might afford them
no handle, but signified it darkly by saying, “He will give the vineyard to others.” For this
purpose then did He speak by a parable, that themselves might pass the sentence, which
was done in the case of David also, when He passed judgment on the parable of Nathan.
But do thou mark, I pray thee, even hereby how just is the sentence, when the very persons
that are to be punished condemn themselves.</p>
<p>Then that they might learn that not only the nature of justice requires these things, but
even from the beginning the grace of the Spirit had foretold them, and God had so decreed,
He both added a prophecy, and reproves them in a way to put them to shame, saying, “Did
ye never read, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the

corner? this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes;” by all things showing, that
they should be cast out for unbelief, and the Gentiles brought in. This He darkly intimated
by the Canaanitish woman also; this again by the ass, and by the centurion, and by many
other parables; this also now.</p>
<p>Wherefore He added too, “This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes,”
declaring beforehand that the believing Gentiles, and as many of the Jews as should also
themselves believe, shall be one, although the difference between them had been so great
before.</p>
<p>Then, that they might learn that nothing was opposed to God’s will of the things doing,
but that the event was even highly acceptable, and beyond expectation, and amazing every
one of the beholders (for indeed the miracle was far beyond words), He added and said, “It
is the Lord’s doing.” And by the stone He means Himself, and by builders the teachers of
the Jews; as Ezekiel also saith, “They that build the wall, and daub it with untempered
mortar.”2571 But how did they reject Him? By saying, “This man is not of God;2572 This
man deceiveth the people;”2573and again, “Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil.”2574</p>
<p>Then, that they might know that the penalty is not limited to their being cast out, He
added the punishments also, saying, “Every one that falleth on this stone, shall be broken;
but upon whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.”2575 He speaks here of two
ways of destruction, one from stumbling and being offended; for this is, “Whosoever falleth
on this stone:” but another from their capture, and calamity, and utter destruction, which
also He clearly foretold, saying, “It will grind him to powder.” By these words He darkly
intimated His own resurrection also.</p>
<p>Now the Prophet Isaiah saith, that He blames the vineyard, but here He accuses in particular
the rulers of the people. And there indeed He saith, “What ought I to have done to
my vineyard, that I did not;”2576and elsewhere again, “What transgression have your fathers
found in me?”2577 And again, “O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have
I grieved thee?”2578showing their thankless disposition, and that when in the enjoyment of

all things, they requited it by the contraries; but here He expresses it with yet greater force.
For He doth not plead, Himself, saying, “What ought I to have done that I have not done?”
but brings in themselves to judge, that nothing hath been wanting, and to condemn themselves.
For when they say, “He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the
vineyard to other husbandmen,” they say nothing else than this, publishing their sentence
with much greater force.</p>
<p>With this Stephen also upbraids them, which thing most of all stung them, that having
enjoyed always much providential care, they requited their benefactor with the contraries,
which very thing itself was a very great sign, that not the punisher, but the punished, were
the cause of the vengeance brought upon them.</p>
<p>This here likewise is shown, by the parable, by the prophecy. For neither was He satisfied
with a parable only, but added also a twofold prophecy, one David’s, the others from Himself.</p>
<p>What then ought they to have done on hearing these things? ought they not to have
adored, to have marvelled at the tender care, that shown before, that afterwards? But if by
none of these things they were made better, by the fear of punishment at any rate ought
they not to have been rendered more temperate?</p>
<p>But they did not become so, but what do they after these things? “When they had heard
it,” it is said, “they perceived that He spake of them. And when they sought to lay hands on
Him, they were afraid because of the multitudes, for they took Him for a prophet.”2579 For
they felt afterwards that they themselves were intimated. Sometimes indeed, when being
seized, He withdraws through the midst of them, and is not seen; and sometimes while appearing
to them He lays a check upon their laboring eagerness; at which indeed men
marveled, and said, “Is not this Jesus? Lo, He speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto
Him.”2580 But in this instance, forasmuch as they were held in restraint by the fear of the
multitude, He is satisfied with this, and doth not work miracles, as before, withdrawing
through the midst, and not appearing. For it was not His desire to do all things in a superhuman
way, in order that the Dispensation2581might be believed.</p>
<p>But they, neither by the multitude, nor by what had been said, were brought to a sound
mind; they regarded not the prophet’s testimony, nor their own sentence, nor the disposition
of the people; so entirely had the love of power and the lust of vainglory blinded them, together
with the pursuit of things temporal.</p>
<p>3. For nothing so urges men headlong and drives them down precipices, nothing so
makes them fail of the things to come, as their being riveted to these decaying things.
Nothing so surely makes them enjoy both the one and the other, as their esteeming the

things to come above all. For, “Seek ye,” saith Christ, “the kingdom of God, and all these
things shall be added unto you.”2582 And indeed, even if this were not joined, not even in
that case ought we to aim at them. But now in obtaining the others, we may obtain these
two; and not even so are some persuaded, but are like senseless stones, and pursue shadows
of pleasure. For what is pleasant of the things in this present life? what is delightful? For
with greater freedom do I desire to discourse with you to-day; but suffer it, that ye may learn
that this life which seems to you to be a galling and wearisome life, I mean that of the monks
and of them that are crucified, is far sweeter, and more to be desired than that which seems
to be easy, and more delicate.</p>
<p>And of this ye are witnesses, who often have asked for death, in the reverses and despondencies
that have overtaken you, and have accounted happy them that are in mountains,
them that are in caves, them that have not married, them that live the unworldly life; ye that
are engaged in crafts, ye that are in military services, ye that live without object or rules, and
pass your days at the theatres and orchestras. For of these, although numberless fountains
of pleasures and mirth seem to spring up, yet are countless darts still more bitter brought
forth.</p>
<p>For if any one be seized with a passion for one of the damsels that dance there, beyond
ten thousand marches, beyond ten thousand journeys from home, will he undergo a torture
more grievous, being in a more miserable state than any besieged city.</p>
<p>However, not to inquire into those things for the present, having left them to the conscience
of those that have been taken captive, come let us discourse of the life of the common
sort of men, and we shall find the difference between either of these kinds of life as great as
between a harbor, and a sea continually beaten about with winds.</p>
<p>And observe from their retreats at once the first signs of their tranquillity. For they have
fled from market places, and cities, and the tumults amidst men, and have chosen the life
in mountains, that which hath nothing in common with the things present, that which undergoes
none of the ills of man, no worldly sorrows, no grief, no care so great, no dangers,
no plots, no envy, no jealousy, no lawless lusts, nor any other thing of this kind.</p>
<p>Here already they meditate upon the things of the kingdom, holding converse with
groves, and mountains, and springs, and with great quietness, and solitude, and before all
these, with God. And from all turmoil is their cell pure, and from every passion and disease
is their soul free, refined and light, and far purer than the finest air.</p>

<p>And their work is what was Adam’s also at the beginning and before his sin, when he
was clothed with the glory, and conversed freely with God, and dwelt in that place that was
full of great blessedness. For in what respect are they in a worse state than he, when before
his disobedience he was set to till the garden? Had he no worldly care? But neither have
these. Did he talk to God with a pure conscience? this also do these; or rather they have a
greater confidence than he, inasmuch as they enjoy even greater grace by the supply of the
Spirit.</p>
<p>Now ye ought indeed by the sight to take in these things; but forasmuch as ye are not
willing, but pass your time in turmoils and in markets, by word at least let us teach you,
taking one part of their way of living (for it is not possible to go over their whole life). These
that are the lights of the world, as soon as the sun is up, or rather even long before its rise,
rise up from their bed, healthy, and wakeful, and sober (for neither doth any sorrow and
care, nor headache, and toil, and multitude of business, nor any other such thing trouble
them, but as angels live they in Heaven); having risen then straightway from their bed
cheerful and glad, and having made one choir, with their conscience bright, with one voice
all, like as out of one mouth, they sing hymns unto the God of all, honoring Him and
thanking Him for all His benefits, both particular, and common.2583</p>
<p>So that if it seem good, let us leave Adam, and inquire what is the difference between
the angels and this company of them who on earth sing and say, “Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will towards men.”2584
And their dress is suitable to their manliness. For not indeed, like those with trailing
garments, the enervated and mincing, are they dressed, but like those blessed angels, Elijah,
Elisha, John, like the apostles; their garments being made for them, for some of goat’s hair,
for some of camel’s hair, and there are some for whom skins suffice alone, and these long
worn.</p>
<p>Then, after they have said those songs, they bow their knees, and entreat the God who
was the object of their hymns for things, to the very thought of which some do not easily
arrive. For they ask nothing of things present, for they have no regard for these, but that
they may stand with boldness before the fearful judgment-seat, when the Only-Begotten
Son of God is come to judge quick and dead, and that no one may hear the fearful voice
that saith, “I know you not,” and that with a pure conscience and many good deeds they
may pass through this toilsome life, and sail over the angry sea with a favorable wind. And
he leads them in their prayers, who is their Father, and their ruler.</p>
<p>2583 “For all Thy goodness and loving kindness to us, and to all men.” Thanksgiving Prayer. See the Morning
Thanksgiving; Const. Apost. viii. 38, and The Eucharistic Prayer, ib. c. 12.</p>

<p>After this, when they have risen up and finished those holy and continual prayers, the
sun being risen, they depart each one to their work, gathering thence a large supply for the
needy.</p>
<p>4. Where now are they who give themselves to devilish choirs, and harlot’s songs, and
sit in theatres? For I am indeed ashamed to make mention of them; nevertheless, because
of your infirmity it is needful to do even this. For Paul too saith, “Like as ye have yielded
your members servants to uncleanness, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness
unto holiness.”2585</p>
<p>Come let us also therefore compare the company that is made up of harlot women, and
prostituted youths on the stage, and this same that consists of these blessed ones in regard
of pleasure, for which most of all, many of the careless youths are taken in their snares. For
we shall find the difference as great as if any one heard angels singing above that all-harmonious
melody of theirs, and dogs and swine howling and grunting on the dunghill. For by
the mouths of these Christ speaketh, by their tongues2586the devil.</p>
<p>But is the sound of pipes joined to them with unmeaning noise, and unpleasing show,
when cheeks are puffed out, and their strings stretched to breaking? But here the grace of
the Spirit pours forth a sound, using, instead of flute or lyre or pipes, the lips of the saints.</p>
<p>Or rather, whatever we may say, it is not possible to set forth the pleasure thereof, because
of them that are riveted to their clay, and their brick-making? Therefore I would even wish
to take one of those who are mad about these matters, and to lead him off there, and to show
him the choir of those saints, and I should have no more need for these words. Nevertheless,
though we speak unto miry ones, we will try, though by word, still by little and little, to draw
them out of the slime and the fens. For there the hearer receives straightway the fire of illicit
love; for as though the sight of the harlot were not enough to set the mind on fire, they add
the mischief also from the voice; but here even should the soul have any such thing, it lays
it aside straightway. But not their voice only, nor their countenance, but even their clothes
do more than these confound the beholders. And should it be some poor man of the
grosser and heedless sort, from the sight he will cry out ten thousand times in bitter despair,
and will say to himself, “The harlot, and the prostituted boy, children of cooks and cobblers,
and often even of slaves live in such delicacy, and I a freeman, and born of freemen, choosing
honest labor, am not able so much as to imagine these things in a dream;” and thus he will
go his way inflamed with discontent.</p>
<p>But in the case of the monks there is no such result, but rather the contrary altogether.
For when he shall see children of rich men and descendants of illustrious ancestors clothed
<note type="footnote">2585 Rom. vi. 19. [R.V., “sanctification.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2586 [“by the tongues of those;” there being a contrast in the Greek, which is obscured in the English rendering.—
R.]</note>

<pb n="728"/>
in such garments as not even the lowest of the poor, and rejoicing in this, consider how
great a consolation against poverty he will receive as he goes away. And should he be rich,
he returns sobered, become a better man. Again in the theatre, when they see the harlot
clothed with golden ornaments, while the poor man will lament, and bemoan, seeing his
own wife having nothing of the kind, the rich will in consequence of this spectacle contemn
and despise the partners of their home. For when the harlot present to the beholders garb
and look, and voice and step, all luxurious, they depart set on fire, and enter into their own
houses, thenceforth captives.</p>
<p>Hence the insults, and the affronts, hence the enmities, the wars, the daily deaths; hence
to them that are taken captive, life is insupportable, and the partner of their home thenceforth
unpleasing, and their children not as much objects of affection, and all things in their houses
turned upside down, and after that they seem to be thrown into disorder by the very sunbeam.</p>
<p>But not from these choirs does any such dissatisfaction arise, but the wife will receive
her husband quiet and meek, freed from all unlawful lust, and will find him more gentle to
her than before this. Such evil things doth that choir bring forth, but this good things, the
one making wolves of sheep, this lambs of wolves. But as yet we have perhaps said nothing
hitherto touching the pleasure.</p>
<p>And what could be more pleasant than not to be troubled or grieved in mind, neither
to despond and groan? Nevertheless, let us carry on our discourse still further, and examine
the enjoyment of either kind of song and spectacle; and we shall see the one indeed continuing
until evening, so long as the spectator sits in the theatre, but after this paining him more
grievously than any sting; but in the other case forever vigorous in the souls of them that
have beheld it. For as well the fashion of the men, and the delightfulness of the place, and
the sweetness of their manner of life, and the purity, of their rule, and the grace of that most
beautiful and spiritual song they have for ever infixed in them. They at least who are in
continual enjoyment of those havens, thenceforth flee as from a tempest, from the tumults
of the multitude.</p>
<p>But not when singing only, and praying, but also when riveted to their books, they are
a pleasing spectacle to the beholders. For after they have ended the choir, one takes Isaiah
and discourses with him, another converses with the apostles, and another goes over the
labors of other men, and seeks wisdom concerning God, concerning this universe, concerning
the things that are seen, concerning the things that are not seen, concerning the objects of
sense, and the objects of intellect, concerning the vileness of this present life, and the greatness
of that to come.</p>
<p>5. And they are fed on a food most excellent, not setting before themselves cooked flesh
of beasts; but oracles of God, beyond honey and the honey comb, a honey marvellous, and
far superior to that whereon John fed of old in the wilderness. For this honey no wild bees
collect, settling on the flowers, neither do lay it up in hives digesting the dew, but the grace

<pb n="729"/>
of the Spirit forming it, layeth it up in the souls of the saints, in the place of honeycombs,
and hives, and pipes, so that he that will may eat thereof continually in security. These bees
then they also imitate, and hover around the honeycombs of those holy books, reaping
therefrom great pleasure.</p>
<p>And if thou desirest to learn about their table, be near it, and thou shalt see them
bursting forth2587with such things, all gentle and sweet, and full of a spiritual fragrance. No
foul word can those spiritual mouths bring forth, nothing of foolish jesting, nothing harsh,
but all worthy of Heaven. One would not be wrong in comparing the mouths of them that
crawl about in the market places, and are mad after worldly things, to ditches of some mire;
but the lips of these to fountains flowing with honey, and pouring forth pure streams.</p>
<p>But if any felt displeased that I have called the mouths of the multitude ditches of some
mire, let him know that I have said it, sparing them very much. For Scripture hath not used
this measure, but a comparison far stronger. “For adder’s poison,” it is said, “is under their
lips,2588and their throat is an open sepulchre.” But theirs are not so, but full of much fragrance.</p>
<p>And their state here is like this, but that hereafter what speech can set before us? what
thought shall conceive? the portion of angels, the blessedness unspeakable, the good things
untold?</p>
<p>Perchance some are warmed now, and have been moved to a longing after this good
rule of life. But what is the profit, when whilst ye are here only, ye have this fire; but when
ye have gone forth, ye extinguish the flame, and this desire fades. How then, in order that
this may not be? While this desire is warm in you, go your way unto those angels, kindle it
more. For the account that we give will not be able to set thee on fire, like as the sight of the
things. Say not, I will speak with my wife, and I will settle my affairs first. This delay is the
beginning of remissness. Hear, how one desired to bid farewell to them at his house,2589and
the prophet suffered him not. And why do I say, to bid farewell? The disciple desired to
bury his father,2590and Christ allowed not so much as this. And yet what thing seems to
thee to be so necessary as the funeral of a father? but not even this did He permit.</p>
<p>Why could this have been? Because the devil is at hand fierce, desiring to find some
secret approach; and though it be but a little hindrance or delay he takes hold of, he works
a great remissness. Therefore one adviseth, “Put not off from day to day.”2591 For thus shalt
thou be able to succeed in most things, thus also shall the things in thine house be well

and prefer the care of ours, much more doth God, who even without these things
hath a care for us, and provides for us.</p>
<p>Be not thoughtful then about thine interests, but leave them to God. For if thou art
thoughtful about them, thou art thoughtful as a man; but if God provide, He provides as
God. Be not so thoughtful about them as to let go the greater things, since then He will not
much provide for them. In order therefore that He may fully provide for them, leave them
to Him alone. For if thou also thyself takest them in hand, having let go the things spiritual,
He will not make much provision for them.</p>
<p>In order then that both these things may be well disposed for thee, and that thou mayest
be freed from all anxiety, cleave to the things spiritual, overlook the things of the world; for
in this way thou shalt have earth also with heaven, and shalt attain unto the good things to
come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXII. 1-14.</p>
<p>“And Jesus answered and spake again2593in parables. The kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
certain king, which made a marriage2594for his son; and sent forth his servants to call
them which were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come. Again, he sent forth
other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen
and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage. But they
made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and
the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.”2595</p>
<p>Seest thou both in the former parable and in this the difference between the Son and
the servants? Seest thou at once the great affinity between both parables, and the great dif-
ference also? For this also indicates God’s long-suffering, and His great providential care,
and the Jews’ ingratitude.</p>
<p>But this parable hath something also more than the other. For it proclaims beforehand
both the casting out of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles; and it indicates together
with this also the strictness of the life required, and how great the punishment appointed
for the careless.</p>
<p>And well is this placed after the other. For since He had said, “It shall be given to a nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof,” He declares next to what kind of nation; and not this only,
but He also again sets forth His providential care towards the Jews as past utterance. For
there He appears before His crucifixion bidding them; but here even after He is slain, He
still urges them, striving to win them over. And when they deserved to have suffered the
most grievous punishment, then He both presses them to the marriage, and honors them
with the highest honor. And see how both there He calls not the Gentiles first, but the Jews,
and here again. But as there, when they would not receive Him, but even slew Him when
He was come, then He gave away the vineyard; thus here too, when they were not willing
to be present at the marriage, then He called others.</p>
<p>What then could be more ungrateful than they, when being bidden to a marriage they
rush away? For who would not choose to come to a marriage, and that a King’s marriage,
and of a King making a marriage for a Son?</p>

<pb n="732"/>
<p>And wherefore is it called a marriage? one may say. That thou mightest learn God’s
tender care, His yearning towards us, the cheerfulness of the state of things, that there is
nothing sorrowful there, nor sad, but all things are full of spiritual joy. Therefore also John
calls Him a bridegroom, therefore Paul again saith, “For I have espoused you to one husband;”
2596and, “This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.”2597</p>
<p>Why then is not the bride said to be espoused to Him, but to the Son? Because she that
is espoused to the Son, is espoused to the Father. For it is indifferent in Scripture that the
one or the other should be said, because of the identity2598of the substance.
Hereby He proclaimed the resurrection also. For since in what went before He had
spoken of the death, He shows that even after the death, then is the marriage, then the
bridegroom.</p>
<p>But not even so do these become better men nor more gentle, than which what can be
worse? For this again is a third accusation. The first that they killed the prophets; then the
son; afterwards that even when they had slain Him, and were bidden unto the marriage of
Him that was slain, by the very one that was slain, they come not, but feign excuses, yokes
of oxen, and pieces of ground, and wives. And yet the excuses seem to be reasonable; but
hence we learn, though the things which hinder us be necessary, to set the things spiritual
at a higher price than all.</p>
<p>And He not suddenly, but a long time before. For, “Tell,” He saith, “them that are bidden;”
and again, “Call them that were bidden;” which circumstance makes the charge against
them heavier. And when were they bidden? By all the prophets; by John again; for unto
Christ he would pass all on, saying, “He must increase, I must decrease;”2599by the Son
Himself again, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh
you;”2600and again, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.”2601</p>
<p>But not by words only, but also by actions did He bid them, after His ascension by Peter,
and those with him. “For He that wrought effectually in Peter,” it is said, “to the apostleship
of the circumcision, was mighty also in me towards the Gentiles.”2602</p>
<p>For since on seeing the Son, they were wroth and slew Him, He bids them again by His
servants. And unto what doth He bid them? Unto labors, and toils, and sweat? Nay but unto

pleasure. For, “My oxen,” He saith, “and my fatlings are killed.” See how complete His
banquet,2603how great His munificence.</p>
<p>And not even this shamed them, but the more long-suffering He showed, so much the
more were they hardened. For not for press of business, but from “making light of it,” they
did not come.</p>
<p>“How then do some bring forward marriages, others yokes of oxen? these things surely
are of want of leisure.”</p>
<p>By no means, for when spiritual things call us, there is no press of business that has the
power of necessity.</p>
<p>And to me they seem moreover to make use of these excuses, putting forward these
things as cloke for their negligence. And not this only is the grievous thing, that they came
not, but also that which is a far more violent and furious act, to have even beaten them that
came, and to have used them despitefully, and to have slain them; this is worse than the
former. For those others came, demanding produce and fruits, and were slain; but these,
bidding them to the marriage of Him that had been slain by them, and these again are
murdered.</p>
<p>What is equal to this madness? This Paul also was laying to their charge, when he said,
“Who both killed the Lord, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us.”2604</p>
<p>Moreover, that they may not say, “He is an adversary of God, and therefore we do not
come,” hear what they say who are bidding them; that it is the father who is making the
marriage, and that it is He who is bidding them.</p>
<p>What then did He after these things? Since they were not willing to come, yea and also
slew those that came unto them; He burns up their cities, and sent His armies and slew
them.</p>
<p>And these things He saith, declaring beforehand the things that took place under Vespasian
and Titus, and that they provoked the father also, by not believing in Him; it is the
father at any rate who was avenging.</p>
<p>And for this reason let me add, not straightway after Christ was slain did the capture
take place, but after forty years, that He might show His long suffering, when they had slain
Stephen, when they had put James to death, when they had spitefully entreated the apostles.
Seest thou the truth of the event, and its quickness? For while John was yet living, and
many other of them that were with Christ, these things came to pass, and they that had
heard these words were witnesses of the events.</p>
<p>See then care utterable. He had planted a vineyard; He had done all things, and finished;
when His servants had been put to death, He sent other servants; when those had been slain,
<note type="footnote">2603 πση πανδαισα.</note>
<note type="footnote">2604 1 Thess. ii. 15. [R.V., “and drove out us.”]</note>

<pb n="734"/>
He sent the son; and when He was put to death, He bids them to the marriage. They would
not come. After this He sends other servants, and they slew these also.</p>
<p>Then upon this He slays them, as being incurably diseased. For that they were incurably
diseased, was proved not by their acts only, but by the fact, that even when harlots and
publicans had believed, they did these things. So that, not by their own crimes alone, but
also from what others were able to do aright, these men are condemned,</p>
<p>But if any one should say, that not then were they out of the Gentiles called, I mean,
when the apostles had been beaten and had suffered ten thousand things, but straightway
after the resurrection (for then He said to them, “Go ye and make disciples of all nations.”
2605) We would say, that both before the crucifixion, and after the crucifixion, they
addressed themselves to them first. For both before the crucifixion, He saith to them, “Go
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;”2606and after the crucifixion, so far from forbidding,
He even commanded them to address themselves to the Jews. For though He said, “Make
disciples of all nations,” yet when on the point of ascending into Heaven, He declared that
unto those first they were to address themselves; For, “ye shall receive power,” saith He,
“after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judæa, and unto the uttermost part of the earth;”2607and Paul again,
“He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, was mighty in
me also toward the Gentiles.”2608 Therefore the apostles also went first unto the Jews, and
when they had tarried a long time in Jerusalem, and then had been driven away by them,
in this way they were scattered abroad unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2. And see thou even herein His bounty; “As many as ye shall find,” saith He, “bid to
the marriage.” For before this, as I said, they addressed themselves both to Jews and Greeks,
tarrying for the most part in Judæa; but since they continued to lay plots against them, hear
Paul interpreting this parable, and saying thus, “It was necessary that the word of God should
first have been spoken to you, but since ye judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn to the
Gentiles.”2609</p>
<p>Therefore Christ also saith, “The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were
not worthy.”</p>
<p>He knew this indeed even before, but that He might leave them no pretext of a shameless
sort of contradiction, although He knew it, to them first He both came and sent, both stopping
their mouths, and teaching us to fulfill all our parts, though no one should derive any profit.</p>

<pb n="735"/>
<p>Since then they were not worthy, go ye, saith He, into the highways, and as many as ye
shall find, bid; both the common sort, and the outcasts. For because He had said in every
way,2610“The harlots and publicans shall inherit heaven;” and, “The first shall be last, and
the last first;” He shows that justly do these things come to pass; which more than anything
stung the Jews, and goaded them far more grievously than their overthrow, to see those
from the Gentiles brought into their privileges, and into far greater than theirs.</p>
<p>Then in order that not even these should put confidence in their faith alone, He discourses
unto them also concerning the judgment to be passed upon wicked actions; to them
that have not yet believed, of coming unto Him by faith, and to them that have believed, of
care with respect to their life. For the garment is life and practice.</p>
<p>And yet the calling was of grace; wherefore then doth He take a strict account? Because
although to be called and to be cleansed was of grace, yet, when called and clothed in clean
garments, to continue keeping them so, this is of the diligence of them that are called.</p>
<p>The being called was not of merit, but of grace. It was fit therefore to make a return for
the grace, and not to show forth such great wickedness after the honor. “But I have not enjoyed,”
one may say, “so much advantage as the Jews.” Nay, but thou hast enjoyed far
greater benefits. For what things were being prepared for them throughout all their time,
these thou hast received at once, not being worthy. Wherefore Paul also saith, “And that
the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.”2611 For what things were due to them, these
thou hast received.</p>
<p>Wherefore also great is the punishment appointed for them that have been remiss. For
as they did despite by not coming, so also thou by thus sitting down with a corrupt life. For
to come in with filthy garments is this namely, to depart hence having one’s life impure;
wherefore also he was speechless.</p>
<p>Seest thou how, although the fact was so manifest, He doth not punish at once, until he
himself, who has sinned, has passed the sentence? For by having nothing to reply he condemned
himself, and so is taken away to the unutterable torments.</p>
<p>For do not now, on hearing of darkness, suppose he is punished by this, by sending into
a place where there is no light only, but where “there is” also “weeping and gnashing of
teeth.”2612 And this He saith, indicating the intolerable pains.</p>
<p>Hear ye, as many as having partaken of the mysteries, and having been present at the
marriage, clothe your souls with filthy deeds. Hear whence ye were called.</p>
<p>From the highway. Being what? Lame and halt in soul, which is a much more grievous
thing than the mutilation of the body. Reverence the love of Him, who called you, and let

<note type="footnote">2611 Rom. xv. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2612 Matt. xxii. 13.</note>

<pb n="736"/>
no one continue to have filthy garments, but let each of you busy himself about the clothing
of your soul.</p>
<p>Hear, ye women; hear, ye men; we need not these garments that are bespangled with
gold, that adorn our outward parts,2613but those others, that adorn the inward. Whilst we
have these former, it is difficult to put on those latter. It is not possible at the same time to
deck both soul and body. It is not possible at the same time both to serve mammon, and to
obey Christ as we ought.</p>
<p>Let us put off us therefore this grievous tyranny. For neither if any one were to adorn
thy house by hanging it with golden curtains, and were to make thee sit there in rags, naked,
wouldest thou endure it with meekness. But lo, now thou doest this to thyself, decking the
house of thy soul, I mean the body, with curtains beyond number, but leaving the soul itself
to sit in rags. Knowest thou not that the king ought to be adorned more than the city? so
therefore while for the city hangings are prepared of linen, for the king there is a purple
robe and a diadem. Even so do thou wrap the body with a much meaner dress, but the mind
do thou clothe in purple, and put a crown on it, and set it on a high and conspicuous
chariot. For now thou art doing the opposite, decking the city in various ways, but suffering
the king, the mind, to be dragged bound after the brute passions.</p>
<p>Rememberest thou not, that thou art bidden to a marriage, and to God’s marriage?
Considerest thou not how the soul that is bidden ought to enter into those chambers, clad,
and decked with fringes of gold.</p>
<p>3. Wilt thou that I show thee them that are clad thus, them that have on a marriage
garment?</p>
<p>Call to mind those holy persons, of whom I discoursed to you of late, them that wear
garments of hair, them that dwell in the deserts. These above all are the wearers of the garments
of that wedding; this is evident from hence, that how many soever purple robes thou
wert to give them, they would not choose to receive them; but much as a king, if any one
were to take the beggar’s rags, and exhort him to put them on, would abhor the clothing,
so would those persons also his purple robe. And from no other cause have they this feeling,
but because of knowing the beauty of their own raiment. Therefore even that purple robe
they spurn like the spider’s web. For these things hath their sackcloth taught them; for indeed
they are far more exalted and more glorious than the very king who reigns.</p>
<p>And if thou wert able to open the doors of the mind, and to look upon their soul, and
all their ornaments within, surely thou wouldest fall down upon the earth, not bearing the
glory of their beauty, and the splendor of those garments, and the lightning brightness of
their conscience.</p>
<note type="footnote">2613 [The clause in italics is not found in the mss. collated by Field, but occurs in the Benedictine edition.—R.]</note>

<pb n="737"/>
<p>For we could tell also of men of old, great and to be admired; but since visible examples
lead on more those of grosser souls, therefore do I send you even to the tabernacles of those
holy persons. For they have nothing sorrowful, but as if in heaven they had pitched their
tents, even so are they encamped far off the wearisome things of this present life, in campaign
against the devils; and as in choirs, so do they war against him. Therefore I say, they have
fixed their tents, and have fled from cities, and markets, and houses. For he that warreth
cannot sit in a house, but he must make his habitation of a temporary kind, as on the point
of removing straightway, and so dwell. Such are all those persons, contrary to us. For we
indeed live not as in a camp, but as in a city at peace.</p>
<p>For who in a camp ever lays foundation, and builds himself a house, which he is soon
after to leave? There is not one; but should any one attempt it, he is put to death as a traitor.
Who in a camp buys acres of land, and makes for himself trades? There is not one, and very
reasonably. “For thou art come here,” they would say, “to fight, not to traffic; why then dost
thou trouble thyself about the place, which in a little time thou wilt leave? When we are
gone away to our country, do these things.”</p>
<p>The same do I now say to thee also. When we have removed to the city that is above,
do these things: or rather thou wilt have no need of labors there; after that the king will do
all things for thee. But here it is enough to dig a ditch round only, and to fix a palisade, but
of building houses there is no need.</p>
<p>Hear what was the life of the Scythians, that lived in their wagons, such, as they say, are
the habits of the shepherd tribes. So ought Christians to live; to go about the world, warring
against the devil, rescuing the captives held in subjection by him, and to be in freedom from
all worldly things.</p>
<p>Why preparest thou a house, O man, that thou mayest bind thyself more? Why dost
thou bury a treasure, and invite the enemy against thyself? Why dost thou compass thyself
with walls, and prepare a prison for thyself?</p>
<p>But if these things seem to thee to be hard, let us go away unto the tents of those men,
that by their deeds we may learn the easiness thereof. For they having set up huts, if they
must depart from these, depart like as soldiers, having left their camp in peace. For so likewise
are they encamped, or rather even much more beautifully.</p>
<p>For indeed it is more pleasant to behold a desert containing huts of monks in close
succession, than soldiers stretching the canvas in a camp, and fixing spears, and suspending
from the point of the spears saffron garments,2614and a multitude of men having heads of
brass, and the bosses of the shields glistening much, and men armed all throughout with
steel, and royal courts hastily made, and ground levelled far, and men dining and piping.
For neither is this spectacle so delightful as that of which I now speak.</p>
<note type="footnote">2614 φρη κροκωτ.</note>

<pb n="738"/>
<p>For if we were to go away into the wilderness, and look at the tents of Christ’s soldiers,
we shall see not canvas stretched, neither points of spears, nor golden garments making a
royal pavilion; but like as if any one upon an earth much larger than this earth, yea infinite,
had stretched out many heavens, strange and awful would be the sight he showed; even so
may one see here.</p>
<p>For in nothing are their lodging-places in a condition inferior to the heavens; for the
angels lodge with them, and the Lord of the angels. For if they came to Abraham, a man
having a wife, and bringing up children, because they saw him hospitable; when they find
much more abundant virtue, and a man delivered from the body, and in the flesh disregarding
the flesh, much more do they tarry there, and celebrate the choral feast that becomes them.
For there is moreover a table amongst them pure from all covetousness, and full of selfdenial.</p>
<p>No streams of blood are amongst them, nor cutting up of flesh, nor heaviness of head,
nor dainty cooking, neither are there unpleasing smells of meat amongst them, nor disagreeable
smoke, neither runnings and tumults, and disturbances, and wearisome clamors; but
bread and water, the latter from a pure fountain, the former from honest labor. But if any
time they should be minded to feast more sumptuously, their sumptuousness consists of
fruits, and greater is the pleasure there than at royal tables. There is no fear there, or trem-
bling; no ruler accuses, no wife provokes, no child casts into sadness, no dis orderly mirth
dissipates, no multitude of flatterers puffs up; but the table is an angel’s table free from all
such turmoil.</p>
<p>And for a couch they have grass only beneath them, like as Christ did when making a
dinner in the wilderness. And many of them do this, not being even under shelter, but for
a roof they have heaven, and the moon instead of the light of a candle, not wanting oil, nor
one to attend to it; on them alone does it shine worthily from on high.</p>
<p>4. This table even angels from heaven beholding are delighted and pleased. For if over
one sinner that repenteth they rejoice, over so many just men imitating them, what will they
not do? There are not master and slave; all are slaves, all free men. And do not think the
saying to be a dark proverb, for they are indeed slaves one of another, and masters one of
another.</p>
<p>They have no occasion to be in sadness when evening has overtaken them, as many
men feel, revolving the anxious thoughts that spring from the evils of the day. They have
no occasion after their supper to be careful about robbers, and to shut the doors, and to put
bars against them, neither to dread the other ills, of which many are afraid, extinguishing
their candles with strict care, lest a spark anywhere should set the house on fire.</p>
<p>And their conversation again is full of the same calm. For they talk not of these things,
whereof we discourse, that are nothing to us; such a one is made governor, such a one has
ceased to be governor; such a one is dead, and another has succeeded to the inheritance,

<pb n="739"/>
and all such like, but always about the things to come do they speak and seek wisdom; and
as though dwelling in another world, as though they had migrated unto heaven itself, as
living there, even so all their conversation is about the things there, about Abraham’s bosom,
about the crowns of the saints, about the choiring with Christ; and of things present they
have neither any memory nor thought, but like as we should not deign to speak at all of
what the ants do in their holes and clefts; so neither do they of what we do; but about the
King that is above, about the war in which they are engaged, about the devil’s crafts, about
the good deeds which the saints have achieved.</p>
<p>Wherein therefore are we different from ants, when compared with them? For like as
they care for the things of the body, so also do we; and would it were for these alone: but
now it is even for things far worse. For not for necessary things only do we care like them,
but also for things superfluous. For those insects pursue a business free from all blame, but
we follow after all covetousness, and not even the ways of ants do we imitate, but the ways
of wolves, but the ways of leopards, or rather we are even worse than these. For to them
nature has assigned that they should be thus fed, but us God hath honored with speech, and
a sense of equity,2615and we are become worse than the wild beasts.</p>
<p>And whereas we are worse than the brutes, those men are equal to the angels, being
strangers and pilgrims as to the things here; and all things in them are made different from
us, clothing, and food, and house, and shoes, and speech. And if any one were to hear them
conversing and us, then he would know full well, how they indeed are citizens of heaven,
but we are not worthy so much as of the earth.</p>
<p>So that therefore, when any one invested with rank is come unto them, then is all inflated
pride found utterly vain. For the laborer there, and he that hath no experience of worldly
affairs, sits near him that is a commander of troops, and prides himself on his authority,
upon the grass, upon a mean cushion. For there are none to extol him, none to puff him
up; but the same result takes place, as if any one were to go to a goldsmith, and a garden of
roses, for he receives some brightness from the gold and from the roses; so they too, gaining
a little from the splendor of these, are delivered from their former arrogance. And like as if
any were to go upon a high place, though he be exceedingly short, he appears high; so these
too, coming unto their exalted minds, appear like them, so long as they abide there, but
when they are gone down are abased again, on descending from that height.</p>
<p>A king is nothing amongst them, a governor is nothing; but like as we, when children
are playing at these things, laugh; so do they also utterly spurn the inflamed pride of them
who strut without. And this is evident from hence, that if any one would give them a kingdom
to possess in security, they would never take it; yet they would take it, unless their thoughts
were upon what is greater than it, unless they accounted the thing to be but for a season.</p>
<note type="footnote">2615 ἰσονομ.</note>

<pb n="740"/>
<p>What then? Shall we not go over unto blessedness so great? Shall we not come unto
these angels; shall we not receive clean garments, and join in the ceremonies of this wedding
feast; but shall we continue begging, in no respect in a better condition than the poor in the
streets, or rather in a state far worse and more wretched? For much worse than these are
they that are rich in evil ways, and it is better to beg than to spoil, for the one hath excuse,
but the other brings punishment; and the beggar in no degree offends God, but this other
both men and God; and undergoes the labors of rapine, but all the enjoyment thereof other
men often reap.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us lay aside all covetousness, and covet the things above,
with great earnestness “taking the kingdom by force.”2616 For it cannot be, it cannot be that
any one who is remiss should enter therein.</p>
<p>But God grant that we all having become earnest, and watchful may attain thereto, by
the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXII. 15.</p>
<p>“Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle Him in His talk.”</p>
<p>Then. When? When most of all they ought to have been moved to compunction, when
they should have been amazed at His love to man, when they should have feared the things
to come, when from the past they ought to have believed touching the future also. For indeed
the things that had been said cried aloud in actual fulfillment. I mean, that publicans and
harlots believed, and prophets and righteous men were slain, and from these things they
ought not to have gainsaid touching their own destruction, but even to believe and to be
sobered.</p>
<p>But nevertheless not even so do their wicked acts cease, but travail and proceed further.
And forasmuch as they could not lay hands on Him (for they feared the multitude), they
took another way with the intention of bringing Him into danger, and making Him guilty
of crimes against the state.</p>
<p>For “they sent out unto Him their disciples with the Herodians saying, Master, we know
that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man;
for thou regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful
to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?”2617</p>
<p>For they were now tributaries, their state having passed under the rule of the Romans.
Forasmuch then as they saw that Theudas and Judas2618with their companies for this cause
were put to death, as having prepared for a revolt, they were minded to bring Him too by
these words into such a suspicion. Therefore they sent both their own disciples, and Herod’s
soldiers, digging, as they thought, a precipice on either side, and in every direction setting
the snare, so that, whatever He should say, they might lay hold of it; and if He should answer
in favor of the Herodians, themselves might find fault with Him, but if in their favor, the
others should accuse Him. And yet He had given the didrachmas,2619but they knew not
that.</p>
<p>And in either way indeed they expected to lay hold of Him; but they desired rather that
He should say something against the Herodians. Wherefore they send their disciples also
to urge Him thereto by their presence, that they might deliver Him to the governor as an
usurper. For this Luke also intimates and shows, by saying, that they asked also in the
presence of the multitude, so that the testimony should be the stronger.</p>

<p>But the result was altogether opposite; for in a larger body of spectators they afforded
the demonstration of their folly.</p>
<p>And see their flattery, and their hidden craft. “We know,” their words are, “that Thou
art true.” How said ye then, “He is a deceiver,” and “deceiveth the people,” and “hath a
devil,” and “is not of God?”2620how a little while before did ye devise to slay Him?</p>
<p>But they are at everything, whatsoever their craft against Him may suggest. For since,
when a little before they had said in self will, “By what authority doest Thou these
things?”2621they did not meet with an answer to the question, they look to puff Him up by
their flattery, and to persuade Him to say something against the established laws, and opposed
to the prevailing government.</p>
<p>Wherefore also they testify the truth unto Him, confessing what was really so, nevertheless,
not with an upright mind, nor willingly; and add thereto, saying, “Thou carest not for
any man.” See how plainly they are desiring to urge Him to these sayings, that would make
Him both offend Herod, and incur the suspicion of being an usurper, as standing up against
the laws, so that they might punish Him, as a mover of sedition, and an usurper. For in
saying, “Thou carest not for any man,” and, “Thou regardest not the person of man,” they
were hinting at Herod and Cæsar.</p>
<p>“Tell us therefore, what thinkest Thou?” Now ye honor Him, and esteem Him a
Teacher, having despised and insulted Him oftentimes, when He was discoursing of the
things that concern your salvation. Whence also they are become confederates.</p>
<p>And see their craftiness. They say not, Tell us what is good, what is expedient, what is
lawful? but, “What thinkest Thou?” So much did they look to this one object, to betray Him,
and to set Him at enmity with the rulers. And Mark declaring this, and more plainly discovering
their self-will, and their murderous disposition, affirms them to have said, “Shall we
give Cæsar tribute, or shall we not give?”2622 So that they were breathing anger, and travailing
with a plot against Him, yet they feigned respect.</p>
<p>What then saith He? “Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?” Seest thou how He talks with
them with more than usual severity? For since their wickedness was now complete and
manifest, He cuts the deeper, first confounding and silencing them, by publishing their
secret thoughts, and making it manifest to all with what kind of intent they are coming unto
Him.</p>
<p>And these things He did, repulsing their wickedness, so that they might not suffer hurt
in attempting the same things again. And yet their words were full of much respect, for they
both called Him Master, and bore witness to His truth, and that He was no respecter of

persons; but being God, He was deceived by none of these things. Wherefore they also ought
to have conjectured, that the rebuke was not the result of conjecture, but a sign of His
knowing their secret thoughts.</p>
<p>2. He stopped not, however, at the rebuke, although it was enough merely to have convicted
them of their purpose, and to have put them to shame for their wickedness; but He
stoppeth not at this, but in another way closes their mouths; for, “Shew me,” saith He, “the
tribute money.” And when they had shown it, as He ever doth, by their tongue He brings
out the decision, and causes them to decide, that it is lawful; which was a clear and plain
victory. So that, when He asks, not from ignorance doth He ask, but because it is His will
to cause them to be bound by their own answers. For when, on being asked, “Whose is the
image?” they said, “Cæsar’s;” He saith, “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s.”2623
For this is not to give but to render, and this He shows both by the image, and by the superscription.</p>
<p>Then that they might not say, Thou art subjecting us to men, He added, “And unto God
the things that are God’s.” For it is possible both to fulfill to men their claims and to give
unto God the things that are due to God from us. Wherefore Paul also saith, “Render unto
all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom
fear.”2624</p>
<p>But thou, when thou hearest, “Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s,” know
that He is speaking only of those things, which are no detriment to godliness; since if it be
any such thing as this, such a thing is no longer Cæsar’s tribute, but the devil’s.</p>
<p>When they heard these things, their mouths were stopped, and they “marvelled” at His
wisdom. Ought they not then to have believed, ought they not to have been amazed. For
indeed, He gave them proof of His Godhead, by revealing the secrets of their hearts, and
with gentleness did He silence them.</p>
<p>What then? did they believe? By no means, but they “left Him, and went their way;”
and after them, “came to Him the Sadducees.”</p>
<p>O folly! When the others had been put to silence, these made the attack, when they
ought to have been the more backward. But such is the nature of rashness, shameless, and
importunate, and attempting things impossible. Therefore the evangelist also, amazed at
their folly, signified this very thing, by saying, “On that day came to Him.”2625 On that day.
On what day? In which He had convicted their craftiness, and put them to shame. But who

are these? A sect of the Jews dif ferent from the Pharisees, and much worse than they, who
said, “that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit.”2626 For these were some of a
grosser sort, and eager after the things of the body. For there were many sects even amongst
the Jews. Wherefore Paul also saith, “I am a Pharisee, of the strictest sect amongst us.”2627</p>
<p>And they say nothing indeed directly about a resurrection; but they feign a story, and
make up a case, which, as I suppose, never so much as had an existence; thinking to drive
Him to perplexity, and desiring to overthrow both things, both the existence of a resurrection,
and of such a resurrection.</p>
<p>And again, these too attack Him with a show of moderation, saying, “Master, Moses
said, If a man die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
unto his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married
a wife, deceased; and, having no issue,2628left his wife unto his brother. Likewise the second
also, and the third, unto the seventh. And last of all the woman died also. Therefore, in the
resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven?”2629</p>
<p>See Him answering these like a teacher. For though out of craft they came unto Him,
yet was their question rather one of ignorance. Therefore neither doth He say unto them,
“Ye hypocrites.”</p>
<p>Moreover, in order that He might not blame, saying, “Wherefore had seven one wife?”
they add the authority of Moses; although, as I have said before, it was a fiction, in my
judgment at least. For the third would not have taken her, when he saw the two bridegrooms
dead; or if the third, yet not the fourth or the fifth; and if even these, much more the sixth
or the seventh would not have come unto the woman, but have shrunk from her. For such
is the nature of the Jews. For if now many have this feeling, much more then had they; when
at least, even without this, they often avoided marrying in this way, and that when the law
was constraining them. Thus, at any rate, Ruth, that Moabitish woman, was thrust off to
him that was further off from her kindred; and Tamar too was thus compelled to obtain, by
stealth, seed from her husband’s kinsman.</p>
<p>And wherefore did they not feign two or three, but seven? In order the more abundantly
to bring derision, as they thought, upon the resurrection. Wherefore they further say, “they
all had her,” as driving Him into some difficulty.</p>
<p>What then saith Christ? He replies unto both, as taking His stand not against the words,
but the purpose, and on every occasion revealing the secrets of their hearts; and at one time
exposing them, at another time leaving the refutation of them that question Him to their

conscience. See, at any rate here, how He proves both points, as well that there will be a resurrection,
as that it will not be such a resurrection as they suspect.</p>
<p>For what saith He? “Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.”2630
For since, as if they knew them, they put forward Moses and the law, He shows that this
question is that of men very ignorant of the Scriptures. For hence also arose their tempting
Him, from their being ignorant of the Scriptures, and from their not knowing the power of
God as they ought.</p>
<p>“For what marvel then is it,” He saith, “if ye tempt me, who am as yet unknown to you,
when at least ye know not so much as the power of God, of which ye have had so much experience,
and neither from common sense nor from the Scriptures have become acquainted
with it;” if indeed even common sense causes us to know this, that to God all things are
possible. And in the first place He answers to the question asked. For since this was the
cause for their not believing a resurrection, that they think the order of things is like this,
He cures the cause, then the symptom also (for thence arose the disease too), and shows the
manner of the resurrection. “For in the resurrection,” saith He, “they neither marry, nor
are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in Heaven.”2631 But Luke saith, “As Sons of
God.”2632</p>
<p>If then they marry not, the question is vain. But not because they do not marry, therefore
are they angels, but because they are as angels, therefore they do not marry. By this He removed
many other difficulties also, all which things Paul intimated by one word, saying,
“For the fashion of this world passeth away.”2633</p>
<p>And by these words He declared how great a thing the resurrection is; and that moreover
there is a resurrection, He proves. And indeed this too was demonstrated at the same time
by what He had said, nevertheless over and above He adds again to His word by what He
saith now. For neither at their question only did He stop, but at their thought. Thus when
they are not dealing with great craft, but are asking in ignorance, He teaches even over and
above, but when it is of wickedness only, not even to their question doth He answer.</p>
<p>And again by Moses doth He stop their mouths, since they too had brought forward
Moses; and He saith, “But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read, I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the
dead, but of the living.”2634 Not of them that are not His meaning is, and that are utterly

blotted out, and are to rise no more. For He said not, I was, but, I am; of them that are, and
them that live. For like as Adam, although he lived on the day that he ate of the tree, died
in the sentence: even so also these, although they had died, lived in the promise of the resurrection.</p>
<p>How then doth He say elsewhere, “That He might be Lord both of the dead and of the
living?”2635 But this is not contrary to that. For here He speaks of the dead, who are also
themselves to live. And moreover too, “I am the God of Abraham,” is another thing from,
“That He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.” He knew of another death too,
concerning which He saith, “Let the dead bury their dead.”2636</p>
<p>“And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.”2637 Yet
not even here the Sadducees; but these go away defeated, while the impartial multitude reap
the benefit.</p>
<p>Since then the resurrection is like this, come let us do all things, that we may obtain the
first honors there. But, if ye will, let us show you some even before the resurrection here
pursuing and reaping these blessings, again having made our resort to the deserts. For again
will I enter upon the same discourse, since I see you listening with more pleasure.</p>
<p>Let us behold then to-day also the spiritual camps, let us behold their pleasure unalloyed
with fear. For not with spears are they encamped like the soldiers, for at this point I lately
ended my discourse, neither with shields and breastplates; but bare of all these wilt thou see
them, yet achieving such things, as not even with arms do they.</p>
<p>And if thou art able to observe, come and stretch forth thy hand to me, and let us go
unto this war, both of us, and let us see their battle array. For these too fight every day, and
slay their adversaries, and conquer all the lusts that are plotting against us; and thou wilt
see these cast out on the ground, and not able so much as to struggle, but proving by very
deed that saying of the apostle, “They that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections
and lusts.”2638</p>
<p>Seest thou a multitude of dead lying there, slain by the sword of the Spirit? Therefore
in that place is no drunkenness nor gluttony. And their table proves it, and the trophy that
is set thereon. For drunkenness and gluttony lie dead, put to the rout by the drinking of
water, though this be multiform, and a many-headed monster. For like as in the fabled Scylla
and Hydra, so in drunkenness may one see many heads, on one side fornication growing
up, on another wrath; on one hand sloth, on another lawless lusts; but all these things are
taken away. And yet all those other armies, though they get the better in ten thousand wars,

are taken captive by these; and neither arms, nor spears, nor whatever else there may be, is
able to stand against these phalanxes; but the very giants, the heroes, those that do countless
brave deeds, thou wilt find without bonds bound by sleep and drunkenness, without slaughter
or wounds lying like the wounded, or rather in more grievous case. For those at least struggle;
but these do not even this, but straightway give up.</p>
<p>Seest thou that this host is greater and more to be admired? For the enemies that got
the better of the others it destroys by its mere will. For they do so weaken the mother of all
their evils, that she cannot even trouble them any more; and the leader being overthrown,
and the head removed, the rest of the body also lies still.</p>
<p>And this victory one may see each of them, that abide there, achieving. For it is not as
in these wars of ours, where, if any enemy hath received a blow from one, he is no more
grievous to another, having been once overthrown; but it is necessary for all to smite this
monster; and he that hath not smitten and overthrown her, is surely troubled by her.</p>
<p>Seest thou a glorious victory? For such a trophy as the hosts in all parts of the world
having met together have not power to erect, this each one of those men erects; and all things
that from the army of drunkenness lie mingled together wounded, delirious words of frenzy,
insane thoughts, unpleasing haughtiness. And they imitate their own Lord, at whom the
Scripture marvelling saith, “He shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall He lift
up the head.”2639</p>
<p>Would ye see also another multitude of dead? Let us see the lusts that arise from luxurious
living, those that are cherished by the makers of sauces, by the cooks, the furnishers of feasts,
the confectioners. For I am ashamed indeed to speak of all; however, I will tell of the birds
from Phasis, the soups that are mixed from various things: the moist, the dry dishes, the
laws made about these things. For like as if ordering some city and marshalling hosts, even
so these too make laws, and ordain such a thing first, and such a thing second, and some
bring in first birds roasted on the embers, filled within with fish; and others make of other
material the beginnings of these unlawful feasts; and there is much rivalry about these things,
about quality, and about order, and about quantity; and they take a pride in the things, for
which they ought to bury themselves for shame; some saying that they have spent the half
of the day, some all of it, some that they have added the night too. Behold, O wretched man,
the measure of thy belly, and be ashamed of thy unmeasured earnestness!</p>
<p>But there is nothing like this amongst those angels; but all these desires also are dead.
For their meals are not unto fullness, and unto luxurious living, but unto necessity. No bird
hunters are there, no fishermen, but bread and water. But this confusion, and the disturbance,
and the turmoils, are all removed from thence, alike from the house and from the body, and
great is the haven, but amongst these great the tempest.</p>
<note type="footnote">2639 Ps. cx. 7.</note>

<pb n="748"/>
<p>Burst open now in thought the belly of them who feed on such things, and thou wilt
see the vast refuse, and the unclean channel, and the whited sepulchre.</p>
<p>But what come after these I am even ashamed to tell, the disagreeable eructations, the
vomitings, the discharges downwards and upwards.</p>
<p>But go and see even these desires dead there, and those more violent lusts that spring
from these; I mean, those of impurity. For these too thou wilt see all overthrown, with their
horses, with their beasts of burden. For the beast of burden, and the weapon, and the horse
of a filthy deed, is a filthy word. But thou wilt see such like horse and rider together, and
their weapons thrown down; but here quite the contrary, and souls cast down dead. But not
at their meal only is the victory of these holy men glorious, but in the other things also, in
money, in glory, in envy, in all diseases of the soul.</p>
<p>Surely does not this host seem to thee mightier than that, and the meal better? Nay, who
will gainsay it? None, not even of those persons themselves, though he be very mad. For
this guides us on to Heaven, that drags to hell; this the devil lays out, that Christ; for this
luxury gives laws, and intemperance, for that self-denial and sobriety, here Christ is present,
there the devil. For where there is drunkenness, the devil is there; where there are filthy
words, where there is surfeiting, there the devils hold their choirs. Such a table had that rich
man, therefore not even of a drop of water was he master.</p>
<p>But these have not such a table, but they already practise the ways of the angels. They
marry not, they are not given in marriage, neither do they sleep excessively, nor live luxuriously,
but except a few things they are even bodiless.</p>
<p>Now who is there that so easily overcomes his enemies as he that sets up a trophy while
at his dinner? Therefore also the prophet saith, “Thou hast prepared a table before me, in
the presence of them that trouble me.”2640 One could not be wrong in repeating this oracle
about this table. For nothing so troubles a soul as disorderly concupiscence, and luxury,
and drunkenness, and the evils that spring from these; and this they know full well who
have had experience thereof.</p>
<p>And if thou wast to learn also, whence this table is procured, and whence that; then
thou wouldest see well the difference between each. Whence then is this procured. From
countless tears, from widows defrauded, from orphans despoiled; but the other from honest
labor. And this table is like to a fair and well-favored woman, needing nothing external, but
having her beauty from nature; but that to some ugly and ill-favored harlot, wearing much
paint, but not able to disguise her deformity, but the nearer she is, the more convicted. For
this too, when it is nearer to him that is at it, then shows its ugliness more. For look not I
tell thee, at the banqueters, as they come only, but also as they go away, and then thou wilt
see its ugliness. For that, as being free, suffers them that come unto it to say nothing
<note type="footnote">2640 Ps. xxiii. 5. [LXX.]</note>

<pb n="749"/>
shameful; but this nothing seemly, as being a harlot, and dishonored. This seeks the profit
of him that is at it, that the hurt. And one permits not to offend God, the other permits not
but that we must offend Him.</p>
<p>Let us go away therefore unto those men. Thence we shall learn with how many bonds
we are encompassed. Thence shall we learn to set before ourselves a table full of countless
blessings, most sweet, without cost, delivered from care, free from envy and jeal ousy and
every disease, and full of good hope, and having its many trophies. No turmoil of soul there,
no sorrow, no wrath; all is calm, all is peace.</p>
<p>For tell me not of the silence of them that serve in the houses of the rich, but of the
clamor of them that dine; I mean, not that which they make one to another (for this too is
worthy of derision), but that within, that in the soul, that brings on them a great captivity,
the tumults of the thoughts, the sleet, the darkness, the tempest, by which all things are
mingled and confused, and are like to some night battle. But not in the monks’ tents are
such things as these; but great is the calm, great the quietness. And that table is succeeded
by a sleep that is like death, but this by sobriety and wakefulness; that by punishment, this
by the kingdom of heaven, and the immortal rewards.</p>
<p>This then let us follow, that we may enjoy also the fruits thereof; unto which God grant
we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be
glory and might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXII. 34-36.</p>
<p>“But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered
together; and one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, and
saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?”</p>
<p>Again doth the evangelist express the cause, for which they ought to have held their
peace, and marks their boldness by this also. How and in what way? Because when those
others were put to silence, these again assail Him. For when they ought even for this to hold
their peace, they strive to urge further their former endeavors,2641and put forward the lawyer,
not desiring to learn, but making a trial of Him, and ask, “What is the first commandment?”</p>
<p>For since the first commandment was this, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,” thinking
that He would afford them some handle, as though He would amend it, for the sake of
showing that Himself too was God, they propose the question. What then saith Christ? Indicating
from what they were led to this; from having no charity, from pining with envy,
from being seized by jealousy, He saith, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God. This is the first
and great commandment.2642 And the second is like unto this,2643 Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.”2644</p>
<p>But wherefore “like unto this?” Because this makes the way for that, and by it is again
established; “For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light;”2645and again, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” And what in consequence
of this? “They are corrupt, and become abominable in their ways.”2646 And again,
“The love of money is the root of all evils; which while some coveted after they have erred
from the faith;”2647and, “He that loveth me, will keep my commandment.”2648</p>
<p>But His commandments, and the sum of them, are, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,
and thy neighbor as thyself.” If therefore to love God is to love one’s neighbor, “For if thou
lovest me,” He saith, “O Peter, feed my sheep,”2649but to love one’s neighbor worketh a

the second also, which is not much inferior to that (for though second, it is like that), intimating
to them, whence the question had arisen, that it was from hatred. “For charity envieth
not.”2651 By this He shows Himself to be submissive both to the law and to the prophets.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth Matthew say that he asked, tempting Him, but Mark the contrary?
“For when Jesus,” he saith, “saw that he answered discreetly, He said unto him, Thou art
not far from the kingdom of God.”2652</p>
<p>They are not contradicting each other, but indeed fully agreeing. For he asked indeed,
tempting, at the beginning, but being benefitted by the answer, was commended. For not
at the beginning did He commend him, but when he had said, “That to love his neighbor
is more than whole burnt sacrifices,” then He saith, “Thou art not far from the kingdom;”
because he overlooked low things, and embraced the first principle of virtue. For indeed all
those are for the sake of this, as well the Sabbath as the rest.</p>
<p>And not even so did He make His commendation perfect, but yet deficient. For His
saying, “Thou art not far off,” indicates that he is yet falling short, that he might seek after
what was deficient.</p>
<p>But if, when He said, “There is one God, and there is none other but He,” He commended
him, wonder not, but by this too observe, how He answers according to the opinion of them
that come unto Him. For although men say ten thousand things about Christ unworthy of
His glory, yet this at any rate they will not dare to say, that He is not God at all. Wherefore
then doth He praise him that said, that beside the Father, there is no other God?</p>
<p>Not excepting Himself from being God; away with the thought; but since it was not yet
time to disclose His Godhead, He suffers him to remain in the former doctrine, and praises
him for knowing well the ancient principles, so as to make him fit for the doctrine of the
New Testament, which He is bringing in its season.</p>
<p>And besides, the saying, “There is one God, and there is none other but He,” both in
the Old Testament and everywhere, is spoken not to the rejection of the Son, but to make
the distinction from idols. So that when praising this man also, who had thus spoken, He
praises him in this mind.</p>

<pb n="752"/>
<p>Then since He had answered, He asks also in turn, “What think ye of Christ, whose Son
is He? They say unto Him, The Son of David.”2653</p>
<p>See after how many miracles, after how many signs, after how many questions, after
how great a display of His unanimity with the Father, as well in words, as in deeds; after
having praised this man that said, that there is one God, He asks the question, that they may
not be able to say, that He did miracles indeed, yet was an adversary to the law, and a foe to
God.</p>
<p>Therefore, after so many things, He asks these questions, secretly leading them on to
confess Him also to be God. And the disciples He asked first what the others say, and then
themselves; but these not so; for surely they would have said a deceiver, and a wicked one,
as speaking all things without fear. So for this cause He inquires for the opinion of these
men themselves.</p>
<p>For since He was now about to go on to His passion, He sees forth the prophecy that
plainly proclaims Him to be Lord; and not as having come to do this without occasion, nor
as having made this His aim, but from a reasonable cause.</p>
<p>For having asked them first, since they answered not the truth concerning Him (for
they said He was a mere man), to overthrow their mistaken opinion, He thus introduces
David proclaiming His Godhead. For they indeed supposed that He was a mere man,
wherefore also they said, “the Son of David;”2654but He to correct this brings in the prophet
witnessing to His being Lord, and the genuineness of His Sonship, and His equality in
honor with His Father.</p>
<p>And not even at this doth He stop, but in order to move them to fear, He adds what
followeth also, saying, “Till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool;”2655that at least in this
way He might gain them over.</p>
<p>And that they may not say, that it was in flattery he so called Him, and that this was a
human judgment, see what He saith, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?” See
how submissively He introduces the sentence and judgment concerning Himself. First, He
had said, “What think ye? Whose Son is He?” so by a question to bring them to an answer.
Then since they said, “the Son of David,” He said not, “And yet David saith these things,”
<note type="footnote">2653 Matt. xxii. 42. [R.V., “the Christ.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2654 It may be in this view that it is said of St. Paul, immediately on his conversion, that “he preached Christ
in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.” Acts ix. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">2655 Matt. xxii. 43. [The form is that of the received text. R.V., following strongly preponderant authority,
“underneath thy feet.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="753"/>
but again in this order of a question, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?” in
order that the sayings might not give offense to them. Wherefore neither did He say, What
think ye of me, but of Christ. For this reason the apostles also reasoned submissively, saying,
“Let us speak freely of the Patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried.”2656</p>
<p>And He Himself too in like manner for this cause introduces the doctrine in the way of
question and inference, saying, “How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy footstool;”
2657and again, “If David then call Him Lord, how is He then his Son,”2658not taking
away the fact that He is his Son, away with the thought; for He would not then have reproved
Peter for this,2659but to correct their secret thoughts. So that when He saith, “How is He
his Son?” He meaneth this, not so as ye say. For they said, that He is Son only, and not also
Lord. And this after the testimony, and then submissively, “If David then call Him Lord,
how is He his Son?”</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, even when they had heard these things, they answered nothing, for
neither did they wish to learn any of the things that were needful. Wherefore He Himself
addeth and saith, that “He is his Lord.” Or rather not even this very thing doth He say
without support, but having taken the prophet with Him, because of His being exceedingly
distrusted by them, and evil reported of amongst them. To which fact we ought to have especial
regard, and if anything be said by Him that is lowly and submissive, not to be offended,
for the cause is this, with many other things also, that He talks with them in condescension.</p>
<p>Wherefore now also He delivers His doctrine in the manner of question and answer;
but He darkly intimates even in this way His dignity. For it was not as much to be called
Lord of the Jews, as of David.</p>
<p>But mark thou also, I pray thee, how seasonable it is. For when He had said, “There is
one Lord,” then He spake of Himself that He is Lord, and showed it by prophecy, no more
by His works only. And He showeth the Father Himself taking vengeance upon them in His
behalf, for He saith, “Until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,” and great unanimity even
hereby on the part of Him that begat Him towards Himself, and honor. And upon His
reasonings with them He doth set this end high and great, and sufficient to close fast their
mouths.</p>
<p>For they were silent from thenceforth, not willingly, but from their having nothing to
say; and they received so deadly a blow, as no longer to dare to attempt the same things any
more. For, “no one,” it is said, “durst from that day forth ask Him any more questions.”2660</p>

<pb n="754"/>
<p>And this was no little advantage to the multitude.2661 Therefore also unto them doth
He henceforth direct His word, having removed the wolves, and having repulsed their plots.</p>
<p>For those men gained nothing, taken captive by vainglory, and having fallen upon this
terrible passion. For terrible is this passion and many-headed, for some set their heart upon
power for the sake of this, some on wealth, some on strength. But proceeding in order it
goes on unto almsgiving also, and fasting, and prayers, and teaching, and many are the heads
of this monster.</p>
<p>But to be vainglorious indeed about those other things is nothing wonderful; but to be
so about fasting and prayer, this is strange and lamentable.</p>
<p>But that we may not again blame only, come and let us tell the means, by which we shall
avoid this. Against whom shall we prepare to contend first, against those that are vainglorious
of money, or those of dress, or those of places of power, or those of sciences, or those of art,
or those of their person, or those of beauty, or those of ornaments, or those of cruelty, or
those of humanity and almsgiving, or those of wickedness, or those of death, or those after
death? For indeed, as I have said, this passion hath many links,2662and goes on beyond our
life. For such a one, it is said, is dead, and that he may be held in admiration, hath charged
that such and such things be done; and therefore such a one is poor, such a one rich.</p>
<p>For the grievous thing is this, that even of opposite things is it made up.</p>
<p>Against whom then shall we stand, and let ourselves in array first? For one and the same
discourse suffices not against all. Will ye then that it be against them that are vainglorious
about almsgiving?</p>
<p>To me at least it seems well; for exceedingly do I love this thing, and am pained at seeing
it marred, and vainglory plotting against it, like a pandering nurse against some royal
damsel. For she feeds her in deed, but for disgrace and mischief, prostituting her and
commanding her to despise her father; but to deck herself to please unholy and often
despicable men; and invests her with such a dress, as strangers wish, disgraceful, and dishonorable,
not such as the father.</p>
<p>Come now, then, let us take our aim against these; and let there be an almsgiving made
in abundance for display to the multitude. Surely then, first vainglory leads her out of her
Father’s chamber. And whereas her Father requires not to appear so much as to the left
hand,2663she displays her to the slaves, and to the vulgar, that have not even known her.</p>

<pb n="755"/>
<p>Seest thou a harlot, and pander, casting her into the love of foolish men, that according
as they require, so she may order herself? Dost thou desire to see how it renders such a soul
not a harlot only, but insane also?</p>
<p>Mark then her mind. For when she lets go heaven and runs after fugitives and menial
slaves, pursuing through streets and lanes them that hate her, the ugly and deformed, them
that are not willing so much as to look at her, them that, when she burns with love towards
them, hate her, what can be more insane than this? For no one do the multitude hate so
much, as those that want the glory they have to bestow. Countless accusations at least do
they frame against them, and the result is the same, as if any one were to bring down a virgin
daughter of the king from the royal throne, and to require her to prostitute herself to gladiators,
who abhorred her. These then, as much as thou pursuest them, so much do they turn
away from thee; but God, if thou seek the glory that cometh from Him, so much the more
both draws thee unto Himself, and commends thee, and great is the reward He renders
unto thee.</p>
<p>But if thou art minded in another way also to discern the mischief thereof, when thou
givest for display and ostentation, consider how great the sorrow that then comes upon
thee, and how continual the desponding, while Christ’s voice is heard in thine ears, saying,
2664“Thou hast lost all thy reward.” For in every matter indeed vainglory is a bad thing,
yet most of all in beneficence, for it is the utmost cruelty, making a show of the calamities
of others, and all but upbraiding those in poverty. For if to mention one’s own good actions
is to upbraid, what dost thou think it is to publish them even to many others.</p>
<p>How then shall we escape the danger? If we learn how to give alms, if we see after whose
good report we are to seek. For tell me, who has the skill of almsgiving? Plainly, it is God,
who hath made known the thing, who best of all knows it, and practises it without limit.
What then? If thou art learning to be a wrestler, to whom dost thou look? or to whom dost
thou display thy doings in the wrestling school, to the seller of herbs, and of fish, or to the
trainer? And yet they are many, and he is one. What then, if while he admires thee, others
deride thee, wilt thou not with him deride them?</p>
<p>What, if thou art learning to box, wilt thou not look in like manner to him who knows
how to teach this? And if thou art practising oratory, wilt thou not accept the praise of the
teacher of rhetoric, and despise the rest.</p>
<p>How then is it other than absurd, in other arts to look to the teacher only, but here to
do the contrary? although the loss be not equal. For there, if you wrestle according to the
opinion of the multitude, and not that of the teacher, the loss is in the wrestling; but here it
is in eternal life. Thou art become like to God in giving alms; be thou then like Him in not
making a display. For even He said, when healing, that they should tell no man.</p>
<note type="footnote">2664 Matt. vi. 1.</note>

<pb n="756"/>
<p>But dost thou desire to be called merciful amongst men? And what is the gain? The gain
is nothing; but the loss infinite. For these very persons, whom thou callest to be witnesses,
become robbers of thy treasures that are in the heavens; or rather not these, but ourselves,
who spoil our own possessions, and scatter what we have laid up above.</p>
<p>O new calamity! this strange passion. Where moth corrupteth not, nor thief breaketh
through, vainglory scattereth. This is the moth of those treasures there; this the thief of our
wealth in heaven; this steals away the riches that cannot be spoiled; this mars and corrupts
all. For because the devil saw that that place is impregnable to thieves and to the worm, and
the other plots against them, he by vainglory steals away the wealth.</p>
<p>But dost thou desire glory? Doth not then that suffice thee which is given by the receiver
himself, that from our gracious God, but dost thou set thine heart on that from men also?
Take heed, lest thou undergo the contrary, lest some condemn thee as not showing mercy,
but making a display, and seeking honor, as making a show of the calamities of others.</p>
<p>For indeed the showing of mercy is a mystery. Shut therefore the doors, that none may
see what it is not pious to display. For our mysteries too are above all things, a showing of
God’s mercy and loving-kindness. According to His great mercy, He had mercy on us being
disobedient.</p>
<p>And the first prayer too is full of mercy, when we entreat for the energumens; and the
second again, for others under penance seeking for much mercy; and the third also for
ourselves, and this puts forward the innocent children of the people entreating God for
mercy. For since we condemn ourselves for sins, for them that have sinned much and deserve
to be blamed we ourselves cry; but for ourselves the children; for the imitators of whose
simplicity the kingdom of heaven is reserved. For this image shows this, that they who are
like those children, lowly and simple, these above all men are able to deliver the guilty by
their prayers.</p>
<p>But the mystery itself, of how much mercy, of how much love to man it is full, the initiated
know.</p>
<p>Do thou then, when according to thy power thou art showing mercy to a man, shut the
doors, let the object of thy mercy see it only; but if it be possible, not even he. But if thou
set them open, thou art profanely exposing thy mystery.</p>
<p>Consider that the very person, whose praise thou seekest, even himself will condemn
thee; and if he be a friend, will accuse thee to himself; but if an enemy, he will deride thee
unto others also. And thou wilt undergo the opposite of what thou desirest. For thou indeed
desirest that he should call thee the merciful man; but he will not call thee this, but the
vainglorious, the man-pleaser, and other names far more grievous than these.</p>
<p>But if thou shouldest hide it, he will call thee all that is opposite to this; the merciful,
the kind. For God suffers it not to be hidden; but if thou conceal it, the other will make it
known, and greater will be the admiration, and more abundant the gain. So that even for

<pb n="757"/>
this very object of being glorified, to make a display is against us; for with respect to the
thing unto which we most hasten and press, as to this most especially is this thing against
us. For so far from obtaining the credit of being merciful, we obtain even the contrary, and
besides this, great is the loss we undergo.</p>
<p>For every motive then let us abstain from this, and set our love on God’s praise alone.
For thus shall we both attain to honor here, and enjoy the eternal blessings, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world without
end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXIII. 1-3.</p>
<p>“Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to His disciples, saying, The Scribes and the Pharisees
sit in Moses’ seat: all therefore whatsoever they bid you do, that do;2665but do not after
their works.”</p>
<p>Then. When? When He had said these things, when He had stopped their mouths; when
He had brought them that they should no more dare to tempt Him; when He had shown
their state incurable.</p>
<p>And since He had made mention of “the Lord” and “my Lord,”2666 He recurs again to
the law. And yet the law said nothing of this kind, but, “The Lord thy God is one Lord.”2667
But Scripture calls the whole Old Testament the law.</p>
<p>But these things He saith, showing by all things His full agreement with Him that begat
Him. For if He were opposed, He would have said the opposite about the law; but now He
commands so great reverence to be shown towards it, that, even when they that teach it are
depraved, He charges them to hold to it.</p>
<p>But here He is discoursing about their life and morals, since this was chiefly the cause
of their unbelief, their depraved life, and the love of glory. To amend therefore His hearers;
that which in the first place most contributes to salvation, not to despise our teachers, neither
to rise up against our priests, this doth He command with superabundant earnestness. But
He does not only command it, but also Himself doth it. For though they were depraved, He
doth not depose them from their dignity; to them rendering their condemnation heavier,
and to His disciples leaving no cloke for disobedience.</p>
<p>I mean, that lest any one should say, that because my teacher is bad, therefore am I become
more remiss, He takes away even this pretext. So much at any rate did He establish
their authority, although they were wicked men, as even after so heavy an accusation to say,
“All whatsoever they command you to do, do.” For they speak not their own words, but
God’s, what He appointed for laws by Moses. And mark how much honor He showed towards
Moses, again showing His agreement with the Old Testament; since indeed even by this
doth He make them objects of reverence. “For they sit,” He saith, “on Moses’ seat.” For because
He was not able to make them out worthy of credit by their life, He doth it from the
<note type="footnote">2665 [The Greek text in this clause differs somewhat both from the received and from that followed in the
R.V.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2666 [κυρου κα κυρου, referring to the two uses of the word in the Old Testament passage cited in Matt. xxii.
44, but not in precise terms.—R.]</note>

<pb n="759"/>
grounds that were open to Him, from their seat, and their succession from him. But when
thou hearest all, do not understand all the law, as, for instance, the ordinances about meats,
those about sacrifices, and the like; for how was He to say so of these things, which He had
taken away beforehand? but He meant all things that correct the moral principle, and amend
the disposition, and agree with the laws of the New Testament, and suffer them not any
more to be under the yoke of the law.</p>
<p>Wherefore then doth He give these things divine authority, not from the law of grace,
but from Moses? Because it was not yet time, before the crucifixion, for these things to be
plainly declared.</p>
<p>But to me He seems, in addition to what has been said, to be providing for another object,
in saying these things. For since He was on the point of accusing them, that He might not
seem in the sight of the foolish to set His heart on this authority of theirs, or for enmity to
be doing these things, first He removed this thought, and having set himself clear from
suspicion, then begins His accusation. And for what intent doth He convict them, and run
out into a long discourse against them? To set the multitude on their guard, so that they
might not fall into the same sins. For neither is dissuading like pointing out those that have
offended; much as recommending what is right, is not like bringing forward those that have
done well. For this cause also He is beforehand in saying, “Do not after their works.” For,
lest they should suppose, because of their listening to them, they ought also to imitate them,
He uses this means of correction, and makes what seems to be their dignity a charge against
them. For what can be more wretched than a teacher, when the preservation of his disciples
is, not to give heed to his life? So that what seemeth to be their dignity is a most heavy charge
against them, when they are shown to live such a life, as they that imitate are ruined.</p>
<p>For this cause He also falls upon His accusations against them, but not for this only,
but that He might show, that both their former unbelief wherewith they had not believed,
and the crucifixion after this, which they dared to perpetrate, were not a charge against Him
who was crucified and disbelieved, but against their perverseness.</p>
<p>But see whence He begins, and whence He aggravates His blame of them. “For they
say,” He saith, “and do not.” For every one is worthy of blame in transgressing the law, but
especially he that bears the authority of teaching, for doubly and triply doth he deserve to
be condemned. For one cause, because he transgresses; for another, that as he ought to
amend others, and then halteth, he is worthy of a double punishment, because of his dignity;
and in the third place, that he even corrupts the more, as committing such transgression in
a teacher’s place.</p>
<p>And together with these He mentions also another charge against them, that they are
harsh to those accountable to them.</p>

<pb n="760"/>
<p>“For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s
shoulders, but they will not move them with their finger.”2668 He mentions here a twofold
wickedness, their requiring great and extreme strictness of life, without any indulgence,
from those over whom they rule, and their allowing to themselves great security; the opposite
to which the truly good ruler ought to hold; in what concerns himself, to be an unpardoning
and severe judge, but in the matters of those whom he rules, to be gentle and ready to make
allowances; the contrary to which was the conduct of these men.</p>
<p>2. For such are all they who practise self restraint in mere words, unpardoning and
grievous to bear as having no experience of the difficulty in actions. And this itself too is
no small fault, and in no ordinary way increases the former charge.</p>
<p>But do thou mark, I pray thee, how He aggravates this accusation also. For He did not
say, “they cannot,” but, “they will not.” And He did not say, “to bear,” but, “to move with a
finger,” that is, not even to come near them, nor to touch them.</p>
<p>But wherein are they earnest, and vigorous? In the things forbidden. For, “all their works
they do,” He saith, “to be seen of men.”2669 These things He saith, accusing them in respect
of vainglory, which kind of thing was their ruin. For the things before were signs of harshness
and remissness, but these of the mad desire of glory. This drew them off from God, this
caused them to strive before other spectators, and ruined them. For whatever kind of spectators
any one may have, since it hath become his study to please these, such also are the
contests he exhibits. And he that wrestles among the noble, such also are the conflicts he
takes in hand, but he among the cold and supine, himself also becomes more remiss. For
instance, hath any one a beholder that delights in ridicule? he himself too becomes a mover
of ridicule, that he may delight the spectator: hath another one who is earnest minded, and
practises self-government? he endeavors himself to be such as he is, since such is the disposition
of him who praises him.</p>
<p>But see again that here too the charge is with aggravation. For neither is it that they do
some things in this way, some in another way, but all things absolutely this way.</p>
<p>Then, having blamed them for vainglory, He shows that it is not even about great and
necessary things they are vainglorious (for neither had they these, but were destitute of good
works), but for things without warmth or worth, and such as were certain proofs of their
baseness, the phylacteries, the borders; of their garments. “For they make broad their
phylacteries,” He saith, “and enlarge the borders of their garments.”2670</p>
<p>And what are these phylacteries, and these borders? Since they were continually forgetting
God’s benefits, He commanded His marvellous works to be inscribed on little tablets, and
<note type="footnote">2668 Matt. xxiii. 4. [“For,” as in rec. text.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2669 Matt. xxiii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">2670 Matt. xxiii. 5.</note>

<pb n="761"/>
that these should be suspended from their hands (wherefore also He said, “They shall be
immoveable in thine eyes”),2671which they called phylacteries; as many of our women now
wear Gospels hung from their necks. And in order that by another thing again they may be
reminded, like as many often do, binding round their finger with a piece of linen or a thread,
as being likely to forget, this God enjoined them as children to do, “to sew a ribbon of blue
on their garments, upon the fringe that hung round their feet, that they might look at it,
and remember the commandments;”2672and they were called “borders.”</p>
<p>In these things then they were diligent, making wide the strips of the tablets, and enlarging
the borders of their garments; which was a sign of the most extreme vanity. For
wherefore art thou vainglorious, and dost make these wide? what, is this thy good work?
what doth it profit thee at all, if thou gain not the good results from them. For God seeks
not the enlarging of these and making them wide, but our remembering His benefits. But
if for almsgiving and prayer, although they be attended with labor, and be good deeds on
our parts, we must not seek vainglory, how dost thou, O Jew, pride thyself in these things,
which most of all convict thy remissness.</p>
<p>But they not in these only, but in other little things, suffered from this disease.</p>
<p>For, “they love,” He saith, “the uppermost rooms2673at feasts, and the chief seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi.”2674 For these
things, although one may think them small, yet are they a cause of great evils. These things
have overthrown both cities and churches.</p>
<p>And it comes upon me now even to weep, when I hear of the first seats, and the greetings,
and consider how many ills were hence engendered to the churches of God, which it is not
necessary to publish to you now; nay rather as many as are aged men do not even need to
learn these things from us.2675</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how vainglory prevailed; when they were commanded not
to be vainglorious, even in the synagogues, where they had entered to discipline others.</p>
<p>For to have this feeling at feasts, to howsoever great a degree, doth not seem to be so

distinguished from the brutes; so also ought the teacher, both speaking and holding his
peace, and dining, and doing whatever it may be, to be distinguished as well by his gait, as
by his look, and by his garb, and by all things generally. But they were on every account
objects of ridicule, and in every respect disgraced themselves, making it their study to follow
what they ought to flee. For they love them, it is said; but if the loving them be a matter of
blame, what a thing must the doing them be; and to hunt and strive after them, how great
an evil.</p>
<p>3. The other things then He carried no further than to accuse them, as being small and
trifling, and as though His disciples needed not at all to be corrected about these matters;
but what was a cause of all the evils, even ambition, and the violent seizing of the teacher’s
chair, this He brings forward, and corrects with diligence, touching this vehemently and
earnestly charging them.</p>
<p>For what saith He? “But be not ye called Rabbi.” Then follows the cause also; “For one
is your master, and all ye are brethren;”2676and one hath nothing more than another, in
respect of his knowing nothing from himself. Wherefore Paul also saith, “For who is Paul,
and who is Apollos, but ministers?”2677 He said not masters. And again, “Call not, father,”
2678not that they should not call, but they may know whom they ought to call Father,
in the highest sense. For like as the master is not a master principally; so neither is the
father. For He is cause of all, both of the masters, and of the fathers.</p>
<p>And again He adds, “Neither be ye called guides, for one is your guide, even
Christ;”2679and He said not, I. For like as above He said, “What think ye of Christ?”2680and
He said not, “of me,” so here too.</p>
<p>But I should be glad to ask here, what they would say, who are repeatedly applying the
term one, one, to the Father alone, to the rejection of the Only-begotten. Is the Father guide?
All would declare it, and none would gainsay it. And yet “one,” He saith, “is your guide,
even Christ.” For like as Christ, being called the one guide, casts not out the Father from
being guide; even so the Father, being called Master, doth not cast out the Son from being
Master. For the expression, one, one, is spoken in contradistinction to men, and the rest of
the creation.</p>
<p>Having warned them therefore against this grievous pest, and amended them, He instructs
also how they may escape it; by humility. Wherefore He adds also, “He that is greatest

among you shall be your servant. For whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and
whosoever shall abase himself shall be exalted.”2681</p>
<p>For nothing is equal to the practice of modesty, wherefore He is continually reminding
them of this virtue, both when He brought the children into the midst, and now. And, when
on the mount, beginning the beatitudes, He began from hence. And in this place, He plucks
it up by the roots hereby, saying, “He that abaseth himself shall be exalted.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how He draws off the hearer right over to the contrary thing. For not only
doth He forbid him to set his heart upon the first place, but requires him to follow after the
last. For so shalt thou obtain thy desire, He saith. Wherefore he that pursues his desire for
the first, must follow after the last place. “For he that abaseth himself shall be exalted.”</p>
<p>And where shall we find this humility? Will ye that we go again to the city of virtue, the
tents of the holy men, the mountains, I mean, and the groves? For there too shall we see this
height of humility.</p>
<p>For men, some illustrious from their rank in the world, some from their wealth, in every
way put themselves down, by their vesture, by their dwelling, by those to whom they minister;
and, as in written characters, they throughout all things inscribe humility.</p>
<p>And the things that are incentives of arrogance, as to dress well, and to build houses
splendidly, and to have many servants, things which often drive men even against their will
to arrogance; these are all taken away. For they themselves light their fire, they themselves
cleave the logs, themselves cook, themselves minister to those that come there.</p>
<p>No one can be heard insulting there, nor seen insulted, nor commanded, nor giving
commands; but all are devoted to those that are waited on, and every one washes the
strangers’ feet, and there is much contention about this. And he doeth it, not inquiring who
it is, neither if he be a slave, nor if he be free; but in the case of every one fulfills this service.
No man there is great nor mean. What then? Is there confusion? Far from it, but the highest
order. For if any one be mean, he that is great seeth not this, but hath accounted himself
again to be inferior even to him, and so becomes great.</p>
<p>There is one table for all, both for them that are served, and for them that serve; the
same food, the same clothes, the same dwellings, the same manner of life. He is great there,
who eagerly seizes the mean task. There is not mine and thine, but this expression is exterminated,
that is a cause of countless wars.</p>
<p>4. And why dost thou marvel, if there be one manner of life and table and dress for all,
since indeed there is even one soul to all, not in substance only (for this is with all men also),
but in love? how then should it ever be lifted up itself against itself? There is no wealth and
poverty there, honor and dishonor; how then should haughtiness and arrogance find an
entrance? For they are indeed little and great in respect of their virtue; but, as I have said,
<note type="footnote">2681 Matt. xxiii. 11, 12. [R.V., “humbled,” and “humble.” The A.V. here uses both “abase” and “humble.”—R.]</note>

<pb n="764"/>
no one seeth this. He that is little, feels not pain, as despised; for neither is there any one to
despise him; and should any one spurn him, this above all are they taught, to be despised,
to be spurned, to be set at nought, in word and in deed. And with the poor and maimed do
they associate, and their tables are full of these guests; so that for this are they worthy of the
heavens. And one tends the wounds of the mutilated, another leads the blind by the hand,
a third bears him that is lamed of his leg.</p>
<p>There is no multitude of flatterers or parasites there; or rather they know not even what
flattery is; whence then could they be lifted up at any time? For there is great equality amongst
them, wherefore also there is much facility for virtue.</p>
<p>For by these are they of an inferior sort better instructed, than if they were compelled
to give up the first place to them.</p>
<p>For like as the impetuous man derives instruction from him that is smitten, and submits
to it; so the ambitious from him that claims not glory, but despises it. This they do there
abundantly, and as the strife is great with us to obtain the first place, so great is it with them
not to obtain it, but utterly to refuse it; and great is their earnest desire who shall have the
advantage in honoring, not in being honored.</p>
<p>And besides, even their very employments persuade them to practise moderation, and
not to be high-swollen. For who, I pray thee, digging in the earth, and watering, and planting,
or making baskets, or weaving sackcloth, or practising any other handy works, will ever be
proud? Who dwelling in poverty and wrestling with hunger, will ever be sick of this disease?</p>
<p>There is not one. Therefore humility is easy to them. And like as here, it is a hard thing to
be lowly minded, for the multitude of them who applaud and admire us, so there it is exceedingly
easy.</p>
<p>And that man gives heed only to the wilderness, and sees birds flying, and trees waving,
and a breeze blowing, and streams rushing through glens. Whence then should he be lifted
up who dwells in solitude so great?</p>
<p>Not however that therefore we have from this an excuse, in that we are proud when
living in the midst of men. For surely Abraham, when amidst Canaanites, said, “I am but
dust and ashes;”2682and David, when in the midst of camps,2683“I am a worm, and no
man;”2684and the apostle, in the midst of the world, “I am not meet to be called an
apostle.”2685 What comfort shall we have then; what plea, when even, having such great
examples, we do not practise moderation? For even as they are worthy of countless crowns,

having been the first that went the way of virtue, even so are we deserving of countless
punishments, who not even after those that are departed, and are set before us in books, no
nor even after these that are living, and held in admiration through their deeds, are drawn
on to the like emulation.</p>
<p>For what couldest thou say, for not being amended? Art thou ignorant of letters, and
hast not looked into the Scriptures that thou mightest learn the virtues of them of old? To
say the truth, this is itself blameworthy, when the church is constantly standing open, not
to enter in, and partake of those sacred streams.</p>
<p>However, although thou know not the departed by the Scriptures, these living men thou
oughtest to see. But is there no one to lead thee? Come to me, and I will show thee the places
of refuge of these holy men; come and learn thou of them something useful. Shining lamps
are these in every part of the earth; as walls are they set about the cities. For this cause have
they occupied the deserts, that they may instruct thee to despise the tumults in the midst of
the world.</p>
<p>For they, as being strong, are able even in the midst of the raging of the waters to enjoy
a calm; but thou, who art leaky on every side, hast need of tranquility, and to take breath a
little, after the successive waves. Go then there continually, that, having purged away the
abiding stain by their prayers and admonitions, thou mayest both pass in the best manner
the present life, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, be unto the Father, together with the
Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXIII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXIII. 14.</p>
<p>“Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a
pretense make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater damnation.”2686</p>
<p>After this, next He derides them for gluttony: and the grievous thing was, that not from
rich men’s goods, but from the poor they indulged their own belly, and aggravated their
poverty, which they should have relieved. For neither did they merely eat, but devoured.</p>
<p>Moreover also the manner of their overreaching was yet more grievous, “for a pretense
making long prayers.”
For every one is worthy of vengeance who doeth any evil thing; but he that is deriving
even the reason for so doing from godliness, and is using this cloke for his wickedness, is
justly liable to a far more grievous punishment. And wherefore did He not depose them?
Because the time suffered it not as yet. So therefore He lets them alone for a time, but by
His sayings, He secures that the people be not deceived, lest, through the dignity of those
men, they be drawn on to the same emulation.</p>
<p>For as He had said, “Whatsoever they bid you do, that do;” He shows how many things
they do amiss, lest from thence He should be supposed amongst the unwise to commit all
to them.</p>
<p>“Woe unto you, for ye shut up the kingdom against men; for ye neither go in yourselves,
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.”2687 But if to profit no one be a charge
against a man, even to hurt and hinder, what plea hath that? But what means, “them that
are entering in?” Them that are fit for it. For when they were to lay injunctions on others,
they used to make the burdens intolerable, but when they themselves were to do any of the
things required, on the contrary, so far from doing anything, they went much beyond this
in wickedness, they even used to corrupt others. These are they that are called pests,2688who
make their employment the ruin of others, standing right contrary to teachers. For if it be
the part of a teacher to save that which is perishing, to destroy that which is on the point of
being saved is that of a destroyer.</p>
<p>After this, again another charge: “Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and
when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves;”2689that is,
<note type="footnote">2686 [This verse is omitted in the best authorities, and its position varies in the later mss. and versions which

<pb n="767"/>
not even the fact that hardly ye have taken him, and with endless toils, induces you to be
sparing towards him, although of the things we have hardly acquired, we are more sparing,
but you not even this renders more gentle.</p>
<p>Here He lays to their charge two things; one, that they are unprofitable for the salvation
of the many, and need much toil in order to win over even one; another, that they were remiss
in the preservation of him whom they had gained, or rather that they were not only careless,
but even traitors, by their wickedness in their life corrupting him, and making him worse.
For when the disciple sees his teachers to be such as these, he becomes worse than they. For
he stops not at his teacher’s wickedness; but as when his teacher is virtuous, he imitates him,
so when he is bad, he even goes beyond him, by reason of our proneness to what is evil.</p>
<p>And He calls him “a child of hell,” that is, a very hell. And He said “twofold more than
you,” that He might both alarm those, and make these feel the more severely, because they
are teachers of wickedness. And not this only, but because they labor to instill into their
disciples a greater wickedness, hardening them to a much greater depravity than they have,
and this is above all a mark of a depraved soul.</p>
<p>Then He derides them for folly also, because they bade them disregard the greater
commandments. And yet before He had said the opposite, that “they bind heavy burdens,
and grievous to be borne.” But these things too they did again and were doing everything
for the corruption of those who were subject to them, in little things requiring strictness,
and despising the great.</p>
<p>“For ye pay tithe,” He saith, “of mint and anise, and have omitted2690the weightier
matters of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not
to leave the others undone.”2691</p>
<p>Here then He naturally saith it, where it is tithe and almsgiving, for what doth it hurt
to give alms? But not to keep the law; for neither doth it say thus. Therefore here indeed He
saith, “These ought ye to have done;” but where He is speaking about clean and unclean,
He no longer adds this, but makes a distinction, and shows that the inward purity is necessarily
followed by the outward, but the converse is no longer so.</p>
<p>For where there is a plea of love to man, He passes it over lightly, for this very reason,
and because it was not yet time expressly and plainly to revoke the things of the law. But
where it is an observance of bodily purification, He overthrows it more plainly.</p>
<p>So, therefore, while with respect to alms He saith, “These ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the others undone,” touching purifications He speaks not on this wise, but what?
“Ye make clean,” He saith, “the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full
of extortion, and injustice. Cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside may be
<note type="footnote">2690 [R.V., “have left undone.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2691 Matt. xxiii. 23. [R.V., “to have left the others undone.” “And cummin” is omitted.—R.]</note>

<pb n="768"/>
clean also.”2692 And He took it from a thing confessed and manifest, from a cup and platter.</p>
<p>2. Then, to show that there is no harm arising from despising bodily cleansings, but
very great vengeance from not regarding the purifications of the soul, which is virtue, He
called these “a gnat,” for they are small and nothing, but those other a camel, for they were
beyond what men could bear. Wherefore also He saith, “Straining at the gnat, and swallowing
the camel.”2693 For indeed the one were enacted for the sake of the other, I mean of mercy
and judgment; so that not even then did they profit being done alone. For whereas the little
things were mentioned for the sake of the great, and after that these last were neglected, and
labor was spent on those alone, nothing was gained even then by this. For the greater followed
not the lesser, but the lesser were sure to follow these greater.</p>
<p>But these things He saith to show, that even before grace was come, these were not
among the principal things, or amongst those upon which men should spend their labor,
but the matters required were different. But if before the grace they were so, much more
when high commandments had come, were these things unprofitable, and it was not meet
to practise them at all.</p>
<p>In every case then is vice a grievous thing, but especially when it does not so much as
think it needs amendment; and it is yet more grievous, when it thinks itself sufficient even
to amend others; to express which Christ calls them “blind guides.” For if for a blind man
not to think he needs a guide be extreme misery and wretchedness; when he wishes himself
to guide others, see to what a gulf it leads.</p>
<p>But these things He said, by all intimating their mad desire of glory, and their exceeding
frenzy concerning this pest. For this became a cause to them of all their evils, namely, that
they did all things for display. This both led them away from the faith, and caused them to
neglect what really is virtue, and induced them to busy themselves about bodily purifyings
only, neglecting the purifications of the soul. So therefore to lead them into what really is
virtue, and to the purifyings of the soul, He makes mention of mercy, and judgment, and
faith. For these are the things that comprise our life, these are what purify the soul, justice,
love to man, truth; the one inclining us to pardon2694and not suffering us to be excessively
severe and unforgiving to them that sin (for then shall we gain doubly, both becoming kind
to man, and hence meeting also ourselves with much kindness from the God of all), and
causing us both to sympathize with them that are despitefully entreated, and to assist them;
the other not suffering them to be deceitful, and crafty.</p>
<p>But neither when He saith, “These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others
undone,” doth He say it as introducing a legal observance; away with the thought;2695neither
<note type="footnote">2692 Matt. xxiii. 25, 26. [The minor textual variations appear in the above English rendering.]</note>

<note type="footnote">2695 [The clause, “for this we showed before,” is omitted by the translator.—R.]</note>

<pb n="769"/>
with regard to the platter and the cup, when He said, “Cleanse that which is within the cup
and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also,” doth He bring us unto the old regard
for little things, but on the contrary indeed, He doth all things to show it to be superfluous.
For He said not, Cleanse the outside of them also, but that which is within, and the outside
is sure to follow.</p>
<p>And besides, neither is it concerning a cup and platter he is speaking, but of soul and
body, by the outside meaning the body, by the inside the soul. But if with regard to the
platter there be need of that which is within much more with regard to thee.</p>
<p>But ye do the contrary, saith He, observing things trifling and external, ye neglect what
are great and inward: whence very great mischief arises, for that thinking ye have duly performed
all, ye despise the other things; and despising them, ye do not so much as strive or
attempt to perform them.</p>
<p>After this, He again derides them for vainglory, calling them “whited sepulchers,”2696and
unto all adding, “ye hypocrites;” which thing is the cause of all their evils, and the origin of
their ruin. And He did not merely call them whited sepulchers, but said, that they were full
of uncleanness and hypocrisy. And these things He spake, indicating the cause wherefore
they did not believe, because they were full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>
<p>But these things not Christ only, but the prophets also constantly lay to their charge,
that they spoil, that their rulers judge not according to the rule of justice, and every where
you may find the sacrifices indeed refused, but these things required. So that there is nothing
strange, nothing new, neither in the lawgiving, nor in the accusation, nay not even in the
comparison of the sepulchre. For the prophet makes mention thereof, neither did he call
them merely a sepulchre, “but their throat an open sepulchre.”2697</p>
<p>Such are many men now also, decking themselves indeed outwardly, but full of iniquity
within. For now too there is many a mode, and many a care for outward purifications, but
of those in the soul not so much as one. But if indeed any one should tear open each man’s
conscience, many worms and much corruption would he find, and an ill savor beyond utterance;
unreasonable and wicked lusts I mean, which are more unclean than worms.</p>
<p>3. But that “they” should be such persons is not “so” dreadful a thing (although it be
dreadful), but that “you,” that have been counted worthy to become temples of God, should
of a sudden have become sepulchers, having as much ill savor, this is extreme wretchedness.
He in whom Christ dwells, and the Holy Spirit hath worked, and such great mysteries, that
this man should be a sepulchre, what wretchedness is this? What mournings and lamentations
doth this call for, when the members of Christ have become a tomb of uncleanness? Consider
how thou wast born, of what things thou hast been counted worthy, what manner of garment
<note type="footnote">2696 Matt. xxiii. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">2697 Ps. v. 9.</note>

<pb n="770"/>
thou hast received, how thou wast built a temple without a breach! how fair! not adorned
with gold, neither with pearls, but with the spirit that is more precious than these.</p>
<p>Consider that no sepulchre is made in a city, so then neither shalt thou be able to appear
in the city above. For if here this is forbidden, much more there. Or rather even here thou
art an object of scorn to all, bearing about a dead soul, and not to be scorned only, but also
to be shunned. For tell me, if any one were to go round, bearing about a dead body, would
not all have rushed away? would not all have fled? Think this now likewise. For thou goest
about, bearing a spectacle far more grievous than this, a soul deadened by sins, a soul paralyzed.</p>
<p>Who now will pity such a one? For when thou dost not pity thine own soul, how shall
another pity him that is so cruel, such an enemy to himself?2698 If any one, where thou didst
sleep and eat, had buried a dead body, what wouldest thou not have done? but thou art
burying a dead soul, not where thou dinest, nor where thou sleepest, but in the members
of Christ: and art thou not afraid lest a thousand lightnings and thunderbolts be hurled
from above upon thine head?</p>
<p>And how dost thou even dare to set foot in the churches of God, and in holy temples,
having within thee the savor of so much abomination? For if one bearing a dead body into
the king’s courts and burying it would have suffered the utmost punishment, thou setting
thy foot in the sacred courts, and filling the house with so much ill savor, consider what a
punishment thou wilt undergo.</p>
<p>Imitate that harlot who anointed with ointment the feet of Christ, and filled the whole
house with the odor, the opposite to which thou doest to His house! For what though thou
be not sensible of the ill savor? For this most of all is the grievous part of the disease;
wherefore also thou art incurably diseased, and more grievously than they that are maimed
in their bodies, and become fetid. For that disease indeed is both felt by the sick and is
without any blame, nay even is deserving of pity; but this of hatred and punishment.</p>
<p>Since then both in this respect it is more grievous, and from the sick not being sensi
ble of it as he ought to be; come, give thyself to my words, that I may teach thee plainly the
mischief of it.</p>
<p>But first listen to what thou sayest in the Psalm, “Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight
as incense.”2699 When then not incense, but a stinking smoke arises from thee, and from
thy deeds, what punishment dost thou not deserve to undergo?</p>
<p>What then is the stinking smoke? Many come in gazing about at the beauty of women;
others curious about the blooming youth of boys. After this, dost thou not marvel, how
bolts are not launched, and all things are not plucked up from their foundations? For worthy
<note type="footnote">2698 [πολμιον ντα αυτ κα χθρν.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2699 Ps. cxli. 2.</note>

<pb n="771"/>
both of thunderbolts and hell are the things that are done; but God, who is long-suffering,
and of great mercy, forbears awhile His wrath, calling thee to repentance and amendment.</p>
<p>What doest thou, O man? Art thou curiously looking after women’s beauty, and dost
thou not shudder at thus doing despite unto the temple of God? Doth the church seem to
thee a brothel, and less honorable than the market-place. For in a market-place indeed thou
art afraid and ashamed to appear to be looking after any woman, but in God’s temple, when
God Himself is discoursing unto thee, and threatening about these things, thou art committing
whoredom and adultery at the very time in which thou art being told not to do this.
And dost thou not shudder, nor stand amazed?</p>
<p>These things do the spectacles of wantonness teach you, the pest that is so hard to put
down, the deleterious sorceries, the grievous snares of the thoughtless, the pleasurable destruction
of the unchaste.</p>
<p>Therefore the prophet also blaming thee, said, “Thine eyes are not good, neither is thine
heart.”2700</p>
<p>It were better for such men to be blind; it were better to be diseased, than to abuse thine
eyes for these purposes.</p>
<p>It were meet indeed that ye had within you the wall to part you from the women; but
since ye are not so minded, our fathers thought it necessary by these boards2701to wall you
off; since I hear from the elder ones, that of old there were not so much as these partitions;
“For in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female.”2702 And in the apostle’s time also
both men and women were together. Because the men were men, and the women women,
but now altogether the contrary; the women have urged themselves into the manners of
courtezans, but the men are in no better state than frantic horses.</p>
<p>Heard ye not, that the men and women were gathered together in the upper room, and
that congregation was worthy of the heavens? And very reasonably. For even women then
practised much self-denial, and the men gravity and chastity. Hear, for instance, the seller
of purple saying, “If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come in, and abide with
me.”2703 Hear the women, who went about with the apostles, having taken unto themselves
manly courage, Priscilla, Persis, and the rest; from whom our present women are as far removed
as our men from their men.</p>
<p>4. For then indeed even travelling into far countries women brought not on themselves
evil report; but now even though brought up in a chamber, they hardly escape this suspicion.

But these things arise from their decking of themselves, and their luxury. Then the business
of those women was to spread the word; but now to appear beauteous, and fair, and comely
in countenance. This is glory to them, this salvation; but of lofty and great works they do
not even dream.</p>
<p>What woman exerts herself to make her husband better? what man hath taken to himself
this care to amend his wife? There is not one: but the woman’s whole study is upon the care
of ornaments of gold, and raiment, and the other adornments of the person, and how to
increase their substance; but the man’s both this, and others more than this, all however
worldly.</p>
<p>Who, when about to marry, inquires about the disposition and nurture of the damsel?
No one; but straightway about money, and possessions, and measures of property of various
and different kinds; like as if he were about to buy something, or to settle some common
contract.</p>
<p>Therefore they do even so call marriage. For I have heard many say, such a man has
contracted with such a woman, that is, has married. And they offer insult to the gifts of God,
and as though buying and selling, so do they marry, and are given in marriage.</p>
<p>And writings there are, requiring greater security than those about buying and selling.
Learn how those of old married, and imitate them. How then did they marry? They inquired
about ways of life, and morals, and virtue of the soul. Therefore they had no need of writings,
nor of security by parch ment and ink; for the bride’s disposition sufficed them in the place
of all.</p>
<p>I therefore entreat you likewise not to seek after wealth and affluence, but a good disposition,
and gentleness. Seek for a pious and self-denying damsel, and these will be to thee
better than countless treasures. If thou seek the things of God, these others will come also;
but if thou pass by those, and hasten unto these, neither will these follow.</p>
<p>But such a man, one will say, became rich by his wife! Art thou not ashamed of bringing
forward such examples? I had ten thousand times sooner become a poor man, as I have
heard many say, than gain wealth from a wife. For what can be more unpleasing than that
wealth? What more painful than the abundance? What more shameful than to be notorious
from thence, and for it to be said by all, such a man became rich by a wife? For the domestic
discomforts I pass by, all that must needs result from hence, the wife’s pride, the servility,
the strifes, the reproaches of the servants. “The beggar,” “the ragged one,” “the base one,
and sprung of base.” “Why, what had he when he came in?” “Do not all things belong to
our mistress?” But thou dost not care at all about these sayings, for neither art thou a freeman.
Since the parasites likewise hear worse things than these, and are not pained wherefore
neither are these, but rather pride themselves in their disgrace; and when we tell them of
these things, “Let me have,” saith one of them, “something pleasant and sweet, and let it
choke me.” Alas! the devil, what proverbs hath he brought into the world, of power to

<pb n="773"/>
overturn the whole life of such persons. See at least this self-same devilish and pernicious
saying; of how much ruin it is full. For it means nothing else than these words, Have thou
no regard to what is honorable; have thou no regard to what is just; let all those things be
cast aside, seek one thing alone, pleasure. Though the thing stifle thee, let it be thy choice;
though all that meet thee spurn thee, though they smear thy face with mire, though they
drive thee away as a dog, bear all. And what else would swine say, if they had a voice? What
else would filthy dogs? But perhaps not even they would have said such things, as the devil
hath persuaded men to rave.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you, being conscious of the senselessness of such words as these,
to flee such proverbs, and to choose out those in the Scriptures that are contrary to them.</p>
<p>But what are these? “Go not,” it is said, “after thy lusts, and refrain thyself from thine
appetites.”2704 And, touching an harlot again, it is said in opposition to this proverb, “Give
not heed to a bad woman: for honey droppeth from the lips of a woman that is an harlot,
which, for a season, is luscious unto thy throat; but afterwards thou shalt find it more bitter
than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.”2705 Unto these last then let us listen, not
unto those. For hence indeed spring our mean, hence our slavish thoughts, hence men become
brutes, because in everything they will follow after pleasure according to this proverb,
which, even without arguments of ours, is of itself ridiculous. For after one is choked, what
is the gain of sweetness?</p>
<p>Cease, therefore, to set up such great absurdity, and to kindle hell and unquenchable
fire; and let us look steadfastly (at length though late) as we ought, unto the things to come,
having put away the film on our eyes, that we may both pass the present life honestly, and
with much reverence and godly fear, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXIV.</head>
<p>“Woe unto you, because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish their sepulchers,2706and
say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with
them in the blood of the prophets.”</p>
<p>Not because they build, nor because they blame the others, doth He say, woe, but because,
while both thus, and by what they say, they are pretending to condemn their fathers, they
do worse. For in proof that the condemnation was a pretense, Luke saith, ye do allow because
ye build; for, “Woe unto you,” saith He, “for ye build the sepulchers of the prophets, and
your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witness, and ye allow the deeds of your fathers, for
they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.”2707 For here He reproves their
purpose, wherewith they built, that it was not for the honoring of them that were slain, but
as making a show of the murders, and afraid, lest, when the tombs had perished by time,
the proof and memory of such daring should fade away, setting up these glorious buildings,
as a kind of trophy, and priding themselves in the daring deeds of those men, and displaying
them.</p>
<p>For the things that ye now dare to do, show that ye do these things also in this spirit.
For, though ye speak the contrary, saith He, as condemning them, as, for instance, “We
should not, if we had been in their days, have been partakers with them;” yet the disposition
is evident wherewith ye say these things. Wherefore also unfolding it, though darkly, still
He hath expressed it. For when He had said, ye say, “If we had been in the days of our fathers,
we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets;” He added,
“Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them that slew the
prophets.” And what blame is it to be a murderer’s son, if one partake not in the mind of
one’s father? None. Whence it is evident, that for this same thing He brings it forward against
them, hinting at their affinity in wickedness.</p>
<p>And this is manifest too by what comes after; He adds at least, “Ye serpents, ye generation
of vipers.”2708 For as those beasts are like their parents, in the destructiveness of their venom,
so also are ye like your fathers in murderousness.</p>
<p>Then, because He was searching their temper of mind, which is to the more part obscure,
He doth, from those things also which they were about to perpetrate, which would be
manifest to all, establish His words. For, because He had said, “Wherefore ye be witnesses
unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets,” making it
<note type="footnote">2706 [There are two variations in the text of verse 29: the omission of “Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!” and
the substitution of “their” for “of the righteous.”—R.]</note>

<note type="footnote">2708 Matt. xxiii. 33.</note>

<pb n="775"/>
evident, that of their affinity in wickedness He is speaking, and that it was a pretense to say,
“We should not have been partakers with them,” He added, “Fill ye up therefore the measure
of your fathers,”2709not commanding, but declaring beforehand, what was to be, that is, His
own murder.</p>
<p>Therefore, having brought in their refutation, and having shown that they were pretenses
which they said in their own defense, as, for instance, “We would not have been partakers
with them,” (for they who refrain not from the Lord, how should they have refrained from
the servants), He makes after this His language more condemnatory,2710calling them “serpents,
and generation of vipers,” and saying, “How shall ye escape the damnation of
hell,”2711at once perpetrating such things, and denying them, and dissembling your purpose?</p>
<p>Then rebuking them more exceedingly from another cause also, He saith, “I will send
unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and some of them shall ye kill and crucify,
and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues.”2712 For that they should not say,
“Though we crucified the Lord, yet from the servants we should have refrained, if we had
been then;” “Behold,” He saith, “I send servants also to you, prophets likewise themselves,
and neither will ye spare them.” But these things He saith, showing that it was nothing
strange, that He should be murdered by those sons, being both murderous and deceitful,
and having much guile, and surpassing their fathers in their outrages.</p>
<p>And besides what hath been said, He shows them to be also exceedingly vainglorious.
For when they say, “If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been
partakers with them,” they spake out of vainglory, and were practising virtue in words only,
but in their works doing the contrary.</p>
<p>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, that is, wicked sons of wicked men, and more
wicked than those who begat them. For He showeth that they are committing greater crimes,
both by their committing them after those others, and by their doing much more grievous
things than they, and this, while positively affirming that they never would have fallen into
the same. For they add that which is both the end and the crown of their evil deeds. For the
others slew them that came to the vineyard, but these, both the son, and them that were
bidding them to the wedding.</p>
<p>But these things He saith, to separate them off from the affinity to Abraham, and to
show that they had no advantage from thence, unless they followed his works; wherefore

<pb n="776"/>
also He adds, “How can ye flee2713from the damnation of hell,” when following them that
have committed such acts?</p>
<p>And here He recalls to their remembrance John’s accusation, for he too called them by
this name, and reminded them of the judgment to come. Then, because they are nothing
alarmed by judgment and hell, by reason of their not believing them, and because the thing
is future, He awes them by the things present, and saith, “Wherefore, behold, I send unto
you prophets and scribes: and some of them shall ye kill and crucify, and scourge;2714that
upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous
Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the
temple2715and the altar. Verily I say unto you, that all these things shall come upon this
generation.”2716</p>
<p>2. See by how many things He has warned them. He said, Ye condemn your fathers, in
that ye say, “We would not have been partakers with them;” and this is no little thing to
shame them. He said, While ye condemn them, ye do worse things, even ye yourselves; and
this is sufficient to cover them with disgrace. He said, These things shall not be without
punishment; and hence he implants in them fear beyond words. He hath reminded them
at least of hell. Then because that was to come, He brought home to them the terrors as even
present. “For all these things shall come,” He saith, “upon this generation.”</p>
<p>He added also unspeakable severity to the vengeance, saying, that they shall suffer more
grievous things than all; yet by none of these things did they become better. But if any one
say, And why do they suffer more grievously than all? we would say, Because they have first
committed more grievous things than all, and by none of the things that have been done to
them have they been brought to a sound mind.</p>
<p>Heardest thou not Lamech saying, “Of Lamech vengeance shall be taken seventy times
sevenfold;”2717that is, “I am deserving of more punishment than Cain.” Why could this be?
Yet he did not slay his brother; but because not even by his example was he brought to a
better mind. And this is what God saith elsewhere, “Requiting the sins of fathers upon
children for the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.”2718 Not as though one
were to suffer punishment for the crimes committed by others, but inasmuch as they who,

after many sin and have been punished, yet have not grown better, but have committed the
same offenses, are justly worthy to suffer their punishments also.</p>
<p>But see how seasonably he also mentioned Abel, indicating that this murder likewise is
of envy. What then have ye to say? Know ye not what Cain suffered? Did God hold His
peace at his deeds? Did He not exact the severest penalty? Heard ye not what things your
fathers suffered, when they slew the prophets; were they not delivered over to punishments,
and inflictions of vengeance without number? How then did ye not become better? And
why do I speak of the punishments of your fathers, and what they suffered? Thou who thyself
condemnest thy fathers, how is it thou doest worse? For moreover even ye yourselves have
declared that “He will miserably destroy those wicked men.”2719 What favor then will ye
have after this, committing such things after such a sentence?</p>
<p>But who is this Zacharias? Some say, the father of John; some, the prophet; some, a
priest with two different names, whom the Scripture also calls, the son of Jehoiada.2720</p>
<p>But do thou mark this, that the outrage was twofold. For not only did they slay holy
men, but also in a holy place. And saying these things, He did not only alarm them, but also
comfort His disciples, showing that the righteous men also who were before them suffered
these things. But these He alarmed, foretelling that like as they paid their penalty, even so
should these too suffer the utmost extremities. Therefore He calls them2721“prophets, and
wise men, and scribes,” even hereby again taking away every plea of theirs. “For ye cannot
say,” He saith, “Thou didst send from among the Gentiles, and therefore we were offended;”
but they were led on unto this by being murderous, and thirsting for blood. Wherefore He
also said beforehand, “For this cause do I send prophets and scribes.” This did the prophets
also lay to their charge, saying, “They mingle blood with blood,”2722and that they are men
of blood. Therefore also did He command the blood to be offered to Him, showing that if
in a brute it be thus precious, much more in a man. Which He saith to Noah likewise, “I
will require all blood that is shed.”2723 And ten thousand other such things might one find
Him enjoining with regard to their not committing murder; wherefore He commanded
them not even to eat that which was strangled.</p>
<p>Oh the love of God towards man! that though He foreknew they would profit nothing,
He still doeth His part. For I will send, He saith, and this knowing they would be slain. So
that even hereby they were convicted of saying vainly, “We should not have been partakers

with our fathers.” For these too slew prophets even in their synagogues, and reverenced
neither the place, nor the dignity of the persons. For not merely ordinary persons did they
slay, but prophets and wise men, such that they had nothing to lay to their charge. And by
these He meaneth the apostles, and those after them, for, indeed, many prophesied. Then,
willing to aggravate their fears, He saith, “Verily, verily I say unto you, All these things shall
come upon this generation;” that is, I will bring all upon your heads, and will make the
vengeance sore. For he that knew many to have sinned, and was not sobered, but himself
hath committed the same sins again, and not the same only, but also far more grievous,
would justly deserve to suffer a far more grievous punishment than they. For like as, if he
had been minded, he would have gained greatly, had he grown better by their examples,
even so, since he continued without amendment, he is liable to a heavier vengeance, as
having had the benefit of more warning by them who had sinned before and been punished,
and having reaped no advantage.</p>
<p>3. Then He directs His speech unto the city, in this way too being minded to correct
His hearers, and saith, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!”2724 What meaneth the repetition? this is
the manner of one pitying her, and bemoaning her, and greatly loving her. For, like as unto
a woman beloved, herself indeed ever loved, but who had despised Him that loved her, and
therefore on the point of being punished, He pleads, being now about to inflict the punishment.
Which He doth in the prophets also, using these words, “I said, Turn thou unto me,
and she returned not.”2725</p>
<p>Then having called her, He tells also her blood-stained deeds, “Thou that killest2726the
prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy
children together, and ye would not,” in this way also pleading for His own dealings; not
even with these things hast thou turned me aside, nor withdrawn me from my great affection
toward thee, but it was my desire even so, not once or twice, but often to draw thee unto
me. “For how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathereth
her chickens, and ye would not.”2727 And this He saith, to show that they were ever scattering
themselves by their sins. And His affection He indicates by the similitude; for indeed the
creature is warm in its love towards its brood. And everywhere in the prophets is this same
image of the wings, and in the song of Moses and in the Psalms, indicating His great protection
and care.</p>
<p>“But ye would not,” He saith. “Behold your house is left desolate,”2728stripped of the
succor which cometh from me. Surely it was the same, who also was before protecting them,

and holding them together, and preserving them; surely it was He who was ever chastening
them. And He appoints a punishment, which they had ever dreaded exceedingly; for it declared
the entire overthrow of their polity. “For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth,
till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.”2729 And this is the language
of one that loves earnestly, earnestly drawing them unto Him by the things to come,
not merely warning them by the past; for of the future day of His second coming doth He
here speak.</p>
<p>What then? Did they not see Him from that time? But it is not that hour which He
meaneth in saying, Henceforth, but the time up to His crucifixion.</p>
<p>For since they were forever accusing Him of this, that He was a kind of rival God, and
a foe to God, He moves them to love Him by this, namely, by showing Himself to be of one
accord with His Father; and He indicates Himself to be the same that was in the prophets.
Wherefore also He uses the same words as did the prophets.</p>
<p>And by these He intimated both His resurrection, and His second coming, and made
it plain even to the utterly unbelieving, that then most surely they should worship Him. And
how did He make this plain? By speaking of many things that were first to be, that He should
send prophets, that they should kill them; that it should be in the synagogues; that they
should suffer the utmost extremities; that their house should be left desolate; that they should
undergo things more grievous than any, and such as never were undergone before. For all
these things are enough to furnish even to the most senseless and contentious a clear proof
of that which should come to pass at His coming.</p>
<p>For I will ask them, Did He send the prophets and wise men? Did they slay them in
their synagogue? Was their house left desolate? Did all the vengeance come upon that generation?
It is quite plain that it was so, and no man gainsays it. As then all these things came
to pass, so shall those also come to pass, and most surely they shall submit then.</p>
<p>But they shall derive thence no advantage in the way of defense, as neither will they who
repent of their course of life then.</p>
<p>Wherefore let us, while it is time, practise what is good. For like as they henceforth derived
no advantage from their knowledge, even so neither shall we ourselves from our repentance
for our wickedness. For neither to the pilot, when the bark is sunk in the sea from
his remissness, will there remain anything more; nor to the physician, when the sick man
is gone; but each of these must before the end devise, and execute all things, so as to be involved
in no danger, nor shame; but after this, all is unprofitable.</p>
<p>Let us also then, while in sickness, send for physicians, and lay out money, and exert
unceasing diligence, that having risen up from our affliction, we may depart hence in health.</p>
<note type="footnote">2729 Matt. xxiii. 39.</note>

<pb n="780"/>
<p>And as much care as we exert about our servants, when their bodies are sick, so much
let us show forth upon ourselves, when our soul is diseased. And indeed we are nearer to
ourselves than our servants, and our souls are more necessary than those bodies, but nevertheless
it were well if we exert at least an equal diligence. For if we do not this now, when
gone, thenceforth we may obtain nothing more in the way of plea.</p>
<p>4. Who is so wretched, one may say, as not to show even as much thought as this? Why
this is the marvellous thing, that we are held in so little esteem with our ownselves, that we
despise ourselves more than our servants. For when our servants are sick of a fever, we send
for physicians, and make a separation in the house, and compel them to obey the laws of
that art; and if these are neglected, we are displeased with them, and set persons to watch
them, who will not, even should they wish them, suffer them to satiate their desire; and if
they who have the care of these persons should say, that medicines must be procured at
great cost, we yield; and whatsoever they may enjoin, we obey, and we pay them hire for
these injunctions.</p>
<p>But when we are sick (or rather there is no time when we are not sick), we do not so
much as call in the physician, we do not lay out money, but as though some ruffian,2730and
enemy, and foes were concerned, so do we disregard our soul. And these things I say, not
finding fault with our attention towards our servants, but thinking it meet to take at least
as much care of our souls. And how should we do? one may say. Show it to Paul when ill;
call in Matthew; let John sit by it. Hear from them, what we ought to do that is thus ill, they
will surely tell, and will not conceal. For they are not dead, but live and speak. But doth the
soul take no heed to them, being weighed down by the fever? Do thou compel it, and awaken
its reasoning power. Call in the prophets. There is no need to pay money to these physicians,
for neither do they themselves demand hire for themselves, nor for the medicines which
they prepare do they drive thee to the necessity of expense, except for almsgiving; but in
everything else they even add to thy possessions; as, for instance, when they require thee to
be temperate, they deliver thee from unseasonable and wrong expenses; when they tell thee
to abstain from drunkenness, they make thee wealthier. Seest thou the skill of physicians,
who besides health, are supplying thee also with riches? Sit down therefore by them, and
learn of them the nature of thy disease. For instance, dost thou love wealth, and greedy gain,
like as the fevered love water? Listen at any rate to their admonitions. For like as the physician
saith to thee, If thou wilt gratify thy desire, thou wilt perish, and undergo this or that; even
so also Paul: “They that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare of the devil, and into
foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.”2731</p>
<note type="footnote">2730 Lit., “executioner.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2731 1 Tim. vi. 9.</note>

<pb n="781"/>
<p>But art thou impatient? Hear him saying, “Yet a little while, and He that cometh will
come, and will not tarry.2732 The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing;”2733and again,
“The fashion of this world passeth away.”2734</p>
<p>For neither doth he command only, but also soothes, as a physician should. And like
as they devise some other things in the place of cold things, so doth this man draw off2735the
desire another way. Dost thou wish to be rich, saith he; let it be “in good works.” Dost thou
desire to lay up treasure? I forbid it not at all; only let it be in Heaven.</p>
<p>And like as the physician saith, that what is cold is hurtful to teeth, to nerves, to bones;
so he too, more briefly indeed, as heedful of brevity, yet far more, clearly and more powerfully,
saith, “For the love of money is the root of all evils.”2736</p>
<p>Of what then should one make use? He tells this also: of contentedness instead of covetousness.
“For contentment,” he saith, “with godliness is great gain.”2737 But if thou art dissatisfied,
and desirest more, and art not yet equal to cast away all superfluous things, he tells
also him that is thus diseased, how he ought to handle these things too. “That they that rejoice
in wealth, be as though they rejoiced not; and they that have, as though they possessed not;
and they that use this world, as not abusing it.”2738</p>
<p>Seest thou what manner of things he enjoins? Wilt thou call in also another physician
besides? To me at least it seems well. For neither are these physicians like those of the body,
who often, while vying one with another, overwhelm the sick man. But not so these, for they
have regard to the health of the sick, not to their own vainglory. Be not then afraid of the
number of them; one Master speaks in all, that is, Christ.</p>
<p>5. See, for instance, another again entering in, and saying severe things concerning this
disease, or rather it is the Master by him;2739“For ye cannot serve God and mammon.”2740
Yea, saith he, and how will these things be? how shall we cease from the desire? Hence may
we learn this also. And how shall we know? Hear him saying this too: “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
break through and steal.”2741</p>

<p>Seest thou how by the place, by the things that waste there, He draws men off from this
desire that is here, and rivets them to Heaven, where all things are impregnable? For if ye
transfer your wealth there where neither rust nor moth corrupts, nor thieves break through
and steal, ye will both expel this disease, and establish your soul in the greatest abundance.</p>
<p>And together with what we have said, He brings forward an example also to teach thee
moderation. And like as the physician, to alarm the sick man saith, that such a one died
from the use of cold water; so doth He also bring in the rich man,2742laboring indeed, and
longing for life and health, but not able to attain thereto, because of having set his heart on
covetousness, but going away empty. And besides this man, another is shown to thee again
by another evangelist, he that was in torment,2743and was not master so much as of a drop
of water. Then showing that His injunctions are easy, He saith, “Behold the fowls of the
air.”2744 But being compassionate, He suffers not even the rich to despair. “For the things
which are impossible with men, are possible with God,”2745saith He. For though thou be
rich, the physician is able to cure thee. For neither was it wealth that He took away, but to
be slave of riches, and a lover of greedy gain.</p>
<p>How then is it possible for the rich man to be saved. By possessing his goods in common
with them that are in need, being such as Job was, and exterminating out of his soul the
desire of more, and in no points going beyond real need.</p>
<p>He shows thee together with these this selfsame publican also, that was grievously oppressed
by the fever of covetousness, quickly set free from it. For what more sordid than a
publican? Nevertheless, the man became indifferent to wealth from obeying the laws of the
physician. For indeed He hath for His disciples such persons as these, that were sick of the
same diseases as we are, and have recovered their health quickly. And He shows us each, in
order we may not despair. See at least this publican. Mark again another, a chief of the
publicans, who promised four fold indeed for all that he had extorted, and the half of all
that he possessed, that he might receive Jesus.</p>
<p>But art thou on fire with exceeding desire for riches. Have the possessions of all men
instead of thine own. For indeed I give thee, He saith, more than thou seekest, in opening
to thee the houses of the wealthy throughout the world. “For whosoever hath forsaken
father or mother, or lands, or house, shall receive an hundredfold.”2746 Thus wilt thou not
enjoy more abundant possessions only, but thou wilt even remove this grievous thirst altogether,
and wilt endure all things easily, so far from desiring more, not seeking often even

necessary things. Thus doth Paul suffer hunger, and is held in honor more than when he
ate. Forasmuch as a wrestler also, when striving, and winning crowns, would not choose to
give up and to be in repose; and a merchant who hath entered on sea voyages would not
desire to be afterwards in idleness.</p>
<p>And we therefore, if we should taste as we ought of spiritual fruits, shall thenceforth
not even account the things present to be anything, being seized by the desire of the things
to come as with some most noble intoxication.</p>
<p>Let us taste of them, therefore, that we may both be delivered from the turmoil of the
things present, and may attain the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXV.</head>
<p>Matt. XXIV. 1, 2.</p>
<p>“And Jesus went out from the temple, and departed.2747And His disciples came to Him to
show Him the buildings of the temple. And He answered and said unto them, See ye not
all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down.”</p>
<p>For inasmuch as He said, “Your house is left desolate,” and had previously forewarned
them of many grievous things; therefore the disciples having heard these things, as though
marvelling at it, came unto Him, showing the beauty of the temple, and wondering, if so
much beauty was to be destroyed, and materials so costly, and variety of workmanship past
utterance; He no longer thenceforth talks to them of desolation merely, but foretells an entire
destruction. “See ye not all these things,” saith He, and do ye marvel, and are ye amazed?
“There shall not remain one stone upon another.” How then did it remain? one may say.
But what is this? For neither so hath the prediction fallen to the ground. For He said these
things either indicating its entire desolation, or at that spot where He was. For there are
parts of it destroyed unto the foundations.</p>
<p>And together with its we would say another thing also, that from what hath been done,
even the most contentious ought to believe concerning the remains, that they are utterly to
be destroyed.</p>
<p>“And as He sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him privately, saying,
Tell us when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end
of the world?”2748</p>
<p>Therefore did they come unto Him privately, as it was of such matters they meant to
inquire. For they were in travail to know the day of His coming, because of their eager desire
to behold that glory, which is the cause of countless blessings. And these two things do they
ask him, when shall these things be? that is, the overthrow of the temple; and, what is the
sign of thy coming? But Luke saith,2749the question was one concerning Jerusalem, as though
they were supposing that then is His coming. And Mark saith, that neither did all of them
ask concerning the end of Jerusalem, but Peter and John,2750as having greater freedom of
speech.</p>

<pb n="785"/>
<p>What then saith He? “Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my
name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.2751 And ye shall hear of wars and rumors
of wars. See that ye be not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is
not yet.”2752</p>
<p>For since they felt as being told of vengeance falling on others when hearing of that
which was to be brought upon Jerusalem and as though they were to be out of the turmoils,
and were dreaming of good things only, and looked for these to befall them quite immediately;
for this cause He again foretells to them grievous things, making them earnest, and
commanding them on two grounds to watch, so as neither to be seduced by the deceit of
them that would beguile them, nor to be overpowered by the violence of ills that should
overtake them.</p>
<p>For the war, saith He, shall be twofold that of the deceivers, and that of the enemies,
but the former far more grievous, as coming upon them in the confusion and turmoils, and
when men were terrified and troubled. For indeed great was the storm then, when the Roman
power was beginning to flourish, and cities were taken, and camps and weapons were set
in motion, and many were readily believed.</p>
<p>But of wars in Jerusalem is He speaking; for it is not surely of those without, and
everywhere in the world; for what did they care for these? And besides, He would thus say
nothing new, if He were speaking of the calamities of the world at large, which are happening
always. For before this, were wars, and tumults, and fightings; but He speaks of the Jewish
wars coming upon them at no great distance, for henceforth the Roman arms were a matter
of anxiety. Since then these things also were sufficient to confound them, He foretells them
all.</p>
<p>Then to show that He Himself also will assail the Jews with them, and war on them, He
speaks not of battles only, but also of plagues sent from God, famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes, showing that the wars also He Himself permitted to come upon them, and that
these things do not happen for no purpose according to what has been before the accustomed
course of things amongst men, but proceed from the wrath on high.</p>
<p>Therefore He saith, they shall come not by themselves or at once, but with signs. For
that the Jews may not say, that they who then believed were the authors of these evils,
therefore hath He told them also of the cause of their coming upon them. “For verily I say
unto you,” He said before, “all these things shall come upon this generation,” having made
mention of the stain of blood on them.</p>
<p>Then lest on hearing of the showers of evils, they should suppose the gospel to be broken
through, He added, “See,2753be not troubled, for all things must come to pass,” i.e. which I

<pb n="786"/>
foretold, and the approach of the temptations will set aside none of the things which I have
said; but there shall indeed be tumults and confusion, but nothing shall shake my predictions.</p>
<p>Then since He had said to the Jews, “Ye shall not see me, till ye shall say, Blessed is He
that cometh in the name of the Lord;” and the disciples supposed that together with the
destruction would be the end also; to set right this secret thought of theirs, He said, “But
the end is not yet.” For that they did suspect even as I said, you may learn from their question.
For, what did they ask? When shall these things be? i.e. when shall Jerusalem be destroyed?
And what is the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?</p>
<p>But He answered nothing directly to this question, but first speaks of those other things
that are urgent, and which it was needful for them to learn first. For neither concerning
Jerusalem straightway, nor of His own second coming, did He speak, but touching the ills
that were to meet them at the doors. Wherefore also He makes them earnest in their exertions,
by saying, “Take heed that no man deceive you;2754for many shall come in my name, saying,
I am Christ.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, when He hath roused them to listen about these things (for, “take heed,”
saith He, “that no man deceive you”);2755and having made them energetic, and prepared
them to be watchful, and hath spoken first of the false Christs, then He speaks of the ills of
Jerusalem, assuring them ever by the things already past, foolish and contentious though
they were, of those which were yet to come.</p>
<p>2. But by “wars and rumors of wars,” He meaneth, what I before said, the troubles
coming upon them. After this, because, as I have already said, they supposed after that war
the end would come, see how He warns them, saying, “But the end is not yet. For nation,”
He saith, “shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.”2756 Of the preludes to
the ills of the Jews doth He speak. “All these are the beginning of sorrows,”2757that is, of
those that befall them. “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you.”2758</p>
<p>In good season did He introduce their ills, having a consolation from the common
miseries; and not in this way only, but also by His adding, that it is “for my name’s sake.
For ye shall be hated,” He saith, “of all men for my name’s sake. Then shall many be offended,
and shall betray one another, and many false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall

deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold; but he
that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”2759</p>
<p>This is the greater evil, when the war is intestine too, for there were many false brethren.
Seest thou the war to be threefold? from the deceivers, from the enemies, from the false
brethren. See Paul too lamenting over the same things, and saying, “Without were fightings,
within were fears;”2760and, “perils among false brethren,”2761and again, “For such are false
apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.”2762</p>
<p>After this again, what is more grievous than all, they shall not have so much as the
consolation from love. Then indicating, that these things will in no degree harm the noble
and the firm, He saith, Fear not, neither be troubled. For if ye show forth the patience that
becomes you, the dangers will not prevail over you. And it is a plain proof of this, that the
word shall surely be preached everywhere in the world, so much shall ye be above the things
that alarm you. For, that they may not say, how then shall we live? He said more, Ye shall
both live and preach everywhere. Therefore He added moreover, “And this gospel shall be
preached in the whole world for a witness to all nations, and then shall the end come,”2763of
the downfall of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>For in proof that He meant this, and that before the taking of Jerusalem the gospel was
preached, hear what Paul saith, “Their sound went into all the earth;”2764and again, “The
gospel which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven.”2765 And seest thou
him running from Jerusalem unto Spain? And if one took so large a portion, consider what
the rest also wrought. For writing to others also, Paul again saith concerning the gospel,
that “it is bringing forth fruit, and growing up in every creature which is under Heaven.”2766</p>
<p>But what meaneth, “For a witness to all nations?” Forasmuch as though it was everywhere
preached, yet it was not everywhere believed. It was for a witness, He saith, to them that
were disbelieving, that is, for conviction, for accusation, for a testimony; for they that believed
will bear witness against them that believed not, and will condemn them. And for this cause,
after the gospel is preached in every part of the world, Jerusalem is destroyed, that they may

not have so much as a shadow of an excuse for their perverseness. For they that saw His
power shine throughout every place, and in an instant take the world captive, what excuse
could they then have for continuing in the same perverseness? For in proof that it was
everywhere preached at that time, hear what Paul saith, “of the gospel which was preached
to every creature which is under Heaven.”2767</p>
<p>Which also is a very great sign of Christ’s power, that in twenty or at most thirty years
the word had reached the ends of the world. “After this therefore,” saith He, “shall come
the end of Jerusalem.” For that He intimates this was manifested by what follows.</p>
<p>For He brought in also a prophecy, to confirm their desolation, saying, “But when ye
shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the
holy place, let him that readeth understand.”2768 He referred them to Daniel. And by “abomination”
He meaneth the statue of him who then took the city, which he who desolated
the city and the temple placed within the temple, wherefore Christ calleth it, “of desolation.”
Moreover, in order that they might learn that these things will be while some of them are
alive, therefore He said, “When ye see the abomination of desolation.”</p>
<p>3. Whence one may most marvel at Christ’s power, and their courage, for that they
preached in such times, in which most especially the Jewish state was warred against, in
which most especially men regarded them as movers of sedition, when Cæsar commanded
all of them to be driven away.2769 And the result was the same as if any one (when the sea
was stirred up on every side, and darkness was filling all the air, and successive shipwrecks
taking place, and when all their fellow-sailors were at strife above, and monsters were rising
up from beneath, and with the waves devouring the mariners, and thunderbolts falling, and
their being pirates, and those in the vessel plotting one against another), were to command
men inexperienced in sailing, and who had not so much as seen the sea to sit at the rudder,
and to guide and fight the vessel, and when an immense fleet was coming against them with
a great array, making use of a single bark, with her crew in this disturbed state, to sink and
subdue the fleet. For indeed by the heathens they were hated as Jews, and by the Jews were
stoned, as waging war against their laws; and nowhere could they stand.</p>
<p>Thus were all things, precipices, and reefs, and rocks, the things in the cities, the things
in the fields, the things in the houses, and every single person was at war with them; generals
and rulers, and private persons, and all nations, and all people, and a turmoil which cannot
be set forth by words. For the Jewish race was exceedingly detestable to the government of
the Romans, as having occasioned them endless trouble; and not even from this did the
preaching of the word take hurt; but the city was stormed and set on fire, and involved its

<pb n="789"/>
inhabitants in countless evils; but the apostles that came from thence, introducing new laws,
prevailed even over the Romans.</p>
<p>O strange and wonderful facts! Countless myriads of Jews did the Romans then subdue,
and they did not prevail over twelve men fighting against them naked and unarmed. What
language can set forth this miracle? For they that teach need to have these two things, to be
worthy of credit, and to be beloved by them whom they are instructing; and together with
these, and besides them, that their sayings should be easy of reception, and the time should
be free from trouble and tumults.</p>
<p>But then were all the contraries to these. For while they did not seem worthy of credit,
they were withdrawing from such as did seem worthy of it, those who had been deceived
by them. So far from being loved, they were even hated, and were taking men away from
what they loved, both habits, and hereditary customs, and laws.</p>
<p>Again, their injunctions had great difficulty; but the things, from which they were
withdrawing men, much pleasure. And many were the perils, many the deaths, both themselves
and they that obeyed them underwent, and together with all this, the time also occasioned
them much difficulty, teeming with wars, tumults, disturbance, so that, even if there
had been none of the things we have mentioned, it would have quite thrown all things into
confusion.</p>
<p>We have good occasion to say, “Who shall tell the mighty works of the Lord, and make
all His praises to be heard.”2770 For if his own people amid signs hearkened not to Moses,
because of the clay only, and the bricks; who persuaded these that every day were beaten
and slain, and were suffering incurable evils, to leave a quiet life, and to prefer thereto this
which was teeming with blood and death, and that when they who preached it were strangers
to them, and very hostile in every way? For I say not unto nations and cities and people, but
into a small house let one bring in him that is hated of all that are in the house, and by him
endeavor to bring them away from those whom they love, from father, and wife, and child,
will he not surely be seen torn in pieces, before he hath opened his mouth? And if there be
added moreover a tumult and strife of husband and wife in the house, will they not stone
him to death before he steps on the threshold? And if he also be one whom they may readily
despise, and who enjoins galling things, and commands them who are living in luxury to
practise self restraint, and together with this the conflict be against those who are far more
in numbers and who excel him, is it not quite manifest that he will be utterly destroyed? Yet
nevertheless, this, which is impossible to be done in one house, this hath Christ accomplished
in all the world, through precipices and furnaces, and ravines, and rocks, and land and sea
at war with Him, bringing in the healers of the world.</p>
<note type="footnote">2770 Ps. cvi. 2.</note>

<pb n="790"/>
<p>And if thou art minded to learn these things more distinctly, I mean, the famines, the
pestilences, the earthquakes, the other calamities, peruse the history about these things
composed by Josephus, and thou wilt know all accurately. Therefore Himself too said, “Be
not troubled, for all must be;” and, “He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved;”
and, “The gospel shall surely be preached in all the world.” For when weakened and faint
at the fear of what had been said, He braces them up by saying, Though ten thousand things
be done, the gospel must be preached in every part of the world, and then shall the end
come.</p>
<p>4. Seest thou in what a state things were then, and how manifold was the war? And this
is the beginning, when each of the things to be effected most required quiet. In what state
then were they? for nothing hinders us from resuming the same things again. The first war
was that of the deceivers; “For there shall come,” He saith, “false Christs and false prophets:”
the second, that of the Romans, “For ye shall hear,” He saith, “of wars:” the third, that which
bringeth on the “famines:” the fourth, “the pestilences” and “the earthquakes:” the fifth,
“they shall deliver you into afflictions:” the sixth, “ye shall be hated of all men:” the seventh,
“They shall betray one another, and hate one another” (an intestine war doth He here make
known); then, “false Christs,” and false brethren; then, “the love of the most2771shall wax
cold,” which is the cause of all the ills.
Seest thou numberless kinds of war, new and strange? Yet nevertheless in the midst of
these things, and much more (for with the intestine wars was mingled also that of kinsmen),
the gospel prevailed over the whole earth. “For the gospel,” He saith, “shall be preached in
the whole world.”</p>
<p>Where then are they who set up the power of a nativity and the cycle of times against
the doctrines of the church? For who has ever recorded that another Christ appeared; that
such a thing took place? Although they falsely affirm other things, that ten myriads of years
passed, yet this they cannot even feign. Of what kind of cycle then would ye speak? For there
was never another Sodom, nor another Gomorrah, nor another flood. How long do ye trifle,
talking of a cycle and nativity?</p>
<p>How then, it is said, do many of the things they say come to pass? Because thou hast
bereaved thyself of the help God bestows, and didst betray thyself, and didst place thyself
without His providence; therefore doth the evil spirit turn and twist about thy matters as
he will.</p>
<note type="footnote">2771 [Only one ms. inserts τν πολλν here. Field rejects it. If accepted, it should be rendered “of the many,” as

<pb n="791"/>
<p>But not so among the saints, or rather not even amongst us sinners, who utterly despise
it. For although our practice is beyond endurance, yet because by God’s grace we cling with
much exactness to the doctrines of the truth, we are above the malice of the evil spirits.</p>
<p>And altogether, what is a nativity? nothing else than injustice, and confusion, and that
all things are borne along at random; or rather not at random only; but more than this, with
folly.</p>
<p>“And if there is not any nativity, whence is such a one rich? whence is such a one poor?”</p>
<p>I know not: for in this way I will for a time reason with thee, instructing thee not to be
curious about all things; neither in consequence of this to go on at random and rashly. For
neither because thou art ignorant of this, oughtest thou to feign the things that are not. It
is better to be ignorant well, than to learn ill. For he that knoweth not the cause, will come
soon to the right one; but he who because he does not know the real cause, feigns one that
is untrue, will not be able easily to receive the real; but he needs more both of labors and
toil, in order to take away the former. For indeed on a tablet, if it have been wiped smooth,
any one may easily write what he will, but when it is written upon, no longer in the same
way, for we must first wipe out what has been ill written. And amongst physicians again,
he that applies nothing, is far better than he that applies hurtful things; and he who builds
unsoundly, is worse than he who doth not so much as build at all; like as the land is far
better that bears nothing, than that which bears thorns.</p>
<p>Let us not then be impatient to learn all things, but let us endure to be even ignorant of
some things, that when we have found a teacher, we may not afford him double toil. Or
rather many oftentimes have remained even incurably diseased, by carelessly entangling
themselves in evil opinions. For neither is the toil the same to pluck up first what hath taken
root amiss, and then to sow, as to plant a clear ground. For in that case, he must overthrow
first, and then put in other things; but in this, the hearing is ready.</p>
<p>Whence then is such a one rich? I will say, now; many acquire wealth, by God’s gift;
and many by His permission. For this is the short and simple account.</p>
<p>What then? it is said, doth He make the whoremongers to be rich, and the adulterers,
and him that hath abused himself with mankind, and him that hath made a bad use of his
possessions? He doth not make them, but permits them to be rich; and great is the difference,
and quite infinite between making and permitting. But wherefore doth He suffer it at all?
Because it is not yet the time for judgment, that every one may receive according to his
merits.</p>
<p>For what more worthless than that rich man, who giveth not to Lazarus so much as of
his crumbs? Nevertheless, he was more wretched than all, for he came to be possessed not
even of a drop of water, and for this very cause most especially, that being rich he was cruel.

For if there are two wicked men, who have not had the same portion here, but one in wealth,
the other in poverty, they will not be similarly punished there, but the wealthier more
grievously.</p>
<p>5. Dost thou not see at least even this man, suffering more fearfully because he had
“received his good things?” Do thou also therefore, when thou seest in prosperity one who
is become rich by injustice, groan, weep; for indeed this wealth is to him an addition of
punishment. For like as they who sin much, and are not minded to repent, treasure up to
themselves a treasure of wrath; even so they, who, besides not being punished, are even enjoying
prosperity, will undergo the greater punishment.</p>
<p>And the proof of this, if thou wilt, I will show thee, not from the things to come only,
but also from the present life. For the blessed David, when he sinned that sin of Bathsheba,
and was convicted by the prophet, for this cause most of all was he more severely reproved,
that even when he had enjoyed such security, he was like this. Hear at least God upbraiding
him with this especially. “Did not I anoint thee for a king, and delivered thee from the hand
of Saul, and give thee all that pertained to thy master, and all the house of Israel and Judah,
and if it had been little for thee, I would have added thus and thus; and wherefore hast thou
done that which was evil in my sight?”2772 For not for all sins are there the same punishments,
but many and diverse, according to the times, according to the persons, according to their
rank, according to their understanding, according to other things besides. And that what I
say may be more clear, let one sin be set forth, fornication; and mark how many different
punishments I find not from myself, but from the divine Scriptures. Did any one commit
fornication before the law, he is differently punished; and this Paul showeth, “For as many
as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law.”2773 Did any one commit fornication
after the law? He shall suffer more grievous things. “For as many as have sinned in
the law shall be judged by the law.”2774 Did any one commit fornication being a priest, he
receives from his dignity a very great addition to his punishment. So for this cause, whereas
the other women were slain for fornication, the daughters of the priests were burnt; the
lawgiver showing the more amply, how great punishment await the priest if he commits
this sin. For if on the daughter he inflicts a greater punishment, because of her being a priest’s
daughter, much more on the man himself who bears the priest’s office. Was fornication
committed with any violence? she is even freed from punishment. Did one play the harlot
being rich, and another being poor? Here again also is a difference. And this is evident from
what we have said before concerning David. Was any one guilty of fornication after Christ’s

<pb n="793"/>
coming? Should he depart uninitiated, he will suffer a punishment more sore than all those.
Was any guilty of fornication after the laver? in this case not even a consolation is left for
the sin any more. And this selfsame thing Paul declared when he said, “He that despised
Moses’ law dieth without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment
suppose ye shall he be counted worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God,
and hath counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the
grace of the Spirit?2775 Hath any been guilty of fornication, bearing the priest’s office now?
this above all is the crown of the evil deeds.</p>
<p>Seest thou of one sin how many different forms? one that before the law, another that
after the law, another that of him who bears the priest’s office; that of the rich woman, and
that of the poor woman, of her that is a catechumen, and of the believing woman, of the
daughter of the priest.</p>
<p>And from the knowledge again great is the difference; “For he which knew his Lord’s
will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.”2776 And to sin after examples bringeth
greater vengeance. Therefore He saith, “But ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards,”
2777though ye had had the advantage of much care. Therefore He upbraids Jerusalem
likewise with this saying, “How often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye
would not!”2778</p>
<p>And to sin being in luxury, this is shown by the history of Lazarus. And from the place
also the sin becomes more grievous, which He Himself indicated when He said, “Between
the temple and the altar.”2779</p>
<p>And from the equality of the offenses themselves, “It is not marvellous if one be taken
stealing;”2780and again, “Thou didst slay thy sons and thy daughters; this is beyond all thy
whoredoms, and thine abominations.”2781</p>
<p>And from the persons again: “If one man sin against another, they shall pray for him;
but if he sin against God, who shall entreat for him?”2782</p>

<p>And when one is not sobered even by the examples of others, “She saw her sister,” it is
said, “and justified her.”2784

mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago; but it
shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for that city.”2785</p>
<p>Seest thou perfect exactness, and that all for the same sins are not paying the same
penalty? For moreover when we have had the benefit of long-suffering, and profit nothing,
we shall endure worse things. And this Paul shows, where he says, “But after thy hardness
and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up for thyself wrath.”2786</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us not be offended, neither let us be confounded at any
of the things that happen, nor bring in upon us the storm of thought, but giving place to
God’s providence, let us give heed to virtue, and flee vice, that we may also attain to the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom

<p>Matt. XXIV. 16-18.</p>
<p>“Then let them which be in Judæa flee into the mountains. And let him that is on the housetop
not come down to take anything out of his house. Neither let him which is in his field return
back to take his clothes.”2787</p>
<p>Having spoken of the ills that were to overtake the city, and of the trials of the apostles,
and that they should remain unsubdued, and should overrun the whole world, He mentions
again the Jews’ calamities, showing that when the one should be glorious, having taught the
whole world, the others should be in calamity.</p>
<p>And see how He relates the war, by the things that seem to be small setting forth how
intolerable it was to be. For, “Then,” saith He, “let them which be in Judæa flee into the
mountains.” Then, When? When these things should be, “when the abomination of desolation
should stand in the holy place.” Whence he seems to me to be speaking of the armies. Flee
therefore then, saith He, for thenceforth there is no hope of safety for you.</p>
<p>For since it had fallen out, that they often had recovered themselves in grievous wars,
as under Sennacherib, under Antiochus again (for when at that time also, armies had come
in upon them, and the temple had been seized beforehand, the Maccabees rallying gave
their affairs an opposite turn); in order then that they might not now also suspect this, that
there would be any such change, He forbids them all thought of the kind. For it were well,
saith He, to escape henceforth with one’s naked body. Therefore them also that are on the
housetop, He suffers not to enter into the house to take their clothes, indicating the evils to
be inevitable, and the calamity without end, and that it must needs be that he that was involved
therein should surely perish. Therefore He adds also, him that is in the field, saying,
neither let this man turn back to take his clothes. For if they that are in doors flee, much
more they that are out of doors ought not to take refuge within.</p>
<p>“Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck,”2788to the one because
of their greater inertness, and because they cannot flee easily, being weighed down by the
burden of their pregnancy; to the other, because they are held by the tie of feeling for their
children, and cannot save their sucklings. For money it is a light thing to despise, and an
easy thing to provide, and clothes; but the bonds of nature how could any one escape? how
could the pregnant woman become active? how could she that gives suck be able to overlook
that which she had borne?</p>
<note type="footnote">2787 [In minor details the Greek text agrees with the received against that of our oldest mss. authorities.—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2788 Matt. xxiv. 19.</note>

<pb n="796"/>
<p>Then, to show again the greatness of the calamity, He saith, “Pray ye that your flight be
not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day. For then shall be great tribulation, such as
was not since the beginning of the world until now, neither shall be.”2789</p>
<p>Seest thou that His discourse is addressed to the Jews, and that He is speaking of the ills
that should overtake them? For the apostles surely were not to keep the Sabbath day, neither
to be there, when Vespasian did those things. For indeed the most part of them were already
departed this life. And if any was left, he was dwelling then in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>But wherefore neither “in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day?”2790 Not in the winter,
because of the difficulty arising from the season; not on the Sabbath day, because of the absolute
authority exercised by the law. For since they had need of flight, and of the swiftest
flight, but neither would the Jews dare to flee on the Sabbath day, because of the law, neither
in winter was such a thing easy; therefore, “Pray ye,” saith He; “for then shall be tribulation,
such as never was, neither shall be.”</p>
<p>And let not any man suppose this to have been spoken hyperbolically; but let him study
the writings of Josephus, and learn the truth of the sayings. For neither can any one say,
that the man being a believer, in order to establish Christ’s words, hath exaggerated the
tragical history. For indeed He was both a Jew, and a determined Jew, and very zealous, and
among them that lived after Christ’s coming.</p>
<p>What then saith this man? That those terrors surpassed all tragedy, and that no such
had ever overtaken the nation. For so great was the famine, that the very mothers fought
about the devouring of their children, and that there were wars about this; and he saith that
many when they were dead had their bellies ripped up.</p>
<p>I should therefore be glad to inquire of the Jews. Whence came there thus upon them
wrath from God intolerable, and more sore than all that had befallen aforetime, not in Judæa
only, but in any part of the world? Is it not quite clear, that it was for the deed of the cross,
and for this rejection? All would say it, and with all and before all the truth of the facts itself.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, the exceeding greatness of the ills, when not only compared with
the time before, they appear more grievous, but also with all the time to come. For not in
all the world, neither in all time that is past, and that is to come, shall any one be able to say
such ills have been. And very naturally; for neither had any man perpetrated, not of those
that ever have been, nor of those to come hereafter, a deed so wicked and horrible. Therefore
He saith, “there shall be tribulation such as never was, nor shall be.”</p>

<pb n="797"/>
<p>“And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved; but for the
elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.”2791 By these things He shows them to be deserving
of a more grievous punishment than had been mentioned, speaking now of the days of the
war and of that siege. But what He saith is like this. If, saith He, the war of the Romans
against the city had prevailed further, all the Jews had perished (for by “no flesh” here, He
meaneth no Jewish flesh), both those abroad, and those at home. For not only against those
in Judæa did they war, but also those that were dispersed everywhere they outlawed and
banished, because of their hatred against the former.</p>
<p>2. But whom doth He here mean by the elect? The believers that were shut up in the
midst of them. For that Jews may not say that because of the gospel, and the worship of
Christ, these ills took place, He showeth, that so far from the believers being the cause, if it
had not been for them, all had perished utterly. For if God had permitted the war to be
protracted, not so much as a remnant of the Jews had remained, but lest those of them who
had become believers should perish together with the unbelieving Jews, He quickly put
down the fighting, and gave an end to the war. Therefore He saith, “But for the elect’s sake
they shall be shortened.” But these things He said to leave an encouragement to those of
them who were shut up in the midst of them, and to allow them to take breath, that they
might not be in fear, as though they were to perish with them. And if here so great is His
care for them, that for their sakes others also are saved, and that for the sake of Christians
remnants were left of the Jews, how great will be their honor in the time for their crowns?</p>
<p>By this He also encouraged them not to be distressed at their own dangers, since these
others are suffering such things, and for no profit, but for evil upon their own head.</p>
<p>But He not only encouraged them, but also led them off secretly and unsuspectedly
from the customs of the Jews. For if there is not to be a change afterwards, and the temple
is not to stand, it is quite evident that the law also shall be made to cease.</p>
<p>However, He spake not this openly, but by their entire destruction He darkly intimated
it. But He spake it not openly, lest He should startle them before the time. Wherefore neither
at the beginning did He of Himself fall into discourse touching these things; but having first
lamented over the city, He constrained them to show Him the stones, and question Him,
in order that as it were in answering them their question, He might declare to them beforehand
all the things to come.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, the dispensation of the Spirit, that John wrote none of these
things, lest he should seem to write from the very history of the things done (for indeed he
lived a long time after the taking of the city), but they, who died before the taking, and had
<note type="footnote">2791 Matt. xxiv. 22. [R.V., “And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but,”
etc.]</note>

<pb n="798"/>
seen none of these things, they write it, in order that every way the power of the prediction
should clearly shine forth.</p>
<p>“Then, if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not: for there
shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, so as to deceive,
if possible, the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.2792 Wherefore if they shall say
unto you, Behold, He is in the desert, go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers,
believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west,
so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there shall
the eagles be gathered together.”2793</p>
<p>Having finished what concerned Jerusalem, He passes on to His own coming, and tells
the signs of it, not for their use only, but for us also, and for all that shall come after us.</p>
<p>“Then.” When? Here, as I have often said, the word, “then,” relates not to the connection
in order of time with the things before mentioned. At least, when He was minded to express
the connection of time, He added, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days,”2794but
here not so, but, “then,” not meaning what should follow straightway after these things, but
what should be in the time, when these things were to be done, of which He was about to
speak. So also when it is said, “In those days cometh John the Baptist,”2795he is not speaking
of the time that should straightway follow, but that many years after, and that in which these
things were done, of which He was about to speak. For, in fact, having spoken of the birth
of Jesus, and of the coming of the magi, and of the death of Herod, He at once saith, “In
those days cometh John the Baptist;” although thirty years had intervened. But this is customary
in the Scripture, I mean, to use this manner of narration. So then here also, having
passed over all the intermediate time from the taking of Jerusalem unto the preludes of the
consummation, He speaketh of the time just before the consummation. “Then,” He saith
therefore, “if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe it not.”</p>
<p>Awhile He secures them by the place, mentioning the distinguishing marks of His second
coming, and the indications of the deceivers. For not, as when at His former coming He
appeared in Bethlehem, and in a small corner of the world, and no one knew Him at the
beginning, so doth He say it shall be then too; but openly and with all circumstance, and so
as not to need one to tell these things. And this is no small sign that He will not come secretly.</p>
<p>But mark how here He saith nothing of war (for He is interpreting the doctrine concerning
His advent), but of them that attempt to deceive. For some in the days of the apostles
deceived the multitude, “for they shall come,” saith He, “and shall deceive many;”2796and

<pb n="799"/>
others shall do so before His second coming, who shall also be more grievous than the
former. “For they shall show,” He saith, “signs and wonders, so as to deceive if possible the
very elect:”2797here He is speaking of Antichrist, and indicates that some also shall minister
to him. Of him Paul too speaks on this wise. Having called him “man of sin,” and “son of
perdition,” He added, “Whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs
and lying wonders; and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.”2798</p>
<p>And see how He secures them; “Go not forth into the deserts, enter not into the secret
chambers.” He did not say, “Go, and do not believe;” but, “Go not forth, neither depart
thither.” For great then will be the deceiving, because that even deceiving miracles are
wrought.</p>
<p>3. Having told them how Antichrist cometh, as, for instance, that it will be in a place;
He saith how Himself also cometh. How then doth He Himself come? “As the lightning
cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son
of Man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there also will the eagles be gathered together.”2799</p>
<p>How then shineth the lightning? It needs not one to talk of it, it needs not a herald, but
even to them that sit in houses, and to them in chambers it shows itself in an instant of time
throughout the whole world. So shall that coming be, showing itself at once everywhere by
reason of the shining forth of His glory. But He mentions also another sign, “where the
carcase is, there also shall the eagles be;” meaning the multitude of the angels, of the martyrs,
of all the saints.</p>
<p>Then He tells of fearful prodigies. What are these prodigies? “Immediately after the
tribulation of those days,” saith He, “the sun shall be darkened.”2800 Of the tribulation of
what days doth He speak? Of those of Antichrist and of the false prophets? For there shall
be great tribulation, there being so many deceivers. But it is not protracted to a length of
time. For if the Jewish war was shortened for the elect’s sake, much more shall this temptation
be limited for these same’s sake. Therefore, He said not, “after the tribulation,” but Immediately
“after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened,” for almost at the same
time all things come to pass. For the false prophets and false Christs shall come and cause
confusion, and immediately He Himself will be here. Because no small turmoil is then to
prevail over the world.</p>
<p>But how doth He come? The very creation being then transfigured, for “the sun shall
be darkened,” not destroyed, but overcome by the light of His presence; and the stars shall
fall, for what shall be the need of them thenceforth, there being no night? and “the powers

of Heaven shall be shaken,” and in all likelihood, seeing so great a change come to pass. For
if when the stars were made, they trembled and marvelled (“for when the stars were made,
all angels,” it is said, “praised Me with a loud voice”);2801much more seeing all things in
course of change, and their fellow servants giving account, and the whole world standing
by that awful judgment-seat, and those who have lived from Adam unto His coming, having
an account demanded of them of all that they did, how shall they but tremble, and be shaken?</p>
<p>“Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven;”2802that is, the cross being
brighter than the sun, since this last will be darkened, and hide himself, and that will appear
when it would not appear, unless it were far brighter than the beams of the sun. But
wherefore doth the sign appear? In order that the shamelessness of the Jews may be more
abundantly silenced. For having the cross as the greatest plea, Christ thus cometh to that
judgment-seat, showing not His wounds only, but also the death of reproach. “Then shall
the tribes mourn,” for there shall be no need of an accusation, when they see the cross; and
they shall mourn, that by His death they are nothing benefited; because they crucified Him
whom they ought to have adored.</p>
<p>Seest thou how fearfully He has pictured His coming? how He has stirred up the spirits
of His disciples? For this reason, let me add, He puts the mournful things first, and then the
good things, that in this way also He may comfort and refresh them. And of His passion He
suggests to them the remembrance, and of His resurrection, and with a display of glory,2803
He mentions His cross, so that they may not be ashamed nor grieve, whereas indeed He
cometh then setting it forth for His sign. And another saith, “They shall look on Him whom
they pierced.” Therefore it is that they shall mourn, when they see that this is He.</p>
<p>And forasmuch as He had made mention of the cross, He added, “They shall see the
Son of Man coming,” no longer on the cross, but “in the clouds of Heaven, with power and
great glory.”2804</p>
<p>For think not, He meaneth, because thou hearest of the cross, that it is again anything
mournful, for He shall come with power and great glory. But He bringeth it, that their sin
may be self-condemned, as if any one who had been struck by a stone, were to show the
stone itself, or his garments stained with blood. And He cometh in a cloud as He was taken
up, and the tribes seeing these things mourn. Not however that the terrors shall with them
proceed no further than mournings; but the mourning shall be, that they may bring forth
their sentence from within, and condemn themselves.</p>

<p>And then again, “He will send His angels with a great trumpet,2805and they shall gather
the elect from the four winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.”2806</p>
<p>But when thou hast heard of this, consider the punishment of them that remain. For
neither shall they suffer that former penalty only, but this too. And as above He said, that
they should say, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,”2807so here, that they
shall mourn. For since He had spoken unto them of grievous wars, that they might learn,
that together with the fearful things here, the torments there also await them, He brings
them in mourning and separated from the elect, and consigned to hell; by this again rousing
the disciples, and indicating from how many evils they should be delivered, and how many
good things they shall enjoy.</p>
<p>4. And why now doth He call them by angels, if He comes thus openly? To honor them
in this way also. But Paul saith, that they “shall be caught up in clouds.” And He said this
also, when He was speaking concerning a resurrection. “For2808the Lord Himself,” it is said,
“shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel.” So that when
risen again, the angels shall gather them together, when gathered together the clouds shall
catch them up; and all these things are done in a moment, in an instant. For it is not that
He abiding above calleth them, but He Himself cometh with the sound of a trumpet. And
what mean the trumpets and the sound? They are for arousing, for gladness, to set forth the
amazing nature of the things then doing, for grief to them that are left.</p>
<p>Woe is me for that fearful day! For though we ought to rejoice when we hear these
things, we feel pain, and are dejected, and our countenance is sad. Or is it I only that feel
thus, and do ye rejoice at hearing of these things? For upon me at least there comes a kind
of shudder when these things are said, and I lament bitterly, and groan from the very depth
of my heart. For I have no part in these things, but in those that are spoken afterwards, that
are said unto the virgins, unto him that buried the talents he had received, unto the wicked
servant. For this cause I weep, to think from what glory we are to be cast out, from what
hope of blessings, and this perpetually, and forever, to spare ourselves a little labor. For if
indeed this were a great toil, and a grievous law, we ought even so to do all things; nevertheless
many of the remiss would seem to have at least some pretext, a poor pretext indeed, yet
would they seem to have some, that the toil was great, and the time endless, and the burden
intolerable; but now we can put forward no such objection; which circumstance most of all
will gnaw2809us no less than hell at that time, when for want of a slight endeavor, and a little

toil, we shall have lost Heaven, and the unspeakable blessings. For both the time is short,
and the labor small, and yet we faint and are supine. Thou strivest on earth, and the crown
is in Heaven; thou art punished of men, and art honored of God; the race is for two days,
and the reward for endless ages; the struggle is a corruptible body, and the rewards in an
incorruptible.</p>
<p>And apart from these things, we should consider another point also, that even if we do
not choose to suffer any of the things that are painful for Christ’s sake, we must in other
ways most assuredly endure them. For neither, though thou shouldest not have died for
Christ, wilt thou be immortal; neither though thou shouldest not have cast away thy riches
for Christ, wilt thou go away hence with them. These things He requires of thee, which although
He should not require them, thou wilt have to give up, because thou art mortal; He
willeth thee to do these by thy choice, which thou must do by necessity. So much only He
requires to be added, that it be done for His sake; since that these things befall men and pass
away, cometh to pass of natural necessity. Seest thou how easy the conflict? What it is altogether
necessary for thee to suffer, that choose to suffer for my sake; let this only be added,
and I have sufficient obedience. The gold which thou intendest to lend to another, this lend
to me, both at more profit, and in greater security. Thy body, wherewith thou art going to
warfare for another, make it to war for me, for indeed I surpass thy toils with recompenses
in the most abundant excess. Yet thou in all other matters preferrest him that giveth thee
more as well in loans, as in marketing and in warfare; but Christ alone, when giving more,
and infinitely more than all, thou dost not receive. And what is this so great hostility? What
is this so great enmity? Where will there be any excuse or defense left for thee, when the
reasons for which thou preferrest man to man avail not to induce thee to prefer God to
man?</p>
<p>Why dost thou commit thy treasure to the earth? “Give it into my hand,” He saith. Doth
not the earth’s Lord seem to thee more worthy of trust than the earth? This indeed restoreth
that which thou laidest in it, though oftentimes not even this, but He gives thee also recompense
for His keeping of it? For indeed He doth exceedingly love us. Therefore if thou
shouldest wish to lend, He stands ready; or to sow, He receives it; or if thou shouldest wish
to build, He draws thee unto Himself, saying, Build in my regions. Why runnest thou unto
poor, unto beggarly men, who also for little gains occasion thee great trouble? Nevertheless,
not even on hearing these things, do we make up our minds to it, but where are fightings
and wars, and wild struggles,2810and trials and suits of law, and false accusations, thither
do we hasten.</p>
<p>5. Doth He not justly turn away from us, and punish us, when He is giving up Himself
unto us for all things, and we are resisting Him? It is surely plain to all. For whether thou
<note type="footnote">2810 παγκρτια.</note>

<pb n="803"/>
art desirous to adorn thyself, “Let it, He saith, be with my ornaments;” or to arm thyself,
“with my arms,” or to clothe thyself, “with my raiment;” or to feed thyself, “at my table;” or
to journey, “on my way;” or to inherit, “my inheritance;” or to enter into a country, “the
city of which I am builder and maker;” or to build a house, “amongst my tabernacles.” “For
I, so far from asking thee for a recompense of the things that I give thee, to even make myself
owe thee a recompense for this very thing, if thou be willing to use all I have.” What can be
equal to this munificence, “I am Father, I am brother, I am bridegroom, I am dwelling place,
I am food, I am raiment, I am root, I am foundation, all whatsoever thou willest, I am.” “Be
thou in need of nothing, I will be even a servant, for I came to minister, not to be ministered
unto; I am friend, and member, and head, and brother, and sister, and mother; I am all; only
cling thou closely2811to me. I was poor for thee, and a wanderer for thee, on the cross for
thee, in the tomb for thee, above I intercede for thee to the Father; on earth I am come for
thy sake am ambassador from my Father. Thou art all things to me, brother, and joint heir,
and friend, and member.” What wouldest thou more? Why dost thou turn away from Him,
who loveth thee? Why dost thou labor for the world? Why dost thou draw water into a
broken cistern? For it is this to labor for the present life. Why dost thou comb wool into the
fire? Why dost thou “beat the air?”2812 Why dost thou “run in vain?”2813</p>
<p>Hath not every art an end? It is surely plain to every one. Do thou also show the end of
thy worldly eagerness. But thou canst not; for, “vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”2814 Let us
go to the tombs; show me thy father; show me thy wife. Where is he that was clad in raiment
of gold? he that rode in the chariot? he that had armies, that had the girdle,2815that had the
heralds? he that was slaying these, and casting those into prison? he that put to death whom
he would, and set free whom he was minded? I see nothing but bones, and a worm, and a
spider’s web; all those things are earth, all those a fable, all a dream, and a shadow, and a
bare relation, and a picture, or rather not so much as a picture. For the picture we see at
least in a likeness, but here not so much as a likeness.</p>
<p>And would that the evils stop with this. For now the honor, and the luxury, and the
distinction, end with a shadow, with words; but the consequences of them, are no longer
limited to a shadow and to words, but continue, and will pass over with us elsewhere, and
will be manifest to all, the rapine, the covetousness, the fornications, the adulteries, the
dreadful things beyond number; these not in similitude, neither in ashes, but written above,
both words and deeds.</p>

<p>With what eyes then shall we behold Christ? For if any one could not bear to see his
father, when conscious to himself that he had sinned against him, upon Him who infinitely
exceeds a father in forbearance how shall we then look? how shall we bear it? For indeed
we shall stand at Christ’s judgment-seat, and there will be a strict inquiry into all things.</p>
<p>But if any man disbelieve the judgments to come, let him look at the things here, at
those in the prisons, those in the mines, those on the dunghills, the possessed, the frantic,
them that are struggling with incurable diseases, those that are fighting against continual
poverty, them that live in famine, them that are pierced with irremediable woes, those in
captivity. For these persons would not suffer these things here, unless vengeance and punishments
were to await all the others also that have committed such sins. And if the rest
have undergone nothing here, you ought to regard this very fact as a sign that there is surely
something to follow after our departure here. For the self-same God of all would not take
vengeance on some, and leave others unpunished, who have committed the same or more
grievous offenses, unless He designed to bring some punishments upon them there.</p>
<p>By these arguments then and these examples let us also humble ourselves; and let them
who are obstinate unbelievers of the judgment believe it henceforth, and become better
men; that having lived here in a manner worthy of the kingdom, we may attain unto the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXIV. 33, 34.</p>
<p>“Now learn a parable of the fig tree; when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,
ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that
it is near, even at the doors.”2816</p>
<p>Forasmuch as He had said, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days;” but they
sought of this, after how long a time it should be, and desired to know in particular the very
day, therefore He puts also the similitude of the fig tree, indicating that the interval was not
great, but that in quick succession would occur His advent also. And this He declared not
by the parable alone, but by the words that follow, saying, “know that it is near, even at the
doors.”2817</p>
<p>Whereby He foretells another thing also, a spiritual summer, and a calm that should be
on that day (after the present tempest) for the righteous; but to the sinners the contrary,
winter after summer, which He declares in what follows, saying, that the day shall come
upon them, when they are living in luxury.</p>
<p>But not for this intent only did He put forward this about the fig tree, in order to declare
the interval; for it was possible to have set this before them in other ways as well; but that
he might hereby also confirm His saying, as assuredly thus to come to pass. For as this of
the fig tree is of necessity, so that too. For thus, wherever He is minded to speak of that which
will assuredly come to pass, He brings forward the necessary courses of nature, both Himself,
and the blessed Paul imitating Him. Therefore also when speaking of His resurrection, He
saith, “When the corn of wheat hath fallen into the earth, except it die, it abideth alone; but
if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”2818 Whereby also the blessed Paul being instructed
uses the same similitude,2819“Thou fool,” he saith, “that which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die.”2820</p>
<p>After this, that they might not straightway return to it again, and say, “When?” he brings
to their remembrance the things that had been said, saying, “Verily I say unto you, This
<note type="footnote">2816 [R.V., “Now from the fig-tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth

generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled!”2821 All these things. What things?
I pray thee. Those about Jerusalem, those about the wars, about the famines, about the pestilences,
about the earthquakes, about the false Christs, about the false prophets, about the
sowing of the gospel everywhere, the seditions, the tumults, all the other things, which we
said were to occur until His coming. How then, one may ask, did He say, “This generation?”
Speaking not of the generation then living, but of that of the believers. For He is wont to
distinguish a generation not by times only, but also by the mode of religious service, and
practice; as when He saith, “This is the generation of them that seek the Lord.”2822</p>
<p>For what He said above, “All these must come to pass,”2823and again, “the gospel shall
be preached,”2824this He declares here also, saying, All these things shall surely come to
pass, and the generation of the faithful shall remain, cut off by none of the things that have
been mentioned. For both Jerusalem shall perish, and the more part of the Jews shall be
destroyed, but over this generation shall nothing prevail, not famine, not pestilence, not
earthquake, nor the tumults of wars, not false Christs, not false prophets, not deceivers, not
traitors, not those that cause to offend, not the false brethren, nor any other such like
temptation whatever.</p>
<p>Then to lead them on more in faith, He saith, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
my words shall not pass away;”2825that is, it were more easy for these firm, fixed, and immoveable
bodies to be blotted out, than for ought of my words to fall to the ground. And
he who gainsays these things, let him test His sayings, and when he hath found them true
(for so he surely will find them) from what is past, let him believe also the things to come,
and let him search out all things with diligence, and he will see the actual events bearing
witness to the truth of the prophecy. And the elements He hath brought forward, at once
to declare, that the church is of more honor than Heaven and earth, and at the same time
to indicate Himself by this also to be maker of all. For since He was speaking of the end, a
thing disbelieved by many, He brought forward Heaven and earth, indicating His unspeakable
power, and showing with great authority, that He is Lord of all, and by these things rendering
His sayings deserving of credit, even with those who are much given to doubt.</p>
<p>“But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of Heaven,2826neither
the Son,2827but the Father.” By saying, not the angels, He stopped their mouths, that they

<pb n="807"/>
should not seek to learn what these angels know not; and by saying, “neither the Son,” forbids
them not only to learn, but even to inquire. For in proof that therefore He said this, see after
His resurrection, when He saw they were become over curious, how He stopped their mouths
more decidedly. For now indeed He hath mentioned infallible signs, many and endless; but
then He saith merely, “It is not for you to know times or seasons.” And then that they might
not say, we are driven to perplexity, we are utterly scorned, we are not held worthy so much
as of this, He says, “which the Father hath put in His own power.”2828 And this, because He
was exceedingly careful to honor them, and to conceal nothing from them. Therefore He
refers it to His Father, both to make the thing awful, and to exclude that of which He had
spoken from their inquiry. Since if it be not this, but He is ignorant of it, when will He know
it? Will it be together with us? But who would say this? And the Father He knoweth clearly,
even as clearly as He knoweth the Son; and of the day is He ignorant? Moreover, “the Spirit
indeed searcheth even the deep things of God,”2829and doth not He know so much as the
time of the judgment? But how He ought to judge He knoweth, and of the secrets of each
He hath a full perception; and what is far more common than that, of this could He be ignorant?
And how, if “all things were made by Him, and without Him was not even one
thing made,”2830was He ignorant of the day? For He who made the worlds,2831it is quite
plain that He made the times also; and if the times, even that day. How then is He ignorant
of that which He made?</p>
<p>2. And ye indeed say that ye know even His substance,2832but that the Son not even the
day, the Son, who is always in the bosom of the Father; and yet His substance is much
greater than the days, even infinitely greater. How then, while assigning to yourselves the
greater things, do you not allow even the less to the Son, “in whom are hid all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge.”2833 But neither do you know what God is in His substance,
though ten thousand times ye talk thus madly, neither is the Son ignorant of the day, but is
even in full certainty thereof.</p>
<p>For this cause, I say, when He had told all things, both the times and the seasons, and
had brought it to the very doors (“for it is near,” He saith, “even at the doors”), He was silent

as to the day. For if thou seek after the day and hour, thou shalt not hear them of me, saith
He; but if of times and preludes, without hiding anything, I will tell thee all exactly.</p>
<p>For that indeed I am not ignorant of it, I have shown by many things; having mentioned
intervals, and all the things that are to occur, and how short from this present time until the
day itself (for this did the parable of the fig tree indicate), and I lead thee to the very vestibule;
and if I do not open unto thee the doors, this also I do for your good.</p>
<p>And that thou mayest learn by another thing also, that the silence is not a mark of ignorance
on His part, see, together with what we have mentioned, how He sets forth another
sign also. “But as in the days of Noe they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the day that the flood came, and took all away; so shall also the coming of
the Son of Man be.”2834 And these things He spake, showing that He should come on a
sudden, and unexpectedly, and when the more part were living luxuriously. For Paul too
saith this, writing on this wise, “When they shall speak of peace and safety, then sudden
destruction cometh upon them;” and to show how unexpected, He said, “as travail upon a
woman with child.”2835 How then doth He say, “after the tribulation of those days?” For if
there be luxury then, and peace, and safety, as Paul saith, how doth He say, “after the
tribulation of those days?” If there be luxury, how is there tribulation? Luxury for them that
are in a state of insensibility and peace. Therefore He said not, when there is peace, but
“when they speak of peace and safety,” indicating their insensibility to be such as of those
in Noah’s time, for that amid such evils they lived in luxury.</p>
<p>But not so the righteous, but they were passing their time in tribulation and dejection.
Whereby He shows, that when Antichrist is come, the pursuit of unlawful pleasures shall
be more eager among the transgressors, and those that have learnt to despair of their own
salvation. Then shall be gluttony, then revellings, and drunkenness. Wherefore also most
of all He puts forth an example corresponding to the thing. For like as when the ark was
making, they believed not, saith He; but while it was set in the midst of them, proclaiming
beforehand the evils that are to come, they, when they saw it, lived in pleasure, just as though
nothing dreadful were about to take place; so also now, Antichrist indeed shall appear, after
whom is the end, and the punishments at the end, and vengeance intolerable; but they that
are held by the intoxication of wickedness shall not so much as perceive the dreadful nature
of the things that are on the point of being done. Wherefore also Paul saith, “as travail upon
a woman with child,” even so shall those fearful and incurable evils come upon them.</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not speak of the ills in Sodom? It was His will to introduce an
example embracing all men,2836and disbelieved after it was foretold. So therefore, as by the
<note type="footnote">2834 Matt. xxiv. 38, 39. [The passage is abridged.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2835 1 Thess. v. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">2836 καθολικν.</note>

<pb n="809"/>
more part the things to come are disbelieved, He confirms those things by the past, terrifying
their minds. And together with the points I have mentioned, He shows this also, that of the
former things also He was the doer. Then again He sets another sign, by all which things
He makes it evident, that He is not ignorant of the day. And what is the sign? “Then shall
two be in the field; one shall be taken, and one left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill,
one shall be taken, and one left. Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
come.”2837 And all these things are both proofs that He knew, and calculated to turn them
from their inquiry. So for this cause He spake also of the days of Noe, for this cause He said
too, “Two shall be on the bed,” signifying this, that He should come upon them thus unexpectedly,
when they were thus without thought, and “two women grinding at the mill,”
which also of itself is not the employment of them that are taking thought.</p>
<p>And together with this, He declares that as well servants as masters should be both taken
and left, both those who are at ease, and those in toil, as well from the one rank as from the
other; even as in the Old Testament He saith, “From him that sitteth upon the throne to the
captive woman that is at the mill.”2838 For since He had said, that hardly are the rich saved,
He shows that not even these are altogether lost, neither are the poor saved all of them, but
both out of these and out of those are men saved, and lost.</p>
<p>And to me He seems to declare, that at night will be the advent. For this Luke too
saith.2839 Seest thou how accurately He knows all things?</p>
<p>After this again, that they may not ask about it, He added, “Watch therefore, for ye
know not what hour your Lord doth come.”2840 He said not, “I know not,” but, “ye know
not.” For when He had brought them well nigh to the very hour, and had placed them there,
again He deters them from the inquiry, from a desire that they should be striving always.
Therefore He saith, “Watch,” showing that for the sake of this, He did not tell it.</p>
<p>“But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief
would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken
up. Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man
cometh.”2841</p>
<note type="footnote">2837 Matt. xxiv. 40–42. [The citation agrees with the received text, except in the omission of the articles in

be broken through.…in an hour ye think not,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="810"/>
<p>For this intent He tells them not, in order that they may watch, that they may be always
ready; therefore He saith, When ye look not for it, then He will come, desiring that they
should be anxiously waiting, and continually in virtuous action.</p>
<p>But His meaning is like this: if the common sort of men knew when they were to die,
they would surely strive earnestly at that hour.</p>
<p>3. In order therefore that they may strive, not at that hour only, therefore He tells them
not either the common hour, or the hour of each, desiring them to be ever looking for this,
that they may be always striving. Wherefore He made the end of each man’s life also uncertain.</p>
<p>After this, He openly calls Himself Lord, having nowhere spoken so distinctly. But here
He seems to me also to put to shame the careless, that not even as much care as they that
expect a thief have taken for their money, not even this much do these take for their own
soul. For they indeed, when they expect it, watch, and suffer none of the things in their
house to be carried off; but ye, although knowing that He will come, and come assuredly,
continue not watching, saith He, and ready so as not to be carried away hence unprepared.
So that the day cometh unto destruction for them that sleep. For as that man, if he had
known, would have escaped, so also ye, if ye be ready, escape free.</p>
<p>Then, as He had fallen upon the mention of the judgment, He directs His discourse to
the teachers next, speaking of punishment and honors; and having put first them that do
right, He ends with them that continue in sin, making His discourse to close with that which
is alarming.</p>
<p>Wherefore He first saith this, “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord
shall set over2842 His household to give them their meat in their2843due season? Blessed is
that servant, whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you,
that He shall make him ruler over all His goods.”2844</p>
<p>Tell me, is this too the language of one who is in ignorance? For if because He said,
“neither doth the Son know,” thou sayest He is ignorant of it; as He saith, “who then?” what
wilt thou say? Wilt thou say He is ignorant of this too? Away with the thought. For not even
one of them that are frantic would say this. And yet in the former case one might assign a
cause; but here not even this. And what when He said, “Peter, lovest thou me?”2845asking
it, knew He not so much as this? nor when He said, “Where have ye laid him?”2846</p>

<pb n="811"/>
<p>And the Father too will be found to be saying such things. For He Himself likewise saith,
“Adam, where art thou?”2847and, “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is waxed great before
me. I will go down therefore, and see whether their doings be according to their cry which
cometh unto me, and if not, I will know.”2848 And elsewhere He saith, “Whether they will
hear, whether they will understand.”2849 And in the gospel too, “It may be they will reverence
my Son:”2850all which are expressions of ignorance. But not in ignorance did He say these
things, but as compassing objects such as became Him: in the case of Adam, that He might
drive him to make an excuse for his sin: in that of the Sodomites, that He might teach us
never to be positive, till we are present at the very deeds; in that of the prophet, that the
prediction might not appear in the judgment of the foolish a kind of compulsion to disobedience;
and in the parable in the gospel, that He might show that they ought to have done this,
and to have reverenced the Son: but here, as well that they may not be curious, nor over
busy again, as that He might indicate that this was a rare and precious thing. And see of
what great ignorance this saying is indicative, if at least He know not even him that is set
over. For He blesses him indeed, “For blessed,” saith He, “is that servant;” but He saith not
who this is. “For who is he,” He saith, “whom His Lord shall set over?” and, “Blessed is he
whom He shall find so doing.”</p>
<p>But these things are spoken not of money only, but also of speech, and of power, and
of gifts, and of every stewardship, wherewith each is entrusted. This parable would suit
rulers in the state also, for every one is bound to make full use of what he hath for the
common advantage. If it be wisdom thou hast, if power, if wealth, if what it may, let it not
be for the hurt of thy fellow-servants, neither for thine own ruin. For this cause, therefore,
He requires both things of him, wisdom, and fidelity: for sin arises from folly also. He calls
him faithful then, because he hath purloined nothing, neither misspent his Lord’s goods
without aim or fruit; and wise, because he knew how to dispense the things given him, according
as was fit. For indeed we have need of both things, as well not to purloin the goods
of our Master, as also to dispense them as is fit. But if the one be wanting, the other halteth.
For if he be faithful and steal not, yet were to waste and to spend upon that which concerned
him not, great were the blame; and if he should know how to dispense it well, yet were to
purloin, again there is no common charge against him.</p>
<p>And let us also that have money listen to these things. For not unto teachers only doth
He discourse, but also unto the rich. For either sort were entrusted with riches; those that
teach with the more necessary wealth, ye with what is inferior. When then at the time that

the teachers are scattering abroad the greater, ye are not willing to show forth your liberality
even in the less, or rather not liberality but honesty (for ye give the things of another), what
excuse will you have? But now, before the punishment of them that do the contrary things,
let us hear the honor of him that approveth himself. “For verily I say unto you, He will set
him over all His goods.”</p>
<p>What can be equal to this honor? what manner of speech will be able to set forth the
dignity, the blessedness, when the King of Heaven, He that possesseth all things, is about
to set a man over “all His goods?” Wherefore also He calleth him wise, because he knew,
not to give up great things for small, but having been temperate here, hath attained to
Heaven.</p>
<p>4. After this, as He ever doth, not by the honor only laid up for the good, but also by
the punishment threatened against the wicked, doth He correct the hearers. Wherefore also
He added, “But and if the evil servant say in his heart, my Lord delayeth His coming; and
shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken: the Lord
of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for Him, and in an hour that he is
not aware of,2851and shall cut him asunder,2852and shall appoint him his portion with the
hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”2853</p>
<p>But if any one should say, Seest thou what a thought hath entered into his mind, because
of the day’s not being known, “my Lord,” he saith, “delayeth His coming?” we should affirm,
that it was not because the day is not known, but because the servant is evil. Else wherefore
came not this thought into the heart of the faithful and wise servant. For what, even though
the Lord tarry, O wretched man, surely thou lookest that He will come. Why then dost thou
not take care?</p>
<p>Hence then we learn, that He doth not so much as tarry. For this judgment is not the
Lord’s, but that of the evil servant’s mind, wherefore also he is blamed for this. For in proof
that He doth not tarry, hear Paul saying, “The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing;”2854and,
“He that cometh will come, and will not tarry.”2855</p>
<p>But do thou hear also what followeth, and learn how continually He reminds them of
their ignorance of the day, showing that this is profitable to the servants, and fitted to waken
and thoroughly to rouse them. For what though some gained nothing hereby? For neither
<note type="footnote">2851 [R.V., “when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not.”]</note>

<note type="footnote">2855 Heb. x. 37.</note>

<pb n="813"/>
by other things profitable for them were some profited, but nevertheless He ceaseth not to
do His part.</p>
<p>What then is the purport of that which followeth? “For He shall come in a day when he
looketh not for Him, and in an hour that he is not aware of;”2856and shall inflict upon him
extreme punishment. Seest thou how even everywhere He puts this, the fact of their ignorance,
indicating that it was profitable, and by this making them always earnest minded? For
this is the point at which He labors, that we should be always on the watch; and since it is
always in luxury that we are supine, but in afflictions we are braced up, therefore everywhere
He saith this, that when there is relaxation, then come the terrors. And as further back He
showed this by the example of Noah, even so here He saith it is, when that servant is
drunken, when he is beating, and that his punishment shall be intolerable.</p>
<p>But let us not regard only the punishment appointed for him, but let us look to this
other point too, lest we ourselves also be un awares to ourselves doing the same things. For
to this servant are they like, who have money, and give not to the needy. For thou too art
steward of thine own possessions, not less than he who dispenses the alms of the church.
As then he has not a right to squander at random and at hazard the things given by you for
the poor, since they were given for the maintenance of the poor; even so neither mayest
thou squander thine own. For even though thou hast received an inheritance from thy
father, and hast in this way all thou possessest: even thus all are God’s. And then thou for
thy part desirest that what thou hast given should be thus carefully dispensed, and thinkest
thou not that God will require His own of us with greater strictness, or that He suffers them
to be wasted at random? These things are not, they are not so. Because for this end, He left
these things in thine hand, in order “to give them their meat in due season.” But what
meaneth, “in due season?” To the needy, to the hungry. For like as thou gavest to thy fellowservant
to dispense, even so doth the Lord will thee too to spend these things on what is
needful. Therefore though He was able to take them away from thee, He left them, that thou
mightest have opportunity to show forth virtue; that bringing us into need one of another,
He might make our love for one another more fervent.</p>
<p>But thou, when thou hast received, so far from giving, dost even beat. And yet if not to
give be blame, what excuse is there for beating? But this, it seems to me, He speaks, hinting
at the insolent, and the covetous, and indicating the charge to be heavy, when they beat
them, whom they were commanded to feed.</p>
<p>5. But He seemeth to be here hinting also at those that live in luxury, since for luxury
too there is laid up a great punishment. “For He eateth and drinketh,” it is said, “with the
drunken,” pointing at gluttony. For not for this purpose didst thou receive, that thou should
spend it on luxury, but that thou shouldest lay it out on alms. What! are they thine own
<note type="footnote">2856 Matt. xxiv. 50.</note>

<pb n="814"/>
things which thou hast? With the goods of the poor hast thou been entrusted, though thou
be possessed of them by honest labor, or though it be by inheritance from thy father. What,
could not God have taken away these things from thee? But He doth not this, to give thee
power to be liberal to the poor.</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how throughout all the parables He punishes them that lay
not out their money upon the needy. For neither had the virgins robbed other men’s goods,
but they had not given their own; neither had he that buried the one talent embezzled, but
he had not doubled; neither are they that overlooked the hungry punished, because they
seized the possessions of others, but because they did not lay out their own, like as also this
servant.</p>
<p>Let us hearken, as many as please the belly, as many as lay out on costly banquets the
riches that pertain not at all to us, but belong to the needy. For do not, because out of great
love to man thou art commanded to give as of thine, therefore suppose these things to be
indeed thine own. He lent them to thee, that thou mightest be able to approve thyself. Do
not then suppose them to be thine, when giving Him His own. For neither, if thou hadst
lent to any one, that he might go and be able to find means of gain, wouldest thou say the
money was his. To thee then also hath God given, that thou mightest traffic for Heaven.
Make not then the exceeding greatness of His love to man a cause of ingratitude.</p>
<p>Consider of what prayer it were a worthy object, to be able to find after baptism a way
to do away one’s sins. If He had not said this, Give alms, how many would have said, Would
it were possible to give money, and so be freed from the ills to come! But since this hath
become possible, again are they become supine.</p>
<p>“But I give,” thou sayest. And what is this? Thou hast not yet given as much as she, who
cast in the two mites; or rather not so much as the half, nor a very small part of what she
gave, but thou layest out the greater part on useless expenses, on banquets, and drunkenness,
and extreme extravagance; now bidding, now bidden; now spending, now constraining
others to spend; so that the punishment is even rendered twofold for thee, both from what
thyself doest, and what thou movest others to do. See at any rate how He Himself blames
His servant for this. “For he eateth,” He saith, “and drinketh with the drunken.” For not the
drunken only, but those that are with them, doth He punish, and very fitly, because (together
with corrupting their own selves) they make light also of the salvation of others. But nothing
does so much provoke God, as for us to be inclined to overlook the things that concern our
neighbor. Wherefore showing His anger, He commands him to be cut asunder. Therefore
He also affirmed love to be a distinguishing mark of His disciples, since it is altogether necessary
that he who loveth should take thought for the things of his beloved.</p>
<p>To this way then let us hold, for this is especially the way that leads up to Heaven, which
renders men followers of Christ, which makes them, as far as possible, like God. See at any
rate how these virtues are more needful, which have their dwelling by this way. And, if ye

<pb n="815"/>
will, let us make an inquiry into them, and let us bring forth the sentences from the judgment
of God.</p>
<p>Let there be then two ways of most holy life, and let the one secure the goodness of him
that practises it, but the other of his neighbor also. Let us see whether is the more approved
and leads us to the summit of virtue. Surely he, who seeks his own things only, will receive
even from Paul endless blame, and when I say from Paul, I mean from Christ, but the other
commendations and crowns. Whence is this evident? Hear what His language is to one,
what to the other. “Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.”2857 Seest
thou he rejects the one, and brings in the other? Again, “Let every one of you please his
neighbor for good to edification.” Then comes also the praise beyond words with an admonition,
“For even Christ pleased not Himself.”2858</p>
<p>Even these judgments then are sufficient to show the victory; but that this may be done
even superabundantly, let us see amongst good works, which are confined to ourselves, and
which pass over from us to others also. Fasting then, and lying on the bare ground, and
keeping virginity, and a self-denying life, these things bring their advantage to the persons
themselves who do them; but those that pass from ourselves to our neighbors are almsgiving,
teaching, charity. Hear then Paul in this matter also saying, “Though I bestow all my goods
to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am nothing
profited.”2859</p>
<p>6. Seest thou it in itself gloriously celebrated, and crowned?</p>
<p>But if ye be willing, from a third point also let us compare them; and let the one fast,
and deny himself, and be a martyr, and be burnt to death, but let another delay his martyrdom
for his neighbor’s edification; and let him not only delay it, but let him even depart without
martyrdom; who will be the more approved after his removal hence? We need not have
many words, nor a long circumlocution. For the blessed Paul is at hand, giving his judgment,
and saying, “To depart and to be with Christ is better, nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
more needful for you;”2860even to his removal unto Christ did he prefer his neighbor’s
edification. For this is in the highest sense to be with Christ, even to be doing His will, but
nothing is so much His will, as that which is for one’s neighbor’s good.</p>
<p>Wilt thou that I tell thee a fourth proof also of these things? “Peter, lovest thou me,”
saith He; “Feed my sheep:”2861and having asked him a third time, declared this to be an
infallible proof of love. But not to priests only is this said, but to every one of us also, who

<pb n="816"/>
are also entrusted with a little flock. For do not despise it, because it is a little flock: For “my
Father,” He saith, “hath pleasure in them.”2862 Each of us hath a sheep, let him lead that to
the proper pastures. And let the man, as soon as he has risen from his bed, seek after nothing
else, but how he may do and say something whereby he may render his whole house more
reverent. The woman again, let her be indeed a good housekeeper; but before attending to
this, let her have another more needful care, that the whole household may work the works
of Heaven. For if in worldly matters, before attending to the affairs of our household, we
labor diligently to pay public dues, that we may not for our undutifulness in these matters
be beaten and dragged to the market places, and suffer ten thousand unseemly things; much
more ought we to do this in things spiritual, and to render what is due to God, the King of
all, first, that we may not come to that place, “where is gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p>And after these virtues let us seek, which together with our own salvation will be able
in the greatest degree to profit our neighbor. Such is almsgiving, such is prayer, or rather
even this latter is by the former made efficacious, and furnished with wings. “For thy prayers,”
it is said, “and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.”2863 But not prayers
only, but fasting also hath its strength from hence. Shouldest thou fast without almsgiving;
the act is not so much as counted for fasting; but such a one is worse than a gluttonous man
and a drunkard; and so much worse, as cruelty is a more grievous thing than luxury. And
why do I speak of fasting? Though thou practise self-denial, though thou practise virginity,
thou art set without the bridechamber, if thou hast not almsgiving. And yet what is equal
to virginity, which not even in the new dispensation hath come under the compulsion of
law, on account of its high excellence? but nevertheless it is cast out, when it hath not
almsgiving. But if virgins are cast out, because they have not this in due abundance, who
will be able without this to obtain pardon? There is no man, but he must quite of necessity
perish, who hath not this.</p>
<p>For, if in worldly matters no man lives for himself, but artisan, and soldier, and husbandman,
and merchant, all of them contribute to the common good, and to their neighbor’s
advantage; much more ought we to do this in things spiritual. For this is most properly to
live: since he at least who is living for himself only, and overlooking all others, is useless,
and is not so much as a human being, nor of our race.</p>
<p>What then, thou wouldest say, if I neglect my own interests, while seeking after the good
of the rest? It is not possible, for one who seeks after the good of the rest to overlook his
own; for he who seeks after the good of the rest pains no man, but pities all, helps them to
the utmost of his powers; will rob no man, will covet the goods of no man, will not steal,
will not bear false witness; will abstain from all wickedness, will apply himself to all virtue,
<note type="footnote">2862 Luke xii. 32.</note>

and will pray for his enemies, and do good to them that plot against him, and will neither
revile any, nor speak ill of them, though he hear from them ten thousand evil things; but
will speak the words of the apostle: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and
I burn not?”2864 But when looking to our own good, it is not quite sure that the good of the
rest will follow.</p>
<p>By all which things being persuaded that it is not possible for one to be saved, who hath
not looked to the common good, and seeing this man that was cut asunder, and him that
buried his talent, let us choose this way, that we may also attain unto eternal life, unto which
God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory, world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXVIII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXV. 1-30.2865</p>
<p>“Then shall the kingdom of Heaven,” He saith, “be likened unto ten virgins, which took their
lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. But five of them were wise, and the other
five foolish, which took not,” He saith, “oil.”</p>
<p>“Then, while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was
a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him. And the five arose,
and being in perplexity, said to the wise, Give us of your oil. But they consented not, saying,
Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you; go to them that sell, and buy.”</p>
<p>“And while they were gone for this, the bridegroom came, and those went in; but these came
afterwards, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answered and said, Verily I say unto
you, I know you not. Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the hour.”</p>
<p>“Then He spake again another parable. A man travelling into a far country, called his own
servants, and delivered unto them his goods; to one five talents, to another two, to another
one, to every man according to his several ability, and took his journey. Then, when the
two had brought him the double, he that had been entrusted with the one talent brought
it alone, and being blamed saith, I knew that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou
hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed; and I was afraid, and hid thy
talent; lo! there thou hast that is thine. His Lord answered and said, Thou wicked servant,
thou knewest that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not strawed:
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming
I might have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give
it to him that hath ten talents. For to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more
abundantly; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath.
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p>These parables are like the former parable of the faithful servant, and of him that was
ungrateful and devoured his Lord’s goods. For there are four in all, in different ways admonishing
us about the same things, I mean about diligence in almsgiving, and about helping
our neighbor by all means which we are able to use, since it is not possible to be saved in
another way. But there He speaks more generally of all assistance which should he rendered

omissions, and some variations from the received text. It seemed unnecessary to annotate it to any extent, since

<pb n="819"/>
to one’s neighbor; but as to the virgins, he speaketh particularly of mercifulness in alms,
and more strongly than in the former parable. For there He punishes him that beats, and is
drunken, and scatters and wastes his lord’s goods, but here even him that doth not help,
nor spends abundantly his goods upon the needy. For they had oil indeed, but not in
abundance, wherefore also they are punished.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He set forth this parable in the person of the virgins, and doth not
merely suppose any person whatever? Great things had He spoken of virginity, saying,
“There are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven’s sake;”
and, “He that is able to receive, let him receive it.”2866 He knew also that the generality of
men would have a great opinion of it. For indeed the work is by nature great, and is shown
so by this, that neither under the old dispensation was it fulfilled by these ancient and holy
men, nor under the new was it brought under the compulsion of the law. For He did not
command this, but left it to the choice of his hearers. Wherefore Paul also said “Now, concerning
virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.”2867“For though I praise him that
attains thereto, yet I constrain not him that is not willing, neither do I make the thing an
injunction.” Since then the thing is both great in itself and hath great honor with the multitude,
lest any one attaining to this should feel as though he had attained to all, and should
be careless about the rest, He putteth forth this parable sufficient to persuade them, that
virginity, though it should have everything else, if destitute of the good things arising out
of almsgiving, is cast out with the harlots, and He sets the inhuman and merciless with them.
And most reasonably, for the one was overcome by the love of carnal pleasure, but these2868of
money. But the love of carnal pleasure and of money are not equal, but that of carnal
pleasure is far keener and more tyrannical. And the weaker the antagonist, the less excusable
are these2869that are overcome thereby. Therefore also He calls them foolish, for that having
undergone the greater labor, they have betrayed all for want of the less. But by lamps here,
He meaneth the gift itself of virginity, the purity of holiness; and by oil, humanity, almsgiving,
succor to them that are in need.</p>
<p>“Then, while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.” He shows that the
time intervening will not be short, leading His disciples away from the expectation that His
kingdom was quite immediately to appear. For this indeed they hoped, therefore He is
continually holding them back from this hope. And at the same time He intimates this too,
that death is a sleep. For they slept, He saith.</p>

<pb n="820"/>
<p>“And about midnight there was a cry made.” Either He was continuing the parable, or
again He shows that the resurrection will be at night. But the cry Paul also indicates, saying,
“With a shout, with a voice of an archangel, with the last trump, He shall come down from
Heaven.”2870 And what mean the trumpets, and what saith the cry? “The bridegroom
cometh.” When therefore they had trimmed their lamps, the foolish say unto the wise, “Give
us of your oil.” Again He calls them foolish, showing that nothing can be more foolish than
they who are wealthy here, and depart naked thither, where most of all we have need of
humanity, where we want much oil. But not in this respect only were they foolish, but also
because they looked to receive it there, and sought it out of season; and yet nothing could
be more humane than those virgins, who for this especially were approved. Neither do they
seek for it all, for, “Give us,” they say, “of your oil;” and the urgency of their need is indicated;
“for our lamps,” they say, “are going out.” But even so they failed, and neither the humanity
of those whom they asked, nor the easiness of their request, nor their necessity and want,
made them obtain.</p>
<p>But what now do we learn from hence? That no man can protect us there, if we are betrayed
by our works, not because he will not, but because he cannot. For these too take
refuge in the impossibility. This the blessed Abraham also indicated, saying, “Between us
and you there is a great gulf,”2871so that not even when willing is it permitted them to pass
it.</p>
<p>“But go to them that sell, and buy.” And who are they that sell? The poor. And where
are these? Here, and then should they have sought them, not at that time.</p>
<p>2. Seest thou what great profit arises to us from the poor? shouldest thou take them
away, thou wouldest take away the great hope of our salvation. Wherefore here must we get
together the oil, that it may be useful to us there, when the time calls us. For that is not the
time of collecting it, but this. Spend not then your goods for nought in luxury and vainglory.
For thou wilt have need of much oil there.</p>
<p>Having heard these things, those virgins went their way; but they profited nothing. And
this He saith, either pursuing the parable, and working it up; or also by these things showing,
that though we should become humane after our departure, we shall gain nothing from
thence towards our escape. Therefore neither did their forwardness avail these virgins, because
they went to them that sell not here, but there; nor the rich man, when he became so
charitable, as even to be anxious about his relations. For he that was passing by him that
was laid at the gate, is eager to rescue from perils and from hell them whom he did not so
much as see, and entreats that some be sent to tell them these things. But nevertheless, he
derived no benefit from thence, as neither did these virgins. For when they having heard
<note type="footnote">2870 1 Thess. iv. 16 (comp. 1 Cor. xv. 52).</note>
<note type="footnote">2871 Luke xvi. 26.</note>

<pb n="821"/>
these things went their way, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with
Him, but the others were shut out. After their many labors, after their innumerable toils,
and that intolerable fight, and those trophies which they had set up over the madness of
natural appetite, disgraced, and with their lamps gone out, they withdrew, bending down
their faces to the earth. For nothing is more sullied than virginity not having mercy; so that
even the multitude are wont to call the unmerciful dark. Where then was the profit of virginity,
when they saw not the bridegroom? and not even when they had knocked did they
obtain, but they heard that fearful saying, “Depart, I know you not.”2872 And when He hath
said this, nothing else but hell is left, and that intolerable punishment; or rather, this word
is more grievous even than hell. This word He speaks to them also that work iniquity.2873</p>
<p>“Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.”2874 Seest thou how continually
He adds this, showing how awful our ignorance concerning our departure hence? Where
now are they, who throughout all their life are remiss, but when they are blamed by us, are
saying, At the time of my death, I shall leave money to the poor. Let them listen to these
words, and be amended. For indeed at that time many have failed of this, having been
snatched away at once, and not permitted so much as to give charge to their relations
touching what they wished to be done.</p>
<p>This parable was spoken with respect to mercy in alms; but the one that comes after
this, to them that neither in money, nor in word, nor in protection, nor in any other things
whatever, are willing to assist their neighbors, but withhold all.</p>
<p>And wherefore can it be that this parable brings forward a king, but that a bridegroom?
That thou mightest learn how close Christ is joined unto the virgins that strip themselves
of their possessions; for this indeed is virginity. Wherefore Paul also makes this as a definition
of the thing. “The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord;”2875such are his
words: and, “For that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
These things we advise,” he saith.</p>
<p>And if in Luke the parable of the talents is otherwise put, this is to be said, that the one
is really different from the other. For in that, from the one capital different degrees of increase
were made, for from one pound one brought five, another ten; wherefore neither did they
obtain the same recompense; but here, it is the contrary, and the crown is accordingly equal.
For he that received two gave two, and he that had received the five again in like manner;

but there since from the same beginning one made the greater, one the less, increase; as
might be expected, in the rewards also, they do not enjoy the same.</p>
<p>But see Him everywhere, not requiring it again immediately. For in the case of the
vineyard, He let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country; and here He committed
to them the talents, and took His journey, that thou mightest learn His long-suffering. And
to me He seems to say these things, to intimate the resurrection. But here it is no more a
vineyard and husbandmen, but all servants. For not to rulers only, nor to Jews, but to all,
doth He address His discourse. And they who bring a return unto Him confess frankly, both
what is their own, and what their Master’s. And the one saith, Lord, “Thou gavest me five
talents;” and the other saith, “two,” indicating that from Him they received the source of
their gain, and they are very thankful, and reckon all to Him.</p>
<p>What then saith the Master? “Well done, thou good” (for this is goodness to look to
one’s neighbor) “and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over few things, I will set thee over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,”2876meaning by this expression all
blessedness.</p>
<p>But not so that other one, but how? “I knew that thou art a hard man, reaping where
thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou strawedst not: and I was afraid, and hid thy
talent: lo, there thou hast that is thine.”2877 What then the Master? “Thou oughtest to have
put my money to the exchangers,”2878that is, “that oughtest to have spoken, to have admonished,
to have advised.” But are they disobedient? Yet this is nought to thee.</p>
<p>What could be more gentle than this? For men indeed do not so, but him that hath put
out the money at usury, even him do they make also responsible to require it again. But He
not so; but, Thou oughtest, He saith, to have put it out, and to have committed the requiring
of it again to me. And I should have required it with increase; by increase upon the hearing,
meaning the showing forth of the works. Thou oughtest to have done that which is easier,
and to have left to me what is more difficult. Forasmuch then as he did not this, “Take,”
saith He, “the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.2879 For unto every
one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not shall
be taken away even that which he hath.”2880 What then is this? He that hath a gift of word
and teaching to profit thereby, and useth it not, will lose the gift also; but he that giveth diligence,
will gain to himself the gift in more abundance; even as the other loseth what he
had received. But not to this is the penalty limited for him that is slothful, but even intolerable

is the punishment, and with the punishment the sentence, which is full of a heavy accusation.
For “cast ye,” saith He, “the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.”2881 Seest thou how not only the spoiler, and the covetous, nor only
the doer of evil things, but also he that doeth not good things, is punished with extreme
punishment.</p>
<p>Let us hearken then to these words. As we have opportunity, let us help on our salvation,
let us get oil for our lamps, let us labor to add to our talent. For if we be backward, and spend
our time in sloth here, no one will pity us any more hereafter, though we should wail ten
thousand times. He also that had on the filthy garments condemned himself, and profited
nothing. He also that had the one talent restored that which was committed to his charge,
and yet was condemned. The virgins again entreated, and came unto Him and knocked,
and all in vain, and without effect.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us contribute alike wealth, and diligence, and protection,
2882and all things for our neighbor’s advantage. For the talents here are each person’s
ability, whether in the way of protection, or in money, or in teaching, or in what thing soever
of the kind. Let no man say, I have but one talent, and can do nothing; for thou canst even
by one approve thyself. For thou art not poorer than that widow; thou art not more uninstructed
than Peter and John, who were both “unlearned and ignorant men;”2883but nevertheless,
since they showed forth a zeal, and did all things for the common good, they attained
to Heaven. For nothing is so pleasing to God, as to live for the common advantage.</p>
<p>For this end God gave us speech, and hands, and feet, and strength of body, and mind,
and understanding, that we might use all these things, both for our own salvation, and for
our neighbor’s advantage. For not for hymns only and thanksgivings is our speech serviceable
to us, but it is profitable also for instruction and admonition. And if indeed we used it to
this end, we should be imitating our Master; but if for the opposite ends, the devil. Since
Peter also, when he confessed the Christ, was blessed, as having spoken the words of the
Father; but when he refused the cross, and dissuaded it, he was severely reproved, as savoring
the things of the devil. But if where the saying was of ignorance, so heavy is the blame, when
we of our own will commit many sins, what favor shall we have?</p>
<p>Such things then let us speak, that of themselves they may be evidently the words of
Christ. For not only if I should say, “Arise, and walk;”2884neither if I should say, “Tabitha,
arise,”2885then only do I speak Christ’s words, but much more if being reviled I bless, if being

despitefully used I pray for him that doeth despite to me. Lately indeed I said, that our tongue
is a hand laying hold on the feet of God; but now much more do I say, that our tongue is a
tongue imitating the tongue of Christ, if it show forth the strictness that becometh us, if we
speak those things which He wills. But what are the things which He wills us to speak? Words
full of gentleness and meekness, even as also He Himself used to speak, saying to them that
were insulting Him, “I have not a devil;”2886and again, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness
of the evil.”2887 If thou also speak in this way; if thou speak for thy neighbor’s amendment,
thou wilt obtain a tongue like that tongue. And these things God Himself saith; “For he that
bringeth out the precious from the vile, shall be as my mouth;”2888such are His words.</p>
<p>When therefore thy tongue is as Christ’s tongue, and thy mouth is become the mouth
of the Father, and thou art a temple of the Holy Ghost, then what kind of honor could be
equal to this? For not even if thy mouth were made of gold, no nor even of precious stones,
would it shine like as now, when lit up with the ornament of meekness. For what is more
lovely than a mouth that knoweth not how to insult, but is used to bless and give good words?
But if thou canst not bear to bless him that curses thee, hold thy peace, and accomplish but
this for the time; and proceeding in order, and striving as thou oughtest, thou wilt attain to
that other point also, and wilt acquire such a mouth, as we have spoken of.</p>
<p>4. And do not account the saying to be rash. For the Lord is loving to man, and the gift
cometh of His goodness. It is rash to have a mouth like the devil, to have a tongue resembling
that of an evil demon, especially for him that partakes of such mysteries, and communicates
of the very flesh of the Lord. Reflecting then on these things, become like Him, to the utmost
of thy power. No longer then will the devil be able so much as to look thee in the face, when
thou art become such a one as this. For indeed he recognizes the image of the King, he knows
the weapons of Christ, whereby he was worsted. And what are these? Gentleness and
meekness. For when on the mountain Christ overthrew and laid low the devil who was assaulting
him, it was not by making it known that He was Christ, but He entrapped him by
these sayings, He took him by gentleness, he turned him to flight by meekness. Thou also
must do this; shouldest thou see a man become a devil, and coming against thee, even so
do thou likewise overcome. Christ gave thee also power to become like Him, so far as thy
ability extends. Be not afraid at hearing this. The fear is not to be like Him. Speak then after
His manner, and thou art become in this respect such as He, so far as it is possible for one
who is a man to become so.</p>
<p>Wherefore greater is he that thus speaks, than he that prophecies. For this is entirely a
gift, but in the other is also thy labor and toil. Teach thy soul to frame thee a mouth like to

Christ’s mouth. For it can create such things, if it will; it knows the art, if it be not remiss.
And how is such a mouth made? one may ask. By what kind of colorings? by what kind of
material? By no colorings, indeed, or material; but by virtue only, and meekness, and humility.</p>
<p>Let us see also how a devil’s mouth is made; that we may never frame that. How then
is it made? By curses, by insults, by envy, by perjury. For when any one speaks his words,
he takes his tongue. What kind of excuse then shall we have; or rather, what manner of
punishment shall we not undergo; when this our tongue, wherewith we are allowed to taste
of the Lord’s flesh, when this, I say, we overlook, speaking the devil’s words?</p>
<p>Let us not overlook it, but let us use all diligence, in order to train it to imitate its Lord.
For if we train it to this, it will place us with great confidence at Christ’s judgment seat.
Unless any one know how to speak thus, the judge will not so much as hear him. For like
as when the judge chances to be a Roman, he will not hear the defense of one who knows
not how to speak thus; so likewise Christ, unless thou speak after His fashion, will not hear
thee, nor give heed.</p>
<p>Let us learn therefore to speak in such wise as our Judge is wont to hear; let it be our
endeavor to imitate that tongue. And shouldest thou fall into grief, take heed lest the tyranny
of despondency pervert thy tongue, but that thou speak like Christ. For He too mourned
for Lazarus and Judas. Shouldest thou fall into fear, seek again to speak even as He. For He
Himself fell into fear for thy sake, with regard to His manhood.2889the other sheep, that He
might indicate the unfruitfulness of the one, for no fruit will come from kids; and the great
profit from the other, for indeed from sheep great is the profit, as well from the milk, as
from the wool, and from the young, of all which things the kid2890is destitute.</p>
<p>But while the brutes have from nature their unfruitfulness, and fruitfulness, these have
it from choice, wherefore some are punished, and the others crowned. And He doth not
punish them, until He hath pleaded with them; wherefore also, when He hath put them in
their place, He mentions the charges against them. And they speak with meekness, but they
have no advantage from it now; and very reasonably, because they passed by a work so much
to be desired. For indeed the prophets are everywhere saying this, “I will have mercy and
not sacrifice,”2891and the lawgiver by all means urged them to this, both by words, and by
works; and nature herself taught it.</p>
<p>But mark them, how they are destitute not of one or two things only, but of all. For not
only did they fail to feed the hungry, or clothe the naked; but not even did they visit the sick,
which was an easier thing.</p>

<p>And mark how easy are His injunctions. He said not, “I was in prison, and ye set me
free; I was sick, and ye raised me up again;” but, “ye visited me,” and, “ye came unto me.”
And neither in hunger is the thing commanded grievous. For no costly table did He seek,
but what is needful only, and His necessary food, and He sought in a suppliant’s garb, so
that all things were enough to bring punishment on them; the easiness of the request, for it
was bread; the pitiable character of Him that requesteth, for He was poor; the sympathy of
nature, for He was a man; the desirableness of the promise, for He promised a kingdom;
the fearfulness of the punishment, for He threatened hell. The dignity of the one receiving,
for it was God, who was receiving by the poor; the surpassing nature of the honor, that He
vouchsafed to condescend so far; His just claim for what they bestowed, for of His own was
He receiving. But against all these things covetousness once for all blinded them that were
seized by it; and this though so great a threat was set against it.</p>
<p>For further back also He saith, that they who receive not such as these shall suffer more
grievous things than Sodom; and here He saith, “Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the
least of these my brethren, ye did it not unto me.”2892 What sayest Thou? they are Thy
brethren; and how dost Thou call them least. Why, for this reason they are brethren, because
they are lowly, because they are poor, because they are outcast. For such doth He most invite
to brotherhood, the unknown, the contemptible, not meaning by these the monks only, and
them that have occupied the mountains, but every believer; though he be a secular person,
yet if he be hungry, and famishing, and naked, and a stranger, His will is he should have the
benefit of all this care. For baptism renders a man a brother, and the partaking of the divine
mysteries.</p>
<p>2. Then, in order that thou mayest see in another way also the justice of the sentence,
He first praises them that have done right, and saith, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world. For I was an hungered,
and ye gave me meat,” and all that follows.2893 For that they may not say, we had it not, He
condemns them by their fellow-servants; like as the virgins by the virgins, and the servant
that was drunken and gluttonous by the faithful servant, and him that buried his talent, by
them that brought the two, and each one of them that continue in sin, by them that have
done right.</p>
<p>And this comparison is sometimes made in the case of an equal, as here, and in the instance
of the virgins, sometimes of him that hath advantage, as when he said, “The men of
Nineveh shall rise up and shall condemn this generation, because they believed at the
preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here;” and, “The queen of the south

<pb n="827"/>
shall condemn this generation, because she came to hear the wisdom of Solomon;”2894and
of an equal again, “They shall be your judges;”2895and again of one at advantage, “Know ye
not, that we shall judge angels, how much more things that pertain to this life?”2896</p>
<p>And here, however, it is of an equal; for he compares rich with rich, and poor with poor.
And not in this way only doth He show the sentence justly passed, by their fellow-servants
having done what was right when in the same circumstances, but also by their not being
obedient so much as in these things in which poverty was no hindrance; as, for instance, in
giving drink to the thirsty, in looking upon him that is in bonds, in visiting the sick. And
when He had commended them that had done right, He shows how great was originally
His bond of love towards them. For, “Come,” saith He, “ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” To how many good things
is this same equivalent, to be blessed, and blessed of the Father? And wherefore were they
counted worthy of such great honors? What is the cause? “I was an hungered, and ye gave
me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink;” and what follows.</p>
<p>Of what honor, of what blessedness are these words? And He said not, Take, but, “Inherit,”
as one’s own, as your Father’s, as yours, as due to you from the first. For, before you
were, saith He, these things had been prepared, and made ready for you, forasmuch as I
knew you would be such as you are.</p>
<p>And in return for what do they receive such things? For the covering of a roof, for a
garment, for bread, for cold water, for visiting, for going into the prison. For indeed in every
case it is for what is needed; and sometimes not even for that. For surely, as I have said, the
sick and he that is in bonds seeks not for this only, but the one to be loosed, the other to be
delivered from his infirmity. But He, being gracious, requires only what is within our power,
or rather even less than what is within our power, leaving to us to exert our generosity in
doing more.</p>
<p>But to the others He saith, “Depart from me, ye cursed,” (no longer of the Father; for
not He laid the curse upon them, but their own works), “into the everlasting fire, prepared,”
not for you, but “for the devil and his angels.” For concerning the kingdom indeed, when
He had said, “Come, inherit the kingdom,” He added, “prepared for you before the foundation
of the world;” but concerning the fire, no longer so, but, “prepared for the devil.” I,
saith He, prepared the kingdom for you, but the fire no more for you, but “for the devil and
his angels;” but since ye cast yourselves therein, impute it to yourselves. And not in this way
only, but by what follows also, like as though He were excusing Himself to them, He sets
forth the causes.</p>

<p>“For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat.” For though He that came to thee had
been thine enemy, were not His sufferings enough to have overcome and subdued even the
merciless? hunger, and cold, and bonds, and nakedness, and sickness, and to wander
everywhere houseless? These things are sufficient even to destroy enmity. But ye did not
these things even to a friend, being at once friend, and benefactor, and Lord. Though it be
a dog we see hungry, often we are overcome; and though we behold a wild beast, we are
subdued; but seeing the Lord, art thou not subdued? And wherein are these things worthy
of defense?</p>
<p>For if it were this only, were it not sufficient for a recompense? (I speak not of hearing
such a voice, in the presence of the world, from Him that sitteth on the Father’s throne, and
of obtaining the kingdom), but were not the very doing it sufficient for a reward? But now
even in the presence of the world, and at the appearing of that unspeakable glory, He proclaims
and crowns thee, and acknowledges thee as His sustainer and host, and is not ashamed
of saying such things, that He may make the crown brighter for thee.</p>
<p>So for this cause, while the one are punished justly, the others are crowned by grace.
For though they had done ten thousand things, the munificence were of grace, that in return
for services so small and cheap, such a heaven, and a kingdom, and so great honor, should
be given them.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings,2897 He said unto His disciples,
Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of Man is betrayed to be
crucified.”2898 In good season again doth He speak of the passion, when He had reminded
them of the kingdom, and of the recompense there, and of the deathless punishment; as
though He had said, Why are ye afraid at the dangers that are for a season, when such good
things await you?</p>
<p>3. But mark thou, I pray thee, how He hath in all His first sayings after a new manner
worked up and thrown into the shade what was most painful to them. For He said not, Ye
know that after two days I am betrayed, but, “Ye know that after two days is the passover,”
2899to show that what is done is a mystery and that a feast and celebration is being kept
for the salvation of the world, and that with foreknowledge He suffered all. So then, as
though this were sufficient consolation for them, He did not even say anything to them now
about a resurrection; for it was superfluous, after having discoursed so much about it, to
speak of it again. And moreover, as I said, He shows that even His very passion is a deliver-

ance from countless evils, having by the passover reminded them of the ancient benefits in
Egypt.</p>
<p>“Then were assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the
people, in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and consulted that they
might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill Him. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be
an uproar among the people.”2900</p>
<p>Seest thou the unspeakable corruption of the Jewish state? Attempting unlawful acts,
they come to the high priest, desiring to obtain their authority from that quarter, whence
they ought to have found hindrance.</p>
<p>And how many high priests were there? For the law wills there should be one, but then
there were many. Whence it is manifest, that the Jewish constitution had begun to dissolve.
For Moses, as I said, commanded there should be one, and that when he was dead there
should be another, and by the life of this person He measured the banishment of them that
had involuntarily committed manslaughter. How then were there at that time many high
priests? They were afterwards made for a year. And this the evangelist declared, when he
was speaking of Zacharias, saying, that he was of the course of Abia. Those therefore doth
he here call high priests, who had been high priests.</p>
<p>What did they consult together? That they might seize Him secretly, or that they might
put Him to death? Both; for they feared the people. Wherefore also they waited for the feast
to be past; for “they said, Not on the feast day.”2901 For the devil, lest he should make the
passion conspicuous, was not willing it should take place at the passover; but they, lest there
should be an uproar. Mark them then ever fearing, not the ills from God, neither lest any
greater pollution should arise to them from the season, but in every case the ills from men.</p>
<p>Yet for all this, boiling with anger, they changed their purpose again. For though they
had said, “Not at the feast time;” when they found the traitor, they waited not for the time,
but slew Him at the feast. But why did they take Him then? They were boiling with rage, as
I said; and they expected then to find Him, and all things they did as blinded. For though
He Himself made the greatest use of their wickedness for His own dispensation, they were
not surely for this guiltless, but deserving of inflictions without number for their temper of
mind. At least when all should be set free, even the guilty, then these men slew the guiltless,

Gentiles for their sake. But O loving-kindness! them that were thus depraved, them that
were thus froward, and2902full of countless evils, He again saves, and sends the apostles to
be slain in their behalf, and by the apostles makes entreaty. “For we are ambassadors for
Christ.”2903</p>
<p>Having then such patterns as these, I say not, let us die for our enemies, for we ought
to do even this; but since we are too feeble for this, I say for the present, at least let us not
look with an evil eye upon our friends, let us not envy our benefactors. I say not for the
present, let us do good to them that evil entreat us, for I desire even this; but since you are
too gross for this, at least avenge not yourselves. What is our condition, a scene, and acting?
Wherefore can it be that ye set yourselves directly against the acts enjoined? It is not for
nought that all else hath been written and how many things He did at the very cross sufficient
to recall them to Him; but that thou mightest imitate His goodness, that thou mightest
emulate His lovingkindness. For indeed He cast them to the ground, and restored the servant’s
ear, and discoursed with forbearance; and great miracles did He show forth, when
lifted up, turning aside the sunbeams, bursting the rocks, raising the dead, frightening by
dreams the wife of him that was judging Him, at the very judgment showing forth all
meekness (which was of power not less than miracles to gain them over), forewarning them
of countless things in the judgment hall; on the very cross crying aloud, “Father, forgive
them their sin.”2904 And when buried, how many things did He show forth for their salvation?
And having risen again, did he not straightway call the Jews? did He not give them remission
of sins? did He not set before them countless blessings? What can be more strange than
this? They that crucified Him, and were breathing murder, after they crucified Him, became
sons of God.</p>
<p>What can be equal to this tenderness? On hearing these things let us hide our faces, to
think that we are so far removed from Him whom we are commanded to imitate. Let us at
least see how great the distance, that we may at any rate condemn ourselves, for warring
with these, in behalf of whom Christ gave His life, and not being willing to be reconciled to
them, whom that He might reconcile He refused not even to be slain; unless this too be
some expense, and outlay of money, which ye object in almsgiving.</p>
<p>4. Consider of how many things thou art guilty; and so far from being backward to
forgive them that have injured thee, thou wilt even run unto them that have grieved thee,
in order that thou mayest have a ground for pardon, that thou mayest find a remedy for
thine own evil deeds.</p>

<p>The sons of the Greeks, who look for nothing great, have often shown self-command
toward these: and thou who art to depart hence with such hopes, shrinkest, and art slow to
act; and that which time effects, this thou endurest not to do before the time for God’s law,
but willest this passion to be quenched without reward, rather than for a reward? For neither,

thou spoken ill of no one? But thou hast heard men so speaking, and allowed it. Neither is
this guiltless.</p>
<p>Wilt thou learn how good a thing it is not to remember injuries, and how this more
than anything pleases God? Them that exult over persons, justly chastised by Himself, He
punishes. And yet they are justly chastised; but thou shouldest not rejoice over them. So the
prophet having brought many accusations, added this also, saying, “They felt nothing for
the affliction of Joseph;”2905and again, “She that inhabiteth Enan, came not forth to lament
for the place near her.”2906 And yet both Joseph (that is, the tribes that were sprung from
him), and the neighbors of these others, were punished according to the purpose of God;
nevertheless, it is His will that we sympathize even with these. For if we, being evil, when
we are punishing a servant, if we should see one of his fellow slaves laughing, we at the same
time are provoked the more, and turn our anger against him; much more will God punish
them that exult over those whom He chastises. But if upon them that are chastised by God
it is not right to trample, but to grieve with them, much more with them that have sinned
against us. For this is love’s sign; love God prefers to all things. For as in the royal purple,
those are precious amongst the flowers and dyes, which make up this robing; so here too,
these virtues are the precious ones, which preserve love. But nothing maintains love so much
as the not remembering them that have sinned against us.</p>
<p>“Why? did not God guard the other side also? Why? did He not drive him that hath
done the wrong to him that is wronged? Doth He not send him from the altar to the other,
and so after the reconciliation invite him to the table?” But do not therefore wait for the
other to come, since thus thou hast lost all. For to this intent most especially doth He appoint
<note type="footnote">2905 Amos vi. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">2906 Micah i. 11, LXX.</note>

<pb n="832"/>
unto thee an unspeaka ble reward, that thou mayest prevent the other, since, if thou art
reconciled by his entreaties, the amity is no longer the result of the divine command, but
of the other party’s diligence. Wherefore also thou goest away uncrowned, while he receives
the rewards.</p>
<p>What sayest thou? Hast thou an enemy, and art thou not ashamed? Why is not the
devil enough for us, that we bring upon ourselves those of our own race also? Would that
not even he had been minded to war against us; would that not even he were a devil!</p>
<p>Knowest thou not how great the pleasure after reconciliation? For what, though in our
enmity it appear not great? For that it is sweeter to love him that doth us wrong than to hate
him, after the enmity is done away thou shalt be able to learn full well.</p>
<p>5. Why then do we imitate the mad, devouring one another, warring against our own
flesh?</p>
<p>Hear even under the Old Testament, how great regard there was for this, “The ways of
revengeful men are unto death.2907 One man keepeth anger against another, and doth he
seek healing of God?”2908“And yet He allowed, ‘eye for eye,’ and ‘tooth for tooth,’ how then
doth He find fault?” Because He allowed even those things, not that we should do them one
to another, but that through the fear of suffering, we might abstain from the commission
of crime. And besides, those acts are the fruits of a short-lived anger, but to remember injuries
is the part of a soul that practises itself in evil.</p>
<p>But hast thou suffered evil? yet nothing so great, as thou wilt do to thyself by remembering
injuries. And besides, it is not so much as possible for a good man to suffer any evil. For
suppose there to be any man, having both children and a wife, and let him practise virtue,
and let him have moreover many occasions of being injured, as well abundance of possessions,
as sovereign power, and many friends, and let him enjoy honor; only let him practise
virtue, for this must be added, and let us in supposition lay plagues upon him. And let some
wicked man come unto him, and involve him in losses. What then is that to him who accounts
money nothing? Let him kill his children. What this to him, who learns to be wise touching
the resurrection? Let him slay his wife; what is this to him who is instructed not to sorrow
for them that are fallen asleep? let him cast him into dishonor. What this to him who accounts
the things present, the flower of the grass? If thou wilt, let him also torture his body, and
cast him into prison, what this to him that hath learnt, “Though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed;”2909and that “tribulation worketh approval?”2910</p>

<pb n="833"/>
<p>Now I had undertaken that he should receive no harm; but the account as it proceeded
hath shown that he is even advantaged, being renewed, and becoming approved.</p>
<p>Let us not then vex ourselves with others, injuring ourselves, and rendering our soul
weak. For the vexation is not so much from our neighbors’ wickedness, as from our weakness.
Because of this, should any one insult us, we weep, and frown; should any one rob us, we
suffer the same like those little children, which the more clever of their companions provoke
for nothing, grieving them for small causes; but nevertheless these too, if they should see
them vexed, continue to tease them, but if laughing, they on the contrary leave off. But we
are more foolish even than these, lamenting for these things, about which we ought to laugh.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat, let us let go this childish mind, and lay hold of Heaven. For indeed,
Christ willeth us to be men, perfect men. On this wise did Paul also command, “Brethren,
be not children in understanding,” he saith, “howbeit in malice be ye children.”2911</p>
<p>Let us therefore be children2912in malice, and flee wickedness, and lay hold on virtue,
that we may attain also to the good things eternal, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXX.</head>
<p>Matt. XXVI. 6, 7.</p>
<p>“Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto Him a
woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head,
as He sat at meat.”</p>
<p>This woman seems indeed to be one and the same with all the evangelists, yet she is not
so; but though with the three she doth seem to me to be one and the same,2913yet not so
with John, but another person, one much to be admired, the sister of Lazarus.</p>
<p>But not without purpose did the evangelist mention the leprosy of Simon, but in order
that He might show whence the woman took confidence, and came unto Him. For inasmuch
as the leprosy seemed a most unclean disease, and to be abhorred, and yet she saw Jesus had
both healed the man (for else He would not have chosen to have tarried with a leper), and
had gone into his house; she grew confident, that He would also easily wipe off the uncleanness
of her soul. And not for nought doth He name the city also, Bethany, but that thou
mightest learn, that of His own will He cometh to His passion. For He who before this was
fleeing through the midst of them; then, at the time when their envy was most kindled,
comes near within about fifteen furlongs; so completely was His former withdrawing Himself
a part of a dispensation.2914</p>
<p>The woman therefore having seen Him, and having taken confidence from thence came
unto Him. For if she that had the issue of blood, although conscious to herself of nothing
like this, yet because of that natural seeming uncleanness, approached Him trembling and
in fear; much more was it likely this woman should be slow, and shrink back because of her
evil conscience. Wherefore also it is after many women, the Samaritan, the Canaanite, her
that had the issue of blood, and other besides, that she cometh unto Him, being conscious
to herself of much impurity; and then not publicly but in a house. And whereas all the others
<note type="footnote">2913 St. Augustin, on St. John, Hom. XLIX. sec. 3, speaks of the identity as doubtful. See also Greswell, vol.
ii., Diss. XVII., and vol. iii. Diss. III. It seems that the occasion recorded in Luke vii. 37 must have been different,
whether the person were the same or not. St. Chrysostom supposes two unctions at Bethany. See note at the end
of “Sermons preached at St. Saviour’s Church, Leeds.” [Augustin discusses the question more fully in his Harmony
of the Gospels, see Nicene Fathers, vol. vi. pp. 173, 174. He holds that there were two occasions, one named by
Luke, and the other by Matthew, Mark and John, but that Mary was the person anointing on both occasions.
This leads to the identification of Mary, the sister of Lazarus, with Mary Magdalene. But there is no proof that
Luke refers to the latter. The opinion of Chrysostom seems to be that Matthew, Mark and Luke refer to the same
person, and John to another on a different occasion. But to this there are insuperable objections.—R.]</note>

were coming unto Him for the healing of the body alone, she came unto Him by way of
honor only, and for the amendment of the soul. For neither was she at all afflicted in body,
so that for this most especially one might marvel at her.</p>
<p>And not as to a mere man did she come unto Him; for then she would not have wiped
His feet with her hair, but as to one greater than man can be. Therefore that which is the
most honorable member of the whole body, this she laid at Christ’s feet, even her own head.</p>
<p>“But when His disciples saw it, they had indignation,” such are the words, “saying, To
what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
the poor. But when Jesus understood it, He said, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath
wrought a good work upon me? For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not
always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there
shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.”2915</p>
<p>And whence had they this thought? They used to hear their Master saying, “I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice,”2916and blaming the Jews, because they omitted the weightier
matters, judgment, and mercy, and faith, and discoursing much on the mount concerning
almsgiving, and from these things they inferred with themselves, and reasoned, that if He
accepts not whole burnt offerings, neither the ancient worship, much more will He not accept
the anointing of oil.</p>
<p>But though they thus thought, He knowing her intention suffers her. For indeed great
was her reverence, and unspeakable her zeal; wherefore of this exceeding condescension,
He permitted the oil to be poured even on His head.</p>
<p>For if He refused not to become man, and to be borne in the womb, and to be fed at the
breast, why marvellest thou, if He doth not utterly reject this? For like as the Father suffered
a savor of meat, and smoke, even so did He the harlot, accepting, as I have already said, her
intention. For Jacob too anointed a pillar to God, and oil was offered in the sacrifices, and
the priests were anointed with ointment.</p>
<p>But the disciples not knowing her purpose found fault unseasonably, and by the things
they laid to her charge, they show the woman’s munificence. For saying, that it might have
been sold for three hundred pence, they showed how much this woman had spent on the
ointment, and how great generosity she had manifested. Wherefore He also rebuked them,
saying, “Why trouble ye the woman?” And He adds a reason, as it was His will again to put
them in mind of His passion, “For she did it,” He said, “for my burial.” And another reason.
<note type="footnote">2915 Matt. xxvi. 8–13. [The Greek text agrees with the received with the exception of a change of order in the

“For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always;” and, “Wheresoever the
gospel shall be preached, that shall be told also which this woman hath done.”</p>
<p>Seest thou how again He declares beforehand the going forth unto the Gentiles, in this
way also consoling them for His death, if after the cross His power was so to shine forth,
that the gospel should be spread abroad in every part of the earth.</p>
<p>Who then is so wretched as to set his face against so much truth? For lo! what He said
is come to pass, and to whatever part of the earth thou mayest go, thou wilt see her celebrated.</p>
<p>And yet neither was the person that did it distinguished, nor had what was done many
witnesses, neither was it in a theatre, but in a house, that it took place, and this a house of
some leper, the disciples only being present.</p>
<p>2. Who then proclaimed it, and caused it to be spread abroad? It was the power of Him
who is speaking these words. And while of countless kings and generals the noble exploits
even of those whose memorials remain have sunk into silence; and having overthrown cities,
and encompassed them with walls,2917and set up trophies, and enslaved many nations, they
are not known so much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up statues,
and established laws; yet that a woman who was a harlot poured out oil in the house of some
leper, in the presence of ten men, this all men celebrate throughout the world; and so great
a time has passed, and yet the memory of that which was done hath not faded away, but
alike Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the race of the
Moors, and they that dwell in the British Islands, spread abroad that which was done secretly
in a house by a woman that had been a harlot.2918</p>
<p>Great is the loving-kindness of the Lord. He endureth an harlot, an harlot kissing his
feet, and moistening them with oil, and wiping them with her hair, and He receives her, and
reproves them that blame her. For neither was it right that for so much zeal the woman
should be driven to despair.</p>
<p>But mark thou this too, how far they were now raised up above the world, and forward
in almsgiving. And why was it He did not merely say, “She hath wrought a good work,” but
before this, “Why trouble ye the woman?” That they might learn not at the beginning to
require too high principles of the weaker sort. Therefore neither doth He examine the act
merely itself by itself, but taking into account the person of the woman. And indeed if He
had been making a law, He would not have brought in the woman, but that thou mightest
learn that for her sake these things were said, that they might not mar her budding faith,
but rather cherish it, therefore He saith it, teaching us whatever good thing may be done by
any man, though it be not quite perfect, to receive it, and encourage it, and advance it, and
<note type="footnote">2917 [A clause is omitted here: “and conquered in wars.”—R.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2918 [This accords with the assumed identity with the woman spoken of in Luke vii. But there seems to be no
proof that Chrysostom identified the woman with Mary Magdalene. Compare p. 41, Homily VI. 8.—R.]</note>

<pb n="837"/>
not to seek all perfection at the beginning. For, that at least He Himself would rather have
desired this, is manifest from the fact, that He required a bag to be borne, who had not where
to lay His head. But then the time demanded not this, that He should correct the deed, but
that He should accept it only. For even as, if any one asked Him, without the woman’s
having done it, He would not have approved this; so, after she had done it, He looks to one
thing only, that she be not driven to perplexity by the reproof of the disciples, but that she
should go from His care, having been made more cheerful and better. For indeed after the
oil had been poured out, their rebuke had no seasonableness.</p>
<p>Do thou then likewise, if thou shouldest see any one provide sacred vessels and offer
them, and loving to labor upon any other ornament of the church, about its walls or floor;
do not command what has been made to be sold, or overthrown, lest thou spoil his zeal.
But if, before he had provided them, he were to tell thee of it, command it to be given to the
poor; forasmuch as He also did this not to spoil the spirit of the woman, and as many things
as He says, He speaks for her comfort.</p>
<p>Then because He had said, “She hath done it for my burial;” that He might not seem to
perplex the woman, by making mention of such a thing as this, His burial and death, I mean;
see how by that which follows He recovers her, saying, “What she hath done shall be spoken
of in the whole world.”</p>
<p>And this was at once consolation to His disciples, and comfort and praise to her. For
all men, He saith, shall celebrate her hereafter; and now too hath she announced beforehand
my passion, by bringing unto me what was needed for a funeral, let not therefore any man
reprove her. For I am so far from condemning her as having done amiss, or from blaming
her as having not acted rightly, that I will not suffer what hath been done to lie hid, but the
world shall know that which has been done in a house, and in secret. For in truth the deed
came of a reverential mind, and fervent faith, and a contrite soul.</p>
<p>And wherefore did He promise the woman nothing spiritual; but the perpetual memory?
From this He is causing her to feel a confidence about the other things also. For if she hath
wrought a good work, it is quite evident she shall receive a due reward.</p>
<p>“Then went one of the twelve, he that was called Judas Iscariot, unto the chief priests,
and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you?”2919 Then.
When? When these things were spoken, when He had said, it is for my burial, and not even
thereby was he moved to compunction, neither when he heard that the Gospel should be
preached everywhere did he fear (and yet it was the language of unspeakable power), but
when women showed so much honor, and women that had been harlots, then he wrought
the devil’s works.</p>
<note type="footnote">2919 Matt. xxvi. 14, 15. [R.V., “Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests, and said, What are ye willing to give me,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="838"/>
<p>But what can be the reason they mention his surname? Because there was also another
Judas. And they do not shrink from saying, He was of the twelve; so entirely do they hide
none of those things which seem to be matters of reproach. And yet they might have said
merely this, that he was one of the disciples, for there were others besides. But now they
add, of the twelve, as though they had said, of the first company of those selected as the best,
of them with Peter and John. Because for one thing did they care, for truth alone, not for
concealing what things were done.</p>
<p>For this cause many of the signs they pass by, but of the things that appear to be matters
of reproach they conceal nothing; but though it be word, though it be deed, though it be
what you will of this kind, they proclaim it with confidence.</p>
<p>3. And not these only, but even John himself, who utters the higher doctrines. For he
most of all tells us of the affronts and the reproachful things that were done unto Him.</p>
<p>And see how great is the wickedness of Judas, in that he comes unto them of his own
accord, in that he does this for money, and for such a sum of money.</p>
<p>But Luke saith, that he conferred with the chief captains.2920 For after that the Jews became
seditious, the Romans set over them those that should provide for their good order.
For their government had now undergone a change according to the prophecy.</p>
<p>To these then he went and said, “What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you.
And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought
opportunity to betray Him.”2921 For indeed he was afraid of the multitude, and desired to
seize him alone.</p>
<p>Oh madness! how did covetousness altogether blind him! For he that had often seen
Him when He went through the midst, and was not seized, and when He afforded many
demonstrations of His Godhead and power, looked to lay hold on Him; and this while He
was using like a charm for him so many, both awful and soothing words, to put an end to
this evil thought. For not even at the supper did He forbear from this care of him, but unto
the last day discoursed to him of these things. But he profited nothing. Yet not for that did
the Lord cease to do His part.</p>
<p>Knowing this, then, let us also not intermit to do all things unto them that sin and are
remiss, warning, teaching, exhorting, admonishing, advising, though we profit nothing. For
Christ indeed foreknew that the traitor was incorrigible, yet nevertheless He ceased not to
supply what could be done by Himself, as well admonishing as threatening and bewailing
over him, and nowhere plainly, nor openly, but in a concealed way. And at the very time of
<note type="footnote">2920 Luke xxii. 4. [The explanation is untenable. The “captains” (στρατηγο) were not “chiliarchs,” but the
officers of the temple guard; comp. Luke xxii. 52, where the same word occurs.</note>

word as in verse 15.—R.]</note>

<pb n="839"/>
the betrayal, He allowed him even to kiss Him, but this benefited him nothing. So great an
evil is covetousness, this made him both a traitor, and a sacrilegious robber.</p>
<p>Hearken, all ye covetous, ye that have the disease of Judas; hearken, and beware of the
calamity. For if he that was with Christ, and wrought signs, and had the benefit of so much
instruction, because he was not freed from the disease, was sunk into such a gulf; how much
more shall ye, who do not so much as listen to the Scripture, who are constantly riveted to
the things present, become an easy prey to this calamity, unless ye have the advantage of
constant care. Every day was that man with Him, who had not where to lay His head, and
every day was he instructed by deeds, and by words, not to have gold, nor silver, nor two
coats; and yet he was not taught self restraint; and how dost thou expect to escape the disease,
if thou hast not the benefit of earnest attention, and dost not use much diligence? For terrible,
terrible is the monster, yet nevertheless, if thou be willing, thou wilt easily get the better of
him. For the desire is not natural; and this is manifest from them that are free from it. For
natural things are common to all; but this desire has its origin from remissness alone; hence
it takes its birth, hence it derives its increase, and when it has seized upon those who look
greedily after it, it makes them live contrary to nature. For when they regard not their fellow
countrymen, their friends, their brethren,2922in a word all men, and with these even themselves,
this is to live against nature. Whence it is evident that the vice and disease of covetousness,
wherein Judas, being entangled, became a traitor, is contrary to nature. And how
did he become such a one, you may say, having been called by Christ? Because God’s call is
not compulsory, neither does it force the will of them who are not minded to choose virtue,
but admonishes indeed, and advises, and does and manages all things, so as to persuade
men to become good; but if some endure not, it does not compel. But if thou wouldest learn
from what cause he became such as he was, thou wilt find him to have been ruined by covetousness.</p>
<p>And how was he taken by this calamity? one may say. Because he grew remiss. For hence
arise such changes, as on the other hand, those for the better from diligence. How many for
instance that were violent, are now more gentle than lambs? how many lascivious persons
have become afterwards continent? how many, heretofore covetous, yet now have cast away
even their own possessions? And the contrary again has been the result of remissness. For
Gehazi also lived with a holy man, and he too became depraved from the same disease. For
this calamity is the most grievous of all. Hence come robbers of tombs, hence menslayers,
hence wars and fightings, and whatsoever evil thou mayest mention, it cometh hence. And
in every respect is such a one useless, whether it be requisite to lead an army or to guide a
people: or rather not in public matters only, but also in private. If he is to marry a wife, he
will not take the virtuous woman, but the vilest of all; if he have to buy a house, not that
<note type="footnote">2922 [The words “their kinsmen” should be inserted here.—R.]</note>

<pb n="840"/>
which becomes a free man, but what can bring much rent; if he is to buy slaves, or what else
it may be, he will take the worst.</p>
<p>And why do I speak of leading an army, and guiding a people, and managing households;
for should he be a king, he is the most wretched of all men, and a pest to the world, and the
poorest of all men. For he will feel like one of the common sort, not accounting all men’s
possessions to be his, but himself to be one of all; and when spoiling all men’s goods, thinks
himself to have less than any. For measuring the things present by his desire for those
whereof he is not yet possessed, he will account the former nothing compared to the latter.
Wherefore also one saith, “There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man.”2923</p>
<p>4. For such a one both setteth himself to sale, and goeth about, a common enemy of the
world, grieving that the earth doth not bear gold instead of the corn, and the fountains instead
of streams, and the mountains instead of stone; vexed at the fruitfulness of the seasons,
troubled at common benefits; shunning every means whence one cannot obtain money;
undergoing all things whence one can scrape together so much as two farthings; hating all
men, the poor and the rich; the poor, lest they should come and beg of him; the rich, because
he hath not their possessions. All men he accounts to be possessed of what is his, and as
though he had been injured by all, so is he displeased with all. He knows not plenty, he has
no experience of satiety, he is more wretched than any, even as, on the other hand, he that
is freed from these things, and practises self-restraint, is the most enviable. For the virtuous
man, though he be a servant, though a prisoner, is the most happy of all men. For no one
shall do him ill, no not though all men should come together out of the world, setting in
motion arms and camps, and warring with him. But he that is depraved and vile, and such
as we have described, though he be a king, though he have on a thousand diadems, will
suffer the utmost extremities, even from a common hand. So feeble is vice, so strong is virtue.</p>
<p>Why then dost thou mourn, being in a state of poverty. Why wailest thou keeping a
feast, for indeed it is an occasion of feasting. Why weepest thou, for poverty is a festival, if
thou be wise. Why lamentest thou, thou little child; for such a one we should call a little
child. Did such a person strike thee? What is this, he made thee more able to endure? But
did he take away thy money? He hath removed the greater part of thy burden. But hath he
cut off thine honor? Again thou tellest me of another kind of freedom. Hear even those
without teaching wisdom touching these things, and saying, “Thou hast suffered no ill, if
thou show no regard to it.” But hath he taken away that great house of thine, which hath
enclosures about it? But behold the whole earth is before thee, the public buildings, whether
thou wouldest have them for delight, or for use. And what is more pleasing or more beautiful
than the firmament of Heaven.</p>
<note type="footnote">2923 Ecclus. x. 9.</note>

<pb n="841"/>
<p>How long are ye poor and needy? It is not possible for him to be rich, who is not wealthy
in his soul; like as it is not possible for him to be poor, who hath not the poverty in his mind.
For if the soul is a nobler thing than the body, the less noble parts have not power to affect
it after themselves; but the noble part draws over unto herself, and changes those that are
not so noble. For so the heart, when it has received any hurt, affects the whole body accordingly;
if its temperament be disordered, it mars all, if it be rightly tempered, it profits all.</p>
<p>And if any of the remaining parts should have become corrupt, while this remains sound,
it easily shakes off what is evil in them also.
And that I may further make what I say more plain, what is the use, I pray thee, of
verdant branches, when the root is withering? and what is the harm of the leaves being
withered above, while this is sound? So also here there is no use of money, while the soul is
poor; neither harm from poverty, when the soul is rich. And how can a soul, one may say,
be rich, being in want of money? Then above all times might this be; for then also is it wont
to be rich.</p>
<p>For if, as we have often shown, this is a sure proof of being rich, to despise wealth, and
to want nothing; and of poverty again, to want, and any one would more easily despise
money in poverty than in wealth, it is quite evident that to be in poverty rather makes one
to be rich. For indeed that the rich man sets his heart on money more than the poor man,
is surely plain to every one; like as the drunken man is thirsty, rather than he that hath
partaken of drink sufficiently. For neither is his desire such as to be quenched by too much;
but, on the contrary, it is its nature to be inflamed by this. For fire likewise, when it has received
more food, then most of all waxes fierce; and the tyranny of wealth, when thou hast
cast into it more gold, then most especially is increased.</p>
<p>If then the desiring more be a mark of poverty; and he that is in the possession of riches
is like this; he is especially in poverty. Seest thou that the soul then most of all is poor, when
it is rich; and then is rich, when it is in poverty?</p>
<p>And if thou wilt, let us exercise our reasoning in persons also, and let there be two, the
one having ten thousand talents, the other ten, and from both let us take away these things.
Who then will grieve the most? He that hath lost the ten thousand. But he would not have
grieved more, unless he had loved it more; but if he loves more, he desires more; but if he
desires more, he is more in poverty. For this do we most desire, of which we are most in
want, for desire is from want. For where there is satiety, there cannot be desire. For then
are we most thirsty, when we have most need of drink.</p>
<p>And all these things have I said, to show that if we be vigilant, no one shall harm us;
and that the harm arises not from poverty but from ourselves. Wherefore I beseech you
with all diligence to put away the pest of covetousness, that we may both be wealthy here,
and enjoy the good things eternal, unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXI.</head>
<p>Matt. XXVI. 17, 18.</p>
<p>“Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where
wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover? And He said, Go into the city to
such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
Passover at thy house with My disciples.”</p>
<p>By the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, he means the day before that feast; for
they are accustomed always to reckon the day from the evening, and he makes mention of
this in which in the evening the passover must be killed;2924for on the fifth day of the week
they came unto Him. And this one2925calls the day before the feast of unleavened
bread,2926speaking of the time when they came to Him, and another saith on this wise,
“Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed;”2927by the word
“came,” meaning this, it was nigh, it was at the doors, making mention plainly of that
evening. For they began with the evening, wherefore also each adds, when the passover was
killed.</p>
<p>And they say, “Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the passover?” So even
from this it is manifest, that He had no house, no place of sojourning; and I suppose neither
had they. For surely they would have entreated him to come there. But neither had they
any, having now parted with all things.</p>
<p>But wherefore did He keep the passover? To indicate by all things unto the last day, that
He is not opposed to the law.</p>
<p>And for what possible reason doth He send them to an unknown person? To show by
this also that He might have avoided suffering. For He who prevailed over this man’s mind,
so that he received them, and that by words; what would He not have done with them that
crucified Him, if it had been His will not to suffer? And what He did about the ass, this He
did here also. For there too He saith, “If any man say aught unto you, ye shall say, that the
Lord hath need of them;”2928and so likewise here, “The Master saith, I will keep the passover

it in their hate against our Lord, explaining in this way the difficulty arising from the statement in John xviii.

at thy house.” But I marvel not at this only, that he received Him, being unknown, but that
expecting to bring upon himself such enmity and implacable hostility, he despised the enmity
of the multitude.</p>
<p>After this, because they knew him not, He gave them a sign, like as the prophet touching
Saul, saying, “Thou shalt find one going up and carrying a bottle;”2929and here, “carrying
a pitcher.” And see again the display of his power. For He did not only say, “I will keep the
passover,” but He adds another thing also, “My time is at hand.” And this He did, at once
continually reminding His disciples of the passion, so that exercised by the frequency of the
prediction, they should be prepared for what was to take place; and at the same time to show
to themselves, and to him that was receiving Him, and to all the Jews, which I have often
mentioned, that not involuntarily doth He come to His passion. And He adds, “with my
disciples,” in order that both the preparation should be sufficient, and that the man should
not suppose that He was concealing Himself.</p>
<p>“Now when the even was come, He sat down with the twelve disciples.”2930 Oh the
shamelessness of Judas! For he too was present there, and came to partake both of the
mysteries, and of the meal,2931and is convicted at the very table, when although he had been
a wild beast, he would have become tame.</p>
<p>For this cause the evangelist also signifies, that while they are eating, Christ speaks of
His betrayal, that both by the time and by the table he might show the wickedness of the
traitor.</p>
<p>For when the disciples had done, as Jesus had appointed them, “when the even was
come, He sat down with the twelve.2932 And as they did eat, He said,” we are told, “Verily,
I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.”2933 And before the supper, He had even
washed his feet. And see how He spares the traitor. For He said not, such a one shall betray
me; but, “one of you,” so as again to give him power of repentance by concealment. And
He chooseth to alarm all, for the sake of saving this man. Of you, the twelve, saith He, that
are everywhere present with me, whose feet I washed, to whom I promised so many things.</p>
<p>Intolerable sorrow thereupon seized that holy company. And John indeed saith, they
“were in doubt, and looked one upon another,”2934and each of them asked in fear concerning
himself, although conscious to themselves of no such thing. But this evangelist saith, that

“being exceeding sorrowful, they began every one of them to say unto Him, Is it I, Lord?2935
And He answered and said, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.”2936</p>
<p>Mark at what time He discovered him. It was when it was His will to deliver the rest
from this trouble, for they were even dead with the fear, wherefore also they were instant
with their questions. But not only as desiring to deliver them from their distress He did this,
but also as willing to amend the traitor. For since after having often heard it generally, he
continued incorrigible, being past feeling, He being minded to make him feel more, takes
off his mask.</p>
<p>For when being sorrowful they began to say, “Is it I, Lord? He answered and said, He
that dippeth2937with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of Man goeth, as it
is written of Him, but woe to the man by2938whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It had been
good for that man if he had not been born.”2939</p>
<p>Now some say that he was so bold as not to honor his Master, but to dip with Him: but
to me Christ seems to have done this too, to shame him the more, and bring him over to a
better disposition. For this act again has something more in it.</p>
<p>2. But these things we ought not to pass by at random, but they should be infixed in our
minds, and wrath would find no place at any time.</p>
<p>For who, bearing in mind that supper, and the traitor sitting at meat with the Saviour
of all, and Him who was to be betrayed thus meekly reasoning, would not put away all venom
of wrath and anger? See at any rate how meekly He conducts Himself towards him, “The
Son of Man goeth, as it is written of Him.”</p>
<p>And these things again He said, both to restore the disciples, that they might not think
the thing was a sign of weakness, and to amend the traitor.</p>
<p>“But woe unto that2940man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been good for
that man if he had not been born.” See again in His rebukes His unspeakable meekness. For
not even here with invective, but more in the way of compassion, doth He apply what He
saith, but in a disguised way again; and yet not his former senselessness only, but his subsequent
shamelessness was deserving of the utmost indignation. For after this conviction
he saith, “Is it I, Lord?”2941 Oh insensibility! He inquires, when conscious to himself of such

things. For the evangelist too, marvelling at his boldness, saith this. What then saith the
most mild and gentle Jesus? “Thou sayest.” And yet He might have said, O thou unholy,
thou all unholy one; accursed, and profane; so long a time in travail with mischief, who hast
gone thy way, and made satanical compacts, and hast agreed to receive money, and hast
been convicted by me too, dost thou yet dare to ask? But none of these things did He say;
but how? “Thou sayest?” fixing for us bounds and rules of long suffering.</p>
<p>But some one will say, Yet if it was written that He was to suffer these things, wherefore
is Judas blamed, for he did the things that were written? But not with this intent, but from
wickedness. For if thou inquire not concerning the motive, thou wilt deliver even the devil
from the charges against him. But these things are not, they are not so. For both the one
and the other are deserving of countless punishments, although the world was saved. For
neither did the treason of Judas work out salvation for us, but the wisdom of Christ, and
the good contrivance of His fair skill, using the wickednesses of others for our advantage.</p>
<p>“What then,” one may say, “though Judas had not betrayed Him, would not another
have betrayed Him?” And what has this to do with the question? “Because if Christ must
needs be crucified, it must be by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such
a person as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had been impeded.”
Not so. For the Allwise knows how He shall bring about our benefits, even had this happened.
For His wisdom is rich in contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no
one might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, He declares the
wretchedness of the man. But some one will say again, “And if it had been good if he had
never been born, wherefore did He suffer both this man, and all the wicked, to come into
the world?” When thou oughtest to blame the wicked, for that having the power not to become
such as they are, they have become wicked, thou leavest this, and busiest thyself, and
art curious about the things of God; although knowing that it is not by necessity that any
one is wicked.</p>
<p>“But the good only should be born,” he would say, “and there were no need of hell, nor
punishment, nor vengeance, nor trace of vice, but the wicked should either not be born at
all, or being born should straightway depart.”</p>
<p>First then, it were well to repeat to thee the saying of the apostle, “Nay but, O man, who
art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why
hast Thou made me thus?”2942</p>
<p>But if thou still demandest reasons, we would say this, that the good are more admired
for being among the bad; because their long-suffering and great self-command is then most
shown. But thou takest away the occasion of their wrestlings, and conflicts, by saying these
things. “What then, in order that these may appear good, are others punished?” saith he.
<note type="footnote">2942 Rom. ix. 20. [R.V., “Why didst thou make me thus?”]</note>

<pb n="846"/>
God forbid, but for their own wickedness. For neither because they were brought into the
world did they become wicked, but on account of their own wickedness; wherefore also they
are punished. For how should they fail to be deserving of punishment, seeing they have so
many teachers of virtue, and gain nothing therefrom. For like as the noble and good are
worthy of double honor, because they both became good, and took no hurt from the wicked;
so also the worthless deserve twofold punishment, both because they became wicked, when
they might have become good (they show it who have become such), and because they
gained nothing from the good.</p>
<p>But let us see what saith this wretched man, when convicted by his Master. What then
saith he? “Is it I, Rabbi?”2943 And why did he not ask this from the beginning? He thought
to escape knowledge by its being said, “one of you;” but when He had made him manifest,
he ventured again to ask, confiding in the clemency of his Master, that He would not convict
him.2944</p>
<p>3. O blindness! Whereunto hath it led him? Such is covetousness, it renders men fools
and senseless, yea reckless, and dogs instead of men, or rather even more fierce than dogs,
and devils after being dogs. This man at least received unto him the devil even when plotting
against him, but Jesus, even when doing him good, he betrayed, having already become a
devil in will. For such doth the insatiable desire of gain make men, out of their mind, frenzysmitten,
altogether given up to gain, as was the case even with Judas.</p>
<p>But how do Matthew and the other evangelists say, that, when he made the agreement
touching the treason, then the devil seized him; but John, that “after the sop Satan entered
into him.”2945 And John himself knew this, for further back he saith, “The devil having now
put into the heart of Judas, that he should betray Him.”2946 How then doth he say, “After
the sop Satan entered into him?” Because he enters not in suddenly, nor at once, but makes
much trial first, which accordingly was done here also. For after having tried him in the
beginning, and assailed him quietly, after that he saw him prepared to receive him, he
thenceforth wholly breathed himself into him, and completely got the better of him.</p>
<p>But how, if they were eating the passover, did they eat it contrary to the law? For they
should not have eaten it, sitting down to their meat.2947 What then can be said? That after
eating it, they then sat down to the banquet.</p>

<pb n="847"/>
<p>But another evangelist saith, that on that evening He not only ate the passover, but also
said, “With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you,”2948that is, on that year. For
what reason? Because then the salvation of the world was to be brought about, and the
mysteries to be delivered, and the subjects of sorrow to be done away with by His death; so
welcome was the cross to Him. But nothing softened the savage monster, nor moved, nor
shamed him. He pronounced him wretched, saying, “Woe to that man.” He alarmed him
again, saying, “It were good for him if he had not been born.” He put him to shame, saying,
“To whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.” And none of these things checked him,
but he was seized by covetousness, as by some madness, or rather by a more grievous disease.
For indeed this is the more grievous madness.</p>
<p>For what would the madman do like this? He poured not forth foam out of his mouth
but he poured forth the murder of his Lord. He distorted not his hands, but stretched them
out for the price of precious blood. Wherefore his madness was greater, because he was mad
being in health.</p>
<p>But he doth not utter sayest thou, sounds without meaning. And what is more without
meaning than this language. “What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you?”2949“I
will deliver,” the devil spake by that mouth. But he did not smite the ground with his feet
struggling? Nay, how much better so to struggle, than thus to stand upright. But sayest thou,
he did not cut himself with stones? Yet how much better, than to do such things as these!</p>
<p>Will ye, that we bring forward the possessed and the covetous, and make a comparison
between the two. But let no one account what is done a reproach to himself. For we do not
reproach the nature, but we lament the act. The possessed was never clad with garments,
cutting himself with stones, and running, he rushes over rough paths, driven headlong of
the devil. Do not these things seem to be dreadful? What then, if I shall show the covetous
doing more grievous things than these to their own soul, and to such a degree more grievous,
that these are considered child’s play compared with those. 
Will you indeed shun the pest?
Come then, let us see if they are in any respect in a more tolerable state than they. In none,
but even in a more grievous condition; for indeed they are more objects of shame than ten
thousand naked persons. For it were far better to be naked as to clothing, than being clad
with the fruits of covetousness, to go about like them that celebrate the orgies for Bacchus.
For like as they have on madmen’s masks and clothes, so have these also. And much as the
nakedness of the possessed is caused by madness, so doth madness produce this clothing,
and the clothing is more miserable than the nakedness.</p>
<p>And this I will hereby endeavor to prove. For whom should we say was more mad,
amongst madmen themselves; one who should cut himself, or one who together with himself
<note type="footnote">2948 Luke xxii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">2949 Matt. xxvi. 15.</note>

<pb n="848"/>
should hurt those who met him? It is quite clear that it is this last. The madmen then strip
themselves of their clothing, but these all that meet them. 
“But these tear their clothes to
pieces.” And how readily would every one of those that are injured consent that his garment
should be torn, rather than be stripped of all his substance?</p>
<p>“But those do not aim blows at the face.” In the first place, the covetous do even this,
and if not all, yet do all inflict by famine and penury more grievous pains on the belly.</p>
<p>“But those bite not with the teeth.” Would that it were with teeth, and not with the darts
of covetousness fiercer than teeth. “For their teeth are weapons and darts.”2950 For who will
feel most pained, he that was bitten once, and straightway healed, or he that is for ever eaten
up by the teeth of penury? For penury when involuntary is more grievous than furnace or
wild beast.</p>
<p>“But those rush not into the deserts like the possessed of devils.” Would it were the
deserts, and not the cities, that they overran, and so all in the cities enjoyed security. For
now in this respect again, they are more intolerable than all the insane, because they do in
the cities these things which the others do in the deserts, making the cities deserts, and like
as in a desert, where there is none to hinder, so plundering the goods of all men.</p>
<p>“But they do not pelt with stones them that meet them.” And what is this? Of stones it
were easy to beware; but of the wounds which by paper and ink they work to the wretched
poor (framing writings full of blows without number), who, out of those that fall in with
them, can ever easily beware?</p>
<p>4. And let us see also what they do to themselves. They walk naked up and down the
city, for they have no garment of virtue. But if this doth not seem to them to be a disgrace,
this again is of their exceeding madness, for that they have no feeling of the unseemliness,
but while they are ashamed of having their body naked, they bear about the soul naked, and
glory in it. And if you wish, I will tell you also the cause of their insensibility. What then is
the cause? They are naked amongst many that are thus naked, wherefore neither are they
ashamed, like as neither are we in the baths. So that if indeed there were many clothed with
virtue, then would their shame appear more. But now this above all is a worthy subject for
many tears, that because the bad are many, bad things are not even esteemed as a disgrace.
For besides the rest, the devil hath brought about this too, not to allow them to obtain even
a sense of their evil deeds, but by the multitude of them that practise wickedness, to throw
a shade over their disgrace; since if it came to pass that he was in the midst of a multitude
of persons practising self-restraint, such a one would see his nakedness more.</p>
<p>That they are more naked than the possessed is evident from these things; and that they
go into the deserts, neither this again could any one gainsay. For the wide and broad way is
more desert than any desert. For though it have many that journey on it, yet none from
<note type="footnote">2950 Ps. lvii. 4.</note>

<pb n="849"/>
amongst men, but serpents, scorpions, wolves, adders, and asps. Such are they that practise
wickedness. And this way is not only desert, but much more rugged than that of the mad.
And this is hereby evident. For stones and ravines and crags do not so wound those that
mount them, as robbery and covetousness the souls that practise them.</p>
<p>And that they live by the tombs, like the possessed, or rather that they themselves are
tombs, is plain by this. What is a tomb? A stone having a dead body lying in it. Wherein
then do these men’s bodies differ from those stones? or rather, they are more miserable even
than they. For it is not a stone containing a dead body, but a body more insensible than
stones, bearing about a dead soul. Wherefore one would not be wrong in calling them tombs.
For so did our Lord too call the Jews, for this reason most especially; He went on at least to
say, “Their inward parts are full of ravening and covetousness.”2951</p>
<p>Would ye that I show next, how they also cut their heads with stones? Whence then
first, I pray thee, wilt thou learn this? From the things here, or from the things to come? But
of the things to come they have not much regard; we must speak then of the things here.
For are not anxieties more grievous than many stones, not wounding heads, but consuming
a soul. For they are afraid, lest those things should justly go forth out of their house, which
have come unto them unjustly; they tremble in fear of the utmost ills, are angry, are provoked,
against those of their own house, against strangers; and now despondency, now fear, now
wrath, comes upon them in succession, and they are as if they were crossing precipice after
precipice, and they are earnestly looking day by day for what they have not yet acquired.
Wherefore neither do they feel pleasure in the things they have, both by reason of not feeling
confidence about the security of them, and because with their whole mind they are intent
upon what they have not yet seized. And like as one continually thirsting, though he should
drink up ten thousand fountains, feeleth not the pleasure, because he is not satisfied; so also
these, so far from feeling pleasure, are even tormented, the more they heap around themselves;
from their not feeling any limit to such desire.</p>
<p>And things here are like this; but let us speak also of the day to come. For though they
give not heed, yet it is necessary for us to speak. In the day to come then, one will see
everywhere such men as these undergoing punishment. For when He saith, “I was an
hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;”2952 He is punishing
these; and when He saith, “Depart into the eternal fire prepared for the devil,” He is
sending thither them that make a bad use of riches. And the wicked servant, who gives not
to his fellow-servants the goods of his Lord, is of the number of these men, and he that
buried his talent, and the five virgins.</p>
<note type="footnote">2951 Matt. xxiii. 25, and comp. verse 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">2952 Matt. xxv. 42.</note>

<pb n="850"/>
<p>And whithersoever thou shalt go, thou wilt see the covetous punished. And now they
will hear, “There is a void between us and you;”2953now, “Depart from me into the fire that
is prepared.”2954 And now being cut asunder, they will go away, where there is gnashing of
teeth, and from every place one may see them driven, and finding a place nowhere, but
gathered in hell alone.</p>
<p>5. What then is the use of the right faith to us for salvation, when we hear these things?
There, gnashing of teeth, and outer darkness, and the fire prepared for the devil, and to be
cut asunder, and to be driven away; here, enmities, evil speakings, slanders, perils, cares,
plots, to be hated of all, to be abhorred of all, even of the very persons that seem to flatter
us. For as good men are admired not by the good only but even by the wicked; so bad men,
not the good only, but also the worthless, hate. And in proof that this is true, I would gladly
ask of the covetous, whether they do not feel painfully one toward another; and account
such more their enemies than those that have done them the greatest wrong; whether they
do not also accuse themselves, whether they do not account the thing an affront, if any one
brings this reproach upon them. For indeed this is an extreme reproach, and a sure proof
of much wickedness; for if thou dost not endure to despise wealth, of what wilt thou ever
get the better? of lust, or of the mad desire of glory, or anger, or of wrath? And how would
any be persuaded of it? For as to lust, and anger, and wrath, many impute it even to the
temperament of the flesh, and to this do students of medicine refer the excesses thereof; and
him that is of a more hot and languid temperament, they affirm to be more lustful; but him
that runs out into a drier kind of ill temperament, eager, and irritable, and wrathful. But
with respect to covetousness, no one ever heard of their having said any such thing. So entirely
is the pest the effect of mere remissness, and of a soul past feeling.</p>
<p>Therefore, I beseech you, let us give diligence to amend all such things, and to give an
opposite direction to the passions that come upon us in every age. But if in every part of
our life we sail past the labors of virtue, everywhere undergoing shipwrecks; when we have
arrived at the harbor destitute of spiritual freight, we shall undergo extreme punishment.
For our present life is an outstretched ocean. And as in the sea here, there are different bays
exposed to different tempests, and the Ægean is difficult because of the winds, the Tyrrhenian
strait because of the confined space, the Charybdis that is by Africa because of the
shallows, the Propontis, which is without the Euxine sea, on account of its violence and
currents, the parts without Cadiz because of the desolation, and tracklessness, and unexplored
places therein, and other portions for other causes; so also is it in our life.</p>
<p>And the first sea to view is that of our childish days, having much tempestuousness,
because of its folly, its facility, because it is not steadfast. Therefore also we set over it guides
<note type="footnote">2953 Luke xvi. 26. [Freely cited.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2954 Matt. xxv. 41.</note>

<pb n="851"/>
and teachers, by our diligence adding what is wanting to nature, even as there by the pilot’s
skill.</p>
<p>After this age succeeds the sea of the youth, where the winds are violent as in the Ægean,
lust increasing upon us. And this age especially is destitute of correction; not only because
he is beset more fiercely, but also because his faults are not reproved, for both teacher and
guide after that withdraw. When therefore the winds blow more fiercely, and the pilot is
more feeble, and there is no helper, consider the greatness of the tempest.</p>
<p>After this there is again another period of life, that of men, in which the cares of the
household press upon us, when there is a wife, and marriage, and begetting of children, and
ruling of a house, and thick falling showers of cares. Then especially both covetousness
flourishes and envy.</p>
<p>When then we pass each part of our life with shipwrecks, how shall we suffice for the
present life? how shall we escape future punishment. For when first in the earliest age we
learn nothing healthful, and then in youth we do not practise sobriety, and when grown to
manhood do not get the better of covetousness, coming to old age as to a hold full of bilgewater,
and as having made the barque of the soul weak by all these shocks, the planks being
separated, we shall arrive at that harbor, bearing much filth instead of spiritual merchandise,
and to the devil we shall furnish laughter, but lamentation to ourselves, and bring upon
ourselves the intolerable punishments.</p>
<p>That these things may not be, let us brace ourselves up on every side, and, withstanding
all our passions, let us cast out the lust of wealth, that we may also attain unto the good
things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXVI. 26-28.</p>
<p>“And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave2955it to
the disciples, and said, Take, eat; This is my body.”</p>
<p>“And He took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; This is
my blood of the New Testament, Which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.”2956</p>
<p>Ah! how great is the blindness of the traitor! Even partaking of the mysteries, he remained
the same; and admitted to the most holy2957table, he changed not. And this Luke shows by
saying, that after this Satan entered2958into him, not as despising the Lord’s body, but
thenceforth laughing to scorn the traitor’s shamelessness. For indeed his sin became greater
from both causes, as well in that he came to the mysteries with such a disposition, as that
having approached them, he did not become better, either from fear, or from the benefit,
or from the honor. But Christ forbad him not, although He knew all things, that thou
mightest learn that He omits none of the things that pertain to correction. Wherefore both
before this, and after this, He continually admonished him, and checked him, both by deeds,
and by words; both by fear, and by kindness; both by threatening, and by honor. But none
of these things withdrew him from that grievous pest.</p>
<p>Wherefore thenceforth He leaves him, and by the mysteries again reminds the disciples
of His being slain, and in the midst of the meal His discourse is of the cross, by the continual
repeating of the prediction, making His passion easy to receive. For if, when so many things
had been done and foretold, they were troubled; if they had heard none of these things, what
would they not have felt?</p>
<p>“And as they were eating, He took bread, and brake it.” Why can it have been that He
ordained this sacrament then, at the time of the passover? That thou mightest learn from
everything, both that He is the lawgiver of the Old Testament, and that the things therein
are foreshadowed because of these things. Therefore, I say, where the type is, there He puts
the truth.</p>
<p>But the evening is a sure sign of the fullness of times, and that the things were now come
to the very end.</p>
<note type="footnote">2955 [εχαριστσα (from verse 27) is substituted for ελογσα; and ἔδωκεν (from the same verse) for ἐδδου (rec.

<pb n="853"/>
<p>And He gives thanks, to teach us how we ought to celebrate this sacrament, and to show
that not unwillingly doth He come to the passion, and to teach us whatever we may suffer
to bear it thankfully, thence also suggesting good hopes. For if the type was a deliverance
from such bondage, how much more will the truth set free the world, and will He be delivered
up for the benefit of our race. Wherefore, I would add, neither did He appoint the sacrament
before this, but when henceforth the rites of the law were to cease. And thus the very chief
of the feasts He brings to an end, removing them to another most awful table, and He saith,
“Take, eat, This is my body, Which is broken for many.”</p>
<p>And how were they not confounded at hearing this? Because He had before told unto
them many and great things touching this. Wherefore that He establishes no more, for they
had heard it sufficiently, but he speaks of the cause of His passion, namely, the taking away
of sins. And He calls it blood of a New Testament, that of the undertaking, the promise, the
new law. For this He undertook also of old, and this comprises the Testament that is in the
new law. And like as the Old Testament had sheep and bullocks, so this has the Lord’s blood.
Hence also He shows that He is soon to die, wherefore also He made mention of a Testament,
and He reminds them also of the former Testament, for that also was dedicated with blood.
And again He tells the cause of His death, “which is shed for many for the remission of
sins;” and He saith, “Do this in remembrance of me.” Seest thou how He removes and draws
them off from Jewish customs. For like as ye did that, He saith, in remembrance of the
miracles in Egypt, so do this likewise in remembrance of me. That was shed for the preservation
of the firstborn, this for the remission of the sins of the whole world. For, “This,”
saith He, “is my blood, which is shed for the remission of sins.”</p>
<p>But this He said, indicating thereby, that His passion and His cross are a mystery, by
this too again comforting His disciples. And like as Moses saith, “This shall be to you for
an everlasting memorial,”2959so He too, “in remembrance of me,” until I come.2960 Therefore
also He saith, “With desire I have desired to eat this passover,”2961that is, to deliver you the
new rites, and to give a passover, by which I am to make you spiritual.</p>
<p>And He Himself drank of it. For lest on hearing this, they should say, What then? do
we drink blood, and eat flesh? and then be perplexed (for when He began to discourse
concerning these things, even at the very sayings many were offended),2962therefore lest
they should be troubled then likewise, He first did this Himself, leading them to the calm
participation of the mysteries. Therefore He Himself drank His own blood. What then must

<note type="footnote">2962 John vi. 60, 61, 66.</note>

<pb n="854"/>
we observe that other ancient rite also? some one may say. By no means. For on this account
He said, “Do this,” that He might withdraw them from the other. For if this worketh remission
of sins, as it surely doth work it, the other is now superfluous.</p>
<p>As then in the case of the Jews, so here also He hath bound up the memorial of the benefit
with the mystery, by this again stopping the mouths of heretics. For when they say,
Whence is it manifest that Christ was sacrificed? together with the other arguments we stop
their mouths from the mysteries also. For if Jesus did not die, of what are the rites the symbols?</p>
<p>2. Seest thou how much diligence hath been used, that it should be ever borne in mind
that He died for us? For since the Marcionists, and Valentinians, and Manichæans were to
arise, denying this dispensation, He continually reminds us of the passion even by the
mysteries, (so that no man should be deceived); at once saving, and at the same time teaching
by means of that sacred table. For this is the chief of the blessings; wherefore Paul also is in
every way pressing this.</p>
<p>Then, when He had delivered it, He saith, “I will not drink of the fruit of this wine, until
that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”2963 For because He had
discoursed with them concerning passion and cross, He again introduces what He has to
say of His resurrection, having made mention of a kingdom before them,2964table, and rise
up in drunkenness, whereas it were meet to give thanks, and end with an hymn.</p>
<p>Hear this, as many as wait not again for the last prayer of the mysteries, for this is a
symbol of that. He gave thanks before He gave it to His disciples, that we also may give
thanks. He gave thanks, and sang an hymn after the giving, that we also may do this selfsame
thing.</p>
<p>But for what reason doth He go forth unto the mountain? Making Himself manifest,
that He may be taken, in order not to seem to hide himself. For He hastened to go to the
place which was also known to Judas.</p>
<p>Then “He saith unto them, All ye shall be offended in me.”2965 After this He mentions
also a prophecy, “For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered
abroad:”2966at once persuading them ever to give heed to the things that are written, and
at same time making it plain that He was crucified, according to God’s purpose; and by
everything showing He was no alien from the old covenant, nor from the God preached
<note type="footnote">2963 Matt. xxvi. 29. [The word “henceforth” is omitted; “this” is joined with “vine,” and “new” is in a different

therein, but that what is done is a dispensation,2967and that the prophets all proclaimed all
things beforehand from the beginning that are comprised in the matter, so that they be quite
confident about the better things also.</p>
<p>And He teaches us to know what the disciples were before the crucifixion, what after
the crucifixion. For indeed they who, when He was crucified, were not able so much as to
stand their ground, these after His death were mighty, and stronger than adamant.</p>
<p>And this self-same thing is a demonstration of His death, the fright and cowardice, I
mean, of His disciples. For if when so many things have been both done and said, still some
are shameless, and say that He was not crucified; if none of these things had come to pass,
to what pitch of wickedness would they not have proceeded? So for this reason, not by His
own sufferings only, but by what took place with respect to the disciples, He confirms the
word concerning His death, and by the mysteries also, in every way confounding those that
are diseased with the pest of Marcion. For this reason He suffers even the chief apostle to
deny Him. But if He was not bound nor crucified, whence sprung the fear to Peter, and to
the rest of the apostles.</p>
<p>He suffers them not however, on the other hand, to wait until the sorrows, but what
saith He? “But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.”2968 For not from
Heaven doth He appear at once, neither will He depart into any distant country, but in the
same nation, in which He had also been crucified, nearly in the same place, so as hereby
again to assure them that He that was crucified was the very same that rose again, and in
this way to comfort them more abundantly when in sorrow. Therefore also He said “in
Galilee,” that being freed from the fears of the Jews they might believe His saying. For which
cause indeed He appeared there.</p>
<p>“But Peter answered and said, Though all men should be offended because of Thee, yet
will I never be offended.”2969</p>
<p>3. What sayest thou, O Peter? the prophet said, “The sheep shall be scattered;” Christ
hath confirmed the saying, and sayest thou, No? Is not what passed before enough, when
Thou saidst, “Far be it from Thee,”2970and thy mouth was stopped? For this then He suffers
him to fall, teaching him thereby to believe Christ in all things, and to account His declaration
more trustworthy than one’s own conscience. And the rest too reaped no small benefit from
his denial, having come to know man’s weakness, and God’ s truth. For when He foretells
anything, we must no longer be subtle, nor lift up ourselves above the common sort. For,
“thy rejoicing,” it is said, “thou shalt have in thyself, and not in another.”2971 For where he

should have prayed, and have said, Help us, that we be not cut off, he is confident in himself,
and saith, “Though all men should be offended in Thee, yet will I never;” though all should
undergo this, I shall not undergo it, which led him on by little and little to self-confidence.
Christ then, out of a desire to put down this, permitted his denial. For since he neither
submitted to Him nor the prophet (and yet for this intent He brought in the prophet besides,
that they may not gainsay), but nevertheless since he submitted not to His words, he is instructed
by deeds.</p>
<p>For in proof that for this intent He permitted it, that He might amend this in him, hear
what He saith, “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.”2972 For this He said sharply
reproving him, and showing that his fall was more grievous than the rest, and needed more
help. For the matters of blame were two; both that he gainsaid; and, that he set himself before
the other; or rather a third too, namely, that he attributed all to himself.</p>
<p>To cure these things then, He suffered the fall to take place, and for this cause also leaves
the others, and addresses Himself earnestly to him. For, “Simon,”2973saith He, “Simon, behold
Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat;” that is, that he may trouble,
confound, tempt you; but “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.”</p>
<p>And why, if Satan desired all, did He not say concerning all, I have prayed for you? Is
it not quite plain that it is this, which I have mentioned before, that it is as reproving him,
and showing that his fall was more grievous than the rest, that He directs His words to him?</p>
<p>And wherefore said He not, But I did not suffer it, rather than, “I have prayed?” He
speaks from this time lowly things, on His way to His passion, that He may show His humanity.
For He that has built His church upon Peter’s confession, and has so fortified it,
that ten thousand dangers and deaths are not to prevail over it; He that hath given him the
keys of Heaven, and hath put him in possession of so much authority, and in no manner
needed a prayer for these ends (for neither did He say, I have prayed, but with His own authority,
“I will build my church, and I will give thee the keys of Heaven”), how should He
need to pray, that He might brace up the shaken soul of a single man? Wherefore then did
He speak in this way? For the cause which I mentioned, and because of their weakness, for
they had not as yet the becoming view of Him.</p>
<p>How then was it that He denied? he said not, that thou mayest not deny, but that thy
faith fail not, that thou perish not utterly. For this came from His care.</p>
<p>For indeed fear had driven out all else, for it was beyond measure, and it became beyond
measure, since God had to an exceeding degree deprived him of His help, and He did exceedingly
deprive him thereof, because there was to an exceeding degree in him the passion
<note type="footnote">2972 Luke xxii. 32. [R.V., “made supplication.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2973 Luke xxii. 31. [R.V., “Satan asked;” margin, “Or, obtained you by asking.”]</note>

<pb n="857"/>
of self-will and contradiction. In order then that He might pluck it up by the roots, therefore
He suffered the terror to overtake him.</p>
<p>For in proof that this passion was grievous in him, he was not content with his former
words, gainsaying both prophet and Christ, but also after these things when Christ had said
unto him, “Verily I say unto thee, that this night,2974before the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice,” he replieth, “Though I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee in any wise.”2975
And Luke signifies moreover, that the more Christ warned him, so much the more did Peter
exceedingly oppose Him.</p>
<p>What mean these things, O Peter? When He was saying, “One of you shall betray me,”
thou didst fear lest thou shouldest be the traitor, and didst constrain the disciple to ask, although
conscious to thyself of no such thing; but now, when He is plainly crying out, and
saying, “All shall be offended,” art thou gainsaying it, and not once only, but twice and often?
For this is what Luke saith.</p>
<p>Whence then did this come to him? From much love, from much pleasure. I mean, that
after that he was delivered from that distressing fear about the betrayal, and knew the traitor,
he then spoke confidently, and lifted himself up over the rest, saying, “Though all men shall
be offended, yet will I not be offended.”2976 And in some degree too his conduct sprung
from jealousy, for at supper they reasoned “which of them is the greater,”2977to such a degree
did this passion trouble them. Therefore He checked him, not compelling him to the denial,
God forbid! but leaving him destitute of His help, and convicting human nature.</p>
<p>See at any rate after these things how he was subdued. For after the resurrection, when
he had said, “And what shall this man do?”2978and was silenced, he ventured no more to
gainsay as here, but held his peace. Again, towards the assumption,2979when he heard, “It
is not for you to know times or seasons,”2980again he holds his peace, and contradicts not.
After these things, on the house, and by the sheet, when he heard a voice saying to him,
“What God hath cleansed, call not thou common,”2981even though he knew not for the
time what the saying could be, he is quiet, and strives not.</p>
<p>4. All these things did that fall effect, and whereas before that he attributes all to himself,
saying, “Though all men shall be offended, yet will I not be offended;” and, “If I should die,
<note type="footnote">2974 [The preposition ἐν is omitted from the Greek text.—R.]</note>

I will not deny Thee” (when he should have said, If I receive the assistance from Thee);—yet
after these things altogether the contrary, “Why do ye give heed to us, as though by our own
power or holiness we had made him to walk?”2982</p>
<p>Hence we learn a great doctrine, that a man’s willingness is not sufficient, unless any
one receive the succor from above; and that again we shall gain nothing by the succor from
above, if there be not a willingness. And both these things do Judas and Peter show; for the
one, though he had received much help, was profited nothing, because he was not willing,
neither contributed his part; but this one, though he was ready in mind, because he received
no assistance, fell. For indeed of these two things is virtue’s web woven.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you neither (when you have cast all upon God) to sleep yourselves,
nor, when laboring earnestly, to think to accomplish all by your own toils. For neither is it
God’s will that we should be supine ourselves, therefore He worketh it not all Himself; nor
yet boasters, therefore He did not give all to us; but having removed what was hurtful in
either way, left that which is useful for us. Therefore He suffered even the chief apostle to
fall, both rendering him more humbled in mind, and training him thenceforth to greater
love. “For to whom more is forgiven,” it is said, “he loveth more.”2983</p>
<p>Let us then in everything believe God, and gainsay Him in nothing, though what is said
seem to be contrary to our thoughts and senses, but let His word be of higher authority than
both reasonings and sight. Thus let us do in the mysteries also, not looking at the things set
before us, but keeping in mind His sayings.</p>
<p>For His word cannot deceive, but our senses are easily beguiled. That hath never failed,
but this in most things goeth wrong. Since then the word saith, “This is my body,” let us
both be persuaded and believe, and look at it with the eyes of the mind.</p>
<p>For Christ hath given nothing sensible, but though in things sensible yet all to be perceived
by the mind. So also in baptism, the gift is bestowed by a sensible thing, that is, by
water; but that which is done is perceived by the mind, the birth, I mean, and the renewal.
For if thou hadst been incorporeal, He would have delivered thee the incorporeal gifts bare;
but because the soul hath been locked up in a body, He delivers thee the things that the
mind perceives, in things sensible.</p>
<p>How many now say, I would wish to see His form, the mark, His clothes, His shoes. Lo!
thou seest Him, Thou touchest Him, thou eatest Him. And thou indeed desirest to see His
clothes, but He giveth Himself to thee not to see only, but also to touch and eat and receive
within thee.</p>
<p>Let then no one approach it with indifference, no one faint-hearted, but all with burning
hearts, all fervent, all aroused. For if Jews standing, and having on their shoes and their

<note type="footnote">2983 Luke vii. 47.</note>

<pb n="859"/>
staves in their hands, ate with haste, much more oughtest thou to be watchful. For they indeed
were to go forth to Palestine, wherefore also they had the garb of pilgrims, but thou art about
to remove unto Heaven.</p>
<p>5. Wherefore it is needful in all respects to be vigilant, for indeed no small punishment
is appointed to them that partake unworthily.</p>
<p>Consider how indignant thou art against the traitor, against them that crucified Him.
Look therefore, lest thou also thyself become guilty of the body and blood of Christ. They
slaughtered the all-holy body, but thou receivest it in a filthy soul after such great benefits.
For neither was it enough for Him to be made man, to be smitten and slaughtered, but He
also commingleth Himself with us, and not by faith only, but also in very deed maketh us
His body. What then ought not he to exceed in purity that hath the benefit of this sacrifice,
than what sunbeam should not that hand be more pure which is to sever this flesh, the
mouth that is filled with spiritual fire, the tongue that is reddened by that most awful blood?
Consider with what sort of honor thou wast honored, of what sort of table thou art partaking.
That which when angels behold, they tremble, and dare not so much as look up at it without
awe on account of the brightness that cometh thence, with this we are fed, with this we are
commingled, and we are made one body and one flesh with Christ. “Who shall declare the
mighty works of the Lord, and cause all His praises to be heard?”2984 What shepherd feeds
his sheep with his own limbs? And why do I say, shepherd? There are often mothers that
after the travail of birth send out their children to other women as nurses; but He endureth
not to do this, but Himself feeds us with His own blood, and by all means entwines us with
Himself.</p>
<p>Mark it, He was born of our substance. But, you say, this is nothing to all men; though
it does concern all. For if He came unto our nature, it is quite plain that it was to all; but if
to all, then to each one. And how was it, you say, that all did not reap the profit therefrom.
This was not of His doing, whose choice it was to do this in behalf of all, but the fault of
them that were not willing. With each one of the faithful doth He mingle Himself in the
mysteries, and whom He begat, He nourishes by Himself, and putteth not out to another;
by this also persuading thee again, that He had taken thy flesh. Let us not then be remiss,
having been counted worthy of so much both of love and honor. See ye not the infants with
how much eagerness they lay hold of the breast? with what earnest desire they fix their lips
upon the nipple? With the like let us also approach this table, and the nipple of the spiritual
cup. Or rather, with much more eagerness let us, as infants at the breast, draw out the grace
of the spirit, let it be our one sorrow, not to partake of this food. The works set before us
are not of man’s power. He that then did these things at that supper, this same now also
works them. We occupy the place of servants. He who sanctifieth and changeth them is the

same. Let then no Judas be present, no covetous man. If any one be not a disciple, let him
withdraw, the table receives not such. For “I keep the passover,” He saith, “with my disciples.”
2985</p>
<p>This table is the same as that, and hath nothing less. For it is not so that Christ wrought
that, and man this, but He doth this too. This is that upper chamber, where they were then;
and hence they went forth unto the mount of Olives.</p>
<p>Let us also go out unto the hands of the poor, for this spot is the mount of Olives. For
the multitude of the poor are olive-trees planted in the house of God, dropping the oil, which
is profitable for us there, which the five virgins had, and the others that had not received
perished thereby. Having received this, let us enter in that with bright lamps we may meet
the bridegroom; having received this, let us go forth hence.</p>
<p>Let no inhuman person be present, no one that is cruel and merciless, no one at all that
is unclean.</p>
<p>6. These things I say to you that receive, and to you that minister. For it is necessary to
address myself to you also, that you may with much care distribute the gifts there. There is
no small punishment for you, if being conscious of any wickedness in any man, you allow
him to partake of this table. “His blood shall be required at your hands.”2986 Though any
one be a general, though a deputy, though it be he himself who is invested with the diadem,
and come unworthily, forbid him, the authority thou hast is greater than his. Thou, if thou
wert entrusted to keep a spring of water clean for a flock, and then wert to see a sheep having
much mire on its mouth, thou wouldest not suffer it to stoop down unto it and foul the
stream: but now being entrusted with a spring not of water, but of blood and of spirit, if
thou seest any having on them sin, which is more grievous than earth and mire, coming
unto it, art thou not displeased? dost thou not drive them off? and what excuse canst thou
have?</p>
<p>For this end God hath honored you with this honor, that ye should discern these things.
This is your office, this your safety, this your whole crown, not that ye should go about
clothed in a white and shining vestment.</p>
<p>And whence know I, you may say, this person, and that person? I speak not of the unknown,
but of the notorious.</p>
<p>Shall I say something more fearful. It is not so grievous a thing for the energumens2987to
be within, as for such as these, whom Paul affirms to trample Christ under foot, and to
“account the blood of the covenant unclean, and to do despite to the grace of the Spirit.”2988

For he that hath fallen into sin and draws nigh, is worse than one possessed with a devil.
For they, because they are possessed are not punished, but those, when they draw nigh unworthily,
are delivered over to undying punishment. Let us not therefore drive away these
only, but all without exception, whomsoever we may see coming unworthily.</p>
<p>Let no one communicate who is not of the disciples. Let no Judas receive, lest he suffer
the fate of Judas. This multitude also is Christ’s body. Take heed, therefore, thou that ministerest
at the mysteries, lest thou provoke the Lord, not purging this body. Give not a sword
instead of meat.</p>
<p>Nay, though it be from ignorance that he come to communicate, forbid him, be not
afraid. Fear God, not man. If thou shouldest fear man, thou wilt be laughed to scorn even
by him, but if God, thou wilt be an object of respect even to men.</p>
<p>But if thou darest not to do it thyself, bring him to me; I will not allow any to dare do
these things. I would give up my life rather than impart of the Lord’s blood to the unworthy;
and will shed my own blood rather than impart of such awful blood contrary to what is
meet.</p>
<p>But if any hath not known the bad man, after much inquiry, it is no blame. For these
things have been said about the open sinners. For if we amend these, God will speedily discover
to us the unknown also; but if we let these alone, wherefore should He then make
manifest those that are hidden.</p>
<p>But these things I say, not that we repel them only, nor cut them off, but in order that
we may amend them, and bring them back, that we may take care of them. For thus shall
we both have God propitious, and shall find many to receive worthily; and for our own diligence,
and for our care for others, receive great reward; unto which God grant we may all
attain by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXVI. 36-38.</p>
<p>“Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples,
Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy: and He saith unto them, My soul is
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here, and watch with me.”2989</p>
<p>Because they clung to Him inseparably, therefore He saith, “Tarry ye here, while I go
away and pray.” For it was usual with Him to pray apart from them. And this He did
teaching us in our prayers, to prepare silence for ourselves and great retirement.</p>
<p>And He takes with Him the three, and saith unto them, “my soul is exceeding sorrowful,
even unto death.” Wherefore doth He not take all with Him? That they might not be cast
down; but these He taketh that had been spectators of His glory. However, even these He
dismisses: “And He went on a little farther, and prayeth, saying, Father, if it be possible, let
this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt. And He cometh unto
them, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me
one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing,
but the flesh is weak.”2990</p>
<p>Not without reason doth He inveigh against Peter most, although the others also had
slept; but to make him feel by this also, for the cause which I mentioned before. Then because
the others also said the same thing (for when Peter had said (these are the words), “Though
I must die with Thee, I will not deny Thee; likewise also,” it is added, “said all the disciples”);
2991 He addresses Himself to all, convicting their weakness. For they who are desiring
to die with Him, were not then able so much as to sorrow with Him wakefully, but sleep
overcame them.</p>
<p>And He prays with earnestness, in order that the thing might not seem to be acting.
And sweats flow over him for the same cause again, even that the heretics might not say
this, that He acts the agony. Therefore there is a sweat like drops of blood, and an angel
appeared strengthening Him, and a thousand sure signs of fear, lest any one should affirm
the words to be feigned. For this cause also was this prayer. By saying then, “If it be possible,
let it pass from me,” He showed His humanity; but by saying, “Nevertheless not as I will,

but as Thou wilt,” He showed His virtue and self-command, teaching us even when nature
pulls us back, to follow God. For since it was not enough for the foolish to show His face
only, He uses words also. Again, words sufficed not alone, but deeds likewise were needed;
these also He joins with the words, that even they who are in a high degree contentious may
believe, that He both became man and died. For if, even when these things are so, this be
still disbelieved by some, much more, if these had not been. See by how many things He
shows the reality of the incarnation: by what He speaks, by what He suffers. After that He
cometh and saith to Peter, as it is said, “What, couldest thou not watch one hour with
me?”2992 All were sleeping, and He re bukes Peter, hinting at him, in what He spake. And
the words, “with me,” are not employed without reason; it is as though He had said, Thou
couldest not watch with me one hour, and wilt thou lay down thy life for me? and what
follows also, intimates this self-same thing. For “Watch,” saith He, “and pray not to enter
into temptation.” See how He is again instructing them not to be self-confident, but contrite
in mind, and to be humble, and to refer all to God.</p>
<p>And at one time He addresses Himself to Peter, at another to all in common. And to
him He saith, “Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat;
but I have prayed for thee;” and to all in common, “Pray that ye enter not into temptation;”
every way plucking up their self-will, and making them earnest-minded. Then, that He
might not seem to make His language altogether condemnatory, He saith, “The spirit indeed
is ready, but the flesh is weak.” For even although thou dost desire to despise death, yet thou
wilt not be able, until God stretch forth His hand, for the carnal mind draws down.</p>
<p>And again He prayed in the same way, saying, “Father, if this cannot pass from me except
I drink it, Thy will be done,”2993showing here, that He fully harmonizes with God’s will,
and that we must always follow this, and seek after it.</p>
<p>“And He came and found them asleep.”2994 For besides that it was late at night, their
eyes also were weighed down by their despondency. And the third time He went and spake
the same thing, establishing the fact, that He was become man. For the second and third
time is in the Scriptures especially indicative of truth; like as Joseph also said to Pharaoh,
“Did the dream appear to thee the second time? For truth was this done, and that thou
mightest be assured that this shall surely be.”2995 Therefore He too once, and twice, and
three times spake the same thing, for the sake of proving the incarnation.2996</p>

<p>And wherefore came He the second time? In order to reprove them, for that they were
so drowned in despondency, as not to have any sense even of His presence. He did not
however reprove them, but stood apart from them a little, showing their unspeakable
weakness, that not even when they had been rebuked, were they able to endure. But He doth
not awake and rebuke them again, lest He should smite them that were already smitten, but
He went away and prayed, and when He is come back again, He saith, “Sleep on now, and
take your rest.” And yet then there was need to be wakeful, but to show that they will not
bear so much as the sight of the dangers, but will be put to flight and desert Him from their
terror, and that He hath no need of their succor, and that He must by all means be delivered
up, “Sleep on now,” He saith, “and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son
of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.”2997</p>
<p>He shows again that what is done belongs to a divine dispensation.</p>
<p>2. But He doth not this only, but also, by saying, “into the hands of sinners,” He cheers
up their minds, showing it was the effect of their wickedness, not of His being liable to any
charge.</p>
<p>“Rise, let us be going; behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.”2998 For by all means
He taught them, that the matter was not of necessity, nor of weakness, but of some secret
dispensation. For, as we see, He foreknew that Judas would come, and so far from flying,
He even went to meet him. At any rate, “While He yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve,
came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and
elders of the people.”2999 Seemly surely are the instruments of the priests! “with swords and
staves” do they come against Him! And Judas, it is said, with them, one of the twelve. Again
he calleth him “of the twelve,” and is not ashamed. Now he that betrayed Him gave them a
sign, saying, “Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast.”3000 Oh! what depravity
had the traitor’s soul received. For with what kind of eyes did he then look at his
Master? with what mouth did he kiss Him? Oh! accursed purpose; what did he devise? What
did he dare? What sort of sign of betrayal did he give? Whomsoever I shall kiss, he saith.
He was emboldened by his Master’s gentleness, which more than all was sufficient to shame
him, and to deprive him of all excuse for that he was betraying one so meek.</p>
<p>But wherefore doth He say this? Because often when seized by them He had gone out
through the midst, without their knowing it. Nevertheless, then also this would have been
done, if it had not been His own will that He should be taken. It was at least with a view to
teach them this, that He then blinded their eyes, and Himself asked, “Whom seek ye?”3001

<pb n="865"/>
And they knew Him not, though being with lanterns and torches, and having Judas with
them. Afterwards, as they had said, “Jesus;” He saith, “I am He” whom ye seek: and here
again, “Friend, wherefore art thou come?”3002</p>
<p>For after having shown His own strength, then at once He yielded Himself. But John
saith, that even to the very moment He continued to reprove him, saying, “Judas, betrayest
thou the Son of Man with a kiss?”3003 Art thou not ashamed even of the form of the betrayal?
saith He. Nevertheless, forasmuch as not even this checked him, He submitted to be kissed,
and gave Himself up willingly; and they laid their hands on Him, and seized Him that night
on which they ate the passover, to such a degree did they boil with rage, and were mad.
However, they would have had no strength, unless He had Himself suffered it. Yet this delivers
not Judas from intolerable punishment, but even more exceedingly condemns him,
for that though he had received such proof of His power, and lenity, and meekness, and
gentleness, he became fiercer than any wild beast.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us flee from covetousness. For that, that it was, which
then drove him to madness; that exercises them who are taken thereby in the most extreme
cruelty and inhumanity. For, when it makes them to despair of their own salvation, much
more doth it cause them to overlook that of the rest of mankind. And so tyrannical is the
passing, as sometimes to prevail over the keenest lust. Wherefore indeed I am exceedingly
ashamed, that to spare their money, may indeed have bridled their unchastity, but for the
fear of Christ they were not willing to live chastely and with gravity.</p>
<p>Wherefore I say, let us flee from it; for I will not cease for ever saying this. For why, O
man, dost thou gather gold? Why dost thou make thy bondage more bitter? Why thy
watching more grievous? Why thy anxiety more painful? Account for thine own the metals
buried in the mines, those in the kings’ courts. For indeed if thou hadst all that heap, thou
wouldest keep it only, and wouldest not use it. For if now thou hast not used the things thou
possessest, but abstainest from them as though they belonged to others, much more would
this be the case with thee, if thou hadst more. For it is the way of the covetous, the more
they heap up around them, the more to be sparing of it. “But I know,” sayest thou, “that
these things are mine.” The possession then is in supposition only, not in enjoyment. But I
should be an object of fear to men, sayest thou. Nay, but thou wouldest by this become a
more easy prey both to rich and poor, to robbers, and false accusers, and servants, and in
general to all that are minded to plot against thee. For if thou art desirous to be an object of
fear, cut off the occasions by which they are able to lay hold of thee and pain thee, whoever

have set their hearts thereon. Hearest thou not the parable that saith, that the poor and naked
man, not even a hundred men gathered together are ever able to strip? For he hath his
poverty as his greatest protection, which not even the king shall ever be able to subdue and
take.</p>
<p>3. The covetous man indeed all join in vexing. And why do I say men, when moths and
worms war against such a man? And why do I speak of moths? Length of time is enough
alone, even when no one troubles him, to do the greatest injury to such a man.</p>
<p>What then is the pleasure of wealth? For I see its discomforts, but do thou tell me the
pleasure of it. And what are its discomforts? sayest thou: anxieties, plots, enmities, hatred,
fear; to be ever thirsting and in pain.</p>
<p>For if any one were to embrace a damsel he loves, but were not able to satisfy his desire,
he undergoes the utmost torment. Even so also doth the rich man. For he hath plenty, and
is with her, but cannot satisfy all his desire; but the same result takes place as some wise man
mentions; “The lust of eunuch to deflower a virgin;” and, “Like an eunuch embracing a
virgin and groaning;”3004so are all the rich.</p>
<p>Why should one speak of the other things? how such a one is displeasing to all, to his
servants, his laborers, his neighbors, to them that handle public affairs, to them that are injured,
to them that are not injured, to his wife most of all, and to his children more than to
any. For not as men does he bring them up, but more miserably than menials and purchased
slaves.</p>
<p>And countless occasions for anger, and vexation, and insult, and ridicule against himself,
doth he bring about, being set forth as a common laughing stock to all. So the discomforts
are these, and perhaps more than these; before one could never go through them all in discourse,
but experience will be able to set them before us.</p>
<p>But tell me the pleasure from hence. “I appear to be rich,” he saith, “and am reputed to
be rich.” And what kind of pleas ure to be so reputed? It is a very great name for envy. I say
a name, for wealth is a name only void of reality.</p>
<p>“Yet he that is rich,” saith he, “indulges and delights himself with this notion.” He delights
himself in those things about which he ought to grieve. “To grieve? wherefore?” asks he.
Because this renders him useless for all purposes, and cowardly and unmanly both with regard
to banishment and to death, for he holds this double, longing more for money than for light.
Such a one not even Heaven delights, because it beareth not gold; nor the sun, forasmuch
as it puts not forth golden beams.</p>
<p>But there are some, saith he, who do enjoy what they possess, living in luxury, in gluttony,
in drunkenness, spending sumptuously. You are telling me of persons worse than the first.
For the last above all are the men, who have no enjoyment. For the first at least abstains
<note type="footnote">3004 Ecclus. xx. 4, xxx. 20.</note>

<pb n="867"/>
from other evils, being bound to one love; but the others are worse than these, besides what
we have said, bringing in upon themselves a crowd of cruel masters, and doing service every
day to the belly, to lust, to drunkenness, to other kinds of intemperance, as to so many cruel
tyrants, keeping harlots, preparing expensive feasts, purchasing parasites, flatterers, turning
aside after unnatural lusts, involving their body and their soul in a thousand diseases
springing therefrom.</p>
<p>For neither is it on what they want they spend their goods, but on ruining the body, and
on ruining also the soul therewith; and they do the same, as if any one, when adorning his
person, were to think he was spending his money on his own wants.</p>
<p>So that he alone enjoys pleasure and is master of his goods, who uses his wealth for a
proper object; but these are slaves and captives, for they aggravate both the passions of the
body and the diseases of the soul. What manner of enjoyment is this, where is siege and
war, and a storm worse than all the raging of the sea? For if wealth find men fools, it renders
them more foolish; if wanton, more wanton.</p>
<p>And what is the use of understanding, thou wilt say, to the poor man? As might be expected
thou art ignorant; for neither doth the blind man know what is the advantage of
light. Listen to Solomon, saying, “As far as light excelleth darkness, so doth wisdom excel
folly.”3005</p>
<p>But how shall we instruct him that is in darkness? For the love of money is darkness,
permitting nothing that is to appear as it is, but otherwise. For much as one in darkness,
though he should see a golden vessel, though a precious stone, though purple garments,
supposes them to be nothing, for he sees not their beauty; so also he that is in covetousness,
knows not as he ought the beauty of those things that are worthy of our care. Disperse then
I pray thee the mist that arises from this passion, and then wilt thou see the nature of things.</p>
<p>But nowhere do these things so plainly appear as in poverty, nowhere are those things
so disproved which seem to be, and are not, as in self-denial.</p>
<p>4. But oh! foolish men; who do even curse the poor, and say that both houses and living
are disgraced by poverty, confounding all things. For what is a disgrace to a house? I pray
thee. It hath no couch of ivory, nor silver vessels, but all of earthenware and wood. Nay, this
is the greatest glory and distinction to a house. For to be indifferent about worldly things,
often occasions all a man’s leisure to be spent in the care of his soul.</p>
<p>When therefore thou seest great care about outward things, then be ashamed at the
great unseemliness. For the houses of them that are rich most of all want seemliness. For
when thou seest tables covered with hangings, and couches inlaid with silver, much as in
the theatre, much as in the display of the stage, what can be equal to this unseemliness? For
what kind of house is most like the stage, and the things on the stage? The rich man’s or the
<note type="footnote">3005 Eccles. ii. 13.</note>

<pb n="868"/>
poor man’s? Is it not quite plain that it is the rich man’s? This therefore is full of unseemliness.
What kind of house is most like Paul’s, or Abraham’s? It is quite evident that it is the poor
man’s. This therefore is most adorned, and to be approved. And that thou mayest learn that
this is, above all, a house’s adorning, enter into the house of Zacchæus, and learn, when
Christ was on the point of entering therein, how Zacchæus adorned it. For he did not run
to his neighbors begging curtains, and seats, and chairs made of ivory, neither did he bring
forth from his closets Laconian hangings; but he adorned it with an adorning suitable to
Christ. What was this? “The half of my goods I will give,” he saith, “to the poor; and
whomsoever I have robbed, I will restore fourfold.”3006 On this wise let us too adorn our
houses, that Christ may enter in unto us also. These are the fair curtains, these are wrought
in Heaven, they are woven there. Where these are, there is also the King of Heaven. But if
thou adorn it in another way, thou art inviting the devil and his company.</p>
<p>He came also into the house of the publican Matthew. What then did this man also do?
He first adorned himself by his readiness, and by his leaving all, and following Christ.</p>
<p>So also Cornelius adorned his house with prayers and alms; wherefore even unto this
day it shines above the very palace. For the vile state of a house is not in vessels lying in
disorder, nor in an untidy bed, nor in walls covered with smoke, but in the wickedness of
them that dwell therein. And Christ showeth it, for into such a house, if the inhabitant be
virtuous, He is not ashamed to enter; but into that other, though it have a golden roof, He
will never enter. So that while this one is more gorgeous than the palace, receiving the Lord
of all, that with its golden roof and columns is like filthy drains and sewers, for it contains
the vessels of the devil.</p>
<p>But these things we have spoken not of those who are rich for a useful purpose, but of
the grasping, and the covetous. For neither is there amongst these, diligence nor care about
the things needful, but about pampering the belly, and drunkenness, and other like unseemliness;
but with the others about self-restraint. Therefore nowhere did Christ enter into a
gorgeous house, but into that of the publican and chief publican, and fisherman, leaving
the kings’ palaces, and them that are clothed with soft raiment.</p>
<p>If then thou also desirest to invite Him, deck thy house with alms, with prayers, with
supplications, with vigils. These are the decorations of Christ the King, but those of mammon,
the enemy of Christ. Let no one be ashamed then of a humble house, if it hath this furniture;
let no rich man pride himself on having a costly house, but let him rather hide his face, and
seek after this other, forsaking that, that both here he may receive Christ, and there enjoy
the eternal tabernacles, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory and might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXVI. 51-54.</p>
<p>“And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched forth his hand, and drew his sword,
and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.”</p>
<p>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword unto his place, for all they that take the
sword, shall perish by the sword. Thinkest3007thou that I cannot pray to the Father, and
He shall presently3008give me more than twelve legions of angels? How then should the
Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?”3009</p>
<p>Who was this “one,” who cut off the ear? John saith that it was Peter.3010 For the act
was of his fervor.</p>
<p>But this other point is worth inquiry, wherefore they were bearing swords? For that they
bore them is evident not hence only, but from their saying when asked, “here are two.” But
wherefore did Christ even permit them to have swords? For Luke affirms this too, that He
said unto them, “When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?”
And when they said, “Nothing,” He said unto them, “But now, he that hath a purse, let him
take it, and a scrip, and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.” And
when they said, “Here are two swords,” He said unto them, “It is enough.”3011</p>
<p>Wherefore then did He suffer them to have them? To assure them that He was to be
betrayed. Therefore He saith unto them, “Let him buy a sword,” not that they should arm
themselves, far from it; but by this, indicating His being betrayed.</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He mention a scrip also? He was teaching them henceforth to be
sober, and wakeful, and to use much diligence on their own part. For at the beginning He
cherished them (as being inexperienced) with much putting forth of His power but afterwards
bringing them forth as young birds out of the nest, He commands them to use their own
wings. Then, that they might not suppose that it was for weakness He is letting them alone,
in commanding them also to work their part, He reminds them of the former things, saying,
“When I sent you without purse, lacked ye anything?” that by both they might learn His
power, both wherein He protected them, and wherein He now leaveth them to themselves
by degrees.</p>

<p>But whence were the swords there? They were come forth from the supper, and from

hearing that certain were coming forth against Him, took them for defense, as meaning to
fight in behalf of their Master, which was of their thought only. Wherefore also Peter is rebuked
for using it, and with a severe threat. For he was resisting the servant who came,
warmly indeed, yet not defending himself, but doing this in behalf of his Master.</p>
<p>Christ however suffered not any harm to ensue. For He healed him, and showed forth
a great miracle, enough to indicate at once both His forbearance and His power, and the
affection and meekness of His disciple. For then he acted from affection, now with dutifulness.
For when he heard, “Put up thy sword into its sheath,”3012he obeyed straightway, and afterwards
nowhere doeth this.</p>
<p>But another saith, that they moreover asked, “Shall we smite?”3013but that He forbad
it, and healed the man, and rebuked His disciple, and threatened, that He might move him
to obedience. “For all they that take the sword,” He said, “shall die with the sword.”</p>
<p>And he adds a reason, saying, “Think ye that I cannot pray to my Father, and He shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”
3014 By these words He quenched their anger, indicating that to the Scriptures also,
this seemed good. Wherefore there too He prayed, that they might take meekly what befell
Him, when they had learnt that this again is done according to God’s will.</p>
<p>And by these two things, He comforted them, both by the punishment of them that are
plotting against Him, “For all they,” He saith, “that take the sword shall perish with the
sword;” and by His not undergoing these things against His will, “For I can pray,” He saith,
“to my Father.”</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not say, “Think ye that I cannot destroy them all?” Because He
was more likely to be believed in saying what He did say; for not yet had they the right belief
concerning Him. And a little while before He had said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful
even unto death,” and, “Father, let the cup pass from me;”3015and He had appeared in an
agony and sweating, and strengthened by an angel.</p>
<p>Since then He had shown forth many tokens of human nature, He did not seem likely
to speak so as to be believed, if He had said, “Think ye that I cannot destroy them.” Therefore
He saith, “What, think ye that I cannot pray to my Father?” And again He speaks it humbly,
in saying, “He will presently give me twelve legions of angels.” For if one angel slew one
hundred and eighty-five armed thousands,3016what need of twelve legions against a thousand

men? But He frames His language with a view to their terror and weakness, for indeed they
were dead with fear. Wherefore also He brings against them the Scriptures, saying, “How
then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled?” alarming them by this also. For if this be approved
by the Scriptures, do ye oppose and fight against them?</p>
<p>2. And to His disciples He saith these things; but to the others, “Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily teaching in the temple, and
ye laid no hold on me.”3017</p>
<p>See how many things He doeth that might awaken them. He cast them to the ground,
He healed the servant’s ear, He threatened them with being slain; “For they shall perish with
the sword,” He saith, “who take the sword.” By the healing of the ear, He gave assurance of
these things also; from every quarter, both from the things present, and from the things to
come, manifesting His power, and showing that it was not a work of their strength to seize
Him. Wherefore He also adds, “I was daily with you, and sat teaching, and ye laid no hold
on me;” by this also making it manifest, that the seizure was of His permission. He passed
over the miracles, and mentions the teaching, that He might not seem to boast.</p>
<p>When I taught, ye laid no hold on me; when I held my peace, did ye come against me?
I was in the temple, and no one seized me, and now do ye come upon me late and at midnight
with swords and staves? What need was there of these weapons against Him, who was with
you always? by these things teaching them, that unless He had voluntarily yielded, not even
then would they have succeeded. For neither could they (who were not able to hold Him
when in their hands, and who, when they had got Him in the midst of them, had not prevailed)
even then have succeeded, unless He had been willing.</p>
<p>After this, He solves also the difficulty why He willed it then. For, “this was done,” He
saith, “that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”3018 See how even up to the
last hour, and in the very act of being betrayed, He did all things for their amendment,
healing, prophesying, threatening. “For,” He saith, “they shall perish by the sword.” To show
that He is suffering voluntarily, He saith, “I was daily with you teaching;” to manifest His
accordance with the Father, He adds, “That the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>But wherefore did they not lay hold on Him in the temple? Because they would not have
dared in the temple, on account of the people. Wherefore also He went forth without, both
by the place and by the time giving them security, and even to the last hour taking away
their excuse. For He who, in order that He might obey the prophets, gave up even Himself,
how did He teach things contrary to them?</p>
<p>“Then all His disciples,” it is said, “forsook Him, and fled.” For when He was seized,
they remained; but when He had said these things to the multitudes, they fled. For thenceforth
<note type="footnote">3017 Matt. xxvi. 55. [R.V., “robber”…“ to seize me”…“ye took me not.”]</note>

<pb n="872"/>
they saw that escape was no longer possible, when He was giving Himself up to them voluntarily,
and saying, that this was done according to the Scriptures.</p>
<p>And when these were fled, “they lead Him away to Caiaphas; but Peter followed, and
entered in to see what the end should be.”3019</p>
<p>Great was the fervor of the disciple; neither did he fly when he saw them flying, but
stood his ground, and went in with Him. And if John did so too, yet he was “known to the
high priest.”3020</p>
<p>And why did they lead Him away there where they were all assembled? That they might
do all things with consent of the chief priests. For he was then high priest, and all were
waiting for Christ there, to such a degree did they spend the whole night, and give up their
sleep for this object. For neither did they then eat the passover, but watched for this other
purpose. For John, when he had said that “it was early,” added, “they entered into the
judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover.”3021</p>
<p>What must we say then? That they ate it on another day, and broke the law, on account
of their eager desire about this murder. For Christ would not have transgressed as to the
time of the passover, but they who were daring all things, and trampling under foot a
thousand laws. For since they were exceedingly boiling with rage, and having often attempted
to seize Him, had not been able; having then taken Him unexpectedly, they chose even to
pass by the passover, for the sake of satiating their murderous lust.</p>
<p>Wherefore also they were all assembled together, and it was a council of pestilent
men,3022and they ask some questions, wishing to invest this plot with the appearance of a
court of justice. For “neither did their testimonies agree together;”3023so feigned was the
court of justice, and all things full of confusion and disorder.</p>
<p>“But false witnesses came, and said, This fellow said, I will destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it.”3024 And indeed He had said, “In three days,” but He said not, “I
will destroy,” but, “Destroy,” and not about that temple but about His own body.3025</p>
<p>What then doth the high priest? Willing to press Him to a defense, that by that he might
take Him, he saith, “Hearest Thou not what these witness against Thee? But He held His
peace.”3026</p>

<p>For the attempts at defense were unprofitable, no man hearing. For this was a show
only of a court of justice, but in truth an onset of robbers, assailing Him without cause, as
in a cave, or on a road.</p>
<p>Wherefore “He held His peace,” but the other continued, saying, “I adjure Thee by the
living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of the living God. But
He said, Thou hast said. Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man
sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds. Then the high priest rent his
clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy.”3027 And this he did to add force to the accusation,
and to aggravate what He said, by the act. For since what had been said moved the
hearers to fear, what they did about Stephen,3028stopping their ears, this high priest doth
here also.</p>
<p>3. And yet what kind of blasphemy was this? For indeed before He had said, when they
were gathered together, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand,”3029and
interpreted the saying, and they dared say nothing, but held their peace, and from that time
forth gainsaid Him no more. Why then did they now call the saying a blasphemy? And
wherefore also did Christ thus answer them? To take away all their excuse, because unto
the last day He taught that He was Christ, and that He sitteth at the right hand of the Father,
and that He will come again to judge the world, which was the language of one manifesting
His full accordance with the Father.</p>
<p>Having rent therefore his clothes, he saith, “What think ye?”3030 He gives not the sentence
from himself, but invites it from them, as in a case of confessed sins, and manifest blasphemy.
For, inasmuch as they knew that if the thing came to be inquired into, and carefully decided,
it would free Him from all blame, they condemn Him amongst themselves, and anticipate
the hearers by saying, “Ye have heard the blasphemy;” all but necessitating and forcing them
to deliver the sentence. What then say they? “He is guilty of death;” that having taken Him
as condemned, they should thus work upon Pilate thereupon to pass sentence. In which
matter those others also being accomplices say, “He is guilty of death;” themselves accusing,
themselves judging, themselves passing sentence, themselves being everything then.</p>
<p>But wherefore did they not bring forward the Sabbaths? Because He had often stopped
their mouths; and moreover they wanted to take Him, and condemn Him by the things
then said. And the high priest anticipated them, and gave the sentence as from them, and

drew them all on by rending his vestments, and having led Him away as now condemned
unto Pilate, thus did all.</p>
<p>Before Pilate at any rate they said nothing of this kind, but what? “If3031this Man were
not a malefactor, we would not have delivered Him up unto thee;” attempting to put Him
to death by political accusations. And wherefore did they not slay Him secretly? They were
desirous also to bring up an evil report against His fame. For since many had now heard
Him, and were admiring Him, and amazed at Him, therefore they endeavored that He
should be put to death publicly, and in the presence of all.</p>
<p>But Christ hindered it not, but made full use of their wickedness for the establishment
of the truth, so that His death should be manifest. And the result was the contrary to what
they wished. For they wished to make a show of it, as in this way disgracing Him, but He
even by these very things shone forth the more. And much as they said, “Let us put Him to
death, lest the Romans come and take away our place and nation;”3032and after they had
put Him to death, this came to pass; so also here; their object was to crucify Him publicly,
that they might injure His fame, and the contrary result took place.</p>
<p>For in proof that indeed they had power to have put Him to death, even amongst
themselves, hear what Pilate saith: “Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law.”3033
But they would not, that He might seem to have been put to death as a transgressor, as an
usurper, as a mover of sedition. Therefore also they crucified thieves with Him; therefore
also they said, “Write not that this man is King of the Jews; but that He said it.”3034</p>
<p>But all these things are done for the truth, so that they might not have so much as any
shadow of a defense that is surely shameless. And at the sepulchre too, in the like manner,
the seals and the watches made the truth to be the more conspicuous; and the mockings,
and the jeerings, and the revilings, wrought again this self-same effect.</p>
<p>For such is the nature of error: it is destroyed by those things whereby it plots; thus at
least it fell out even here, for they that seemed to have conquered, these most of all were put
to shame, and defeated, and ruined; but He that seemed to be defeated, this man above all
hath both shone forth, and conquered mightily.</p>
<p>Let us not then everywhere seek victory, nor everywhere shun defeat. There is an occasion
when victory brings hurt, but defeat profit. For, for instance, in the case of them that are
angry; he that hath been very outrageous seems to have prevailed; but this man above all is
the one subdued and hurt by the most grievous passion; but he that hath endured nobly,
this man hath got the better and conquered. And while the one hath not had strength to

<pb n="875"/>
overcome so much as his own disease; the other hath removed another man’s; this hath
been subdued by his own, that hath got the better even of another’s passion; and so far from
being burnt up, he quenched the flame of another when raised to a height. But if he had
minded to gain what seems to be victory, both he himself would have been overcome; and
having inflamed the other, he would have occasioned him to have suffered this more
grievously; and, like women, both the one and the other would have been disgracefully and
miserably overthrown by their anger. But now he that hath exercised self-control is both
freed from this disgrace, and hath erected a glorious trophy over anger both in himself and
in his neighbor, through his honorable defeat.</p>
<p>4. Let us not then everywhere seek victory. For he that hath overreached hath conquered
the person wronged, but with an evil victory, and one that brings destruction to him that
has won it; but he that is wronged, and seems to have been conquered, if he have borne it
with self-command, this above all is the one that hath the crown. For often to be defeated
is better, and this is the best mode of victory. For whether one overreaches, or smites, or
envies, he that is defeated, and enters not into the conflict, this is he who hath the victory.</p>
<p>And why do I speak of overreaching and envy? For he also that is dragged to martyrdom,
thus conquers by being bound, and beaten, and maimed, and slain. And what is in wars
defeat, namely, for the combatant to fall; this with us is victory. For nowhere do we overcome
by doing wrongfully, but everywhere by suffering wrongfully. Thus also doth the victory
become more glorious, when we sufferers get the better of the doers. Hereby it is shown
that the victory is of God. For indeed it hath an opposite nature to outward conquest, which
fact is again above all an infallible sign of strength. Thus also the rocks in the sea, by being
struck, break the waves; thus also all the saints were proclaimed, and crowned, and set up
their glorious trophies, winning this tranquil victory. “For stir not thyself,” He saith, “neither
weary thyself. God hath given thee this might, to conquer not by conflict, but by endurance
alone. Do not oppose thyself also as he does, and thou hast conquered; conflict not, and
thou hast gained the crown.3035 Why dost thou disgrace thyself? Allow him not to say that
by conflicting thou hast got the better, but suffer him to be amazed and to marvel at thy
invincible power; and to say to all, that even without entering into conflict thou hast
conquered.”</p>
<p>Thus also the blessed Joseph obtained a good report, everywhere by suffering wrong
getting the better of them who were doing it. For his brethren and the Egyptian woman
were amongst those that were plotting against him, but over all did this man prevail. For
tell me not of the prison, wherein this man dwelt, nor of the kings’ courts where she abode,
but show me who it is that is conquered, who it is that is defeated, who that is in despondency,
<note type="footnote">3035 [The following clause is omitted in the translation: “Much better and stronger art thou than thine antagonist.”—
R.]</note>

<pb n="876"/>
who that is in pleasure. For she, so far from being able to prevail over the righteous man,
could not master so much as her own passion; but this man prevailed both over her and
over that grievous disease. But if thou wilt, hear her very words, and thou shalt see the
trophy. “Thou broughtest in unto us here an Hebrew servant to mock us.”3036 It was not
this man that mocked thee, O wretched and unhappy woman, but the devil that told thee
that thou couldest break down the adamant. This thy husband brought not in unto thee an
Hebrew servant to plot against thee, but the wicked spirit brought in that unclean lasciviousness;
he it was that mocked thee.</p>
<p>What then did Joseph? He held his peace, and thus is condemned, even as Christ is also.</p>
<p>For all those things are types of these. And he indeed was in bonds, and she in royal
courts. Yet what is this? For he was more glorious than any crowned victor, even while
continuing in his bonds, but she was in a more wretched condition than any prisoner, while
abiding in royal chambers.</p>
<p>But not hence alone may one see the victory, and the defeat, but by the end itself. For
which accomplished his desired object? The prisoner, not the high born lady? For he strove
to keep his chastity, but she to destroy it. Which then accomplished what he desired? he
who suffered wrong, or she who did the wrong. It is quite plain, that it is he who suffered.
Surely then this is the one who hath conquered.</p>
<p>Knowing then these things, let us follow after this victory, which is obtained by suffering
wrong, let us flee from that which is got by doing wrong. For so shall we both live this
present life in all tranquility, and great quietness, and shall attain unto the good things to
come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXVI. 67, 68.</p>
<p>“Then did they spit in His face, and buffeted Him, and others smote Him with the palms of
their hands,3037saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote3038thee?”3039</p>
<p>Wherefore did they these things, when they were to put Him to death? What need of
this mockery? That thou mightest learn their intemperate spirit by all things, and that having
taken Him like a prey, they thus showed forth their intoxication, and gave full swing to their
madness; making this a festival, and assaulting Him with pleasure, and showing forth their
murderous disposition.</p>
<p>But admire, I pray thee, the self command of the disciples, with what exactness they
relate these things. Hereby is clearly shown their disposition to love the truth, because they
relate with all truthfulness the things that seem to be opprobrious, disguising nothing, nor
being ashamed thereof, but rather accounting it very great glory, as indeed it was, that the
Lord of the universe should endure to suffer such things for us. This shows both His unutterable
tenderness, and the inexcusable wickedness of those men, who had the heart to do
such things to Him that was so mild and meek, and was charming them with such words,
as were enough to change a lion into a lamb. For neither did He fail in any things of gentleness,
nor they of insolence and cruelty, in what they did, in what they said. All which things
the prophet Isaiah foretold, thus proclaiming beforehand, and by one word intimating all
this insolence. For “like as many were astonished at thee,” he saith, “so shall thy form be
held inglorious of men, and thy glory of the sons of men.”3040</p>
<p>For what could be equal to this insolence? On that face which the sea, when it saw it,
had reverenced, from which the sun, when it beheld it on the cross, turned away his rays,
they did spit, and struck it with the palms of their hands, and some upon the head; giving
full swing in every way to their own madness. For indeed they inflicted the blows that are
most insulting of all, buffeting, smiting with the palms of their hands, and to these blows
adding the insult of spitting at Him. And words again teeming with much derision did they
speak, saying, “prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?” because the
multitude called Him a prophet.</p>

<p>But another3041saith, that they covered His face with His own garment, and did these
things, as though they had got in the midst of them some vile and worthless fellow. And not
freemen only, but slaves3042also were intemperate with this intemperance towards Him at
that time.</p>
<p>These things let us read continually, these things let us hear aright, these things let us
write in our minds, for these are our honors. In these things do I take a pride, not only in
the thousands of dead which He raised, but also in the sufferings which He endured. These
things Paul puts forward in every way, the cross, the death, the sufferings, the revilings, the
insults, the scoffs. And now he saith, “let us go forth unto Him bearing His reproach;”3043and
now, “who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame.”3044</p>
<p>“Now Peter sat in the court without;3045and a damsel came unto him, saying, thou also
wast with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before them all,3046saying, I know not what thou
sayest. And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith, this
man also was there3047with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an oath. And after
a while came unto him they that stood by, and said unto Peter, surely thou also art one of
them, for thy speech bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the
man. And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, which
said, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.”3048</p>
<p>Oh strange and wonderful acts! When indeed he saw his master seized only, he was so
fervent as both to draw his sword, and to cut off the man’s ear; but when it was natural for
him to be more indignant, and to be inflamed and to burn, hearing such revilings, then he
becomes a denier. For who would not have been inflamed to madness by the things that
were then done? yet the disciple, overcome by fears, so far from showing indignation, even
denies, and endures not the threat of a miserable and mean girl, and not once only, but a
second and third time doth he deny Him; and in a short period, and not so much as before
judges, for it was without for “when he had gone out into the porch,” they asked him, and
he did not even readily come to a sense of his fall. And this Luke saith,3049namely, that

Christ looked on him showing that he not only denied Him, but was not even brought to
remembrance from within, and this though the cock had crowed; but he needed a further
remembrance from his master, and His look was to him instead of a voice; so exceedingly
was he full of fear.</p>
<p>But Mark saith,3050that when he had once denied, then first the cock crew, but when
thrice, then for the second time; for he declares more particularly the weakness of the disciple,
and that he was utterly dead with fear; having learnt these things of his master3051himself,
for he was a follower of Peter. In which respect one would most marvel at him, that so far
from hiding his teacher’s faults, he declared it more distinctly than the rest, on this very
account, that he was his disciple.</p>
<p>2. How then is what is said true, when Matthew affirms that Christ said, “Verily I say
unto thee, that before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice;”3052and Mark declares after
the third denial, that “The cock crew the second time?”3053 Nay, most certainly is it both
true and in harmony. For because at each crowing the cock is wont to crow both a third and
a fourth time, Mark, to show that not even the sound checked him, and brought him to recollection
saith this. So that both things are true. For before the cock had finished the one
crowing, he had denied a third time. And not even when reminded of his sin by Christ did
he dare to weep openly, lest he should be betrayed by his tears, but “he went out, and wept
bitterly.”</p>
<p>“And when it was day, they led away Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate.”3054 For because
they were desirous to put Him to death, but were not able themselves because of the feast,
they lead Him to the governor.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, how the act was forced on, so as to take place at the feast. For so
was it typified from the first.</p>
<p>“Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that He was condemned, repented,
and brought again the thirty pieces of silver.”3055</p>

he delivered Him up, he himself confessed); and against them, for that having the power to
reverse it, they repented not.</p>
<p>But mark, when it is that he feels remorse. When his sin was completed, and had received
an accomplishment. For the devil is like this; he suffers not those that are not watchful to
see the evil before this, lest he whom he has taken, should repent. At least, when Jesus was
saying so many things, he was not influenced, but when his offense was completed, then
repentance came upon him; and not then profitably. For to condemn it, and to throw down
the pieces of silver, and not to regard the Jewish people, were all acceptable things; but to
hang himself, this again was unpardonable, and a work of an evil spirit. For the devil led
him out of his repentance too soon, so that he should reap no fruit from thence; and carries
him off, by a most disgraceful death, and one manifest to all, having persuaded him to destroy
himself.</p>
<p>But mark, I pray thee, the truth shining forth on every side, even by what the adversaries
both do and suffer. For indeed even the very end of the traitor stops the mouths of them
that had condemned Him, and suffers them not to have so much as any shadow of an excuse,
that is surely shameless. For what could they have to say, when the traitor is shown to pass
such a sentence on himself.</p>
<p>But let us see also the words, what is said; “He brought again the thirty pieces of silver
to the chief priests,3056and saith, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And
they said, what is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the
temple,3057and departed, and went and hanged himself.”3058</p>
<p>For neither could he bear his conscience scourging him. But mark, I pray thee, the Jews
too suffering the same things. For these men also, when they ought to have been amended
by what they suffered, do not stop, until they have completed their sin. For his sin had been
completed, for it was a betrayal; but theirs not yet. But when they too had accomplished
theirs, and had nailed Him to the cross then they also are troubled; at one time saying, “Write
not, this is the king of the Jews”3059(and yet why are ye afraid? why are ye troubled at a dead
body that is nailed upon the cross?); at another time they guard over Him, saying, “Lest His
disciples steal Him away, and say that He is risen again; so the last error shall be worse than
the first.”3060 And yet if they do it, the thing is refuted, if it be not true. But how should they
say so, which did not dare so much as to stand their ground, when He was seized; and the
chief3061of them even thrice denied Him, not bearing a damsel’s threat. But, as I said, the

chief priests were now troubled; for that they knew the act was a transgression of the law is
manifest, from their saying, “See thou to that.”</p>
<p>Hear, ye covetous, consider what befell him; how he at the same time lost the money,
and committed the sin, and destroyed his own soul. Such is the tyranny of covetousness.
He enjoyed not the money, neither the present life, nor that to come, but lost all at once,
and having got a bad character even with those very men, so hanged himself.</p>
<p>But, as I said, after the act, then some see clearly. See at any rate these men too for a
time not willing to have a clear perception of the fact, but saying, “See thou to that:” which
thing of itself is a most heavy charge against them. For this is the language of men bearing
witness to their daring and their transgression, but intoxicated by their passion, and not
willing to forbear their satanical attempts, but senselessly wrapping themselves up in a veil
of feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>For if indeed these things had been said after the crucifixion, and His being slain, of a
truth even then the saying would have had no reasonable meaning, nevertheless it would
not have condemned them so much; but now having Him yet in your own hands, and having
power to release Him, how could ye be able to say these things? For this defense would be
a most heavy accusation against you. How? and in what way? Because while throwing the
whole blame upon the traitor (for they say, “See thou to that”), being able to have set
themselves free from this murder of Christ, they left the traitor, and even pressed the crime
further, adding the cross to the betrayal. For what hindered them, when they said to him,
“See thou to that,” themselves to forbear the criminal act? But now they even do the contrary,
adding to it the murder and in every thing, both by what they do, and by what they say,
entangling themselves in inevitable ills. For indeed after these things, when Pilate left it to
them, they choose the robber to be released rather than Jesus; but Him that had done no
wrong, but had even conferred on them so many benefits, they slew.</p>
<p>3. What then did that man? When he saw that he was laboring to no profit, and that
they would not consent to receive the pieces of silver, “he cast them down in the temple,
and went and hanged himself.3062 And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said,
it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they
took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that
field was called, the field of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
by Jeremy the prophet, saying, and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him
that was valued, and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.”3063</p>

7; and the omission of a clause in verse 9, as indicated above.—R.]</note>

<pb n="882"/>
<p>Seest thou them again self-condemned by their conscience? For because they knew that
they had been buying the murder, they put them not into the treasury, but bought a field
to bury strangers in. And this also became a witness against them, and a proof of their
treason. For the name of the place more clearly than a trumpet proclaimed their bloodguiltiness.
Neither did they it at random, but having taking counsel, and in every case in
like manner, so that no one should be clear of the deed, but all guilty. But these things the
prophecy foretold from of old. Seest thou not the apostles only, but the prophets also declaring
exactly those things which were matters of reproach, and every way proclaiming the
passion, and indicating it beforehand?</p>
<p>This was the case with the Jews without their being conscious of it. For if they had cast
it into the treasury, the thing would not have been so clearly discovered; but now having
bought a piece of ground, they made it all manifest even to subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Hear ye as many as think to do good works out of murders, and take a reward for the
lives of men. These almsgiving are Judaical, or rather they are Satanical. For there are, there
are now also they, that take by violence countless things belonging to others, and think that
an excuse is made for all if they cast in some ten or a hundred gold pieces.</p>
<p>Touching whom also the prophet saith, “Ye covered my altar with tears.”3064 Christ is
not willing to be fed by covetousness, He accepts not this food. Why dost thou insult thy
Lord, offering Him unclean things? It is better to leave men to pine with hunger, than to
feed them from these sources. That was the conduct of a cruel man, this of one both cruel
and insolent. It is better to give nothing, than to give the things of one set of persons to
others. For tell me, if you saw any two persons, one naked, one having a garment, and then
having stripped the one that had the garment, thou wert to clothe the naked, wouldest thou
not have committed an injustice? It is surely plain to every one. But if when thou hast given
all that thou hast taken to another, thou hast committed an injustice, and not shown mercy;
when thou givest not even a small portion of what thou robbest, and callest the deed alms,
what manner of punishment wilt thou not undergo? For if men offering lame brutes were
blamed, what favor wilt thou obtain doing things more grievous? For if the chief, making
restitution to the owner himself, still doeth an injustice, and so doeth an injustice, as by
adding fourfold scarcely to do away the charge against himself, and this under the old covenant;
3065he that is not stealing, but taking by violence, and not even giving to him that is
robbed, but instead of him to another; nor yet giving fourfold, but not so much as the half;
and moreover not living under the old dispensation, but under the new; consider how much
fire he is heaping together upon his own head. And if he do not as yet suffer his punishment,
for this self-same thing I say bewail him, for he is treasuring up against himself a greater

wrath, unless he repent. For what? “Think ye,” saith He, “that they alone were sinners upon
whom the tower fell down? Nay, I say unto you, but except ye repent, ye also shall suffer
the same things.”3066</p>
<p>Let us repent then, and give alms pure from covetousness, and in great abundance.
Consider that the Jews used to feed eight thousand Levites, and together with the Levites,
widows also and orphans, and they bore many other public charges, and together with these
things also served as soldiers; but now there are fields, and houses, and hirings of lodgings,
and carriages, and muleteers, and mules, and a great array of this kind in the church on account
of you, and your hardness of heart. For this store of the church ought to be with you,
and your readiness of mind ought to be a revenue to her; but now two wrong things come
to pass, both you continue unfruitful, and God’s priests do not practise their proper duties.</p>
<p>Was it not possible for the houses and the lands to have remained in the time of the
apostles? Wherefore then did they sell them and give away? Because this was a better thing.</p>
<p>4. But now a fear seized our fathers (when you were so mad after worldly things, and
because of your gatherings, and not dispersing abroad), lest the companies of the widows
and orphans, and of the virgins, should perish of famine; therefore were they constrained
to provide these things. For it was not their wish to thrust themselves unto what was so
unbecoming; but their desire was that your good will should have been a supply for them,
and that they should gather their fruits from thence, and that they themselves should give
heed to prayers only.</p>
<p>But now ye have constrained them to imitate the houses of them that manage public
affairs; whereby all things are turned upside down. For when both you and we are entangled
in the same things, who is there to propitiate God? Therefore it is not possible for us to open
our mouths, when the state of the church is no better than that of worldly men. Have ye not
heard that the apostles would not consent so much as to distribute the money that was collected
without any trouble? But now our bishops have gone beyond agents, and stewards,
and hucksters in their care about these things; and when they ought to be careful and
thoughtful about your souls, they are vexing themselves every day about these things, for
which the innkeepers, and tax-gatherers, and accountants, and stewards are careful.</p>
<p>These things I do not mention for nought in the way of complaint, but in order that
there may be some amendment and change, in order that we may be pitied for serving a
grievous servitude, in order that you may become a revenue and store for the church.</p>
<p>But if ye are not willing, behold the poor before your eyes; as many as it is possible for
us to suffice, we will not cease to feed; but those, whom it is not possible, we will leave to
you, that ye may not hear those words on the awful day, which shall be spoken to the unmerciful
and cruel. “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me not.”3067</p>

<p>For together with you this inhumanity makes us laughing-stocks, because leaving our
prayers, and our teaching, and the other parts of holiness, we are fighting all our time, some
with wine merchants, some with corn-factors, others with them that retail other provisions.</p>
<p>Hence come battles, and strifes, and daily revilings, and reproaches, and jeers, and on
each of the priests names are imposed more suitable for houses of secular men; when it
would have been fit to take other names in the place of these, and to be named from those
things, from which also the apostles ordained, from the feeding of the hungry, from the
protection of the injured, from the care of strangers, from succoring them that are despitefully
used, from providing for the orphans, from taking part with the widows, from presiding
over the virgins; and these offices should be distributed amongst us instead of the care of
the lands and houses.</p>
<p>These are the stores of the church, these the treasures that become her, and that afford
in great degree both ease to us and profit to you; or rather to you ease with the profit. For I
suppose that by the grace of God they that assemble themselves here amount to the number
of one hundred thousand;3068and if each bestowed one loaf to some one of the poor, all
would be in plenty; but if one farthing only, no one would be poor; and we should not undergo
so many revilings and jeers, in consequence of our care about the money. For indeed
the saying, “Sell thy goods, and give to the poor, and come and follow me,”3069might be
seasonably addressed to the prelates of the church with respect to the property of the church.
For in any other way it is not possible to follow Him as we ought, not being freed from all
grosser and more worldly care.</p>
<p>But now the priests of God attend at the vintage and harvest, and at the sale and purchase
of the produce; and whereas they that served the shadow had an entire immunity from such
matters, although entrusted with a more carnal service; we, who are invited to the very inmost
shrines of the heavens, and who enter into the true holy of holies, take upon ourselves the
cares of tradesmen and retail dealers.</p>
<p>Hence great neglect of the Scriptures, and remissness in prayers, and indifference about
all the other duties; for it is not possible to be split into the two things with due zeal. Where
I pray and beseech you that many fountains may spring up to us from all quarters, and that
your forwardness may be to us the threshing floor and the wine press.</p>
<p>For in this way both the poor will more easily be supported, and God will be glorified,
and ye will advance unto a greater degree of love to mankind, and will enjoy the good things
eternal; unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXVII. 11, 12.</p>
<p>“And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked Him, saying, Art thou the king
of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. And when He was accused of the chief
priests and elders, He answered nothing.”3070</p>
<p>Seest thou what He is first asked? which thing most of all they were continually bringing
forward in every way? For since they saw Pilate making no account of the matters of the
law, they direct their accusation to the state charges. So likewise did they in the case of the
apostles, ever bringing forward these things, and saying that they were going about proclaiming
king one Jesus,3071speaking as of a mere man, and investing them with a suspicion of
usurpation.</p>
<p>Whence it is manifest, that both the rending the garment and the amazement were a
pretense. But all things they got up, and plied, in order to bring Him to death.</p>
<p>This at any rate Pilate then asked. What then said Christ? “Thou sayest.” He confessed
that He was a king, but a heavenly king, which elsewhere also He spake more clearly,
replying to Pilate, “My kingdom is not of this world;”3072that neither they nor this man
should have an excuse for accusing Him of such things. And He gives a reason that cannot
be gainsaid, saying, “If I were of this world, my servants would fight, that I should not be
delivered.” For this purpose I say, in order to refute this suspicion, He both paid tribute,
3073and commanded others to pay it, and when they would make Him a king, He fled.3074</p>
<p>Wherefore then did he not bring forward these things, it may be said, at that time, when
accused of usurpation? Because having the proofs from His acts, of His power, His meekness,
His gentleness, beyond number, they were willfully blind, and dealt unfairly, and the tribunal
was corrupt. For these reasons then He replies to nothing, but holds His peace, yet answering
briefly (so as not to get the reputation of arrogance from continual silence) when the high
priest adjured Him, when the governor asked, but in reply to their accusations He no longer
saith anything; for He was not now likely to persuade them. Even as the prophet declaring
this self-same thing from of old, said, “In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.”3075</p>

<p>At these things the governor marvelled, and indeed it was worthy of admiration to see
Him showing such great forbearance, and holding His peace, Him that had countless things
to say. For neither did they accuse Him from knowing of any evil thing in Him, but from
jealousy and envy only. At least when they had set false witness, wherefore, having nothing
to say, did they still urge their point? and when they saw Judas was dead, and that Pilate had
washed his hands of it, why were they not pricked with remorse. For indeed He did many
things even at the very time, that they might recover themselves, but by none were they
amended.</p>
<p>What then saith Pilate? “Hearest thou not how many things these witness against
thee?”3076 He wished that He should defend Himself and be acquitted, wherefore also he
said these things; but since He answered nothing, he devises another thing again.</p>
<p>Of what nature was this? It was a custom for them to release one of the condemned,
and by this means he attempted to deliver Him. For if you are not willing to release Him as
innocent, yet as guilty pardon Him for the feast’s sake.</p>
<p>Seest thou order reversed? For the petition in behalf of the condemned it was customary
to be with the people, and the granting it with the rulers; but now the contrary hath come
to pass, and the ruler petitions the people; and not even so do they become gentle, but grow
more savage and bloodthirsty, driven to frenzy by the passion of envy. For neither had they
whereof they should accuse Him, and this though He was silent, but they were refuted even
then by reason of the abundance of His righteous deeds, and being silent He overcame them
that say ten thousand things, and are maddened.</p>
<p>“And when he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, have
thou nothing to do with this just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream
because of Him.”3077 See what a thing takes place again, sufficient to recall them all. For
together with the proof from the things done, the dream too was no small thing. And
wherefore doth he not see it himself? Either because she was more worthy, or because he,
if he had seen it, would not have been equally believed; or would not so much as have told
it. Therefore it was ordered that the wife should see it, so that it might be manifest to all.
And she doth not merely see it, but also suffers many things, that from his feeling towards
his wife, the man may be made more reluctant to the murder. And the time too contributed
not a little, for on the very night she saw it.</p>
<p>But it was not safe, it may be said, for him to let Him go, because they said He made
Himself a king. He ought then to have sought for proofs, and a conviction, and for all the
things that are infallible signs of an usurpation, as, for instance, whether He levied forces,

<pb n="887"/>
whether He collected money, whether He forged arms, whether He attempted any other
such thing. But he is led away at random, therefore neither doth Christ acquit him of the
blame, in saying, “He that betrayeth me unto thee hath greater sin.”3078 So that it was from
weakness that he yielded and scourged Him, and delivered Him up.</p>
<p>He then was unmanly and weak; but the chief priests wicked and criminal. For since he
had found out a device, namely, the law of the feast requiring him to release a condemned
person, what do they contrive in opposition to that? “They persuaded the multitude,” it is
said, “that they should ask Barabbas.”3079</p>
<p>2. See how much care he taketh for them to relieve them from blame, and how much
diligence they employed, so as not to leave to themselves so much as a shadow of an excuse.
For which was right? to let go the acknowledged criminal, or Him about whose guilt there
was a question? For, if in the case of acknowledged offenders it was fit there should be a
liberation, much more in those of whom there was a doubt. For surely this man did not
seem to them worse than acknowledged murderers. For on this account, it is not merely
said they had a robber; but one noted, that is, who was infamous in wickedness, who had
perpetrated countless murders. But nevertheless even him did they prefer to the Saviour of
the world, and neither did they reverence the season because it was holy, nor the laws of
humanity, nor any other thing of the kind, but envy had once for all blinded them. And
besides their own wickedness, they corrupt the people also, that for deceiving them too they
might suffer the most extreme punishment.</p>
<p>Since therefore they ask for the other, he saith, “What shall I do then with the
Christ,”3080in this way desiring to put them to the blush, by giving them the power to choose,
that at least out of shame they might ask for Him, and the whole should be of their bountifulness.
For though to say, He had not done wrong, made them more contentious, yet to
require that He should be saved out of humanity, carries with it persuasion and entreaty
that cannot be gainsaid.</p>
<p>But even then they said, “Crucify Him. But he said, why, what evil hath He done? but
they cried out exceedingly,3081let Him be crucified. But he, when he saw that he profited
nothing, washed his hands, saying, I am innocent.” Why then didst thou deliver Him up?
Why didst thou not rescue Him, as the centurion did Paul.3082 For that man too was aware
that he would please the Jews; and a sedition had taken place on his account, and a tumult,

nevertheless he stood firm against all. But not so this man, but he was extremely unmanly
and weak, and all were corrupt together. For neither did this man stand firm against the
multitude, nor the multitude against the Jews,3083and in every way their excuse was taken
away. For they “cried out exceedingly,” that is, cried out the more, “Let Him be crucified.”
For they desired not only to put Him to death, but also that it should be on a charge of
wickedness, and though the judge was contradicting them, they continued to cry out the
same thing.</p>
<p>Seest thou how many things Christ did in order to recover them? For like as He often
times checked Judas, so likewise did He restrain these men too, both throughout all His
Gospel, and at the very time of His condemnation. For surely when they saw the ruler and
the judge washing his hands of it, and saying, “I am innocent of this blood,” they should
have been moved to compunction both by what was said, and by what was done, as well
when they saw Judas had hanged himself, as when they saw Pilate himself entreating them
to take another in the place of Him. For when the accuser and traitor condemns himself,
and he who gives sentence puts off from himself the guilt, and such a vision appears the
very night, and even as condemned he begs Him off, what kind of plea will they have? For
if they were not willing that He should be innocent, yet they should not have preferred to
him even a robber, one that was acknowledged to be such, and very notorious.</p>
<p>What then did they? When they saw the judge washing his hands, and saying, “I am
innocent,” they cried out “His blood be on us, and on our children.”3084 Then at length
when they had given sentence against themselves, he yielded that all should be done.</p>
<p>See here too their great madness. For passion and wicked desire are like this. They suffer
not men to see anything of what is right. For be it that ye curse yourselves; why do you draw
down the curse upon your children also?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lover of man, though they acted with so much madness, both against
themselves, and against their children, so far from confirming their sentence upon their
children, confirmed it not even on them, but from the one and from the other received those
that repented, and counts them worthy of good things beyond number. For indeed even
Paul was of them, and the thousands that believed in Jerusalem; for, “thou seest it is said,
brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe.”3085 And if some continued
in their sin, to themselves let them impute their punishment.</p>

<p>“Then released he Barabbas unto them, but Jesus, when he had scourged Him, he delivered
to be crucified.”3086</p>
<p>And wherefore did he scourge Him. Either as one condemned, or willing to invest the
judgment with due form, or to please them. And yet he ought to have resisted them. For
indeed even before this he had said, “Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law.”3087
And there were many things that might have held back him and those men, the signs and
the miracles, and the great patience of Him, who was suffering these things, and above all
His untold silence. For since both by His defense of Himself, and by His prayers, He had
shown His humanity, again He showeth His exaltedness and the greatness of His nature,
both by His silence, and by His contemning what is said; by all leading them on to marvel
at Himself.3088 But to none of these things did they give way.</p>
<p>3. For when once the reasoning powers are overwhelmed as it were by intoxication or
some wild insanity, it would be hard for the sinking soul to rise again, if it be not very noble.</p>
<p>For it is fearful, it is fearful to give place to these wicked passions, wherefore it were fit
in every way to ward off and repel their entering in. For when they have laid hold of the
soul, and got the dominion over it, like as fire lighting upon a wood, so do they kindle the
flame to a blaze.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you to do all things so as to fence off their entrance; and not by
comforting yourselves with this heartless reasoning to bring in upon yourselves all wickedness,
saying, what of this? What of that? For countless ills have their birth from hence. For
the devil, being depraved, makes use of much craft, and exertion, and self-abasement for
the ruin of men, and begins his attack on them with things of a more trifling nature.</p>
<p>And mark it, he desired to bring Saul into superstition of witchcraft. But if he had
counselled this at the beginning, the other would not have given heed; for how should he,
who was even driving them out? Therefore gently and by little and little he leads him on to
it. For when he had disobeyed Samuel, and had caused the burnt-offering to be offered,
when he was not present, being blamed for it, he says, “The compulsion from the enemy
was too great,”3089and when he ought to have bewailed, he felt as though he had done
nothing.</p>
<p>Again God gave him the commands about the Amalekites, but he transgressed these
too. Thence he proceeded to his crimes about David, and thus slipping easily and by little
and little he stayed not, until he came unto the very pit of destruction, and cast himself in.
So likewise in the case of Cain, he did not at once urge him to slay his brother, since he

would not have persuaded him, but first wrought upon him to offer things more or less vile,
saying, “This is no sin:” in the second place he kindled envy and jealousy, saying, neither is
there anything in this; thirdly, he persuaded him to slay and to deny his murder; and did
not leave him before he had put on him the crowning act of evil.</p>
<p>Wherefore it is necessary for us to resist the beginning. For at any rate, even if the first
sins stopped at themselves, not even so were it right to despise the first sins; but now they
go on also to what is greater, when the mind is careless. Wherefore we ought to do all things
to remove the beginnings of them.</p>
<p>For look not now at the nature of the sin, that it is little, but that it becomes a root of
great sin when neglected. For if one may say something marvellous, great sins need not so
much earnestness, as such as are little, and of small account. For the former the very nature
of the sin causes us to abhor, but the little sins by this very thing cast us into remissness;
and allow us not to rouse ourselves heartily for their removal. Wherefore also they quickly
become great, while we sleep. This one may see happening in bodies also.</p>
<p>So likewise in the instance of Judas, that great wickedness had its birth. For if it had not
seemed to him a little thing to steal the money of the poor, he would not have been led on
to this treachery. Unless it had seemed to the Jews a little thing to be taken captive by vainglory,
they would not have run on the rock of becoming Christ’s murderers. And indeed all
evils we may see arise from this.</p>
<p>For no one quickly and at once rusheth out into vices. For the soul hath, yea it hath a
shame implanted in us, and a reverence for right things; and it would not at once become
so shameless as in one act to cast away everything, but slowly, and by little and little doth it
perish, when it is careless. Thus also did idolatry enter in, men being honored beyond
measure, both the living and the departed; thus also were idols worshipped; thus too did
whoredom prevail, and the other evils.</p>
<p>And see. One man laughed unseasonably; another blamed him; a third took away the
fear, by saying, nothing comes of this. “For what is laughing? What can come of it?” Of this
is bred foolish jesting; from that filthy talking; then filthy doings.</p>
<p>Again, another being blamed for slandering his neighbors, and reviling, and calumniating,
despised it, saying, evil-speaking is nothing. By this he begets hatred unspeakable, revilings
without end; by the revilings blows, and by the blows oftentimes murder.</p>
<p>4. From these little things then that wicked spirit thus brings in the great sins; and from
the great despair; having invented this other while not less mischievous than the former.
For to sin destroys not so much as to despair. For he that hath offended, if he be vigilant,
speedily by repentance amends what hath been done; but he that hath learnt to despond,
and doth not repent, by reason thereof fails of this amendment by not applying the remedies
from repentance.</p>

<pb n="891"/>
<p>And he hath a third grievous snare; as when he invests the sin with a show of devotion.
And where hath the devil so far prevailed as to deceive to this degree? Hear, and beware of
his devices. Christ by Paul commanded “that a woman depart not from her husband,3090and
not to defraud one another, except by consent;”3091but some from a love of continence
forsooth, having withdrawn from their own husbands, as though they were doing something
devout, have driven them to adultery. Consider now what an evil it is that they, undergoing
so much toil, should be blamed as having committed the greatest injustice, and should suffer
extreme punishment, and drive their husbands into the pit of destruction.</p>
<p>Others again, abstaining from meats by a rule of fasting, have by degrees gone so far as
to abhor them; which even of itself brings a very great punishment.</p>
<p>But this comes to pass, when any hold fast their own prejudices contrary to what is approved
by the Scriptures. Those also among the Corinthians thought it was a part of perfection
to eat of all things without distinction, even of things forbidden, but nevertheless this
was not of perfection, but of the utmost lawlessness. Wherefore also Paul earnestly reproves
them, and pronounces them to be worthy of extreme punishment. Others again think it a
sign of piety to wear long hair. And yet this is amongst the things forbidden, and carries
with it much disgrace.</p>
<p>Again, others follow after excessive sorrow for their sins as a profitable thing; yet it also
comes of the devil’s wiles, and Judas showed it; at least in consequence thereof he even
hanged himself. Therefore Paul again was in fear about him that had committed fornication,
lest any such thing should befall him, and persuaded the Corinthians speedily to deliver
him, “lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.”3092 Then,
indicating that such a result cometh of the snares of that wicked one, he saith, “Lest Satan
should get an advantage over us, for we are not ignorant of his devices,”3093meaning that
he assails us with much craft. Since if he fought against us plainly and openly, the victory
would be ready and easy; or rather even now, if we be vigilant, victory will be ready. For
indeed against each one of those ways God hath armed us.</p>
<p>For to persuade us not to despise even these little things, hear what warning He gives
us, saying, “He that saith to his brother, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell;”3094and he that
hath looked with unchaste eyes is a complete adulterer.3095 And on them that laugh he
pronounces a woe, and everywhere He removes the beginning and the seeds of evil, and

<pb n="892"/>
saith we have to give an account of an idle word.3096 Therefore also Job applied a remedy
even for the thoughts of his children.3097</p>
<p>But about not despairing, it is said, “Doth he fall, and not arise? Doth he turn away, and
not return?”3098and, “I do not will the death of the sinner, so much as that he should turn
and live:”3099and, “To-day if ye will hear His voice:”3100and many other such things, both
sayings and examples are set in the Scripture. And in order not to be ruined under the guise
of godly fear, hear Paul saying, “Lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up by overmuch
sorrow.”</p>
<p>Knowing therefore these things, let us set for a barrier in all the ways that pervert the
unwary the wisdom which is drawn from the Scriptures. Neither say, why, what is it, if I
gaze curiously at a beautiful woman? For if thou shouldest commit the adultery in the heart,
soon thou wilt venture on that in flesh. Say not, why, what is it if I should pass by this poor
man? For if thou pass this man by, thou wilt also the next; if him, then the third.</p>
<p>Neither again say, why, what is it, if I should desire my neighbor’s goods. For this, this
caused Ahab’s ruin; although he would have paid a price, yet he took it from one unwilling.
For a man ought not to buy by force, but on persuasion. But if he, who would have paid the
fair price, was so punished, because he took from one unwilling, he who doeth not so much
as this, and taketh by violence from the unwilling, and that when living under grace, of what
punishment will he not be worthy?</p>
<p>In order therefore that we be not punished, keeping ourselves quite pure from all violence
and rapine, and guarding against the sources of sins together with the sins themselves, let
us with much diligence give heed to virtue; for thus shall we also enjoy the good things
eternal by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world
without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXVII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXVII. 27-29.</p>
<p>“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall,3101and gathered unto him
the whole band of soldiers; and they stripped Him, and put on Him a purple robe; and
when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right
hand; and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying, Hail, king of the
Jews.”3102</p>
<p>As though on some signal the devil then was entering in triumph3103into all. For, be it
that Jews pining with envy and jealousy were mad against Him, as to the soldiers, whence
was it, and from what sort of cause? Is it not clear that it was the devil who was then entering
in fury into the hearts of all? For indeed they made a pleasure of their insults against Him,
being a savage and ruthless set. I mean that, when they ought to have been awestruck, when
they ought to have wept, which even the people did, this they did not, but, on the contrary,
were despiteful, and insolent; perhaps themselves also seeking to please the Jews, or it may
be doing all in conformity to their own evil nature.</p>
<p>And the insults were different, and varied. For that Divine Head at one time they buffeted,
at another they insulted with the crown of thorns, at another they smote with the reed, men
unholy and accursed!</p>
<p>What plea shall we have after this for being moved by injuries, after Christ suffered
these things? For what was done was the utmost limit of insolence. For not one member,
but the whole entire body throughout was made an object of insolence; the head through
the crown, and the reed, and the buffeting; the face, being spit upon; the cheeks, being
smitten with the palms of the hands; the whole body by the stripes, by being wrapped in the
robe, and by the pretended worship; the hand by the reed, which they gave him to hold instead
of a sceptre; the mouth again by the offering of the vinegar. What could be more
grievous than these things? What more insulting?</p>
<p>For the things that were done go beyond all language. For as though they were afraid
lest they should seem to fall short at all in the crime, having killed the prophets with their
own hands, but this man with the sentence of a judge, so they do in every deed; and make
it the work of their own hands, and condemn and sentence both among themselves and
before Pilate, saying, “His blood be on us and on our children,”3104and insult Him, and do

<pb n="894"/>
despite unto Him themselves, binding Him, leading Him away, and render themselves authors
of the spiteful acts done by the soldiers, and nail Him to the cross, and revile Him, and spit
at Him, and deride Him. For Pilate contributed nothing in this matter, but they themselves
did every thing, becoming accusers, and judges, and executioners, and all.</p>
<p>And these things are read amongst us, when all meet together. For that the heathens
may not say, that ye display to people and nations the things that are glorious and illustrious,
such as the signs and the miracles, but that ye hide these which are matters of reproach; the
grace of the Spirit hath brought it to pass, that in the full festival, when men in multitude
and women are present, and all, as one may say, at the great eve of the passover, then all
these things should be read; when the whole world is present, then are all these acts proclaimed
with a clear voice. And these being read, and made known to all, Christ is believed
to be God and, besides all the rest, is worshipped, even because of this, that He vouchsafed
to stoop so much for us as actually to suffer these things, and to teach us all virtue.</p>
<p>These things then let us read continually; for indeed great is the gain, great the advantage
to be thence obtained. For when thou seest Him, both by gestures and by deeds, mocked
and worshipped with so much derision, and beaten and suffering the utmost insults, though
thou be very stone, thou wilt become softer than any wax, and wilt cast out of thy soul all
haughtiness.</p>
<p>Hear therefore also what follows. For after “they had mocked Him, they led Him to
crucify Him,”3105it is said, and when they had stripped Him, they took His garments, and
sat down and watched Him, when He should die. And they divide His garments amongst
them, which sort of thing is done in the case of very vile and abject criminals, and such as
have no one belonging to them, and are in utter desolation.</p>
<p>They parted the garments, by which such great miracles were done. But they wrought
none now, Christ restraining His unspeakable power. And this was no small addition of
insult. For as to one base and abject, as I said, and the vilest of all men; so do they dare to
do all things. To the thieves at any rate they did nothing of the kind, but to Christ they dare
it all. And they crucified Him in the midst of them, that He might share in their reputation.
And they gave Him gall to drink, and this to insult Him, but He would not. But another
saith, that having tasted it, He said, “It is finished.”3106 </p> 
<p>And what meaneth, “It is finished?”
The prophecy was fulfilled concerning Him. “For they gave me,” it is said, “gall for my meat,
and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.”3107 But neither doth that evangelist indicate
that He drank, for merely to taste differs not from not drinking, but hath one and the same
signification.</p>
<note type="footnote">3105 Matt. xxvii. 31. [ἤγαγον for ἀπγαγον.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3106 John xix. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">3107 Ps. lxix. 21.</note>

<pb n="895"/>
<p>But nevertheless not even here doth their contumely stop, but after having stripped and
crucified Him, and offered Him vinegar, they proceeded still further, and beholding Him
impaled upon the cross, they revile Him, both they themselves and the passers by; and this
was more grievous than all, that on the charge of being an impostor and deceiver He suffered
these things, and as a boaster, and vainly pretending what He said. Therefore they both
crucified Him publicly, that they might make a show of it in the sight of all; and therefore
also they did it by the hands of the soldiers, that these things being perpetrated even by a
public tribunal, the insult might be the greater.</p>
<p>2. And yet who would not have been moved by the multitude that was following Him,
and lamenting Him? Nay, not these wild beasts. Wherefore also He to the multitude
vouchsafes an answer, but to these men not so. For after having done what they would, they
endeavor also to injure His honor, fearing His resurrection. Therefore they say these things
publicly, and crucified thieves with Him, and wishing to prove Him a deceiver, they say,
“Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days come down from the cross.”3108
For since on telling Pilate to remove the accusation (this was the writing, “The king of the
Jews”), they prevailed not, but he persevered in saying, “What I have written, I have written,”
3109they then endeavor by their derision of Him to show that He is not a king.</p>
<p>Wherefore they said those things, and also these. If “He is the king of Israel, let Him
come down now from the cross. He saved others, Himself He cannot save,”3110aiming
hereby to bring discredit even on His former miracles. And again, “If He be Son of God,
and He will have Him, let Him save Him.”3111</p>
<p>O execrable; most execrable! What, were not the prophets prophets, nor the righteous
men righteous, because God rescued them not out of their dangers. Nay surely they were,
though suffering these things. What then could be equal to your folly? For if the coming of
the dangers upon them did not injure their honor with you, how much more in the case of
this man, was it wrong for you to be offended, when both by what He did, by what He said,
He was ever correcting beforehand this suspicion of yours.</p>
<p>Yet nevertheless, even when these things were said and done, they prevailed nothing,
not even at the very time. At any rate, he, who was depraved in such great wickedness, and
who had spent his whole life in murders and house-breakings, when these things were being
said, then confessed Him, and made mention of a kingdom, and the people bewailed Him.

<pb n="896"/>
And yet the things that were done seemed to testify the contrary in the eyes of those who
knew not the mysterious dispensations, that He was weak and of no power, nevertheless
truth prevailed even by the contrary things.</p>
<p>Hearing then these things, let us arm ourselves against all rage, against all anger.
Shouldest thou perceive thy heart swelling, seal thy breast setting upon it the cross. Call to
mind some one of the things that then took place, and thou wilt cast out as dust all rage by
the recollection of the things that were done. Consider the words, the actions; consider that
He is Lord, and thou servant. He is suffering for thee, thou for thyself; He in behalf of them
who had been benefited by Him and had crucified Him, thou in behalf of thyself; He in behalf
of them who had used Him despitefully, thou oftentimes at the hands of them who have
been injured. He in the sight of the whole city, or rather of the whole people of the Jews,
both strangers, and those of the country, before whom He spake those merciful words, but
thou in the presence of few; and what was more insulting to Him, that even His disciples
forsook Him. For those, who before paid Him attention, had deserted Him, but His enemies
and foes, having got Him in the midst of themselves on the cross, insulted, reviled, mocked,
derided, scoffed at Him, Jews and soldiers from below, from above thieves on either side:
for indeed the thieves insulted, and upbraided Him both of them. How then saith Luke that
one “rebuked?”3112 Both things were done, for at first both upbraided Him, but afterwards
one did so no more. For that thou mightest not think the thing had been done by any
agreement, or that the thief was not a thief, by his insolence he showeth thee, that up on the
cross he was a thief and an enemy, and at once was changed.</p>
<p>Considering then all these things, control thyself. For what sufferest thou like what thy
Lord suffered? Wast thou publicly insulted? But not like these things. Art thou mocked? yet
not thy whole body, not being thus scourged, and stripped. And even if thou wast buffeted,
yet not like this.</p>
<p>3. And add to this, I pray thee, by whom, and wherefore, and when, and who it was;
and (the most grievous matter) that these things being done, no one found fault, no one
blamed what was done, but on the contrary all rather approved, and joined in mocking Him
and in jeering at Him; and as a boaster, impostor, and deceiver, and not able to prove in
His works the things that He said, so did they revile Him. But He held His peace to all,
preparing for us the most powerful incentives to long suffering.</p>
<p>But we, though hearing such things, are not patient so much as to servants, but we rush
and kick worse than wild asses, with respect to injuries against ourselves, being savage and
<note type="footnote">3112 Luke xxiii. 40.</note>

<pb n="897"/>
inhuman; but of those against God not making much account. And with respect to friends
too we have the same disposition; should any one vex us, we bear it not; should he insult
us, we are savage more than wild beasts, we who are reading these things every day. A disciple
betrayed Him, the rest forsook Him and fled, they that had been benefited by Him spat at
Him, the servants of the high priest smote Him with the palm of the hand, the soldiers
buffeted Him; they that passed by jeered Him and reviled Him, the thieves accused Him;
and to no man did He utter a word, but by silence overcame all; instructing thee by His actions,
that the more meekly thou shalt endure, the more wilt thou prevail over them that
do thee evil, and wilt be an object of admiration before all. For who will not admire him
that endures with forbearance the insults he receives from them that are using him despitefully?
For even as, though any man suffer justly, yet enduring the evil meekly, he is considered
by the more part to suffer unjustly; so though one suffer unjustly, yet if he be violent, he will
get the suspicion of suffering justly, and will be an object of ridicule, as being dragged captive
by his anger, and losing his own nobility. For such a one, we must not call so much as a
freeman, though he be lord over ten thousand servants.</p>
<p>But did some person exceedingly provoke thee? And what of that? For then should selfcontrol
be shown, since when there is no one to vex, we see even the wild beasts gentle; for
neither are they always savage, but when any one rouses them. And we therefore, if we are
only then quiet, when there is no one provoking us, what advantage have we over them. For
they are both oftentimes justly indignant, and have much excuse, for by being stirred and
goaded are they roused, and besides these things they are devoid of reason, and have savageness
in their nature.</p>
<p>But whence, I pray thee, canst thou find a plea for being savage and fierce? What hardship
hast thou suffered? Hast thou been robbed? For this self-same reason shouldest thou endure
it, so as to gain more amply. But wast thou deprived of character? And what is this? Thy
condition is in no way worsened by this, if thou practise self-command. But if thou sufferest
no grievance, whence art thou angry with him that hath done thee no harm, but hath even
benefited thee? For they who honor, make them that are not watchful the more vain; but
they who insult and despise render those that take heed to themselves more steadfast. For
the careless are more injured by being honored than by being insulted. And the one set of
persons, if we be sober, become to us authors of self-control, but the others excite our pride,
they fill us with boastfulness, vainglory, folly, they make our soul the feebler.</p>
<p>And to this fathers bear witness, who do not flatter their own children so much as they
chide them, fearing lest from the praise they should receive any harm, and their teachers
use the same remedy to them. So that if we are to avoid any one, it should be those that
flatter us rather than those that insult us; for this bait brings greater mischief than insult to
them, who do not take heed, and it is more difficult to control this feeling than that. And
the reward too is far more abundant from thence, and the admiration greater. For indeed

<pb n="898"/>
it is more worthy of admiration to see a man insulted, and not moved, than beaten and
smitten, and not falling.</p>
<p>And how is it possible not to be moved? one may say. Hath any one insulted thee? Place
the sign upon thy breast, call to mind all the things that were then done; and all is quenched.
Consider not the insults only, but if also any good hath been ever done unto thee, by him
that hath insulted thee, and straightway thou wilt become meek, or rather consider before
all things the fear of God, and soon thou wilt be mild and gentle.</p>
<p>4. Together with these things even from thine own servants take a lesson concerning
these matters; and when thou seest thyself insulting, but thy servant holding his peace,
consider that it is possible to practise self-control, and condemn thyself for being violent;
and in the very time of offering insults learn not to insult; and thus not even when insulted,
wilt thou be vexed. Consider that he who is insolent is beside himself and mad, and thou
wilt not feel indignant, when insulted, since the possessed strike us, and we, so far from being
provoked, do rather pity them. This do thou also; pity him that is insolent to thee, for he is
held in subjection by a dreadful monster, rage, by a grievous demon, anger. Set him free as
he is wrought upon by a grievous demon, and going quickly to ruin. For so great is this
disease as not to need even time for the destruction of him that is seized with it. Wherefore
also one said, “The sway of his fury shall be his fall;”3113by this most of all showing its
tyranny, that in a short time it works great ills, and needs not to continue long with us, so
that if in addition to its strength it were apt to last, it would indeed be hard to strive against.</p>
<p>I should like to show what the man is who insulteth, what he that practises self-control,
and to bring nakedly before you the soul of the one and the other. For thou shouldest see
the one like a sea tost with a tempest, but the other like a harbor free from disturbance. For
it is not disturbed by these evil blasts, but puts them to rest easily. For indeed they who are
insulting, do everything in order to make it sting. When then they fail of that hope, even
they are thenceforth at peace, and go away amended. For it is impossible that a man, who
is angry, should not utterly condemn himself, even as on the other hand it is impossible for
one who is not angry to be self-condemned. For though it be necessary to retaliate, it is
possible to do this without anger (and it were more easy and more wise than with anger)
and to have no painful feeling. For if we be willing, the good things will be from ourselves,
and we shall be with the grace of God sufficient for our own safety and honor.</p>
<p>For why seekest thou the glory that cometh from another? Do thou honor thyself, and
no one will be able to insult thee; but if thou dishonor thyself, though all should honor thee,
thou wilt not be honored. For like as, unless we put ourselves in an evil state, no one else
puts us in such a state; even so unless we insult ourselves, no one else can put us to shame.</p>

or indignant, nor be conscious to himself of any of these crimes, what disgrace will he thence
undergo? None. What then, you may say, if many have such an opinion of him? Not even
so is he disgraced, but they bring shame upon themselves, by accounting one, who is not
such, to be such. For tell me, if any one think the sun to be dark, doth he bring an ill name
on that heavenly body, or on himself? Surely on himself, getting himself the character of
being blind or mad. So also they that account wicked men good, and they that make the
opposite error, disgrace themselves.</p>
<p>Wherefore we ought to give the greater diligence, to keep our conscience clear, and to
give no handle against ourselves, nor matter for evil suspicion; but if others will be mad,
even when this is our disposition, not to care very much, nor to grieve. For he that hath got
the character of a wicked man, being a good man, is in no degree thereby hurt as regards
his being such as he is; but he that hath been suspecting another vainly and causelessly, receives
the utmost harm; as, on the other hand, the wicked man, if he be supposed to be the
contrary, will gain nothing thence, but will both have a heavier judgment, and be led into
greater carelessness. For he that is such and is suspected thereof, may perhaps be humbled,
and acknowledge his sins; but when he escapes detection, he falls into a state past feeling.
For if, while all are accusing them, offenders are hardly stirred up to compunction, when
so far from accusing them, some even praise them, at what time will they who are living in
vice be able to open their eyes? Hearest thou that Paul also blames for this, that the Corinthians
(so far from permitting him that had been guilty of fornication, to acknowledge his own
sin), applauding and honoring him, did on the contrary urge him on in vice thereby?
Wherefore, I pray, let us leave the suspicions of the multitude, their insults and their honors,
and let us be diligent about one thing only, that we be conscious to ourselves of no evil thing,
nor insult our own selves. For so both here, and in the world to come, we shall enjoy much
glory, unto which God grant we all may attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily LXXXVIII.</head>
<p>Matt. XXVII. 45-48.</p>
<p>“Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
that is to say, my God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood there,
when they heard that said, this man calleth for Elias. And straight way one of them ran,
and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to
drink.”3114</p>
<p>This is the sign which before He had promised to give them when they asked it, saying,
“An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to
it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas;”3115meaning His cross, and His death, His burial, and
His resurrection. And again, declaring in another way the virtue of the cross, He said, “When
ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that I am He.”3116 And what He saith
is to this purport: “When ye have crucified me, and think ye have overcome me, then, above
all, shall ye know my might.”</p>
<p>For after the crucifixion, the city was destroyed, and the Jewish state came to an end,
they fell away from their polity and their freedom, the gospel flourished, the word was spread
abroad to the ends of the world; both sea and land, both the inhabited earth and the desert
perpetually proclaim its3117power. These things then He meaneth, and those which took
place at the very time of the crucifixion. For indeed it was much more marvellous that these
things should be done, when He was nailed to the cross, than when He was walking on earth.
And not in this respect only was the wonder, but because from heaven also was that done
which they had sought, and it was over all the world, which had never before happened, but
in Egypt only, when the passover was to be fulfilled. For indeed those events were a type of
these.</p>
<p>And observe when it took place. At midday, that all that dwell on the earth may know
it, when it was day all over the world; which was enough to convert them, not by the greatness
of the miracle only, but also by its taking place in due season. For after all their insulting,
and their lawless derision, this is done, when they had let go their anger, when they had
ceased mocking, when they were satiated with their jeerings, and had spoken all that they

were minded; then He shows the darkness, in order that at least so (having vented their
anger) they may profit by the miracle. For this was more marvellous than to come down
from the cross, that being on the cross He should work these things. For whether they
thought He Himself had done it, they ought to have believed and to have feared; or whether
not He, but the Father, yet thereby ought they to have been moved to compunction, for that
darkness was a token of His anger at their crime. For that it was not an eclipse, but both
wrath and indignation, is not hence alone manifest, but also by the time, for it continued
three hours, but an eclipse takes place in one moment of time, and they know it, who have
seen this; and indeed it hath taken place even in our generation.</p>
<p>And how, you may say, did not all marvel, and account Him to be God? Because the
race of man was then held in a state of great carelessness and vice. And this miracle was but
one, and when it had taken place, immediately passed away; and no one was concerned to
inquire into the cause of it, and great was the prejudice and the habit of ungodliness. And
they knew not what was the cause of that which took place, and they thought perhaps this
happened so, in the way of an eclipse or some natural effect. And why dost thou marvel
about them that are without, that knew nothing, neither inquired by reason of great indifference,
when even those that were in Judæa itself, after so many miracles, yet continued
using Him despitefully, although He plainly showed them that He Himself wrought this
thing.</p>
<p>And for this reason, even after this He speaks, that they might learn that He was still
alive, and that He Himself did this, and that they might become by this also more gentle,
and He saith, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?”3118that unto His last breath they might see that
He honors His Father, and is no adversary of God. Wherefore also He uttered a certain cry
from the prophet,3119even to His last hour bearing witness to the Old Testament, and not
simply a cry from the prophet, but also in Hebrew, so as to be plain and intelligible to them,
and by all things He shows how He is of one mind with Him that begat Him.</p>
<p>But mark herein also their wantonness, and intemperance, and folly. They thought (it
is said) that it was Elias whom He called, and straightway they gave Him vinegar to drink.3120
But another came unto Him, and “pierced His side with a spear.”3121 What could be more
lawless, what more brutal, than these men; who carried their madness to so great a length,
offering insult at last even to a dead body?</p>

<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, how He made use of their wickednesses for our salvation.
For after the blow the fountains of our salvation gushed forth from thence.</p>
<p>“And Jesus, when He had cried with a loud voice, yielded up the Ghost.”3122 This is
what He said, “I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again,” and, “I
lay it down of myself.”3123 So for this cause He cried with the voice, that it might be shown
that the act is done by power. Mark at any rate saith, that “Pilate marvelled if He were already
dead:”3124and that the centurion for this cause above all believed, because He died with
power.3125</p>
<p>This cry rent the veil, and opened the tombs, and made the house desolate. And He did
this, not as offering insult to the temple (for how should He, who saith, “Make not my
Father’s house a house of merchandise”),3126but declaring them to be unworthy even of
His abiding there; like as also when He delivered it over to the Babylonians. But not for this
only were these things done, but what took place was a prophecy of the coming desolation,
and of the change into the greater and higher state; and a sign of His might.</p>
<p>And together with these things He showed Himself also by what followed after these
things, by the raising of the dead. For in the instance of Elisha;3127 one on touching a dead
body rose again, but now by a voice He raised them, His body continuing up there, on the
cross. And besides, those things were a type of this. For that this might be believed, therefore
is that all done. And they are not merely raised, but also rocks are rent, and the earth shaken,
that they might learn, that He was able to strike themselves blind, and to rend them in pieces.
For He that cleft rocks asunder, and darkened the world, much more could have done these
things to them, had it been His will. But He would not, but having discharged His wrath
upon the elements, them it was His will to save by clemency. But they abated not their
madness. Such is envy, such is jealousy, it is not easily stayed. At that time then they were
impudent in setting themselves against the actual appearances; and afterwards even against
the things themselves,3128 when a seal being put upon Him, and soldiers watching Him, He
rose again, and they heard these things from the very guards; they even gave money, in order
both to corrupt others, and to steal away the history of the resurrection.</p>
<p>Marvel not therefore if at this time also they were perverse, being thus altogether prepared
to set themselves impudently against all things; but observe this other point, how great signs

He had wrought, some from Heaven, some on earth, some in the very temple, at once
marking His indignation, and at the same time showing that what were unapproachable are
now to be entered, and that Heaven shall be opened; and the work removed to the true Holy
of Holies. And they indeed said, “If He be the King of Israel, let Him come down now from
the cross,”3129but He shows that He is King of all the world. And whereas those men said,
“Thou that destroyest this temple, and buildest it in three days,”3130 He shows that it shall
be made forever desolate. Again they said, “He saved others, Himself He cannot save,”3131but
He while abiding on the cross proved this most abundantly on the bodies of His servants.
For if for Lazarus to rise on the fourth day was a great thing, how much more for all those
who had long ago fallen asleep, at once to appear alive, which was a sign of the future resurrection.
For, “many bodies of the saints which slept, arose,” it is said, “and went into the
holy city, and appeared to many.”3132 For in order that what was done might not be accoun-
ted to be an imagination, they appear, even to many, in the city. And the Centurion too
then glorified God, saying, “Truly this was a righteous man.
And the multitudes that came
together to that sight, returned beating their breasts.”3133 So great was the power of the
crucified, that after so many mockings, and scoffs, and jeers, both the centurion was moved
to compunction, and the people. And some say that there is also a martyrdom of this centurion,
who after these things grew to manhood in the faith.</p>
<p>“And many women were there beholding afar off, which had followed Him, ministering
unto Him, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Joses, and the mother of
Zebedee’s sons.”3134</p>
<p>These things the women see done, these who were most inclined to feel for Him, who
were most of all bewailing Him. And mark how great their assiduity. They had followed
Him ministering to Him, and were present even unto the time of the dangers. Wherefore
also they saw all; how He cried, how He gave up the ghost, how the rocks were rent, and all
the rest.</p>
<p>And these first see Jesus; and the sex that was most condemned, this first enjoys the
sight of the blessings, this most shows its courage. And when the disciples had fled, these
were present. But who were these? His mother, for she is called mother of James,3135and

the rest. But another evangelist3136saith, that many also lamented over the things that were
done, and smote their breasts, which above all shows the cruelty of the Jews, for that they
gloried in things for which others were lamenting, and were neither moved by pity, nor
checked by fear. For indeed the things that were done were of great wrath, and were not
merely signs, but signs of anger all of them, the darkness, the cloven rocks, the veil rent in
the midst, the shaking of the earth, and great was the excess of the indignation.</p>
<p>“But Joseph went, and begged the body.”3137 This was Joseph, who was concealing his
discipleship of late; now however he had become very bold after the death of Christ. For
neither was he an obscure person, nor of the unnoticed; but one of the council, and highly
distinguished; from which circumstance especially one may see his courage. For he exposed
himself to death, taking upon him enmity with all, by his affection to Jesus, both having
dared to beg the body, and not having desisted until he obtained it. But not by taking it only,
nor by burying it in a costly manner, but also by laying it in his own new tomb, he showeth
his love, and his courage. And this was not so ordered without purpose, but so there should
not be any bare suspicion, that one had risen instead of another.</p>
<p>“And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.”
3138 For what purpose do these wait by it? As yet they knew nothing great, as was
meet, and high about Him, wherefore also they had brought ointments, and were waiting
at the tomb, so that if the madness of the Jews should relax, they might go and embrace the
body. Seest thou women’s courage? seest thou their affection? seest thou their noble spirit
in money? their noble spirit even unto death?</p>
<p>Let us men imitate the women; let us not forsake Jesus in temptations. For they for Him
even dead spent so much and exposed their lives, but we (for again I say the same things)
neither feed Him when hungry, nor clothe Him when naked, but seeing Him begging, we
pass Him by. And yet if ye saw Himself, every one would strip himself of all his goods. But
even now it is the same. For He Himself has said, I am he. Wherefore then dost thou not
strip thyself of all? For indeed even now thou hearest Him say, Thou doest it unto me; and
there is no difference whether thou givest to this man or to Him; thou hast nothing less than
these women that then fed Him, but even much more. But be not perplexed! For it is not
so much to have fed Him appearing in His own person, which would be enough to prevail
with a heart of stone, as (because of His mere word) to wait upon the poor, the maimed,

him that is bent down. For in the former case, the look and the dignity of Him who appears
divides with thee that which is done; but here the reward is entire for thy benevolence; and
there is the proof of the greater reverence towards Him, when at His mere word waiting
upon thy fellow-servant thou refreshest him in all things. Refresh him, and believe Him,
who receiveth it, and saith, Thou givest to me. For unless thou hadst given to Him, He would
not have counted thee worthy of a kingdom. If thou hadst not turned away from Him, He
would not have sent thee to hell, if thou hadst overlooked a chance person; but because it
is He Himself that is despised, therefore great is the blame.</p>
<p>Thus also Paul persecuted Him, in persecuting them that are His; wherefore too He
said, “Why persecutest thou me?”3139 Thus therefore let us feel, as bestowing on Christ
Himself when we bestow. For indeed His words are more sure than our sight. When therefore
thou seest a poor man, remember His words, by which He declared, that it is He Himself
who is fed. For though that which appears be not Christ, yet in this man’s form Christ
Himself receiveth and beggeth.</p>
<p>But art thou ashamed to hear that Christ beggeth? Rather be ashamed when thou dost
not give to Him begging of thee. For this is shame, this is vengeance and punishment. Since
for Him to beg is of His goodness, wherefore we ought even to glory therein; but for thee
not to give, is of thy inhumanity. But if thou believe not now, that in passing by a poor man
that is a believer, thou passest by Him, thou wilt believe it then, when He will bring thee
into the midst and say, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to these, ye did it not to me.”3140 But God
forbid that we should so learn it, and grant rather that we may believe now, and bring forth
fruit, and hear that most blessed voice that bringeth us into the kingdom.</p>
<p>But perhaps some one will say, “Thou art every day discoursing to us of almsgiving and
humanity.” Neither will I cease to speak of this. For if ye had attained to it, in the first place,
not even so ought I to desist, for fear of making you the more remiss; yet had ye attained, I
might have relaxed a little; but if ye have not arrived even at the half; say not these things
to me, but to yourselves. For indeed thou doest the same in blaming me, as if a little child,
hearing often of the letter alpha, and not learning it, were to blame its teacher, because he
is continually and for ever reminding him about it.</p>
<p>For who from these discourses has become more forward in the giving of alms? Who
has cast down his money? Who has given the half of his substance? Who the third part? No
one. How then should it be other than absurd, when ye do not learn, to require us to desist
from teaching? Ye ought to do the contrary. Though we were minded to desist, ye ought to
stop us and to say, we have not yet learnt these things, and how is it ye have desisted from
reminding us of them? If it befell any one to suffer from his eye, and I happened to be a

physician, and then having covered it up and anointed it, and having applied other treatment,
I had not benefited it much, and so had desisted; would he not have come to the doors of
my surgery and cried out against me, accusing me of great remissness, for that I had of
myself withdrawn, while the disease remained; and if, on being blamed, I had said in reply
to these things, that I had covered it up, and anointed it; would he have endured it? By no
means, but would immediately have said; “And what is the advantage, if I still suffer pain.”
Reason thus also with respect to thy soul. But what if after having often fomented a hand
that was lifeless and shrunk, I had not succeeded in mollifying it? Should I not have heard
the same thing? And even now a hand that is shrunk and withered we bathe, and for this
reason, until we can stretch it out perfectly, we will not desist. Would that you too were to
discourse of nothing else, at home and at market, at table and at night, and as a dream. For
if we were always careful about these things by day, even in our dreams we should be engaged
in them.</p>
<p>What sayest thou? Am I forever speaking of almsgiving? I would wish myself that there
were not great need for me to address this advice to you, but that I were to speak of the battle
against the Jews, and heathens, and heretics; but when ye are not yet sound, how can any
one arm you for the fight? How should he lead you to the array, yet having wounds and
gashes. Since if indeed I saw you thoroughly sound in health, I should lead you forth to that
battle array, and ye would see by the grace of Christ ten thousands lying dead, and their
heads cast one upon another. In other books at any rate, many discourses have been spoken
by us touching these things, but not even so are we able thoroughly to triumph in the victory,
because of the remissness of the multitude. For when we conquer them ten thousand times
over in doctrines, they reproach us with the lives of the multitude of those who join our
congregations, their wounds, their diseases in their soul.
How then shall we with confidence show you in the battle array, when ye rather do us
mischief, being straightway wounded by our enemies, and made a mock of? For one man’s
hand is diseased, and shrunk so as not to be able to give away.</p>
<p>How then should such a one
hold a shield, and thrust it before him, and avoid being wounded by the jeers of cruelty.
With others the feet halt, as many as go up to the theatres, and to the resorts of the harlot
women. How shall these then be able to stand in the battle, and not to be wounded with the
accusation of wantonness? Another suffers and is maimed in his eyes, not looking straight,
but being full of lasciviousness, and assailing women’s chastity, and overthrowing marriages.
How then should this man be able to look in the face of the enemy, and brandish a spear,
and throw his dart, being goaded on all sides with jeers. We may see also many suffering
with the belly not less than the dropsical, when they are held in subjection by gluttony and
drunkenness. How then shall I be able to lead forth these drunken men to war? With others
the mouth is rotten; such are the passionate, and revilers, and blasphemers. How then shall

<pb n="907"/>
this man ever shout in battle, and achieve anything great and noble, he too being drunk
with another drunkenness, and affording much laughter to the enemy?</p>
<p>Therefore each day I go about this camp, dressing your wounds, healing your sores. But
if ye ever rouse yourselves up, and become fit even to wound others, I will both teach you
this art of war, and instruct you how to handle these weapons, or rather your works themselves
will be weapons to you, and all men will immediately submit, if ye would become
merciful, if forbearing, if mild and patient, if ye would show forth all other virtue. But if any
gainsay, then we will also add the proof of what we can show on our part,3141bringing you
forward, since now we rather are hindered (at least as to your part) in this race.</p>
<p>And mark. We say that Christ hath done great things, having made angels of men; then,
when we are called upon to give account, and required to furnish a proof out of this flock,
our mouths are stopped. For I am afraid, lest in the place of angels, I bring forth swine as
from a style, and horses mad with lust.</p>
<p>I know ye are pained, but not against you all are these things spoken, but against the
guilty, or rather not even against them if they awake, but for them. Since now indeed all is
lost and ruined, and the church is become nothing better than a stable of oxen, and a fold
for asses and camels, and I go round seeking for a sheep, and am not able to see it. So much
are all kicking, like horses, and any wild asses, and they fill the place here with much dung,
for like this is their discourse. And if indeed one could see the things spoken at each assemblage,
3142by men, by women, thou wouldest see their words more unclean than that
dung.</p>
<p>Wherefore I entreat you to change this evil custom, that the church may smell of ointment.
But now, while we lay up in it perfumes for the senses, the uncleanness of the mind
we use no great diligence to purge out, and drive away. What then is the advantage? For we
do not so much disgrace the church by bringing dung into it, as we disgrace it by speaking
such things one to another, about gains, about merchandise, about petty tradings, about
things that are nothing to us, when there ought to be choirs of angels here, and we ought
to make the church a heaven, and to know nothing else but earnest prayers, and silence with
listening.</p>
<p>This then let us do at any rate, from the present time, that we may both purify our lives,
and attain unto the promised blessings, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>“Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees
came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was
yet alive,3143After three days I will3144rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre
be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away, and say to
the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error should be3145worse than the first.”</p>
<p>Everywhere deceit recoils upon itself, and against its will supports the truth. And observe.
It was necessary for it to be believed that He died, and that He rose again, and that He was
buried, and all these things are brought to pass by His enemies. See, at any rate, these words
bearing witness to every one of these facts. “We remember,” these are the words, “that that
deceiver said, when He was yet alive,” (He was therefore now dead), “After three days I rise
again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be sealed,” (He was therefore buried), “lest
His disciples come and steal Him away.” So that if the sepulchre be sealed, there will be no
unfair dealing. For there could not be. So then the proof of His resurrection has become
incontrovertible by what ye have put forward. For because it was sealed, there was no unfair
dealing. But if there was no unfair dealing, and the sepulchre was found empty, it is manifest
that He is risen, plainly and incontrovertibly. Seest thou, how even against their will they
contend for the proof of the truth?</p>
<p>But mark thou, I pray thee, the disciples’ love of truth, how they conceal from us none
of the things that are said by His enemies, though they use opprobrious language. Behold,
at any rate, they even call Him a deceiver, and these men are not silent about that.</p>
<p>But these things show also their savageness (that not even at His death did they let go
their anger), and these men’s simple and truthful disposition.</p>
<p>But it were worth while to inquire concerning that point also, where He said, “After
three days I rise again?” For one would not find this thus distinctly stated,3146but rather the
example of Jonah. So that they understood His saying, and of their own will dealt unfairly.</p>

<p>What then saith Pilate? “Ye have a watch; make it as sure as ye can. And they made it
sure, sealing the sepulchre, and setting the watch.”3147 He suffers not the soldiers alone to
seal, for as having learnt the things concerning Christ, he was no longer willing to co-operate
with them. But in order to be rid of them, he endures this also, and saith, “Do ye seal it as
ye will, that ye may not have it in your power to blame others.” For if the soldiers only had
sealed, they might have said (although the saying would have been improbable and false,
yet nevertheless as in the rest they cast aside shame, so in this too they might have been able
to say), that the soldiers, having given up the body to be stolen, gave His disciples opportunity
to feign the history concerning His resurrection, but now having themselves made it sure,
they are not able to say so much as this.</p>
<p>Seest thou how they labor for the truth against their will? For they themselves came to
Pilate, themselves asked, themselves sealed, setting the watch, so as to be accusers, and refuters
one of another. And indeed when should they have stolen Him? on the Sabbath? And how?
for it was not lawful so much as to go out.3148 And even if they transgressed the law, how
should they have dared, who were so timid, to come forth? And how could they also have
been able to persuade the multitude? By saying what? By doing what? And from what sort
of zeal could they have stood in behalf of the dead? expecting what recompense? what requital?
Seeing Him yet alive and merely seized, they had fled; and after His death were they
likely to speak boldly in His behalf, unless He had risen again? And how should these things
be reasonable? For that they were neither willing nor able to feign a resurrection, that did
not take place, is plain from hence. He discoursed to them much of a resurrection, and
continually said, as indeed these very men have stated, “After three days I rise again.” If
therefore He rose not again, it is quite clear that these men (having been deceived and made
enemies to an entire nation for His sake, and come to be without home and without city)
would have abhorred Him, and would not have been willing to invest Him with such glory;
as having been deceived, and having fallen into the utmost dangers on His account. For that
they would not even have been able, unless the resurrection had been true, to feign it, this
does not so much as need reasoning.</p>
<p>For in what were they confident? In the shrewdness of their reasonings? Nay of all men
they were the most unlearned. But in the abundance of their possessions? Nay, they had
neither staff nor shoes. But in the distinction of their race? Nay, they were mean, and of
mean ancestors. But in the greatness of their country? Nay, they were of obscure places. But
in their own numbers? Nay, they were not more than eleven, and they were scattered abroad.
But in their Master’s promises? What kind of promises? For if He were not risen again,
<note type="footnote">3147 Matt. xxvii. 65, 66. [The only peculiarity is indicated in the above rendering; for “made the sepulchre

<pb n="910"/>
neither would those be likely to be trusted by them. And how should they endure a frantic
people. For if the chief of them endured not the speech of a woman, keeping the door, and
if all the rest too, on seeing Him bound, were scattered abroad, how should they have thought
to run to the ends of the earth, and plant a feigned tale of a resurrection? For if he stood not
a woman’s threat, and they not so much as the sight of bonds, how were they able to stand
against kings, and rulers, and nations, where were swords, and gridirons, and furnaces, and
ten thousand deaths day by day, unless they had the benefit of the power and grace3149of
Him who rose again? Such miracles and so many were done, and none of these things did
the Jews regard, but crucified Him, who had done them, and were they likely to believe these
men at their mere word about a resurrection? These things are not, they are not so, but the
might of Him, who rose again, brought them to pass.</p>
<p>2. But mark, I pray thee, their craft, how ridiculous it is. “We remember,” these are their
words, “that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three days I rise again.” Yet if
He were a deceiver, and boastfully uttered falsehood, why are ye afraid and run to and fro,
and use so much diligence? We are afraid, it is replied, lest perchance the disciples steal Him
away, and deceive the multitude. And yet this has been proved to have no probability at all.
Malice, however, is a thing contentious and shameless, and attempts what is unreasonable.</p>
<p>And they command it to be made sure for three days, as contending for doctrines, and
being minded to prove that before that time also He was a deceiver, and they extend their
malice even to His tomb. For this reason then He rose sooner, that they might not say that
He spake falsely, and was stolen. For this, His rising sooner, was open to no charge, but to
be later would have been full of suspicion. For indeed if He had not risen then, when they
were sitting there, and watching, but when they had withdrawn after the three days, they
would have had something to say, and to speak against it, although foolishly. For this reason
then He anticipated the time. For it was meet the resurrection should take place, while they
were sitting by and watching. Therefore also it was fit it should take place within the three
days, since if it had been when they were passed, and the men had withdrawn, the matter
would have been regarded with suspicion. Wherefore also He allowed them to seal it, as
they were minded, and soldiers sat around it.</p>
<p>And they cared not about doing these things, and working on a Sabbath day, but they
looked to one object only, their own wicked purpose, as though by that they were to succeed;
which was a mark of extreme folly, and of fear now greatly dismaying them. For they who
seized Him, when living, are afraid of Him when dead. And yet if He had been a mere man,
they had reason to have taken courage. But that they might learn, that when living also He
endured of His own will, what He did endure; behold, both a seal, a stone, and a watch, and

they were not able to hold Him. But there was one result only, that the burial was published,
and the resurrection thereby proved. For indeed soldiers sat by it, and Jews are on the watch.</p>
<p>“But in the end of the Sabbath,3150as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week,
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a
great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from Heaven, and came and rolled
back the stone from the door of the tomb,3151and sat upon it. His countenance was like
lightning, and his raiment white as snow.”3152</p>
<p>After the resurrection came the angel. Wherefore then came he, and took away the
stone? Because of the women, for they themselves had seen Him then in the sepulchre.3153
Therefore that they might believe that He was risen again, they see the sepulchre void of the
body. For this cause he removed the stone, for this cause also an earthquake took place, that
they might be thoroughly aroused and awakened. For they were come to pour oil on Him,
and these things were done at night, and it is likely that some also had become drowsy. And
for what intent and cause doth he say, “Fear not ye?”3154 First he delivers them from the
dread, and then tells them of the resurrection. And the ye is of one showing them great
honor, and indicating, that extreme punishment awaits them that had dared to do, what
the others had dared, except they repented. For to be afraid is not for you, he means, but
for them that crucified Him.</p>
<p>Having delivered them then from the fear both by his words, and by his appearance
(for his form he showed bright, as bearing such good tidings), he went on to say, “I know
that ye seek Jesus the Crucified.”3155 And he is not ashamed to call Him “crucified;” for this
is the chief of the blessings.</p>
<p>“He is risen.”3156 Whence is it evident? “As He said.” So that if ye refuse to believe me,
he would say, remember His words, and neither will ye disbelieve me. Then also another
proof, “Come and see the place where He lay.”3157 For this he had lifted up the stone, in
order that from this too they might receive the proof. “And tell His disciples, that ye shall
see Him in Galilee.”3158 And he prepares them to bear good tidings to others, which thing

most of all made them believe. And He said well “in Galilee,” freeing them from troubles
and dangers, so that fear should not hinder their faith.</p>
<p>“And they departed from the sepulchre with fear and joy.”3159 Why could this be? They
had seen a thing amazing, and beyond expectation, a tomb empty, where they had before
seen Him laid. Wherefore also He had led them to the sight, that they might become witnesses
of both things, both of His tomb, and of His resurrection. For they considered that no man
could have taken Him, when so many soldiers were sitting by Him, unless He raised up
Himself. For this cause also they rejoice and wonder, and receive the reward of so much
continuance with Him, that they should first see and gladly declare, not what had been said
only, but also what they beheld.</p>
<p>3. Therefore after then they had departed with fear and joy, “Behold, Jesus met them,
saying, All hail.” But “they held Him by the feet,”3160and with exceeding joy and gladness
ran unto Him, and received by the touch also, an infallible proof, and full assurance of the
resurrection. “And they worshipped Him.” What then saith He? “Be not afraid.” Again, He
Himself casts out their fear, making way for faith, “But go, tell my brethren, that they go
into Galilee, and there shall they see me.”3161 Mark how He Himself sends good tidings to
His disciples by these women, bringing to honor, as I have often said, that sex, which was
most dishonored, and to good hopes; and healing that which was diseased.</p>
<p>Perchance some one of you would wish to be like them, to hold the feet of Jesus; ye can
even now, and not His feet and His hands only, but even lay hold on that sacred head, receiving
the awful mysteries with a pure conscience. But not here only, but also in that day
ye shall see Him, coming with that unspeakable glory, and the multitude of the angels, if ye
are disposed to be humane; and ye shall hear not these words only, “All hail!” but also those
others, “Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the
foundation of the world.”3162</p>
<p>Be ye therefore humane, that ye may hear these things; and ye women, that wear gold,
who have looked on the running of these women, at last, though late, lay aside the disease
of the desire for golden ornaments. So that if ye are emulous of these women, change the
ornaments which ye wear, and clothe yourselves instead with almsgiving. What is the use,
I pray you, of these precious stones, and of the garments spangled with gold? “My soul,”
you say, “is glad, and is pleased with these things.” I asked thee the profit, but thou tellest

me the hurt. For nothing is worse than being taken up with these things, and delighting in
them, and being riveted to them. For more bitter is this grievous slavery, when any one finds
delight even in being a slave. For in what spiritual matter will she ever be diligent as she
ought; when will she laugh to scorn, as she should, the things of this world, who thinks it a
worthy matter for joy, that she hath been chained in gold? For he that continues in prison,
and is pleased, will never desire to be set free; as indeed neither will this woman; but as
having become a kind of captive to this wicked desire, she will not endure so much as to
hear spiritual language with becoming desire and diligence, much less to engage in such
work.</p>
<p>What then is the profit of these ornaments and this luxury? I pray thee. “I am pleased
with them,” thou sayest. Again thou hast told of the hurt and the ruin. “But I enjoy also,”
thou sayest, “much honor from the beholders.” And what is this? This is the occasion of
another destruction, when thou art lifted up to haughtiness, to arrogance. Come now, since
thou hast not told me of the profit, bear with me while I tell thee of the mischiefs. What
then are the mischiefs resulting therefrom? Anxiety, which is greater than the pleasure.
Wherefore many of the beholders, these I mean of the grosser sort, derive more pleasure
from it than she who wears the gold. For thou indeed deckest thyself with anxiety, but they,
without this, feast their eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are other things again, the debasing of the soul, the being looked upon
with envy on all sides. For the neighboring women stung by it, arm themselves against their
own husbands, and stir up against thee grievous wars. Together with these things, the fact
that all one’s leisure and anxiety are spent on this object, that one doth not apply one’s self
earnestly to spiritual achievements; that one is filled with haughtiness, arrogance, and
vainglory; that one is riveted to the earth, and loses one’s wings, and instead of an eagle,
becometh a dog or a swine. For having given up looking up into Heaven, and flying thither,
thou bendest down to the earth like the swine, being curious about mines and caverns, and
having an unmanly and base soul. But dost thou, when thou appearest, turn towards thee
the eyes of them at the market-place? Well then; for this very reason, thou shouldest not
wear gold, that thou mayest not become a common gazing stock, and open the mouths of
many accusers. For none of those whose eyes are toward thee admireth thee, but they jeer
at thee, as fond of dress, as boastful, as a carnal woman. And shouldest thou enter into a
church, thou goest forth, without getting anything but countless leers, and revilings, and
curses, not from the beholders only, but also from the prophet. For straightway Isaiah,3163that
hath the fullest voice of all, as soon as he hath seen thee, will cry out, “These things saith the
Lord against the princely daughters of Sion; because they walked with a lofty neck, and with
winkings of the eyes, and in their walking, trailing their garments, and mincing at the same

time with their feet; the Lord shall take off their bravery, and instead of a sweet smell there
shall be dust, and instead of a stomacher, thou shalt gird thyself with a cord.”3164</p>
<p>These things for thy gorgeous array. For not to them only are these words addressed,
but to every woman that doeth like them. And Paul again with him stands as an accuser,
telling Timothy to charge the women, “not to adorn themselves with braided hair, or gold,
or pearls, or costly array.”3165 So that everywhere the wearing of gold is hurtful, but especially
when thou art entering into a church, when thou passest through the poor. For if thou wert
exceedingly anxious to bring an accusation against thyself, thou couldest not put on any
other array than this visage of cruelty and inhumanity.</p>
<p>4. Consider at any rate how many hungry bellies thou passest by with this array, how
many naked bodies with this satanical display. How much better to feed hungry souls, than
to bore through the lobes of thy ears, and to hang from them the food of countless poor for
no purpose or profit. What? is to be rich a commendation? What? is to wear gold a praise?
Though it be from honest earnings that these things are put on you, even so what thou hast
done is a very heavy charge against thee; but when it is moreover from dishonesty, consider
the exceeding greatness of it.</p>
<p>But dost thou love praises and honor? Strip thyself therefore of this ridiculous clothing,
and then all will admire thee; then shalt thou enjoy both honor and pure pleasure; since
now at any rate thou art overwhelmed with jeers, working for thyself many causes of vexation
arising out of these things. For should any of these things be missing, consider how many
are the evils that have their birth therefrom, how many maidservants are beaten, how many
men put to trouble, how many led to execution, how many cast into prison. And trials arise
hence, and actions, and countless curses and accusations against the wife from the husband,
against the hus band from her friends, against the soul from itself. “But it will not be lost.”
In the first place, this is not easy to secure, but even if it be kept safe constantly, yet by being
kept, it occasions much anxiety and care and discomfort, and no advantage.</p>
<p>For what kind of profit arises from hence to the house? What advantage to the woman
herself who wears it? No advantage indeed, but much unseemliness, and accusation from
every quarter? How wilt thou be able to kiss Christ’s feet, and cling to them, when thus
dressed? From this adorning He turneth away. For this cause He vouchsafed to be born in
the house of the carpenter, or rather not even in that house, but in a shed, and a manger.
How then wilt thou be able to behold Him, not having beauty that is desirable in His eyes,
not wearing the array that is lovely before Him, but what is hateful. For he that cometh unto
Him must not deck himself out with such garments, but be clothed with virtue.</p>

<p>Consider what after all these jewels are. Nothing else than earth and ashes. Mix water
with them, and they are clay. Consider and be ashamed to make clay thy master, forsaking
all, and abiding by it, and carrying and bearing it about, even when thou enterest into a
church, when most of all thou oughtest to flee from it. For neither for this cause was the
church built, that thou shouldest display therein these riches, but spiritual riches. But thou,
as though thou wert entering into a pompous procession, thus deckest thyself out on every
side, imitating the women on the stage, even so dost thou carry about in profusion that ridiculous
mass.</p>
<p>Therefore, I tell thee, thou comest for mischief to many, and when the congregation is
dismissed, in their houses, at their tables, one may hear the more part describing these
things. For they have left off saying, thus and thus said the prophet and the apostle, and they
describe the costliness of your garments, the size of your precious stones, and all the other
unseemliness of them that wear these things.</p>
<p>This makes you backward in almsgiving, and your husbands. For one of you would not
readily consent to break up one of these ornaments to feed a poor man. For when thou
wouldest choose even thyself to be in distress rather than to behold these things broken to
pieces, how shouldest thou feed another at the cost of them?</p>
<p>For most women feel towards these things, as to some living beings, and not less than
towards their children. “God forbid,” thou sayest. Prove me this then, prove it by your works,
as now at least I see the contrary. For who ever of those that are completely taken captive,
by melting down these things, would rescue a child’s soul from death? And why do I say a
child’s? Who hath redeemed his own soul thereby, when perishing? Nay, on the contrary,
the more part even set it to sale for these things every day. And should any bodily infirmity
take place, they do everything, but if they see their soul depraved, they take no such pains,
but are careless both about their children’s soul, and their own soul, in order that these
things may remain to rust with time.</p>
<p>And whilst thou art wearing jewels worth ten thousand talents, the member of Christ
hath not the enjoyment so much as of necessary food. And whereas the common Lord of
all hath imparted to all alike of heaven, and of the things in Heaven, and of the spiritual
table, thou dost not impart to Him even of perishing things, on purpose that thou mayest
continue perpetually bound with these grievous chains.</p>
<p>Hence the countless evils,3166hence the fornications of the men, when ye prepare them
to cast off self-restraint, when ye teach them to take delight in these things with which the
harlot women deck themselves. For this cause they are so quickly taken captive. For if thou
hadst instructed him to look down upon these things, and to take delight in chastity, godly

fear and humility, he would not have been so easily taken by the shafts3167of fornication.
For the harlot is able to adorn herself in this way even to a greater degree than this, but with
those other ornaments not so. Accustom him then to take delight in these ornaments, which
he cannot see placed on the harlot. And how wilt thou bring him into this habit? If thou
take off these, and put on those others, so shall both thy husband be in safety, and thou in
honor, and God will be propitious to you, and all men will admire you, and ye will attain
unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Matt. XXVIII. 11-14.</p>
<p>“Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and declared unto
the chief priests all the things that were done.3168And when they had assembled with the
elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye,
His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept. And if this come to the
governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.”3169</p>
<p>For the sake of these soldiers that earthquake took place, in order to dismay them, and
that the testimony might come from them, which accordingly was the result. For the report
was thus free from suspicion, as proceeding from the guards themselves. 
For of the signs
some were displayed publicly to the world, others privately to those present on the spot;
publicly for the world was the darkness, privately the appearance of the angel, the earthquake.
When then they came and showed it (for truth shines forth, being proclaimed by its adversaries),
they again gave money, that they might say, as it is expressed, “that His disciples came
and stole Him.”</p>
<p>How did they steal Him? O most foolish of all men! For because of the clearness and
conspicuousness of the truth, they are not even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed
what they said was highly incredible, and the falsehood had not even speciousness. For how,
I ask, did the disciples steal Him, men poor and unlearned, and not venturing so much as
to show themselves? What? was not a seal put upon it? What? were there not so many
watchmen, and soldiers, and Jews stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect this
very thing, and take thought, and break their rest, and continue anxious about it? And
wherefore moreover did they steal it? That they might feign the doctrine of the resurrection?
And how should it enter their minds to feign such a thing, men who were well content to
be hidden and to live? And how could they remove the stone that was made sure? how could
they have escaped the observation of so many? Nay, though they had despised death, they
would not have attempted without purpose, and fruitlessly to venture in defiance of so many
who were on the watch. And that moreover they were timorous, what they had done before
showed clearly, at least, when they saw Him seized, all rushed away from Him. If then at
that time they did not dare so much as to stand their ground when they saw Him alive, how
when He was dead could they but have feared such a number of soldiers? What? was it to
burst open a door? Was it that one should escape notice? A great stone lay upon it, needing
many hands to move it.</p>

<p>They were right in saying, “So the last error shall be worse than the first,”3170making
this declaration against themselves, for that, when after so much mad conduct they ought
to have repented, they rather strive to outdo their former acts, feigning absurd fictions, and
as, when He was alive, they purchased His blood, so when He was dead and risen again,
they again by money were striving to undermine the evidence of His resurrection. But do
thou mark, I pray thee, how by their own doings they are caught everywhere. For if they
had not come to Pilate, nor asked for the guard, they would have been more able to act thus
impudently, but as it was, not so. For indeed, as though they were laboring to stop their own
mouths, even so did they all things. For if the disciples had not strength to watch with Him,
and that, though upbraided by Him, how could they have ventured upon these things? And
wherefore did they not steal Him before this, but when ye were come? For if they had been
minded to do this, they would have done it, when the tomb was not yet guarded on the first
night, when it was to be done without danger, and in security. For it was on the Sabbath
that they came and begged of Pilate to have the watch, and kept guard, but during the first
night none of these was present by the sepulchre.</p>
<p>2. And what mean also the napkins that were stuck on with the myrrh; for Peter saw
these lying. For if they had been disposed to steal, they would not have stolen the body naked,
not because of dishonoring it only, but in order not to delay and lose time in stripping it,
and not to give them that were so disposed opportunity to awake and seize them. Especially
when it was myrrh, a drug that adheres so to the body, and cleaves to the clothes, whence
it was not easy to take the clothes off the body, but they that did this needed much time, so
that from this again, the tale of the theft is improbable.</p>
<p>What? did they not know the rage of the Jews? and that they would vent their anger on
them? And what profit was it at all to them, if He had not risen again?</p>
<p>So these men, being conscious that they had made up all this tale, gave money, and said,
“Say ye these things, and we will persuade the governor.” For they desire that the report
should be published, fighting in vain against the truth; and by their endeavors to obscure
it, by these even against their will they occasioned it to appear clearly. For indeed even this
establishes the resurrection, the fact I mean of their saying, that the disciples stole Him. For
this is the language of men confessing, that the body was not there. When therefore they
confess the body was not there, but the stealing it is shown to be false and incredible, by
their watching by it, and by the seals, and by the timidity of the disciples, the proof of the
resurrection even hence appears incontrovertible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these shameless and audacious men, although there were so many things
to stop their mouths, “Say ye,” these are their words, “and we will persuade, and will secure
you.” Seest thou all depraved? Pilate, for he was persuaded? the soldiers? the Jewish people?
<note type="footnote">3170 Matt. xxvii. 64.</note>

<pb n="919"/>
But marvel not, if money prevailed over soldiers. For if with His disciple it showed its might
to be so great, much more with these.</p>
<p>“And this saying is commonly reported,” it is said, “until this day.”3171 Seest thou again
the disciples’ love of truth, how they are not ashamed of saying even this, that such a report
prevailed against them.</p>
<p>“Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, and some worshipped, and some
when they saw Him doubted.”3172</p>
<p>This seems to me to be the last appearance in Galilee, when He sent them forth to baptize.
And if “some doubted,” herein again admire their truthfulness, how they conceal not even
their shortcomings up to the last day. Nevertheless, even these are assured by their sight.</p>
<p>What then saith He unto them, when He seeth them? “All power is given unto me in
heaven and on earth.”3173 Again He speaketh to them more after the manner of man, for
they had not yet received the spirit, which was able to raise them on high. “Go ye, make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you;”3174giving the one charge with a view to doctrine, the other concerning commandments.
And of the Jews He makes no mention, neither brings forward what had been done, nor
upbraids Peter with his denial, nor any one of the others with their flight, but having put
into their hands a summary of the doctrine, that expressed by the form of baptism, commands
them to pour forth over the whole world.</p>
<p>After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage, He says,
“Lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”3175 Seest thou His own proper
power again? Seest thou how those other things also were spoken for condescension? And
not with those men only did He promise to be, but also with all that believe after them. For
plainly the apostles were not to remain here unto “the end of the world;” but he speaks to
the believers as to one body. For tell me not, saith He, of the difficulty of the things: for “I
am with you,” who make all things easy. This He said to the prophets also in the Old Testament
continually, as well to Jeremiah objecting his youth,3176as to Moses3177and

Ezekiel3178shrinking from the office, “I am with you,” this here also to these men. And mark,
I pray thee, the excellence of these, for the others, when sent to one nation, often excused
themselves, but these said nothing of the sort, though sent to the world. And He reminds
them also of the consummation, that He may draw them on more, and that they may look
not at the present dangers only, but also at the good things to come that are without end.</p>
<p>“For the irksome things, saith He, that ye will undergo are finished together with the
present life, since at least even this world itself shall come to an end, but the good things
which ye shall enjoy remain immortal, as I have often told you before.” Thus having invigorated
and roused their minds, by the remembrance of that day, He sent them forth. For
that day to them that live in good works is to be desired, even as on the other hand to those
in sin, it is terrible as to the condemned.</p>
<p>But let us not fear only, and shudder, but let us change too, while there is opportunity,
and let us rise out of our wickedness, for we can, if we be willing. For if before grace many
did this, much more after grace.</p>
<p>3. For what grievous things are we enjoined? to cleave mountains asunder? to fly into
the air? or to cross the Tuscan sea? By no means, but a way of life so easy, as not so much
as to want any instruments, but a soul and purpose only. For what instruments had these
apostles, who effected such things? Did they not go about with one vestment and unshod?
and they got the better of all.</p>
<p>For what is difficult of the injunctions? Have no enemy. Hate no man. Speak ill of no
man. Nay, the opposites of these things are the greater hardships. But He said, you reply,
Throw away thy money. Is this then the grievous thing? In the first place, He did not command,
but advised it. Yet even if it were a command, what is it grievous not to carry about
burdens and unseasonable cares?</p>
<p>But oh covetousness! All things are become money; for this cause all things are turned
upside down. If anyone declares another happy, he mentions this; should he pronounce
him wretched, hence is derived the description of wretchedness. And all reckonings are
made on this account, how such an one gets rich, how such an one gets poor. Should it be
military service, should it be marriage, should it be a trade, should it be what you will that
any man takes in hand, he does not apply to what is proposed, until he see these riches are
coming in rapidly upon him. After this shall we not meet together and consult how we shall
drive away this pest? Shall we not regard with shame the good deeds of our fathers? of the
three thousand, of the five thousand, who had all things common?</p>
<p>What is the profit of this present life, when we do not use it for our future gain? How
long do ye not enslave the mammon that hath enslaved you? How long are ye slaves of
money? How long have ye no love for liberty, and do not rend in pieces the bargains of
<note type="footnote">3178 Ezek. ii. and iii.</note>

<pb n="921"/>
covetousness? But while, if ye should have become slaves of men, you do all things, if any
one should promise you liberty; yet being captives of covetousness, ye do not so much as
consider how ye may be delivered from this bitter bondage. And yet the one were nothing
terrible, the other is the most bitter tyranny.</p>
<p>Consider how great a price Christ paid for us. He shed His own blood; He gave up
Himself. But ye, even after all this, are grown supine; and the most grievous thing of all is,
that ye even take delight in the slavery, ye luxuriate in the dishonor, and that, from which
ye ought to flee, is become an object of desire to you.</p>
<p>But since it is right not only to lament and to blame, but also to correct, let us see from
what cause this passion and this evil have become an object of desire to you. Whence then,
whence hath this come to be an object of desire? Because, thou sayest, it makes me to be in
honor and in security. In what kind of security, I pray thee? In the confidence, not to suffer
hunger, nor cold, not to be harmed, not to be despised. Wilt thou then, if we promise thee
this security, refrain from being rich? For if it is for this that riches are an object of desire,
if it be in your power to have security without these, what need hast thou of these any more?
“And how is it possible,” thou sayest, “for one who is not rich to attain to this?” Nay, how
is it possible (for I say the opposite thing) if one is rich? For it is necessary to flatter many,
both rulers and subjects, and to entreat countless numbers, and to be a base slave, and to
be in fear and trembling, and to regard with suspicion the eyes of the envious, and to fear
the tongues of false accusers, and the desires of other covetous men. But poverty is not like
this, but altogether the contrary. It is a place of refuge and security, a calm harbor, a wrestling
ground, and school of exercise to learn self-command, an imitation of the life of angels.</p>
<p>Hear these things, as many as are poor; or rather also, as many as desire to be rich. It is
not poverty that is the thing to be feared, but the not being willing to be poor. Account
poverty to be nothing to fear, and it will not be to thee a matter for fear. For neither is this
fear in the nature of the thing, but in the judgment of feeble-minded men. Or rather, I am
even ashamed that I have occasion to say so much concerning poverty, to show that it is
nothing to be feared. For if thou practise self-command, it is even a fountain to thee of
countless blessings. And if any one were to offer thee sovereignty, and political power, and
wealth, and luxury, and then having set against them poverty, were to give thee thy choice
to take which thou wouldest, thou wouldest straightway seize upon poverty, if indeed thou
knewest the beauty thereof.</p>
<p>4. And I know that many laugh, when these things are said; but we are not troubled but
we require you to stay, and soon ye will give judgment with us. For to me poverty seems
like some comely, fair, and well-favored damsel, but covetousness like some monster shaped
woman, some Scylla or Hydra, or some other like prodigies feigned by fabulous writers.</p>
<p>For bring not forward, I pray thee, them that accuse poverty, but them that have shone
thereby. Nurtured in this, Elias was caught up in that blessed assumption. With this Eliseus

<pb n="922"/>
shone; with this John; with this all the apostles; but with the other, Ahab, Jezebel, Gehazi,
Judas, Nero, Caiaphas, were condemned.</p>
<p>But if it please you, let us not look to those only that have been glorious in poverty, but
let us observe the beauty itself of this damsel. For indeed her eye is clear and piercing, having
nothing turbid in it, like the eye of covetousness, which is at one time full of anger, at another
sated with pleasure, at another troubled by incontinence. But the eye of poverty is not like
this, but mild, calm, looking kindly on all, meek, gentle, hating no man, shunning no man.
For where there are riches, there is matter for enmity, and for countless wars. The mouth
again of the other is full of insults, of a certain haughtiness, of much boasting, cursing, deceit;
but the mouth and the tongue of this are sound, filled with continual thanksgiving, blessing,
words of gentleness, of affection, of courtesy, of praise, of commendation. And if thou
wouldest see also the proportion of her members, she is of a goodly height, and far loftier
than wealth. And if many flee from her, marvel not at it, for indeed so do fools from the rest
of virtue.</p>
<p>But the poor man, thou wilt say, is insulted by him that is rich. Again thou art declaring
to me the praise of poverty. For who, I pray thee, is blessed, the insulter, or the insulted? It
is manifest that it is the insulted person. But then, the one, covetousness, urges to insult the
other; poverty persuades to endure. “But the poor man suffers hunger,” thou wilt say. Paul
also suffered hunger, and was in famine.3179“But he has no rest.” Neither “had the Son of
Man where to lay His head.”3180</p>
<p>Seest thou how far the praises of poverty have proceeded, and where it places thee, to
what men it leads thee on, and how it makes thee a follower of the Lord? If it were good to
have gold, Christ, who have the unutterable blessings, would have given this to His disciples.
But now so far from giving it them, He forbad them to have it. Wherefore Peter also, so far
from being ashamed of poverty, even glories in it, saying, “Silver and gold have I none; but
what I have give I thee.”3181 And who of you would not have desired to utter this saying?
Nay, we all would extremely, perhaps some one may say. Then throw away thy silver, throw
away thy gold. “And if I throw it away, thou wilt say, shall I receive the power of Peter?”
Why, what made Peter blessed, tell me? Was it indeed to have lifted up the lame man? By
no means, but the not having these riches, this procured him Heaven. For of those that
wrought these miracles, many fell into hell, but they, who did those good things, attained a
kingdom. And this you may learn even of Peter himself. For there were two things that he
said, “Silver and gold have I none;” and, “In the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk.”</p>
<note type="footnote">3179 1 Cor. iv. 11; 2 Cor. xi. 27; Phil. iv. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">3180 Matt. viii. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">3181 Acts iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="923"/>
<p>Which sort of thing then made Him glorious and blessed, the raising up the lame man,
or the casting away his money? And this you may learn from the Master of the conflicts
Himself. What then doth He Himself say to the rich man seeking eternal life? He said not,
“raise up the lame,” but, “Sell thy goods, and give to the poor, and come and follow me, and
thou shalt have treasure in Heaven.”3182 And Peter again said not, “Behold, in Thy name
we cast out devils;” although he was casting them out, but, “Behold, we have forsaken all
and followed Thee what shall we have?”3183 And Christ again, in answering this apostle,
said not, “If any man raise up the lame,” but, “Whosoever hath forsaken houses or lands,
shall receive an hundredfold in this world, and shall inherit everlasting life.”3184</p>
<p>Let us also then emulate this man, that we may not be confounded, but may with confidence
stand at the judgment seat of Christ; that we may win Him to be with us, even as
He was with His disciples. For He will be with us, like as He was with them, if we are willing
to follow them, and to be imitators of their life and conversation. For in consequence of
these things God crowns, and commends men, not requiring of thee to raise the dead, or
to cure the lame. For not these things make one to be like Peter, but the casting away one’s
goods, for this was the apostles’ achievement.</p>
<p>But dost thou not find it possible to cast them away? In the first place, I say, it is possible;
but I compel thee not, if thou art not willing, nor constrain thee to it; but this I entreat, to
spend at least a part on the needy, and to seek for thyself nothing more than is necessary.
For thus shall we both live our life here without trouble, and in security, and enjoy eternal
life; unto which God grant we all may attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, together with the Father and the Holy Ghost,
now and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>NPNF1-11. Saint Chrysostom: Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles
and the Epistle to the Romans by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. This volume contains St. John Chrysostom's homilies on the Gospel of
Acts and Romans. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some of the greatest
theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians
for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even today!

<head>Catena Aurea - Gospel of Matthew by St. Thomas Aquinas</head>
<p>Catena Aurea, or "Golden Chain," is a unique style of biblical commentary comprised of
fragments from other existing commentaries. Aquinas' Gospel of Matthew features the
teachings of St. Augustine, St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Ambrose, The Venerable St. Bede,
and other Church Fathers. Chapter by chapter, Aquinas draws together the biblical reflections
of these great historical figures to create a continuous commentary on the Book of Matthew.
This eight volume set was commissioned by Pope Urban IV in hopes that it would bring
the Church a deeper understand of the early Christian faith. Aquinas' commentaries are
excellent resources for biblical study because they contain a wealth of valuable references.
